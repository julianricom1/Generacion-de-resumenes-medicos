"purpose: osteoarthritis of the knee is a common disease, often associated with a baker's cyst. besides osteoarthritis, also other joint pathologies of the knee can be causative for a baker's cyst. radiotherapy is known to be an effective treatment for osteoarthritis, with an anti-inflammatory effect. as the excessive production of synovia usually is associated with intraarticular inflammation, our hypothesis was that radiotherapy might positively influence the synovial production and reduce the volume of a baker's cyst. materials and methods: we performed a prospective trial, including 20 knees receiving radiotherapy for knee arthritis. besides documentation of nrs (numeric rating scale), womac (western ontario and mcmaster universities osteoarthritis index) score and knee society score, the volume of the baker's cyst was calculated for a short- (6 to 12 weeks) and long-term (9 to 12 months) follow-up. ultrasonic volumetry was performed using an ultrasound device with a high-resolution multifrequency linear probe (6-9 mhz). results: low-dose radiotherapy improved nrs, womac score and knee society score significantly. the mean volume of baker's cyst decreased from 22.3 ml to 10.7 respectively 3.1 ml during follow-up. a decrease in volume of more than 25% compared to the baseline could be achieved for 75% of the patients in the short-term and 79% of the patients in the long-term follow up. conclusion: radiotherapy of knee osteoarthritis is an effective treatment that decreases the volume of a baker's cyst. most patients respond to the treatment. whether radiotherapy is an effective treatment for baker's cyst without associated osteoarthritis has to be further examined."
"knee osteoarthritis is a common disease, often occuring with baker's cyst (a fluid-filled pocket behind the knee). besides osteoarthritis, other knee joint diseases can lead to an uncomfortable fuild-filled swelling behind the knee. radiation therapy treats osteoarthritis, with an anti-inflammatory effect. as excess fluid in joints is linked with joint inflammation, radiation therapy may help fluid production in joints and reduce the size of the fluid-filled swelling behind the knee. our trial includes 29 knees receiving radiation therapy for knee arthritis. besides knee pain and function measurements, the size of the cust was measured for a short- (6 to 12 weeks) and long-term (9 to 12 months) follow-up. low-dose radiation therapy improves measurements for knee arthritis. the size of the fluid-filled swelling behind the knees decreased. 75% of patients in the short-term and 79% of patients in the long-term achieved a decrease in size of over 25% relative to baseline scores. radiation therapy of knee osteoarthritis decreases the size of a baker's cyst. most patients respond to the treatment. whether radiation therapy treats baker's cyst without associated osteoarthritis is unknown."
"osteoarthritis of the knee is a common disease, often associated with baker's cyst, which is an abnormal enlargement of the bursa (a protective fluid-filled sac) behind the knee other knee joint injuries or disorders can also cause baker's cyst radiotherapy is an effective treatment for osteoarthritis because it targets inflammation inflammation increases the amount of fluid, or synovia, in the knee. so we asked if radiotherapy may reduce both the production of synovia and volume of baker's cyst. to answer this question, we performed a prospective trial, where we examined 20 knees receiving radiotherapy for knee arthritis. we assigned scores for the degree of osteoarthitis and calculated the cyst volume for a short- (6 to 12 weeks) and long-term (9 to 12 months) follow-up. we measured cyst volume by ultrasound, and found that low-dose radiotherapy improved knee osteoarthritis scores significantly. the average volume of baker's cysts also decreased from 22.3 ml to 10.7 respectively during follow-up. a decrease in cyst volume of more than 25% compared to the starting volume could be achieved for 75% of the patients in the short-term, and 79% of the patients in the long-term follow up. we conclude that radiotherapy of knee osteoarthritis is an effective treatment that decreases the volume of a baker's cyst. most patients respond to this treatment."
"background: this study aimed to compare the arthroscopic internal drainage of popliteal cysts alone or in combination with cyst wall resection in terms of clinical outcomes. methods: forty-two consecutive patients with symptomatic popliteal cysts received arthroscopic treatment. specifically, 20 of them received arthroscopic internal drainage (ai group) alone and 22 received arthroscopic internal drainage combined with cyst wall resection (aicr group) through double posteromedial portals. magnetic resonance imaging (mri) was performed to identify recurrence of popliteal cysts. the lysholm score and rauschning-lindgren grade were used to assess the clinical outcomes. the median of the follow-up period was 24 months (12-48 months). results: the two groups (ai group and aicr group) were similar in age, gender, cyst diameter, associated joint disorder, preoperative lysholm score, preoperative rauschning-lindgren grade and follow-up period (p > 0.05). relative to the ai group, the aicr group had a significantly prolonged operation time (p < 0.05) and a higher incidence of complications (p < 0.05). in both groups, the rauschning-lindgren grade at the last follow-up significantly differed from the preoperative grade (p < 0.05) and the lysholm knee score remarkably increased compared to the preoperative score (p < 0.05); however, there were no differences between the two groups at the last follow-up (p > 0.05). according to the mri results, the cyst disappeared in 11 (55%), shrank in size in 6 (30%) and existed in 3 (15%) patients in the ai group, and was absent in 18 (81.8%) and shrank in size in 4 (18.2%) patients in the aicr group, suggesting a significant difference between the two (p < 0.05). conclusion: additional resection of cyst wall can result in a lower recurrence rate of cysts but extend the operation time and increase the incidence of perioperative complications compared with arthroscopic internal drainage of popliteal cysts alone."
"this work compared internal joint drainage of fluid-filled swellings or cysts alone or with cyst wall removal surgery. forty-two patients with typical fluid-filled cysts or pockets received joint treatment. specifically, 20 received joint or arthroscopic internal drainage (ai group alone) and 22 received internal joint drainage with cyst wall removal surgery or resection (aicr group) in two locations. we identified reappearance of fluid-filled cysts with medical imaging. we also took knee-specific clinical measurements. the average follow-up period was 24 months. the two treatment groups were similar in age, gender, cyst diameter, associated joint disorder, initial clinical scores, and follow-up period. relative to the internal joint drainage alone group, the internal joint drainage with cyst wall removal surgery group had increased operation time and more difficulties. in both groups, cyst scores at the last follow-up differed from the starting score. the knee scores improved compared to starting scores; however, the two groups did not differ at the last follow-up. according to imaging results, the fluid-filled swelling disappeared in 11 (55%), shrank in 6 (30%), and existed in 3 (15%) patients of the internal joint drainage alone group. the cyst was absent in 18 (81.8%) and shrank in 4 (18.2%) patients of the internal joint dranage with cyst wall removal surgery group, implying a difference between the two groups. additional cyst wall removal surgery can lower reappearance rate of cysts (fluid-filled pockets) but increase operation time and surgery complications compared with internal joint drainage of cysts alone."
"popliteal cysts, or baker's cysts, are abnormal enlargements of the bursa (a protective fluid-filled sac) behind the knee. this study aimed to compare drainage of popliteal cysts by arthroscopy (minimally-invasive surgery using fine instruments) alone or in combination with cyst wall removal (resection) in terms of clinical outcomes. forty-two consecutive patients with symptomatic popliteal cysts received arthroscopic treatment. specifically, 20 of these patients received arthroscopic internal drainage (ai group) alone and 22 received arthroscopic internal drainage combined with cyst wall resection (aicr group) through two small holes, or portals, made in the middle side of their knees (double posteromedial portals). the patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (mri) to observe if these cysts re-appeared or recurred. we assigned scores to patients to quantitatively asses their clinical outcomes. patients were re-examined during a follow-up period of 12-48 months. the median follow-up exam time was 24 months after the surgery. results: the two groups (ai group and aicr group) were similar in age, gender, cyst diameter, associated joint disorder, preoperative scores, and follow-up period. relative to the ai group, the aicr group had a significantly prolonged operation time and a higher incidence of complications. pre-operative and post-operative knee assessment scores differed signficantly in both groups, but there were no differences between the two groups at the last follow-up. according to the mri results, the cyst disappeared in 11 (55%), shrank in size in 6 (30%) and existed in 3 (15%) patients in the ai group. in the aicr group, the cyst was absent in 18 (81.8%) and shrank in size in 4 (18.2%) patients in, suggesting a significant difference between these two treatment groups. conclusion: additional resection of cyst wall (aicr) can result in a lower recurrence rate of cysts but extend the operation time and increase the incidence of perioperative complications compared with arthroscopic internal drainage (ai) of popliteal cysts alone."
"objective: to review the results of arthroscopic treatment of popliteal cysts in our centre and analyse outcomes including complications. patients: from july 2007 to july 2009, 11 patients with symptomatic popliteal cysts were treated arthroscopically. all of them had preoperative magnetic resonance imaging to confirm the diagnosis, identify the valvular opening, and the associated intra-articular pathology. we used the rauschning and lindgren criteria for evaluation. results: intra-articular pathology like cartilage degeneration and meniscus tear were commonly associated with popliteal cysts. all patients achieved symptomatic improvement after treatment and the recurrence rate was low. no major complications were encountered. we failed to identify (and correct) any valvular opening in one patient. conclusion: from our experience, we conclude that arthroscopic treatment of popliteal cyst with correction of the valvular opening and treatment of associated intra-articular pathology is effective and safe."
"the objective is to review the results and issues of joint treatment of fluid-filled swellings or cysts in our treatment center. from july 2007 to july 2009, 11 patients with typical fluid-filled swellings behind the knee were treated with minor joint surgery. all patients had pre-operation imaging to confirm the problem, identify the source, and the associated joint symptoms. intra-joint symptoms like cartilage deterioration and tears were associated with fluid-filled swellings behind the knee. all patients improved after treatment. reappearance rate was low. no major issues were encountered. we failed to correct any swelling sources in one patient. minor joint surgery of fluid-filled pockets or cysts behind the knee with correction of the source and symptom treatment is effective and safe."
"popliteal cysts, or baker's cysts, are abnormal enlargements of the bursa (a protective fluid-filled sac) behind the knee. in this study we evaluated the results for patients who underwent arthroscopic treatment (minimally-invasive surgery using fine instruments) treatment of popliteal cysts in our centre and analysed their outcomes, including complications. patients: from july 2007 to july 2009, we treated 11 patients with symptomatic popliteal cysts by arthtroscopy. all of these patients had preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (mri) to confirm the diagnosis, identify the valve opening of the cysts, and the associated tissue damage within the knee joint (intra-articular pathology). we used the rauschning and lindgren criteria tp evaluate knee joint symptoms. we found that intra-articular pathology like cartilage degeneration and meniscus tear commonly occurred with popliteal cysts. all patients' symptoms improved after treatment and the cyst recurrence rate was low. the patients did not experience any major complications. however, we failed to identify (and correct) any valve opening in one patient's cyst. we conclude that arthroscopic treatment of popliteal cyst with correction of the valve opening, and treatment of associated intra-articular pathology is effective and safe."
"popliteal cyst is a common peri-knee cyst, also known as a baker's cyst. with the current development of popliteal cysts, the pathogenesis is mainly due to increased pressure in the knee joint caused by various reasons, leading to a fluid-filled sac that can form behind the knee as a result of enlargement of the gastrocnemius-semimembranosus bursa. the current diagnostic methods include x-ray computed, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance. among them, magnetic resonance imaging is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of popliteal cysts. there are various treatments, including conservative treatment, traditional surgical resection and arthroscopic surgery. in recent years, the focus of the treatment of popliteal cysts has gradually shifted from the simple removal of cysts to arthroscopic treatment of intra-articular lesions and the treatment of joint-cyst communication, and achieved a good effect. however, there are still controversies about the most effective treatment, and the best surgery method is still uncertained. it is hoped that high quality prospective studies will be able to directly compare different surgery methods, so as to select the best treatment for popliteal cyst. this article reviews past literature research and describes in detail the epidemiology, pathological mechanism, clinical manifestations and signs, auxiliary examination, diagnosis and differential diagnosis and clinical treatment of popliteal cysts. different diagnosis methods and treatment methods are compared and summarized to provide basis for clinical diagnosis and treatment."
"popliteal cyst, also known as baker's cyst, occurs in the knee region. popliteal cysts are caused by increased pressure on the knee joint which results in the abnormal enlargement of a bursa (protective fluid-filled sac) behind the knee to form a cyst. orthopedic specialists can diagnose popliteal cysts using x-ray computed tomography (ct scan), ultrasound, or magnetic resonance imaging (mri). mri is the gold standard for diagnosis of popliteal cysts treatment options for popliteal cysts include conservative treatment, traditional surgery, and arthroscopic surgery. in recent years, treatment of popliteal cysts has shifted from traditional surgical removal of the cysts to arthroscopic treatment of intra-articular lesions and the treatment of joint-cyst communication, with good results. however, controversy remains over which treatment method is best. high quality studies that directly compare different surgical methods should help select the best treatment for popliteal cyst. this article reviews previous studies and literature, and describes in detail the epidemiology, pathological mechanism, signs and symptoms, lab and imaging results, diagnosis and clinical treatment of popliteal cysts we compare and summarize different methods to provide basis for clinical diagnosis and treatment of popliteal cyst."
"context: popliteal synovial cysts, also known as baker's cysts, are commonly found in association with intra-articular knee disorders, such as osteoarthritis and meniscus tears. histologically, the cyst walls resemble synovial tissue with fibrosis evident, and there may be chronic nonspecific inflammation present. osteocartilaginous loose bodies may also be found within the cyst, even if they are not seen in the knee joint. baker's cysts can be a source of posterior knee pain that persists despite surgical treatment of the intra-articular lesion, and they are routinely discovered on magnetic resonance imaging scans of the symptomatic knee. symptoms related to a popliteal cyst origin are infrequent and may be related to size. conclusion: a capsular opening to the semimembranosus-medial head gastrocnemius bursa is a commonly found normal anatomic variant. it is thought that this can lead to the formation of a popliteal cyst in the presence of chronic knee effusions as a result of intra-articular pathology. management of symptomatic popliteal cysts is conservative. the intra-articular pathology should be first addressed by arthroscopy. if surgical excision later becomes necessary, a limited posteromedial approach is often employed. other treatments, such as arthroscopic debridement and closure of the valvular mechanism, are not well studied and cannot yet be recommended."
"popliteal synovial cysts, also known as baker's cysts, commonly occur in association with intra-articular knee disorders, such as osteoarthritis and meniscus tears. at the tissue level, the cyst walls resemble synovial tissue (tissue that contains a protective fluid surrounding the knee joint), but with evident scarring (fibrosis), and there may also be chronic nonspecific inflammation present. osteocartilaginous loose bodies may occur within the cyst, even if they are not seen in the knee joint. baker's cysts can cause posterior knee pain that persists despite surgical treatment of the intra-articular lesion, and they routinely appear on magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scans of the symptomatic knee. symptoms related to a popliteal cyst origin occur infrequently and may depend on the size of the cyst a common normal variant of knee synovial tissue shows a capsule-shaped opening to the semimembranosus-medial head gastrocnemius bursa ( a fluid-filled sac that lies between semimembranosus muscle and superficial muscle in the back part of the lower leg .) this variant may lead to the formation of a popliteal cyst due to chronic leakage of synovial fluid caused by intra-articular tissue damage . management of symptomatic popliteal cysts is conservative. an orthopedic specialist should first use arthroscopy to examine the intra-articular tissue damage . if surgical removal of the cyst later becomes necessary, the surgeon may use a limited posteromedial approach , where an incision is made in the middle inner side of the knee. other treatments, such as arthroscopic removal of damaged tissue (debridement) and closure of the cyst valve , are not well studied and cannot yet be recommended."
"purpose: the purpose of this study was to introduce a modified arthroscopic treatment technique for popliteal cyst and hypothesize that this modified technique would provide good clinical efficacy and low recurrence rate. methods: from january 2013 to january 2017, 34 patients with symptomatic popliteal cysts were treated with our technique. a figure-of-four position and double posteromedial portals were used to achieve adequate enlargement of the posteromedial valvular opening between the cyst and the joint cavity and complete excision of the cyst wall. mri was used to detect the recurrence of the popliteal cyst, and the rauschning and lindgren score was recorded to evaluate the clinical outcome. results: all patients were followed up with a mean period of 14.8 months (range, 12 to 36 months). associated intra-articular lesions were found and treated in all cases. degenerative cartilage damage was the most common pathology, which affected 23 (67.6%) of the cases. the rauschning and lindgren score improved significantly after surgery, and no evidence of recurrence was found from mri in any case. conclusions: our modified arthroscopic treatment technique, using a figure-of-four position and double posteromedial portals, is effective and safe for treating popliteal cyst."

"asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood and, in the latter part of the 20th century, reached epidemic proportions. asthma is generally believed to result from gene-environment interactions. there is consensus that a 'window of opportunity' exists during pregnancy and early in life when environmental factors may influence its development. we review multiple environmental, biologic and sociologic factors that may be important in the development of asthma. meta-analyses of studies have demonstrated that multifaceted interventions are required in order to develop asthma prevention. multifaceted allergen reduction studies have shown clinical benefits. asthma represents a dysfunctional interaction with our genes and the environment to which they are exposed, especially in fetal and early infant life. the increasing prevalence of asthma also may be an indication of increased population risk for the development of other chronic non-communicable autoimmune diseases. this review will focus on the factors which may be important in the primary prevention of asthma. better understanding of the complex gene-environment interactions involved in the development of asthma will provide insight into personalized interventions for asthma prevention."
"asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood and, in the latter part of the 20th century, asthma became very widespread. asthma is generally believed to result from gene-environment interactions, which is when two different genes respond to something in the environment in different ways. there is agreement that there are certain times during pregnancy and early in a child's life when environmental factors (such as food, pollutants, temperature) may shape asthma's development. researchers reviewed multiple environmental, biologic (such as brain chemistry, genes, nutrition, gender, and hormone levels) and sociologic (such as education and socioeconomic) factors that may be important in the development of asthma. other studies show that multiple steps and actions are required to prevent asthma. studies that focus on reducing or avoiding allergens (any substance that causes an allergic reaction) are beneficial. asthma represents an error in how our genes and the environment interact, especially during pregnancy and early infant life. the increase in the number of asthma cases may also signal an increased risk in the general population for the development of other chronic autoimmune diseases, where the body attacks healthy cells. this review of studies focuses on the factors that may be important in the early prevention of asthma before it starts to develop. a better understanding of gene-environment interactions and how they are involved in the development of asthma will help create interventions and treatment programs for individuals in order to prevent asthma."
"purpose of review: the prevalence of asthma is increasing in many parts of the world, particularly in developed countries. the present review focuses on recent literature regarding asthma prevention in childhood. recent findings: several environmental exposures in infancy or early childhood are associated with reduced prevalence of asthma, but the mechanisms leading to these associations remain unknown. recent studies have demonstrated limited success in the prevention of asthma or asthma symptoms with the use of asthma medications, once the therapy is discontinued. immunotherapy offers another strategy for asthma prevention, and groups treated with this intervention have demonstrated reduced atopy and asthma. several multi-interventional trials have demonstrated a reduced asthma symptom burden but have not demonstrated significant differences in objective measures such as lung function or bronchial hyper-responsiveness between intervention groups. summary: the most promising asthma prevention strategies to date have been those that use a multi-interventional approach employing both dietary and environmental manipulations. more research is needed to assess the long-term follow-up of multi-interventional trials and to evaluate novel intervention strategies in the primary or secondary prevention of asthma in childhood."
"asthma is a long-term condition that affects the tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs and makes it hard to breathe. the number of asthma cases is increasing in many parts of the world, particularly in developed countries (countries with a high quality of life, developed economies, and advanced technologies). the present review focuses on recent literature on asthma prevention in childhood. recent findings show that exposure to some things in the environment as an infant or in early childhood is associated with reduced number of asthma cases, but how these associations are connected is unknown. recent studies also show limited success in preventing asthma or asthma symptoms when asthma medications are used and then those medicines are stopped. immunotherapy (treatment that activates or alters the immune system to treat a disease) is another way to prevent asthma. several studies that use multiple treatment (drugs, therapy, or other steps to improve health) methods showed reduced symptoms of asthma, but these studies did not see any major differences in other measures, such as how well the lungs carried air. in summary, the most promising way to prevent asthma is to use more than one treatment that include changing environmental exposures and diet. more research is needed to understand how the effect of multiple treatments last and to evaluate new treatments to prevent asthma in childhood."
"the prevalence of asthma (a disease that restricts breathing) is increasing globally, especially in developed countries. this article focuses on the literature of asthma prevention in childhood. many early experiences with the environment are linked with reduced widespreadness of asthma, but the reasons are unknown. recent studies show little success in preventing asthma or its effects with asthma medications, once therapy ends. immunotherapy, treatment of disease by altering immune system activity, is another treatment for preventing asthma. groups treated with immunotherapy show fewer allergy developments and asthma. many multi-treatment trials show reduced intensity of the effects of asthma but not changes in measures like lung function or sensitivity between treatment groups. the most promising prevention treatments of asthma have used multi-treatment strategies with both diet and environmental changes. we need more evidence to measure the effects of multi-treatment trials and new strategies for asthma prevention in childhood."
"asthma, which typically begins in childhood and is the most common chronic disease of childhood, has reached epidemic proportions. asthma is associated with gene-environment interactions, and there is consensus that a ""window of opportunity"" exists early in life when environmental factors may influence its development. this review considers biologic and sociologic factors in the development of allergy and asthma. meta-analysis of studies demonstrates that monoallergen reduction does not impact asthma prevention. however, multifaceted allergen reduction studies have shown clinical benefit. we propose that allergic diseases, including asthma, represent a dysfunctional interaction with our environment and that the increasing prevalence of asthma and allergy herald increased population risk for the development of other inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. better understanding of the complex factors for asthma and allergies may provide insight into many other chronic complex diseases."
"asthma, which usually begins in childhood and is the most common chronic disease of childhood, has become very widespread. asthma is connected with gene-environment interactions, which is when two different genes respond to something in the environment in different ways. there is agreement that there are certain times during pregnancy and early in a child's life when environmental factors (such as food, pollutants, and temperature) may shape asthma's development. this review considers biologic factors, such as brain chemistry, genes, nutrition, gender, and hormone levels, as well as sociologic factors, such as education and economic activity, in the development of allergies and asthma. studies show that the strategy of decreasing exposure to one allergen (any substance that causes an allergic reaction) does not impact asthma prevention. however, decreasing exposure to more than one allergen has shown a positive effect, such as improved health or symptoms. it is suggested that asthma and other allergic diseases represent an error in how our genes and the environment interact. the increasing number of cases may be a sign that the general population is at risk for developing other inflammatory (when the body reacts to an injury or infection) and autoimmune diseases (where the body attacks healthy cells). a better understanding of the multiple factors that impact asthma and allergies may help researchers understand other chronic diseases."
"purpose of review: this article presents recent findings and perspectives on the relationship between early-life respiratory infections and asthma inception, and discusses emerging concepts on strategies that target these infectious agents for asthma prevention. recent findings: cumulative evidence supports the role of early-life viral infections, especially respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinovirus, as major antecedents of childhood asthma. these viruses may have different mechanistic roles in the pathogenesis of asthma. the airway microbiome and virus-bacteria interactions in early life have emerged as additional determinants of childhood asthma. innovative strategies for the prevention of these early-life infections, or for attenuation of acute infection severity, are being investigated and may identify effective strategies for the primary and secondary prevention of childhood asthma. summary: early-life infections are major determinants of asthma development. the pathway from early-life infections to asthma is the result of complex interactions between the specific type of the virus, genetic, and environmental factors. novel intervention strategies that target these infectious agents have been investigated in proof-of-concepts trials, and further study is necessary to determine their capacity for asthma prevention."
"this article describes the relationship between early-life respiratory infections (infections in the lungs that impact breathing and occur in the first few years of life) and how asthma begins. the article also discusses new strategies to prevent asthma by stopping these infections. viruses that occur in early life, especially respiratory syncytial virus (a contagious virus that infects the lungs and airway tubes) and human rhinovirus (the common cold), usually occur before asthma starts. these viruses may have different roles in how asthma develops. how airway microbiome (micro-organisms such as bacteria in the lungs) interact with bacteria from viruses may determine that a child will develop asthma. new strategies for preventing these infections that occur early in life, or for weakening the symptoms of infections, are being investigated and may help prevent childhood asthma. in summary, early-life infections are major factors of asthma development. how these early-life infections lead to asthma is from the reactions between the virus, genes, and the environment. new treatment and therapy strategies that target these infections have been researched, and more studies are needed to see if they will help prevent asthma."
"it has been 15 years since the first prevention of allergy (pat) study was published, exploring the dream of the allergist: determining whether allergen-specific immunotherapy (ait) can alter the natural course of disease and prevent the development of asthma in children with seasonal allergic rhino-conjunctivitis. two hundred five children aged 6 to 14 years with grass and/or birch pollen allergy were randomized to receive either allergen-specific injection immunotherapy with aluminum-adsorbed native allergen extract subcutaneous immunotherapy for 3 years or to an open control group. subjects had moderate-to-severe hay fever symptoms, but none of them reported asthma at the time of inclusion. actively treated children had significantly fewer asthma symptoms after 3 years, as evaluated by clinical diagnosis (odds ratio, 2.52; p < .05). methacholine bronchial provocation test results were significantly better in the active group. thus a 3-year course of injection ait in children with hay fever to grass, birch pollen, or both significantly reduced the risk of asthma."
"an early study on prevention of allergies aimed to determine if allergen-specific immunotherapy (allergy shots) can improve or prevent the development of asthma in children. in this study, 205 children aged 6 to 14 years with allergies to grass and/or birch pollen were randomly put in either the group that received an allergy shot of immunotherapy for 3 years or in a no-treatment group. none of the study participants reported having asthma at the time of the start of the study. children treated with the allergy shot had much fewer asthma symptoms after 3 years. a test that measures how well the lungs are working were better in the group that received the allergy shot. receiving an allergy shot over the course of 3 years in children with allergies to grass, birch pollen, or both greatly reduced the risk of asthma."
"it has been 15 years since the first prevention of allergy study was published. the study explores the allergist's dream: determining whether allergen-specifc immunotherapy, treatment of disease by modifying immune system activity, can alter the disease and prevent asthma (a disease that restricts breathing) in children with seasonal allergic rhino-conjunctivitis (long-lasting nose and eye problems). two hundred and five children aged 6 to 14 with grass and/or birch pollen allergy were randomly selected either to receive 3 years of allergen-specific, below-skin injection immunotherapy (treatment of disease by modifying immune system activity) or to join a control group. some had moderate-to-severe hay fever symptoms, but none mentioned asthma at the start. treated children had fewer symptoms of asthma after 3 years. lung sensitivity tests were better in the treatment group. therefore, a 3-year course of injection of allergen-specifc immunotherapy in children with seasonal allergies to grass, birch pollen, or both reduces the risk of asthma."
"lower respiratory tract infections by respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) are the foremost cause of infant hospitalization and are implicated in lasting pulmonary impairment and the development of asthma. neutrophils infiltrate the airways of pediatric patients with rsv-induced bronchiolitis in vast numbers: approximately 80% of infiltrated cells are neutrophils. however, why neutrophils are recruited to the site of viral respiratory tract infection is not clear. in this review we discuss the beneficial and pathologic contributions of neutrophils to the immune response against rsv infection. neutrophils can limit viral replication and spread, as well as stimulate an effective antiviral adaptive immune response. however, low specificity of neutrophil antimicrobial armaments allows for collateral tissue damage. neutrophil-induced injury to the airways during the delicate period of infant lung development has lasting adverse consequences for pulmonary architecture and might promote the onset of asthma in susceptible subjects. we suggest that pharmacologic modulation of neutrophils should be explored as a viable future therapy for severe rsv-induced bronchiolitis and thereby prevent the inception of subsequent asthma. the antiviral functions of neutrophils suggest that targeting of neutrophils in patients with rsv-induced bronchiolitis is best performed under the umbrella of antiviral treatment."
"respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) is a contagious virus that infects the lungs and airway tubes and can lead to lower respiratory tract infections (infection in the airways). these infections are a common reason for infant hospital stays, long-term lung problems, and the development of asthma, a long-term condition that affects the tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs and makes it hard to breathe. many neutrophils (white blood cells that fight infection) enter the airways of children with bronchiolitis (a common lung infection in children and infants) caused by rsv. however, why neutrophils are sent to the site of lung infection is not clear. this review discusses how neutrophils help the immune system respond to respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) infections. neutrophils can limit how the virus spreads and can activate the immune system to fight the virus. sometimes neutrophils that are fighting infection can lead to tissue damage. neutrophils that cause injury to airways when an infant's lungs are being developed have a long-term impact on lung function and may lead to asthma. medications that can change neutrophils may be explored as a possible therapy for bronchiolitis caused by rsv and prevent the development of asthma. for patients with bronchiolitis caused by rsv, it is best to use a general antiviral medication when also using neutrophils to help fight infection."
"several risk factors for asthma have been linked with exposures during pregnancy, making their true effects similarly hard to elucidate given the constraints of conducting research in this particular group, and the difficulty of interpreting any findings. a report published in pediatrics outlined the effects of maternal and infant nutrition on the development of atopic disease (including asthma) in children, reflecting that multiple factors could act in concert to influence disease development. maternal exposure to vitamin d has been investigated as a risk factor for childhood asthma and wheeze, with conflicting findings; several studies have reported that vitamin d could protect against asthma attacks or prevent worsening asthma symptoms. many studies have investigated such associations with risk of disease, but the reporting in the media of the study findings often leaves much to be desired in terms of nuance and balance."
"several risk factors for developing asthma are linked with being exposed to certain things during pregnancy. because conducting research on pregnant women is limited and findings are difficult to interpret, understanding these exposures is challenging. a report published in a scientific journal called pediatrics outlined the effects of the mother's and infant's nutrition on developing atopic diseases (a genetic tendency to develop an allergy), including asthma in children. exposure by the mother to vitamin d as a risk for childhood asthma has been investigated, but the results clash. some studies report that vitamin d may protect against asthma attacks or prevent asthma symptoms from getting worse. while many studies have investigated such links with the risk of developing a disease, the media often reports these findings without including details or other considerations."
"bronchial hyperresponsiveness (bhr) as the main condition for the development of asthma may be modulated either by intrinsic or by extrinsic stimuli as well as by climatic and meteorologic factors. proinflammatory mediators in combination with alterations of airway mucosa induce or amplify bhr. upper airway viral infections, exposure to allergens in atopic subjects, chronic hyperplastic changes of the upper airways, airway irritants and analgesics are supposed to be the most likely asthma triggers in predisposed children and adults. there is the suggestion that bhr can be improved not only by treatment with steroidal and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs but also by maritime climatotherapy. the latter could be the result not only of the reduction of inhalative irritants, e.g. of allergen concentration, but also by the involvement or more complex mechanisms. possible theoretic approaches and hypotheses regarding the mode of action of maritime climatic cures are discussed. first preliminary results obtained in a mediterranean region have demonstrated a negative impact of metereologic events like passages of cold weather fronts or increase of wind velocity on the course of asthma disease. an improvement of bhr assessed by histamine challenge test has been observed at the end of climatotherapy in the baltic sea area. prospective studies about asthma prevention in subjects at risk with bhr and atopy that have been starting should contribute to the evaluation of the therapeutic effects and the prognostic importance of maritime climatotherapy for getting exact scientific indications for climatotherapy in patients with bronchial asthma."
"bronchial hyperresponsiveness (bhr) is an increase in sensitivity to different things that cause the airway to narrow. when bhr is the main cause of developing asthma, bhr may be adjusted by internal and external factors as well as by climate and meterologic (atmosphere, humidity, wind, temperature) factors. inflammation that can make the disease worse, combined with changes in the mucus of airways, brings on or increases bronchial hyperresponsiveness. viral infections in the upper airway (the nose, nasal cavity, and pharynx or throat area), exposure to allergens in people with tendencies to have an allergy, long-lasting hyperplastic changes (extra cell growth) of the upper airways, irritants (substances that cause discomfort) and pain drugs in the airways are seen as the most likely asthma triggers in vulnerable children and adults. bronchial hyperresponsiveness (bhr) may be improved with steroid (man-made drugs with a synthetic hormone) and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (drugs that relieve pain) and with maritime climatotherapy, where a patient is relocated to a different location close to the sea for health reasons. maritime climatotherapy may improve bhr by reducing the level of irritants inhaled from the air. how maritime climatic cures work are discussed. metereological (weather) events such as cold weather fronts have shown a negative impact on how asthma disease progresses. an improvement of bhr is observed at the end of climatotherapy using the histamine challenge test, which tests how sensitive airways are to irritants. future studies on asthma prevention in patients at risk with bronchial hyperresponsiveness and atopy (allergies) should evaluate the effects and importance of maritime climatotherapy."
"bronchial hypperresponsiveness (increased lung sensitivity to airway-narrowing particles) or bhr as the main reason for developing asthma (a disease restricting breathing) may be modified by internal or external causes and environmental factors. proinflammatory particles with changes to throat mucus promote bhr. upper airway viral infections, allergen exposure, lasting enlargement of upper airways, airway irritants and pain-relievers may be the most common triggers of asthma in susceptible people. bhr may be improved by treatment with antiinflammatory drugs and coastal weather. improvement with coastal weather may be because of reduced inhalative irritants and more complex reasons. possible ideas regarding the means of coastal weather cures are explored. first, initial results from a mediterranean region show a negative effect of weather events like cold weather or faster wind speeds on the progression of asthma. bhr improvement measured by lung response tests has been observed after weather therapy in the baltic sea area. future studies about preventing asthma in people prone to bhr and allergy development should help with evaluating treatment effects and the importance of coastal weather therapy for those with bronchial asthma."
"with the exception, perhaps, of measures for the avoidance of infrequent forms of asthma caused by very specific types of exposure (e.g., occupational or aspirin-induced asthma), no single action has been irrefutably demonstrated to decrease the risk of the development of persistent asthma in persons who do not already have the disease."
"except for avoiding certain factors that cause infrequent types of asthma (e.g. job or asprin-activated asthma), no single action is definitely proven to decrease the risk of developing long-term asthma in people who do not already have the disease."
"the national disease management program (ndm program) represents the basic content of structured, cross-sectoral healthcare. in particular, the ndm program is directed towards coordinating different disciplines and areas of healthcare. the recommendations are developed through interdisciplinary consensus of the scientific medical societies on the basis of the best available evidence. within this scope the scientific medical societies concerned with the prevention, diagnosis, therapy and rehabilitation of asthma consented upon a national disease management guideline for asthma in 2005. among other things, the following cornerstones of asthma prevention were agreed upon: breastfeeding and non-smoking were suggested as primary prevention measures for (expectant) parents. with respect to secondary prevention, recommendations have been made for allergen avoidance, active/passive smoking and immunotherapy. regarding tertiary prevention, position statements on vaccination and specific immunotherapy are developed. the present paper presents both the original texts of the recommendations and the evidence underlying them."
"the national disease management program (ndm program) represents the basic content of healthcare involving different types of care. the ndm program coordinates different fields and areas of healthcare. recommendations are developed through agreement from scientific medical organizations using the best available evidence. the scientific medical organizations that focus on the prevention, diagnosis, therapy, and rehabilitation of asthma agreed on a national disease management guideline for asthma in 2005. the group agrees that breastfeeding and non-smoking are suggested as a primary prevention measure (preventing disease before it occurs) for expecting parents. recommendations are made for secondary prevention (identifying disease at an early stage before symptoms start) to avoid allergens (any substance that causes an allergic reaction), smoking or secondhand smoke, and immunotherapy (the treatment of disease by activating or suppressing the immune system). statements on vaccination and specific immunotherapy are developed for tertiary prevention (slowing or stopping disease that is affecting a patient). this paper presents both the original texts of the recommendations and the evidence supporting the recommendations."
"corticosteroids have been used for decades to modulate inflammation therapeutically, yet there is a paucity of data on their effects in humans. we examined the changes in cellular and molecular immune system parameters, or ""immunome""in healthy humans after systemic corticosteroid administration. we used multiplexed techniques to query the immunome in 20 volunteers at baseline, and after intravenous hydrocortisone (hc) administered at moderate (250 mg) and low (50 mg) doses, to provide insight into how corticosteroids exert their effects. we performed comprehensive phenotyping of 120 lymphocyte subsets by high dimensional flow cytometry, and observed a decline in circulating specific b and t cell subsets, which reached their nadir 4-8 hours after administration of hc. however, b and t cells rebounded above baseline 24 hours after hc infusion, while nk cell numbers remained stable. whole transcriptome profiling revealed down regulation of nf-κb signaling, apoptosis, and cell death signaling transcripts that preceded lymphocyte population changes, with activation of nk cell and glucocorticoid receptor signaling transcripts. our study is the first to systematically characterize the effects of corticosteroids on the human immunome, and we demonstrate that hc exerts differential effects on b and t lymphocytes and natural killer cells in humans. fauci et al. reported that 400 mg and 100 mg doses of hc cause a transient nadir in circulating peripheral blood lymphocytes at 4–6 hours and recovery to baseline after 24 hours. our data are consistent with these observations. we also observed differential effects of the two steroid doses on lymphocyte recovery at 24 hours, with total t cells, cd4+ t cells, and b cells rebounding above baseline after the 250 mg dose and total nk cells showing no increase above baseline at 24 hours. hc induced a rapid decline in circulating monocytes and mrnas related to innate immune signaling as early as one hour after infusion. these effects preceded neutrophil demargination and lymphocyte depletion."
"corticosteroids (an anti-inflammatory drug or supplement to help relieve pain and swelling, also known as steroids) have been used for decades to relieve inflammation, yet there is little data on their effects in humans. researchers examine the changes in cells and molecules of the immune system, also known as the immunome, in healthy humans after receiving systemic (affecting the entire body, rather than a single organ or body part) corticosteroids. researchers use multiple ways to examine the immunome in 20 volunteers at baseline (the start of the study), and again after intravenous (medication delivered through the vein) hydrocortisone (steroid medication) given at moderate and low doses. a thorough review of cell characteristics of lymphocytes subsets (parts of a type of white blood cell that is part of the immune system) saw a decline in b cell subsets that work with substances found in body fluids and in t-cell subsets that focus on specific foreign substances after receiving hydrocortisone. however, b and t cells rebounded or increased above baseline 24 hours after receiving hydrocortisone, while natural killer cell numbers (white blood cells that kill cells infected with a virus) remained stable. additional analysis found several results: less responsive signaling from nf-κb (proteins involved in different cell functions including immunity responses), apoptosis (normal cell death), and cell death signaling that comes before changes in lymphocytes amount, with activation of signaling in natural killer cells and glucocorticoid receptors (receptors that regulates genes controlling development, metabolism, and immune response). this study is the first to methodically describe the effects of corticosteroids on the human immunome and showed that hydrocortisone has different effects on b and t lymphocytes and natural killer cells in humans. a different study reports that at certain doses, hydrocortisone can cause short-term low level in blood lymphocytes several hours after receiving the drug and return to baseline levels (at the start of the study) after 24 hours. data from the present study have similar results. different effects are found in the two steroid doses on lymphocytes returning to normal at 24 hours, with total t cells, cd4+ t cells, and b cells increasing above baseline after the high dose and total natural killer cells showing no increase above baseline at 24 hours. hydrocortisone brings about a rapid decline in monocytes (an immune cell that attacks and breaks down germs and bacteria) and mrna (a strand of genetic code that provides instructions for building a protein) related to natural immune signaling as early as one hour after receiving the hydrocortisone. these effects come before neutrophil demargination, which increases white blood cells, and a reduction in lymphocytes."
"steroid hormones have long been used to control inflammation, yet there is a shortage of data on their effects in humans. we examined the changes in cellular and molecular immune system measurements, or ""immunome"" in healthy humans after full-body steroid hormone treatment. we used multi-measurement techniques to find immune system measurements in 20 volunteers at baseline and after hydrocortisone (hc) (steroid hormone) treatment via blood vessel injection at moderate (250 mg) and low (50 mg) doses. we did this to understand how steroid hormones bring about their effects. we examine physical traits of 120 immune cell subsets by a specific molecular technique, and saw a decline in blood-specific, immune-cell subsets, which reached their minimum 4-8 hours after hc treatment. however, b and t immune cells increased above baseline 24 hours after hc treatment, while natural killer immune cell numbers did not change. a specific lab technique showed reduced protein signaling and cell death before immune-cell group sizes changed, with activation of natural killer immune cells and energy-monitoring, steroid hormone receptor molecules. our study is the first to explore the effects of steroid hormones on human immune system measurements. we show that hc has different effects on human b and t immune cells and natural killer immune cells. facui et al. showed that 400 mg and 100 mg doses of hc cause a temporary minimum in outer blood immune cells at 4-6 hours and recovery to baseline after 24 hours. our data agree with these results. we also show different effects of the two steroid doses on immune cell recovery at 24 hours, with total t immune cells, specific sub-type t immune cells, and b immune cells increasing after the 250 mg dose. also, total natural killer immune cells show no increases at 24 hours. hc leads to a rapid decline in white blood cells and pre-protein molecules related to immune signaling as early as one hour after treatment. these effects preexist migration and reduction of specific immune cell subtypes."
"lymphocyte kinetic studies employing 51-chromium-labeled autologous lymphocytes were performed in nine normal volunteers in order to determine the effects of hydrocortisone administration on the recirculating versus the nonrecirculating intravascular lymphocyte pools. following infusion of labeled cells, the recirculating portion of the labeled cells rapidly equilibrated with the total intravascular lymphocyte pool and the vastly larger total-body recirculating lymphocyte pool, so that by 1 hr following infusion 21.8% plus or minus 3.2% of the labeled lymphocytes were left in the circulation. four hundred milligrams of intravenous hydrocortisone administered 24 hr after infusion of labeled cells caused a profound but transient lymphocytopenia which was maximal at 4 hr with return of lymphocyte counts to normal by 24 hr after injection. concomitant with the lymphocytopenia there was a dramatic increase in lymphocyte specific activity (cpm per 10-6 lymphocytes), while the total lymphocyte-associated radioactivity remaining in the circulation was unchanged, indicating that corticosteroid administration depleted the unlabeled recirculating cells. as the lymphocyte counts returned to normal following hydrocortisone, the specific activity also returned to normal. these studies indicated that hydrocortisone administration caused a transient lymphocytopenia by a preferential depletion of the recirculating portion of the intravascular lymphocyte pool."
"studies on lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell that is part of the immune system) that are taken from people and returned to the same individuals is performed on nine healthy volunteers to determine the effects of hydrocortisone (a steroid medication used to help calm the immune system) on the lymphocyte pools in blood. the recirculating or re-added part of the new lymphocyte cells returned to volunteers quickly balanced with the total lymphocyte pools and by 1 hour after the cells were put in the body, 21.8% were left in circulation. hydrocortisone is provided to the volunteers through the vein 24 hours after the infusion of cells. it caused a major but short-term lymphocytopenia (a lower-than-normal number of lymphocytes in the blood) at 4 hours and then lymphocytes returned to normal levels by 24 hours after the injection. naturally occurring with lymphocytopenia was a big increase in lymphocyte (white blood cell) specific activity, while the total lymphocyte radioactivity (release of energy) in the circulation did not change, suggesting that corticosteroid administration reduced the recirculating cells that were not provided to the volunteers. the lymphocyte counts (white blood cell count) returned to normal after hydrocortisone use. the specific activity also returned to normal. these studies suggest that giving hydrocortisone caused a short-term lymphocytopenia by reducing the recirculating portion of the lymphocyte pool in the blood."
"the mechanisms and kinetics of the immunosuppressive effects of alternate-day prednisone were investigated in a group of patients with a variety of inflammatory diseases receiving a range of alternate-day prednisone doses from 5 to 120 mg. total circulating lymphocyte and monocyte counts, as well as proportions of lymphocyte subpopulations defined both by surface markers and by in vitro functional capacities, were studied. at 8 a. m. of the day on prednisone, just before drug administration, lymphocyte and monocyte counts, proportions of lymphocyte subpopulations, as well as in vitro lymphocyte blastogenic responses to various mitogenic and antigenic stimuli were normal. 4 h after the administration of prednisone, there was a profound lymphocytopenia and monocytopenia, with a differential depletion of thymus-derived lymphocytes as well as various functionally defined lymphocyte subpopulations. lymphocyte kinetic studies using a radioactive chromium-labeled autologous lymphocytes showed that the lymphocytopenia was due predominantly to a transient depletion of the recirculating portion of the intravascular lymphocytepool. all these parameters returned to normal by 8 a.m. of the following day (off prednisone) and remained normal throughout the day. this very transient lymphocytopenia and monocytopenia after prednisone, with normal cell numbers, proportions, and functions throughout the remainder of the 2-day cycle, was associated with suppression of disease activity, yet did not affect cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity in these patients nor increase the likelihood of infectious complications. this drug-associated cyclic and transient monocytopenia and selective lymphocytopenia is best explained by a redistribution of recirculating lymphocytes to other body compartments, particularly the bone marrow."
"the process and reactions of the immune system from taking alternate- or every-other-day prednisone (a type of steroid drug that works by lowering the activity of the immune system) are investigated in a group of patients with different inflammatory diseases (diseases in which the immune system attacks the body's own tissues). total circulating lymphocyte (the total number of white blood cells in body fluids) and number of monocytes (an immune cell that attacks and breaks down germs and bacteria that enter the body), as well as lymphocyte subpopulations (parts of lymphocytes or white blood cells), were studied. at 8 a.m. of the day of receiving prednisone, just before the drug was given to patients, blood tests that include lymphocyte and monocyte counts and proportions of lymphocyte subpopulations were found to be normal. four hours after receiving the prednisone, there is major lymphocytopenia (a condition where there is a lower-than-normal number of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, in the blood), monocytopenia (a reduction of monocytes, a type of immune cell, in the blood), reduction of t-cells (a type of immune cell that help protect the body from infection), and the presence of different lymphocyte subpopulations. studies that focus on lymphocyte reactions showed that lymphocytopenia is due to short-term reduction of white blood cells circulating within and outside cells. all these blood measures returned to normal by 8 a.m. the next day (off the prednisone) and stayed normal throughout the day. the very short-term lymphocytopenia and monocytopenia after prednisone, with normal cell numbers and counts for the rest of the 2-day cycle, are connected with eliminating disease activity, yet did not affect cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity (showing a reaction in the skin after several days) and did not increase the chance of complications with infection. the short-term monocytopenia and lymphocytopenia connected with this drug is best explained as the body redistributing lymphocytes (white blood cells that are part of the immune system) to other parts of the body, particularly the bone marrow."
"the growth of knowledge in the field of the pharmacokinetics of prednisolone/prednisone has been slow for several reasons. first, convenient and specific methods for measuring these steroids only became available with the development of high performance liquid chromatographic methods. secondly, prednisolone is nonlinearly bound to transcortin and albumin: since the unbound concentrations of prednisolone are biologically relevant, it was necessary to determine the free fraction in each plasma sample. thirdly, due to the short half-life of prednisolone no steady-state is achieved, and therefore area under the concentration-time curve needed to be determined in all studies. fourthly, prednisolone and prednisone are interconvertible and prednisolone is given intravenously as an ester prodrug, features which created controversies about the correct interpretation of pharmacokinetic results. finally, the total body clearances of total and (to a lesser degree) of unbound prednisolone increase with increasing concentrations of prednisolone. therefore, in order to compare pharmacokinetic results between different subjects, standardised doses had to be administered. the investigations performed so far have revealed that: (1) the dose-dependent pharmacokinetics partly explain the clinical observation that an alternate-day regimen with prednisone yields fewer biological effects; (2) the interconversion of prednisone into prednisolone is not a limiting factor, even in patients with severely impaired liver function; (3) hypoproteinaemia per se does not cause increased unbound concentrations of prednisolone in vivo; (4) patients with liver failure, renal failure or a renal transplant, subjects older than 65 years, women on estrogen-containing oral contraceptive steroids or subjects taking ketoconazole have increased unbound concentrations of prednisolone-whereas hyperthyroid patients, some patients with crohn's disease, subjects taking microsomal liver enzyme-inducing agents or patients on intravenous prednisolone phthalate (instead of prednisolone phosphate) or on some brands of enteric coated prednisolone tablets have decreased concentrations of prednisolone. the biological relevance of the altered pharmacokinetics is supported in part by altered clinical effects and altered effects on cellular immunofunctions."
"the growth of knowledge in the field of pharmacokinetics (how the body handles a drug) of prednisolone/prednisone (two types of steroid drugs) has been slow for several reasons. first, the most convenient and specific way to measure these steroid drugs only became possible with the development of high performance liquid chromatographic methods, a technique that separates, identifies, and counts different parts in a mixture that makes it easy to analyze. secondly, it is necessary to understand the free fraction, or portion of the drug that has an effect on the body, of prednisolone in each plasma (the liquid portion of blood) sample. third, due to the short half-life (how long it takes for a drug concentration to be reduced to exactly half its initial amount in the blood) of prednisolone, there is no steady state (when how much the body is given of prednisolone is equal to how much of the drug the body eliminates). therefore, the area under the concentration-time curve (a measure of total exposure to the drug in the body's systems) is needed. fourth, prednisolone and prednisone can be exchanged for one another or converted to the other, and prednisolone is given intravenously or via injection. these features create disagreement about the correct way to understand how the body is able to handle these drugs. finally, the total amount of prednisolone that is cleared from the body and the total amount of prednisolone that has an effect on the body increase with more concentration of prednisolone. therefore, in order to compare pharmacokinetic results (how the body responds to or handles a drug) between different people, the same dose has to be given to patients. the investigations done so far reveal that: 1) using the amount of dose to understand the body's effect explains why an alternate- or every-other-day treatment with prednisone leads to fewer effects in the body; 2) it is not a limiting factor that prednisone can convert to prednisolone; 3) hypoproteinaemia (lower than normal levels of protein in the body) does not cause an increase of the amount of drug in the body that can have an effect; 4) patients with liver failure, kidney failure, or kidney transplant, as well as people with other conditions, have an increased amount of the prednisolone drugs - while patients with other conditions such as crohn's disease have decreased amounts of prednisolone. the biological importance of the changes in how the body handles these steroids is supported, in part, by changes at the clinical and immune cell level."
"the growth of knowledge in the activity of prednisolone/prednisone (a steroid hormone with immunosuppressant effects) has been slow for many reasons. first, convenient and specific methods to measure these steroids only became available with the creation of advanced lab techniques. secondly, prednisolone is connected to certain liver proteins. since the unconnected amounts of prednisolone are important, it was necessary to measure the unconnected amount in each blood sample. thirdly, due to the short span of prednisolone, no balance is achieved. thus, specific measurements needed to always be measured. fourthly, prednisolone and prednisone are interchangeable and prednisolone is given into the blood in an inactive form, attributes which created issues about correct interpretation of the lab results. finally, the full-body removal of total and unconnected prednisolone increase with increasing amounts of prednisolone. therefore, to compare lab results between different patients, measured doses had to be given. the tests performed have shown that (1) the dose-dependent drug reactions partly explain observations that an every-other-day schedule with prednisone leads to less biological effects. (2) the change of prednisone into prednisolone is not limiting, even in patients with very damaged liver function. (3) subnormal protein levels do not cause increased amounts of unbound prednisolone in living beings. (4) patients with liver failure, kidney failure or a kideny transplant, subjects older than 65 years, women on estrogen-containing, pregnancy-preventing, oral steroids or subjects taking ketoconazole (an antifungal medication) have increased amounts of unbound prednisolone. however, patients with overactive thyroids, some patients with crohn's disease (an inflammatory bowel disease), subjects taking specific liver medication, or patients on a specific prednisolone given into the blood (instead of another form of prednisolone) or on some brands of intenstinally-related prednisolone tablets have decreased amounts of prednisolone. the importance of these changed drug reactions is supported partly by changed clinical effects and changed effects on cellular immunofunctions."
"six healthy male volunteers were given 5, 20, and 50 mg of oral prednisone and 5, 20, and 400 mg doses of intravenous prednisolone. plasma and urine concentrations of prednisone and prednisolone were determined by hplc, and the binding of prednisolone to plasma proteins was measured by radioisotopic and equilibrium dialysis techniques. the pharmacokinetics of both oral prednisone and intravenous prednisolone were dose-dependent. the mean oral dose plasma clearances of prednisone ranged from 572 ml/min/1.73 m 2 for the 5 mg dose to 2271 ml/min/1.73 m 2 for the 50 mg dose. changes in prednisone half-life were insignificant, but increases in the half-life of its metabolite were dose-dependent. the systemic plasma clearance of i.v. prednisolone was dose-dependent and increased from 111 to 194 ml/min/1.73 m 2 over the 5 to 40 mg i.v. dosage range. the steady-state volume of distribution also increased, but little change in mean transit time and half-life was found. the binding of prednisolone to plasma proteins was markedly concentration-dependent, and a two compartment, nonlinear equation was used to characterize the effective binding of prednisolone to transcortin and albumin. the apparent pharmacokinetic parameters of protein-free and transcortin-free prednisolone were relatively constant with dose. the interconversion of prednisone and prednisolone varied with time and dose, although prednisolone concentrations dominated by 4- to 10-fold over prednisone. in urine, 2-5% of either administered drug was excreted as prednisone and 11-24% as prednisolone. the apparent renal clearances of both steroids were also nonlinear and unrelated to protein binding. these studies indicate that the pharmacokinetics of prednisone and prednisolone are dose-dependent and that protein binding does not fully explain their apparent nonlinear distribution and disposition."
"six healthy male volunteers were given 5, 20, and 50 mg of oral prednisone (steroid medication given by mouth) and 5, 20, and 400 mg doses of intravenous, or iv, prednisolone (steroid medication delivered through the vein). plasma (the liquid portion of blood) and urine concentrations of prednisone and prednisolone are determined by hplc or high performance liquid chromatographic (a technique that separates, identifies, and counts different parts in a mixture that makes it easy to analyze). how prednisolone attaches to proteins in plasma are also measured. the pharmacokinetics (how the body handles a drug) of both oral prednisone and iv prednisolone are dose-dependent (in which the effects of a drug change when the dose of the drug is changed). there are major changes in prednisone half-life (how long it takes for a drug concentration to be reduced to exactly half its initial amount in the blood), but increases in the half-life of its chemical changes by the body are dose-dependent. how the body clears iv prednisolone from plasma is dose-dependent. the steady-state volume (when how much the body is given of prednisolone is equal to how much of the drug the body eliminates) also increased, but little change in the average time and half-life is found. the binding of prednisolone to plasma proteins was primarily based on the concentration or amount of the drug. the pharmacokinetic measures of prednisolone not attached to proteins or transcortin-free (free of a protein from the liver) are mostly constant with the dose provided. how prednisone and prednisolone can be exchanged for one another or converted to the other varies with time and dose, although the amount of prednisolone is greater than the amount of prednisone. the observed renal (kidney-related) elimination or removal of both steroid drugs are also nonlinear (increases in drug exposure are not directly related to increases in given doses) and unrelated to protein attachment. these studies suggest that how the body handles prednisone and prednisolone are dose-dependent and that attaching to proteins does not fully explain their apparent nonlinear distribution and how it is absorbed and excreted in the body."
"in rheumatoid arthritis (ra), nocturnal release of proinflammatory cytokines is not adequately counteracted by endogenous glucocorticoid and is associated with symptoms of morning stiffness and pain. taking exogenous glucocorticoid during the night reduces morning stiffness significantly more than treatment at the conventional time in the morning, although waking to take tablets is unacceptable for patients. modified-release prednisone tablets were developed to allow administration at bedtime for programmed delivery of glucocorticoid during the night. single-center crossover studies were conducted, each in ≤24 healthy subjects, to compare the pharmacokinetics of a single 5-mg oral dose of modified-release prednisone and conventional prednisone, as well as the effect of food on bioavailability. there was no substantial difference in pharmacokinetic parameters of the formulations apart from the programmed delay in release of glucocorticoid from the modified-release tablets (c(max) 97%, auc(0-∞) 101%, 90% confidence intervals within the requisite range for bioequivalence). administration after a full or light meal did not affect pharmacokinetic characteristics, but bioavailability was reduced under fasted conditions. pharmacokinetic evaluation in 9 patients with ra confirmed that modified-release prednisone tablets taken at bedtime (around 22:00 h) with or after an evening meal result in programmed release of glucocorticoid 4 to 6 hours after intake."
"in rheumatoid arthritis (when the body's immune system attacks its own tissue, including joints, by mistake), nighttime release of proinflammatory cytokines (a type of molecule from immune cells that is capable of creating inflammation) is not prevented well by endogenous glucocorticoid (a type of steroid hormones produced within the body such as in tissues) and is connected with symptoms of morning stiffness and pain. taking exogenous or external glucocorticoid during the night reduces morning stiffness significantly more than treatment at the usual time in the morning, although waking to take tablets is unacceptable for patients. modified-release prednisone tablets are developed to allow it to be taken at bedtime for programmed or scheduled delivery of glucocorticoid during the night. several studies are conducted, each with 24 or less healthy people, to compare pharmacokinetics (how the body handles or responds to a drug) of a single oral dose of modified-release prednisone (a release of part of a drug at a time other than right after the drug is taken) and the regular prednisone. there is no great difference in pharmacokinetic measures of the doses besides the programmed delay in release of glucocorticoid from the modified-release tablets. taking the drug after a full or light meal did not affect pharmacokinetic characteristics, but how much of the drug that was circulating or floating in the body is reduced under fasted conditions (on an empty stomach or before the first meal of the day). evaluating the effect of the drug in 9 patients with rheumatoid arthritis confirmed that modified-release (delayed release) prednisone tablets taken at bedtime with or after an evening meal results in programmed release of glucocorticoid 4 to 6 hours after taking the tablets."
"background: renal transplant recipients were noted to appear cushingoid while on low doses of steroid as part of a triple therapy immunosuppression of cyclosporin a (csa), prednisolone, and azathioprine. methods: the study group comprised adult renal transplant recipients with stable graft function who had received their renal allograft a minimum of 1 year previously (43 studies undertaken in 22 men and 20 women) with median daily prednisone dose of 7 mg (range 3-10). the control group was healthy nontransplant subjects [median dose 10 mg (10-30)]. prednisolone bioavailability was measured using a limited 6-hour area under the curve (auc), with prednisolone measured using specific hplc assay. results: the median prednisolone auc/mg dose for all transplant recipients was significantly greater than the control group by approximately 50% (316 nmol x h/l/mg prednisolone versus 218). auc was significantly higher in female recipients (median 415 versus 297 for men) and in recipients receiving cyclosporin (348 versus 285). the highest auc was in women on estrogen supplements who were receiving cyclosporin (median 595). a significantly higher proportion of patients on triple therapy had steroid side effects compared with those on steroid and azathioprine (17/27 versus 4/15), more women than men had side effects (14/16 versus 7/22), and the auc/mg prednisone was greater in those with side effects than without (median 377 versus 288 nmol x h/l/mg). discussion: the results are consistent with the hypothesis that csa increases the bioavailability of prednisolone, most likely through inhibition of p-glycoprotein. the increased exposure to steroid increased the side-effect profile of steroids in the majority of patients. because the major contributor to auc is the maximum postdose concentration, it may be possible to use single-point monitoring (2 hours postdose) for routine clinical studies."
"people who received a renal (kidney) transplant appear cushingoid (having different symptoms, often facial puffiness and weight gain, due to too much of the hormone cortisol in the body) while on low doses of steroid as part of multiple drug treatments, including prednisolone. the study group has adult kidney transplant patients with stable functions within the transplanted kidney who got the kidney at least a year ago along with an average daily prednisone dose of 7 mg. the comparison group is healthy people who did not receive a transplant. prednisolone bioavailability (how much of a drug becomes completely available to the intended part of the body) is measured using an area under the curve (a measure of total exposure to the drug in the body's systems), with prednisolone measured using hplc, or high performance liquid chromatographic (a technique that separates, identifies, and counts different parts in a mixture that makes it easy to analyze). the prednisolone area under the curve for all transplant patients is significantly greater than the comparison group of healthy non-transplant patients. area under the curve measurements are much higher in females patients and in patients receiving cyclosporin, a drug that prevents the body from rejecting a transplant. the highest area under the curve measurement is in women on estrogen supplements (pills taken, often to resolve symptoms related to menopause) who are taking cyclosporin. a significantly higher proportion of patients on multiple-drug therapy had steroid side effects compared with those on steroid and azathioprine (a drug that can prevent organ rejection after a transplant). more women than men had side effects, and the area under the curve prednisone was greater in those with side effects than without. the results are consistent with the suggestion that cyclosporin a increases the bioavailability (how much of a drug becomes completely available to the intended part of the body) of prednisolone. the increased exposure to the steroid increased the side effects of steroids in most of the patients. it may be possible to use single-point monitoring (one time measurement) 2 hours after the dose for routine clinical studies."
"kidney transplant receivers appeared puffy and obese while on low doses of steroid from a three-part therapy of immunosuppressive drugs including cyclosporin a (csa), prednisolone, and azathioprine. the treatment group had adult kidney transplant receivers with stable transplants who had received their kidney transplant at least 1 year ago (43 studies done in 22 men and 20 women) with average daily immunosuppressive prednisone dose. the baseline group was healthy nontransplant patients. the average immunosuppressive prednisolone dose measurement for all transplant receivers was higher than the baseline group by around 50%. a certain test score was higher in female receivers and receivers taking the immunosuppressive cyclosporin drug. the highest score was in women on estrogen supplements taking the cyclosporin drug. more patients on the three-part therapy had steroid side effects versus those on steroid and the immunosuppressive azathioprine drug (17/27 versus 4/15). more women than men had side effects (14/16 versus 7/22). the immunosuppressive prednisone drug score was higher in those with side effects than without. csa drug increases the usuable amount of immunosuppressive prednisolone drug. the increased exposure to steroid increased steroid side effect severity in a majority of patients. since the major contributor to test scores was maximum post-dose concentration, single-point monitoring (monitoring 2 hours post-dose) may be used for routine studies."
"the effects of single oral doses of 10, 15, or 30 mg of prednisone on circulating mononuclear cells, autologous mlr, mitogen responses, and allogeneic mlr were studied in healthy volunteers. doses as low as 10 mg were immunosuppressive, causing diminution of circulating t cells and monocytes, and significant reduction in autologous but not allogeneic mlr responses. these effects were maximal 6 hr after drug administration and gone by 24 hr. autologous mlr responses were particularly sensitive to the effects of prednisone being significantly and consistently suppressed 2 hr after drug administration, before significant cell redistribution had occurred. macrophage-enriched stimulating cells were more easily suppressed than responding t cells. since the autologous mlr may be important in in vivo regulation of immune responses, its reduction by low-dose glucocorticoids may be of clinical relevance. this suppressive effect must be considered in studies of the autologous mlr in patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy."
"the effects of single oral (by mouth) doses of prednisone (a type of man-made steroid drug that can help lower certain immune-related symptoms, including inflammation and swelling) on circulating mononuclear cells (major cells in the body that signal the immune system), autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction (mlr) (the availability of non t-cells to stimulate t-cells), mitogen responses (to help measure immune response), and allogeneic mlr (grouping of white blood cells called lymphocytes from unrelated individuals resulting in t cell activation) are studied in healthy volunteers. low doses were immunosuppressive (drugs or medicines that lower the body's ability to reject a transplanted organ), causing reduced circulation and amounts of t-cells (a type of immune cell that help protect the body from infection) and monocytes (an immune cell that attacks and breaks down germs and bacteria that enter the body), and major losses in autologous but not allogeneic mlr responses. the maximum effect occurred 6 hours after the drug is provided, and effects are gone by 24 hours. autologous mlr responses are very sensitive to the effects of prednisone and were significantly and consistently slowed or stopped 2 hours after the drug was provided. macrophage-enriched stimulating cells (a type of white blood cell that surrounds and kills foreign organisms like bacteria and activates other immune system cells) were more easily slowed than responding t cells. because autologous mlr may be important in in vivo (experiments within a living human or animal) monitoring of immune responses, its reduction by low dose glucocorticoids (medicines that fight inflammation and work with your immune system) may be important. this suppressive (slowing down) effect must be considered in studies of the autologous mlr in patients receiving glucocorticoid drugs."
"the aim of this study was to estimate the influence of corticosteroids on th1 and th2 serum cytokine balance in patients with go: ifngamma, tnfalpha, il-4 and il-10. further, we tested the hypothesis of an up-regulation of th2 immune response during successful treatment with corticosteroids to explain their beneficial effect in graves' ophthalmopathy. serum cytokines were detected in three groups of subjects: 20 patients with graves' disease without ophthalmopathy (gd), 16 patients with clinical symptoms of ophthalmopathy (go) (cas over 3 points, last consultation record for go less than a year old) and 16 healthy volunteers. corticosteroid therapy consisted of intravenous infusions of methylprednisolone (mp) (2 series, 3 g each time) and subsequent treatment with oral prednisone (60 mg per day) in a tapering schedule. the serum samples were collected 24 hours before mp, 24 hours after mp, 14 days of treatment with prednisone and at the end of corticosteroid therapy. the levels of ifngamma, tnfalpha, il-4 and il-10 in the serum were determined using elisa. statistical significance was estimated by the mann-whitney u-test. our findings show a deviation to systemic th2 profile cytokines in graves' disease. in patients with go, we found a significantly increased serum il-10 concentration. in corticosteroid-responsive patients, the balance of serum cytokines il-4/ifngamma, il-4/tnfalpha, il-10/ifngamma and il-10/tn falpha increased and remained upregulated until the end of the study. in non-responders, the balance of serum cytokines studied increased after methylprednisolone but declined markedly during continuation of the therapy with prednisone. in summary, our results show that efficient corticosteroid therapy may be related to its influence on th2/th1 profile cytokine balance. the upregulation of serum il-4 and il-10 during successful treatment with corticosteroids indicate the possibility of using these cytokines as predictors of the beneficial effect of corticosteroids in graves' ophthalmopathy."
"the aim of this study is to estimate the effect of corticosteroids (anti-inflammatory drugs that help relieve pain and swelling, also known as steroids) on blood level balance of th1-related (cells that activate cellular immune responses) and th2-related (cells that activate hormonal immune responses) cytokines (chemical messengers that coordinate the immune response) in patients with graves' ophthalmopathy (swelling of the tissue in the area around the eyes). further, researchers tested the theory of an up-regulation of the th2 immune response (where th2 cells increase their responses to a signal from outside the cell to carry out specific functions) during successful treatment with corticosteroids. chemical messengers in the blood called cytokines are detected in 3 groups of study participants: 20 patients with graves' disease without ophthalmology, 16 patients with clinical symptoms of graves' ophthalmology, and 16 healthy volunteers. corticosteroid therapy consisted of intravenous (iv) infusions (medication delivered through the vein) of methylprednisolone (a steroid drug) and followed by treatment with oral or by-mouth prednisone (a steroid drug) in a gradually decreasing schedule. blood samples are collected before and after methylprednisolone, 14 days of treatment with prednisone (a type of steroid drug that can help lower certain immune-related symptoms, including inflammation and swelling), and at the end of the corticosteroid therapy. the findings show a shift in the response of th2 cytokines in graves' disease. in patients with graves' ophthalmology, there is a significantly increased blood concentration of interleukin 10 or il-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine which helps minimize damage to the body caused by the immune's response. in patients that received corticosteroids and had a response from the drug, the balance of certain blood cytokines that were measured had increased and remained increased until the end of the study. in those patients who did not respond to the corticosteroids, the balance of the specific blood cytokines studied had increased after receiving methylprednisolone but declined a great deal as the therapy continued with prednisone. in summary, results show that effective corticosteroid therapy may be related to its influence on th2/th1 cytokine profile balance. the upregulation or increase of blood il-4 and il-10 during successful treatment with corticosteroids suggests the possibility of using these cytokines to help predict the beneficial effect of corticosteroids in graves' ophthalmopathy."
"it is thought that glucocorticosteroids impair the clearance of immune complexes by the mononuclear phagocyte system (mps). we studied the effect of a five day course of prednisone (1 mg/kg body weight per day) on mps function in 10 healthy volunteers, using soluble radiolabeled aggregates of human immunoglobulin g as a probe. mps function was assessed before steroid treatment, and again 24 hours after the last dose of prednisone. elimination kinetics and the uptake of the immunoglobulin aggregates by liver and spleen did not change after prednisone treatment. this suggests that, in contrast to general belief, high doses of glucocorticosteroids have no direct, acute effect on mps function."
"it is though that glucocorticosteroids (strong medicines that fight inflammation and work with the immune system) disrupt the elimination of immune complexes (build-up in the blood that can cause infection and problems with the immune system) by the mononuclear phagocyte system (a family of cells that fight foreign substances and are part of the immune system). researchers studied the effect of a five day course of prednisone (a type of steroid drug that can help lower certain immune-related symptoms, including inflammation and swelling) on how the mononuclear phagocyte system functions in 10 healthy volunteers using soluble (can be dissolved in water) build-up of human immunoglobulin g (an common antibody in the body that protects against infection) as a tool to monitor. the mononuclear phagocyte system function is assessed before giving the steroid treatment and again 24 hours after the last dose of prednisone. the elimination reaction and the use of the immunoglobulin by the liver and spleen did not change after prednisone treatment. this suggests that high doses of glucocorticosteroids have no direct, short-term effect on mononuclear phagocyte system functions."
"birt-hogg-dubé syndrome (bhd) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the folliculin gene and is characterized by the formation of fibrofolliculomas, early onset renal cancers, pulmonary cysts, and spontaneous pneumothoraces. the exact pathogenesis of tumor and lung cyst formation in bhd remains unclear. there is great phenotypic variability in the clinical features of bhd, and patients can present with any combination of skin, pulmonary, or renal findings. more than 80% of adult patients with bhd have pulmonary cysts on high-resolution computed tomography scan of the chest."
"birt-hogg-dubé is a rare genetic skin disorder caused by genetic mutations and puts people at risk for non-cancerous tumors in hair follicles around the face, neck and chest. it may also lead to early onset kidney cancers, lung cysts which are sacs usually filled with air or gas on the lungs, and sudden collapse of the lung. it is unclear how tumor and lung cysts form in people with birt-hogg-dubé. there are a lot of differences in the physical traits of birt-hogg-dubé, and patients can show any combination of skin, lung, or kidney findings. more than 80% of adult patients with birt-hogg-dubé have lung cysts on x-ray scans of the chest."
"birt-hogg-dubé syndrome (bhd) is a rare, genetic disorder caused by a dna mutation. the disorder causes hair follicle tumors, kidney cancer, lung cysts, and collapsed lungs. the exact creation of tumor and lung cyst or swellings in bhd is unclear. physical symptoms, like skin, lung, and kidney abnormalities, vary in patients with bhd. over 80% of adult patients with bhd have lung cysts or swellings seen via medical imaging of the chest."
"background and objective: the purpose of this study was to create a practical ct-based algorithm to differentiate birt-hogg-dubé (bhd) syndrome from other diffuse cystic lung diseases (dcld). methods: the study was a retrospective review of the ct images of 33 patients with bhd syndrome, 33 patients with lam, and 23 patients with nbnl (non-bhd and non-lam) among dcld patients. on the basis of the data collected, the ct images were reviewed again to evaluate the characteristics (size, number, distribution, and morphology) of pulmonary cysts. results: lower lung-predominant cysts were more likely to be found in patients with bhd syndrome than in patients with lam or in the nbnl dcld group. in the axial distribution, 18 of 33 patients in bhd group had cysts that were predominantly near the mediastinum, and all the patients in the lam and nbnl dcld groups had diffuse cysts. the appearance of fusiform cysts was more easily observed in patients in the bhd group. in total, 58% patients in the bhd group had less than 50 lung cysts, while all patients in the non-bhd group had more than 50 lung cysts. the biggest cyst was located in the lower lobe in 28 of 33 patients in the bhd group, while 11 of 33 patients in lam group and 10 patients in the nbnl dcld group had the biggest cyst in the lower lobe. conclusion: the pulmonary cysts in patients with bhd tended to be fusiform, less numerous and located predominantly in the lower lobe and near the mediastinum. these radiologic pulmonary features could assist physicians in differentiating bhd from other dclds."
"the purpose of this study is to create a flow-chart based on x-rays called ct scans to tell the difference between birt-hogg-dubé syndrome and other lung diseases that have cysts, which are sacs of air or fluid. the study uses ct scans that were taken prior to the study from 33 patients with birt-hogg-dubé syndrome, 33 patients with a rare disease called lam where a muscle cell grows in the lungs, and 23 patients with other lung diseases that cause cysts (but are not birt-hogg-dubé or lam). the ct images are reviewed again to determine the size, number, location, and form of pulmonary cysts (cysts filled with air located on the lung). cysts mainly located in the lower lung are more likely to be found in patients with birt-hogg-dubé syndrome than in patients with lam or in the group with other lung diseases. in the birt-hogg-dubé group, 18 out of 33 patients have cysts that are mostly near the area between the lungs. all the patients in the lam group and the group with other lung diseases have cysts in different locations. cysts that are fusiform (wide in the middle and taper at the ends) are more easily observed in patients in the birt-hogg-dubé group. in total, 58% patients in the birt-hogg-dubé group have less than 50 lung cysts, while all patients in the non-birt-hogg-dubé group had more than 50 lung cysts. the biggest cyst is located in the bottom of the lung in 28 of 33 patients in the birt-hogg-dubé group, while 11 of 33 patients in the lam group and 10 patients in the other lung diseases group have the biggest cyst in the lower lobe. in conclusion, pulmonary cysts in patients with birt-hogg-dubé are usually fusiform, are fewer in numbers, and mainly located in the bottom of the lung near the space in between the lungs. the lung images may assist doctors in identifying the difference between birt-hogg-dubé from other lung diseases that have cysts."
"birt-hogg-dubé syndrome (bhd) is an autosomal dominant condition characterised clinically by skin fibrofolliculomas, pulmonary cysts, spontaneous pneumothorax, and renal cancer. the condition is caused by germline mutations in the flcn gene, which encodes folliculin; the function of this protein is largely unknown, although flcn has been linked to the mtor pathway. the availability of dna-based diagnosis has allowed insight into the great variation in expression of flcn, both within and between families. patients can present with skin signs and also with pneumothorax or renal cancer. preventive measures are aimed mainly at early diagnosis and treatment of renal cancer. this review gives an overview of current diagnosis and management of bhd."
"birt-hogg-dubé syndrome (bhd) is a genetic condition that is often accompanied by non-cancerous tumors in hair follicles around the face, neck and chest, pulmonary cysts which are sacs of air in the lungs, sudden collapse of the lung, and kidney cancer. birt-hogg-dubé is caused by genetic mutations in a gene that helps control cell growth called flcn. diagnosing conditions using dna allows insight in how the flcn gene works, both within and between families. patients can present with skin signs and also with a collapsed lung (when air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall) or kidney cancer. prevention is mainly focused on early diagnosis and treatment of kidney cancer. this paper gives an overview of current diagnosis and management of birt-hogg-dubé."
"germline mutations in the novel tumor suppressor gene flcn are responsible for the autosomal dominant inherited disorder birt-hogg-dubé (bhd) syndrome that predisposes to fibrofolliculomas, lung cysts and spontaneous pneumothorax, and an increased risk for developing kidney tumors. although the encoded protein, folliculin (flcn), has no sequence homology to known functional domains, x-ray crystallographic studies have shown that the c-terminus of flcn has structural similarity to denn (differentially expressed in normal cells and neoplasia) domain proteins that act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (gefs) for small rab gtpases. flcn forms a complex with folliculin interacting proteins 1 and 2 (fnip1, fnip2) and with 5' amp-activated protein kinase (ampk). this review summarizes flcn functional studies which support a role for flcn in diverse metabolic pathways and cellular processes that include modulation of the mtor pathway, regulation of pgc1α and mitochondrial biogenesis, cell-cell adhesion and rhoa signaling, control of tfe3/tfeb transcriptional activity, amino acid-dependent activation of mtorc1 on lysosomes through rag gtpases, and regulation of autophagy. ongoing research efforts are focused on clarifying the primary flcn-associated pathway(s) that drives the development of fibrofolliculomas, lung cysts and kidney tumors in bhd patients carrying germline flcn mutations."
"changes in the gene called flcn, which is a gene that suppresses tumor growth, are responsible for the inherited disorder birt-hogg-dubé syndrome. this syndrome makes people likely to get non-cancerous tumors in hair follicles around the face, neck and chest (fibrofolliculomas), cysts (sacs of air) in the lungs, sudden collapse of the lung, and an increased risk for developing tumors in the kidneys. some parts of the gene protein, called folliculin, is shown to have a similar structure to other proteins called denn. flcn binds with folliculin proteins 1 and 2 (fnip1, fnip2) and with a protein kinase that is a critical molecule for energy sensing. this review summarizes other studies that have studied flcn functions, including its role in how the body distributes nutrients and other cell processes. ongoing research efforts focus on understanding the ways flcn may lead to the development of fibrofolliculomas, lung cysts, and kidney tumors in birt-hogg-dubé patients who have the flcn mutation."
"heritable dna mutations in the new tumor stopping gene flcn lead to the genetic birt-hogg-dubé (bhd) syndrome. the syndrome causes hair follicle tumors, lung cysts or swellings, collapsed lungs, and an increased risk for kidney tumors. while the full protein, folliculin (flcn), is not similar to other proteins, one end of flcn is structurally similar to the ends of other proteins that help activate high-energy proteins. this review summarizes flcn studies regarding its role in cellular, signaling, and cell structure pathways. current research is on explaining the flcn-associated pathway driving the creation of hair follicle tumors, lung cysts, and kidney tumors in bhd patients with heritable flcn mutations."
"objective: birt-hogg-dubé (bhd) syndrome is an autosomal dominant inherited syndrome involving multiple organs. in young patients, renal neoplasms that are multiple, bilateral, or both, such as oncocytomas, chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (rcc), hybrid chromophobe rcc-oncocytomas, clear cell rcc, and papillary rcc, can suggest bhd syndrome. extrarenal findings, including dermal lesions, pulmonary cysts, and spontaneous pneumothoraces, also aid in diagnosis. conclusion: radiologists may be one of the first medical specialists to suggest the diagnosis of bhd syndrome. knowledge of pathogenesis and management, including the importance of the types of renal neoplasms in a given patient, is needed to properly recognize this rare condition."
"birt-hogg-dubé syndrome is a genetically inherited syndrome involving multiple organs. in young patients, kidney tumors that are numerous, in both kidneys, or both can suggest birt-hogg-dubé. findings outside the kidney, such as changes in the skin, cysts (sacs filled with air) in the lungs, and the sudden collapse of the lung, also help in diagnosis. in conclusion, radiologists (doctors who use x-rays and other electronic images to treat and diagnose patients) may be the first medical care provider to suggest a diagnosis of birt-hogg-dubé. knowledge of how the disease develops and how to manage the condition, including the importance of the types of kidney growths in a patient, is needed to properly recognize this rare condition."
"loss-of-function mutations in the folliculin gene (flcn) on chromosome 17p cause birt-hogg-dube syndrome (bhd), which is associated with cystic lung disease. the risk of lung collapse (pneumothorax) in bhd patients is 50-fold higher than in the general population. the cystic lung disease in bhd is distinctive because the cysts tend to be basilar, subpleural and lentiform, differentiating bhd from most other cystic lung diseases. recently, major advances in elucidating the primary functions of the folliculin protein have been made, including roles in mtor and ampk signaling via the interaction of flcn with fnip1/2, and cell-cell adhesion via the physical interaction of flcn with plakophilin 4 (pkp4), an armadillo-repeat containing protein that interacts with e-cadherin and is a component of the adherens junctions. in addition, in just the last three years, the pulmonary impact of flcn deficiency has been examined for the first time. in mouse models, evidence has emerged that ampk signaling and cell-cell adhesion are involved in alveolar enlargement. in addition, the pathologic features of human bhd cysts have been recently comprehensively characterized. the ""stretch hypothesis"" proposes that cysts in bhd arise because of fundamental defects in cell-cell adhesion, leading to repeated respiration-induced physical stretch-induced stress and, over time, expansion of alveolar spaces particularly in regions of the lung with larger changes in alveolar volume and at weaker ""anchor points"" to the pleura. this hypothesis ties together many of the new data from cellular and mouse models of bhd and from the human pathologic studies. critical questions remain. these include whether the consequences of stretch-induced cyst formation arise through a destructive/inflammatory program or a proliferative program (or both), whether cyst initiation involves a ""second hit"" genetic event inactivating the remaining wild-type copy of flcn (as is known to occur in bhd-associated renal cell carcinomas), and whether cyst initiation involves exclusively the epithelial compartment versus an interaction between the epithelium and mesenchyme. ultimately, understanding the mechanisms of cystic lung disease in bhd may help to elucidate the pathogenesis of primary spontaneous pneumothorax, with more than 20,000 cases reported annually in the united states alone."
"loss-of-function mutations in the folliculin gene, which helps suppress tumor growth, cause birt-hogg-dube syndrome, which is associated with cystic lung disease, a group of diseases that cause cysts (sacs of air) in the lungs. the risk of lung collapse, which is when air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall, in birt-hogg-dube patients is 50 times higher than in the general population. the cystic lung disease in birt-hogg-dube is different from other cystic lung diseases because the cysts tend to be at the base of the lung, under the layer of tissue that wraps the lungs and is shaped like a lentil or lens. recent advances to understand the main functions of the folliculin protein have been made. in addition, in just the last 3 years, the impact of a folliculin gene impairment on the lungs was examined for the first time. in experiments with mice, evidence emerged that another protein called ampk that signals to other cells and cells connecting to other cells is involved when air gets trapped in the lungs. also, how human birt-hogg-dube cysts are formed and how they progress has been recently described. the ""stretch hypothesis"" proposes that cysts in birt-hogg-dube form because of defects in how cells connect to one another, leading to repeated stretching of the lungs and, over time, expansion of different parts of the lung. this idea ties together many of the new data from cell and mouse studies of birt-hogg-dube and from the human studies of the disease. critical questions remain. these questions include how the stretch-induced cyst formation are formed, if the first formation of a cyst involves a second genetic change, and whether the formation of a cyst involves just the surface of the lung or an interaction between the lung surface and cells under tissues. overall, understanding the processes of cystic lung disease in birt-hogg-dube may help to understand how it leads to sudden collapse of the lung, with more than 20,000 cases a year in the united states."
"birt-hogg-dubé syndrome (bhd) is a rare inherited autosomal dominant disorder caused by germline mutations in the tumour suppressor gene flcn, encoding the protein folliculin. its clinical expression typically includes multiple pulmonary cysts, recurrent spontaneous pneumothoraces, cutaneous fibrofolliculomas and renal tumours of various histological types. bhd has no sex predilection and tends to manifest in the third or fourth decade of life. multiple bilateral pulmonary cysts are found on chest computed tomography in >80% of patients and more than half experience one or more episodes of pneumothorax. a family history of pneumothorax is an important clue, which suggests the diagnosis of bhd. unlike other cystic lung diseases such as lymphangioleiomyomatosis and pulmonary langerhans cell histiocytosis, bhd does not lead to progressive loss of lung function and chronic respiratory insufficiency. renal tumours affect about 30% of patients during their lifetime, and can be multiple and recurrent. the diagnosis of bhd is based on a combination of genetic, clinical and/or skin histopathological criteria. management mainly consists of early pleurodesis in the case of pneumothorax, periodic renal imaging for tumour detection, and diagnostic work-up in search of bhd in relatives of the index patient."
"birt-hogg-dubé syndrome is a rare inherited genetic disorder caused by changes in the gene flcn that makes a protein called folliculin, which helps suppress tumor growth. it is often associated with the development of multiple cysts (sacs of air) in the lungs, sudden collapse of the lung, non-cancerous tumors in hair follicles around the face, neck, and chest (fibrofolliculomas), and kidney tumors. birt-hogg-dubé has no preference between male and female and often appears when people are in their 30s or 40s. multiple cysts on both lungs are identified using x-rays in more than 80% of patients. more than half experience one or more collapsed lung events which is when air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall. a family history of collapsed lung is an important clue and suggests a diagnosis of birt-hogg-dubé. unlike other cystic lung diseases, birt-hogg-dubé does not lead to loss of lung function over time or to ongoing breathing problems. kidney tumors affect about 30% of patients during their lifetime. there can be multiple number of tumors, and they can be recurring. the diagnosis of birt-hogg-dubé is based on a combination of genetic and medical characteristics and/or studying skin and skin cells with a microscope. for a collapsed lung, care mostly involves doing a procedure called pleurodesis early that involves sticking the lung to the chest wall to reduce space in the lungs and chest wall. scanning the kidneys for tumors using x-rays and finding out if relatives have birt-hogg-dubé are also ways to manage the disorder."
"birt-hogg-dubé syndrome (bhd) is a rare inherited disorder caused by heritable dna mutations in the tumor stopping gene flcn, used to create the protein folliculin. birt-hogg-dubé syndrome leads to lung cysts or swellings, collapsed lungs, hair follicle and kidney tumors. bhd has no sexual preference and appears in the 30's or 40's. multiple lung cysts in both lungs are detected in >80% of patients via medical imaging. >50% have one or more episodes of lungs collapsing. a family history of collapsing lungs may help identify bhd. unlike other lung diseases with lung cysts or swellings, bhd does not lead to loss of lung function overtime and long-lasting breathing deficits. kidney tumors affect ~30% of patients and can be multiple and reoccuring. identifying bhd involves genetic, medical, and/or skin-related criteria. managing bhd involves removing the space between the lungs and chest wall to prevent collapsing lungs. it also involves constant kidney imaging for tumors and searching for bhd in relatives."
"birt-hogg-dubé syndrome (bhd) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterised by pulmonary cysts, fibrofolliculomas and renal tumours. the pulmonary cysts may lead to pneumothorax, and in cases of primary, spontaneous pneumothorax the syndrome should be excluded. the renal tumours are frequently malignant, but slow-growing. screening and family assessment enable discovery of renal cancer at an early stage. the syndrome is underdiagnosed and little known."

"birt-hogg-dubé (bhd) syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by germline loss-of-function mutations in folliculin gene (flcn). bhd is characterized by lower lobe-predominant pulmonary cysts with risk of pneumothorax, benign skin tumors (fibrofolliculomas), and renal cell carcinoma, often of an unusual chromophobe/oncocytic hybrid histology. the flcn protein functions in multiple signaling and metabolic pathways including positive regulation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mtorc1) activity via flcn's gtpase (gap) activity for rag c, positive regulation of wnt signaling (in mesenchymal cells), and negative regulation of tfe3 nuclear localization. therefore, flcn-deficient cells are predicted to have reduced mtorc1 and wnt activity and enhanced tfe3 activity. folliculin also has functions in autophagy, mitochondrial biogenesis, cell-cell adhesion, 5' amp activated protein kinase activity, and other pathways. the specific contributions of these pathways to the lung manifestations of bhd are largely unknown. this review is focused on the pulmonary manifestations of bhd, highlighting selected recent advances in elucidating the cellular functions of flcn and current hypotheses related to the pathogenesis of cystic lung disease in bhd, including the ""stretch hypothesis."" we also discuss important knowledge gaps in the field, including the genetic, cellular and physical mechanisms of cyst pathogenesis, and the timing of cyst initiation, which may occur during lung development."
"birt-hogg-dubé syndrome is an genetic disorder caused by a loss-of-function mutations in the folliculin gene (flcn), a gene that stops or slows tumor growth. a common characteristic of birt-hogg-dubé is pulmonary cysts (sacs filled with air in the lungs) that are mostly located in the bottom of the lung. there is also the risk of a collapsed lung, when air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall, non-cancerous skin tumors, and kidney cancer. the flcn protein has different functions in the body, including signaling to other cells and supervising the formation of other proteins. therefore, flcn cells that are damaged are thought to have reduced activity in other proteins and increase activity in others that may lead to the development of kidney tumors. folliculin also has other functions including cleaning out damaged cells, helping cells connect with other cells, and working with enzymes that activate the proteins that regular cell energy and fuel. how these functions contribute to the lung problems of birt-hogg-dubé are largely unknown. this review is focused on the lung problems of birt-hogg-dubé and highlights recent advances in understanding the cell function of flcn. the review also provides current ideas related to how cystic lung disease in birt-hogg-dubé is formed. researchers also discuss important knowledge gaps in the field, including genetic, cell, and physical processes of cyst development, in addition to the timing of when cysts first form."
"birt-hogg-dubé syndrome (bhd) is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of hair follicle tumors, renal tumors and pulmonary cysts. bhd is caused by heterozygous, predominantly truncating mutations in the folliculin (flcn) gene located on chromosome 17, which encodes a highly conserved tumor suppressor protein. although management of renal tumors of low malignant potential is the primary focus of longitudinal care, pulmonary manifestations including cyst formation and spontaneous pneumothorax are among the most common manifestations in bhd. due to the lack of awareness, there is commonly a delay in the pulmonary diagnosis of bhd and patients are frequently mislabeled as having chronic obstructive lung disease, emphysema or common bullae/blebs. a family history of pneumothorax is present in 35 % of patients with bhd. certain imaging characteristics of the cysts, including size, basilar and peripheral predominance, perivascular and periseptal localization, and elliptical or lentiform shape can suggest the diagnosis of bhd based on inspection of the chest ct scan alone. recurrent pneumothoraces are common and early pleurodesis is recommended. a better understanding of role of flcn in pulmonary cyst formation and long term studies to define the natural history of the pulmonary manifestations of bhd are needed."

"birt-hogg-dubé syndrome (bhd) is a rare, inherited disorder that leads to hair follicle tumors, kidney tumors, and lungs cysts or swellings. bhd is caused by dna mutations in the folliculin (flcn) gene, which helps create a tumor stopping protein or molecule. while managing low-risk kidney tumors is primary for long-term care, lung issues like cyst formation and random lung collapsions are common in bhd. due to unawareness, identifying bhd is usually delayed. patients are frequently mislabeled with long-lasting, interfering lung disease, emphysema (a lung disease involving damaged air sacs), or fluid-filled blisters. a family history of collapsing lungs is present in 35% of patients with bhd. certain attributes of cysts, like size, location, and shape, can help identify bhd by medical imaging alone. reoccuring collapsing lungs are common. early removal of the space between the lungs and chest wall is recommended. we need to better understand how flcn affects lung cyst formation and how lung problems from bhd develop."
"background: coronavirus disease (covid-19) has affected more than 100 countries worldwide and the discharge criteria of patients with covid-19 vary across different countries. in china, patients with two negative respiratory viral rna tests taken at least one day apart can be discharged with no further quarantine required. currently, pcr testing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) in fecal sample is not routinely performed. methods: we present a patient with covid-19, whose respiratory swabs became negative but fecal sample remained positive for sars-cov-2 rna. results: stool sample collected on 27th of february was still positive for sars-cov-2 rna, 24 days after the first negative respiratory swab. conclusions: based on the experience from the 2003 sars epidemic, we recommend that fecal rna testing of sars-cov-2 should be incorporated into the discharge criteria to minimize the risk of transmission from the gastrointestinal tract."
"covid-19 (a viral, breathing-related disease) has affected more than 100 countries around the world, and the basis used to decide when patients with covid-19 can be sent home is different across countries. in china, patients with two negative (or undetected) viral tests for covid-19 taken at least one day apart can be sent home with no further quarantine (isolation) required. currently, testing of for coronavirus using a fecal or poop sample is not usually done. this paper describes a patient with covid-19 whose tests from swabs of the back of the nose and throat were negative but fecal sample were positive for (or had) coronavirus, which causes covid-19. the stool (feces) sample collected on 27th of february was still positive for genetic material of the coronavirus, 24 days after the first negative swab from the nose and throat. in conclusion, based on the experience from previous epidemics of lung infections, researchers recommend that testing fecal samples for coronavirus should be included into the standard for sending people home to decrease the risk of transmission (or spread) from the digestive system."
"coronavirus disease (covid-19), which is a viral breathing-related disease, has affected over 100 countries worldwide. the hospital release criteria of patients with covid-19 varies across countries. in china, patients with two tests detecting no virus and taken at least one day apart can be released with no further isolation needed. currently, testing of severe acute respiratory syndrome cornoavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), which causes covid-19, in poop samples in not regularly performed. we show a patient with covid-19, whose poop, but not nose swabs, shows traces of the virus. poop sample collected on 27th of february shows signs of the virus, 24 days after the first nose swab that did not detect the virus. based on the 2003 sars virus epidemic, we recommend that poop testing for sars-cov-2 should be added to the hospital release criteria to minimize risk of spread from the digestive tract."
"background: nucleic acid persists after symptom resolution and infectivity for many viral infections via delayed clearance of nucleic acid fragments, non-infectious particles, or transmissible virus. for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), the relationship between nasopharyngeal (np) swab positivity, the development of antibodies against covid-19, and clinical history are unclear. study design and methods: individuals who recovered from covid-19 and volunteered to donate convalescent plasma (cp) were screened by np swab pcr, responded to a questionnaire, and were tested for anti-covid-19 antibodies. results: a proportion of 11.8% of individuals tested positive for sars-cov-2 by np swab pcr greater than 14 days after the resolution of symptoms of active disease, including one donor who had asymptomatic disease and tested positive by np swab 41 days after her initial diagnosis. clinical history did not show a significant correlation with persistence of np swab positivity. also, np swab positivity >14 days from symptom resolution did not correlate with anti-covid-19 serology results. igg anti-sars-cov-2 spike antibody strength correlated with hospitalization for covid-19 using two different assays. total anti-sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid antibody strength correlated with time from symptom resolution to sample collection and symptom duration. conclusions: sars-cov-2 nucleic acid is detectable long after the resolution of symptoms in a significant percentage of previously diagnosed individuals, which is important to consider when interpreting pcr swab results. persistence of pcr positivity does not correlate with antibody strength or symptoms of covid-19. if anti-spike antibody is used to assess cp potency, individuals who suffered severe covid-19 disease symptoms may represent better donors."
"for many infections from viruses, traces of the infection can remain in the body after symptoms and transmission (or spread) to others stop. for covid-19 (a viral, respiratory illness), the relationship between a positive (or virus-detected) nasal swab where a sample is taken from the back of the nose and throat, the development of antibodies (proteins in the body) that fight covid-19, and the clinical history is unclear. in this study, people who recovered from covid-19 and volunteered to donate plasma (the liquid part of blood) are screened for genetic material of the virus using a nasal swab. these volunteers also answer a series of questions and are tested for covid-19 antibodies. there are 11.8% who tested positive for coronavirus, which causes covid-19, using a nasal swab 14 days after symptoms stopped. medical history does not show a big association with ongoing positive nasal swab tests. also, a positive nasal swab >14 days after symptoms stop is not correlated with antibodies against covid-19 in the plasma. a test measuring the increase of antibodies against covid-19 relates with being in the hospital for covid-19. antibodies against covid-19 corresponded with time after symptoms stopped to when the samples are collected and how long symptoms lasted. in conclusion, traces of genetic material from coronavirus can be found long after symptoms end in a significant percentage of people who have been diagnosed, which is important to remember when reading swab test results. continuing to test positive does not correspond with antibody strength or symptoms of covid-19. if measuring antibodies is used to understand plasma strength, individuals who have had serious covid-19 disease symptoms may be better donors or donators."
"background: coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) convalescent plasma (ccp) collection began in two brazilian hospitals for treatment of severe/critical patients. methods and materials: mild/moderate covid-19 convalescents were selected as ccp donors after reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) infection and absence of symptoms for ≥14 days plus (a) age (18-60 years), body weight greater than 55 kg; (b) immunohematological studies; (c) no infectious markers of hepatitis b virus, hepatitis c virus, human immunodeficiency virus, human t-lymphotropic virus-1/2, chagas and syphilis infection; (d) no hla antibodies (multiparous); (e) second rt-pcr (nasopharyngeal swab and/or blood) negativity; (f) virus neutralization test (cytopathic effect-based virus neutralization test neutralizing antibody) and anti-nucleocapsid protein sars-cov-2 igm, igg, and iga enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. results: among 271 donors (41 females, 230 males), 250 presented with neutralizing antibodies. final rt-pcr was negative on swab (77.0%) or blood (88.4%; p = .46). final definition of rt-pcr was only defined at more than 28 days after full recovery in 59 of 174 (33.9%) rt-pcr -ve, and 25/69 rt-pcr +ve (36.2%; 13 between 35 and 48 days). neutralizing antibody titers of 160 or greater were found in 63.6%. correlation between igg signal/cutoff of 5.0 or greater and neutralizing antibody of 160 or greater was 82.4%. combination of final rt-pcr -ve with neutralizing antibody ≥160 was 41.3% (112/271). serial plasma collection showed decline in neutralizing antibody titers and iga levels (p < .05), probably denoting a ""golden period"" for ccp collection (≤28 days after joining the program); iga might have an important role as neutralizing antibody. donor's weight, days between disease onset and serial plasma collection, and igg and igm levels are important predictors for neutralizing antibody titer. conclusions: rt-pcr +ve cases are still detected in 36.2% within 28 to 48 days after recovery. high anti-nucleocapsid protein igg levels may be used as a surrogate marker to neutralizing antibody."
"collection of blood plasma from people who have recovered from the viral, respiratory illness covid-19, also called convalescent plasma, began in two hospitals in brazil for treatment of severe patients. people recovering from mild or moderate covid-19 infection are selected as donors for blood plasma if they have had no symptoms for at least 14 days. additional tests are done for other infections such as hepatitis and hiv and for antibodies (or infection-fighting proteins) for covid-19. among 271 blood plasma donors, 250 have antibodies in the body to fight covid-19. in 77% of donors, no genetic trace of covid-19 is found from a swab test and in 88.4%, none is found in blood. at more than 28 days after full recovery, 59 out of 174 are negative (with no virus detected), and 25 out of 69 are positive (with virus detected), but 13 of these are between 35 and 48 days. additional tests are done to learn more about the level of antibodies in the blood. blood plasma collection showed a decline in antibodies that attach to the virus and keep it from entering cells. the donor's weight, days between the start of the disease and repeated plasma collection, and antibody levels are important for predicting possible antibody concentration that can keep the virus from entering cells. in conclusion, a positive test that finds genetic traces of the virus are still detected in 36.2% of cases within 28 to 48 days after recovery. high levels of certain antibody proteins may be used to identify antibodies that can neutralize the virus and make it inactive."
"background: reverse-transcription pcr (rt-pcr) assays are used to test for infection with the sars-cov-2 virus. rt-pcr tests are highly specific and the probability of false positives is low, but false negatives are possible depending on swab type and time since symptom onset. aim: to determine how the probability of obtaining a false-negative test in infected patients is affected by time since symptom onset and swab type. methods: we used generalised additive mixed models to analyse publicly available data from patients who received multiple rt-pcr tests and were identified as sars-cov-2 positive at least once. results: the probability of a positive test decreased with time since symptom onset, with oropharyngeal (op) samples less likely to yield a positive result than nasopharyngeal (np) samples. the probability of incorrectly identifying an uninfected individual due to a false-negative test was considerably reduced if negative tests were repeated 24 hours later. for a small false-positive test probability (<0.5%), the true number of infected individuals was larger than the number of positive tests. for a higher false-positive test probability, the true number of infected individuals was smaller than the number of positive tests. conclusion: np samples are more sensitive than op samples. the later an infected individual is tested after symptom onset, the less likely they are to test positive. this has implications for identifying infected patients, contact tracing and discharging convalescing patients who are potentially still infectious."
"a test called reverse-transcription pcr (rt-pcr) is used to test for infection for the coronavirus (which causes covid-19 - a viral, respiratory illness) by looking for traces of genes from the virus. the chances of getting an incorrect positive (or virus-detected) result is low when using rt-pcr tests, but false negatives (when a person tests negative - not having the virus - but they are actually positive) are possible depending on swab type and time since symptoms started. the aim of this study is to determine how the likelihood of getting a false-negative test in patients with coronavirus is impacted by the time since symptoms started and the type of swab, a small piece of soft material sometimes on the end of a small stick. publicly available data from patients who received several rt-pcr tests and identified as positive for coronavirus are analyzed. the likelihood of a positive test decreased with the time passed since the start of symptoms. samples from the middle part of the throat are less likely to give a positive result than swabs from the throat and back of the nose. the chance of incorrectly identifying an uninfected person because of a false-negative is reduced if negative tests are repeated 24 hours later. for a small chance of a false-positive test (<0.5%), the true number of infected individuals is larger than the number of positive tests. for a higher chance of a false-positive test, the true number of infected individuals is smaller than the number of positive tests. in conclusion, the samples from the back of the nose called nasopharyngeal are more sensitive than the samples taken in the middle of the throat. the later an infected individual is tested after symptom start, the less likely they are to test positive. this finding may influence decisions on identifying infected patients, contact tracing, or disease tracking, and discharging or releasing recovering patients who are possibly still infectious and can transmit the virus."
"certain molecular tools called rt-pcr assays test for infection with the sars-cov-2 virus, which can cause a threatening breathing-related illness. rt-pcr tests are very specific and detecting a target when there is none (or a false positive) is low. however, not detecting a target when there is one (or a false negative) is possible depending on the swab and time since symptoms. the authors' aim is to determine the likelihood of a false-negative test in infected patients is affected by time since symptoms and swab type. the chance of detecting the target decreased with time since symptoms. also, oropharyngeal (op) or mouth samples are less likely to detect the target than nasopharyngeal (np) or nasal samples. the chance of incorrectly identifying an uninfected individual due to a false-negative test was reduced if tests showing no detection were repeated 24 hours later. for a small false-positive test chance (<0.5%), the true number of infected individuals was larger than the number of positive tests or tests detecting the target. for a higher false-positive test likelihood, the true number of infected individuals was smaller than the number of positive tests. np samples are more sensitive than op samples. the later an infected individual is tests after symptoms show, the less likely they are to test positive. time since symptoms has implifications for identifying infected patients, tracing spread, and releasing recovering patients who may still be infectious."
"in the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic, one potential cause of concern is that some discharged covid-19 patients are testing positive again for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) rna. to better understand what is happening and to provide public health policy planners and clinicians timely information, we have searched and reviewed published studies about discharged patients testing positive again for the sars-cov-2 rna. our search found 12 reports, all of which described patients in china. our review of these reports indicates the presence of discharged patients who remain asymptomatic but test positive. however, it is unclear whether they are contagious because a positive reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction (rt- pcr) test does not necessarily indicate the presence of replicating and transmissible virus. our review suggests the need for timely, parallel testing of different samples, including, for example, fecal specimens, from covid-19 patients before and after they are discharged from hospitals."
"in the current covid-19 pandemic, one possible cause for concern is that some covid-19 patients sent home from the hospital are testing positive again for (or have) coronavirus, which causes the respiratory lung infection of covid-19. to better understand what is happening and provide timely information to officials and doctors, researchers searched and reviewed completed studies about patients discharged or released from the hospital who test positive again for the coronavirus. the search found 12 reports, all of which described patients in china. the review of these reports suggests the presence of discharged patients who do not have any symptoms but test positive. however, it is unclear whether they are contagious because a positive test for genetic traces of the virus does not necessarily indicate the presence of replicating and transmissible virus. the review suggests the need for testing different samples at the same time, including, for example, fecal (poop) samples, from covid-19 patients before and after they are sent home from hospitals."
"many studies have shown that re-positive tests for sars-cov-2 by rt-pcr in recovered covid-19 patients are very common. we aim to conduct this review to summarize the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of these patients and discuss the potential explanations for recurrences, the contagiousness of re-detectable positive sars-cov-2 virus, and the management of covid-19 patients after discharge from hospital. the proportion of re-positive tests in discharged covid-19 patients varied from 2.4 to 69.2% and persisted from 1 to 38 days after discharge, depending on population size, age of patients, and type of specimens. currently, several causes of re-positive tests for sars-cov-2 in recovered covid-19 patients are suggested, including false-negative, false-positive rt-pcr tests; reactivation; and re-infection with sars-cov-2, but the mechanism leading to these re-positive cases is still unclear. the prevention of re-positive testing in discharged patients is a fundamental measure to control the spread of the pandemic. in order to reduce the percentage of false-negative tests prior to discharge, we recommend performing more than two tests, according to the standard sampling and microbiological assay protocol. in addition, specimens should be collected from multiple body parts if possible, to identify sars-cov-2 viral rna before discharge. further studies should be conducted to develop novel assays that target a crucial region of the rna genome in order to improve its sensitivity and specificity."
"many studies have shown that testing positive again for (or having) coronavirus in recovered covid-19 patients (patients recovered from the serious viral, lung infection of covid-19) is very common. this study aims to summarize medical and other key characteristics of these patients. the summary will discuss explanations for the return of the virus in recovered patients, how contagious people are after they have recovered from the virus but test positive again, and the care of covid-19 patients after going home from the hospital. the percentage who re-tested as positive in discharged covid-19 patients is between 2.4 to 69.2%. retesting as positive continued from 1 to 38 days after discharge, or release, from the hospital, depending on population size, age, and the type of samples used to test. currently, several causes of re-positive tests for coronavirus in recovered covid-19 patients are suggested, including incorrect negative or positive test results; reactivation (when someone appears to have recovered but still has traces of the virus in the body); and being re-infected with coronavirus, but the process leading to these re-positive tests is still unclear. preventing patients who have recovered and are sent home from testing positive again is an important step to control the spread of the pandemic. to limit the number of false-negatives tests (when a person tests negative but are actually positive for the virus) before being sent home, study researchers suggest doing more than 2 tests. in addition, samples should be collected from multiple body parts if possible, to identify coronavirus dna before discharge from the hospital. more studies should be done to develop new tests that target a crucial part of the genes from the virus in order to improve its accuracy."
"diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) cases is based on the count of real-time reverse transcription-plymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) positive people. viral load by real-time rt-pcr has been suggested as a biomarker of the sars-cov-2 infection. however, the association of viral load and severity of the disease is not yet resolved. nasopharyngeal samples from 458 patients were tested by rt-pcr for sars-cov-2 diagnosis. relative quantitation was made by the comparative threshold cycle (δδct ) formula between orf1ab viral and rnase p housekeeping genes. absolute viral load was calculate using a reference positive control. most prevalent clinical signs were cough (75.8%), myalgia (66.7%), and fever (48.5%). hypertension (18.2%), neurological diseases (15.1%), and asthma and hypothyroidism (12.1%) were most frequent comorbidities. fever, either as an exclusive symptom or combined with others, was associated with high viral loads ( 2−δδct range, 35.65-155.16; 4.25-4.89 log10 rna copies/test]). during the first week after onset of symptoms in mild patients up to 60 years-old was detected the peak of viral load. children under 10 years old have a high viral load (313.84; 2.50) in the first 2 days postinfection with a sharp decline thereafter. cases between 10 and 49 years old mostly showed low and moderate viral load during the first 2 days postinfection (range, 0.03 to 17.24; -1.50 to 1.24). patients over 60 years old have high viral load up to the second week after the onset of symptoms (range, 25.32-155.42; 1.40-2.19), indicating the longer presence of the virus in them. these findings suggest the viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs would help to monitor the sars-cov-2 infection in mild coronavirus disease 2019 cases."
"diagnosis of cases of coronavirus (a virus causing the lung infection known as covid-19) is based on the count of positive rt-pcr tests, a type of test that looks for traces of dna from the virus and signals positive if there is virus present. the amount of virus in the body, called the viral load, measured by the rt-pcr test is seen as an indication of coronavirus infection. however, the association of the amount of virus and the severity of the disease is not yet understood. samples from the back of the nose from 458 patients are tested by rt-pcr for coronavirus. additional tests are done to measure the viral load. the most common signs are cough, muscle aches and pains, and fever. high blood pressure, diseases affecting the brain and nerves, asthma, and hypothyroidism (not enough thyroid hormone in the body) were the most frequent conditions of other illnesses. fever, either as the only symptom or combined with others, is associated with high viral loads. during the first week after symptoms start in mild patients up to 60 years-old is the peak of viral load. children under 10 years old have a high viral load in the first 2 days post-infection followed by a sharp decline. cases between 10 and 49 years old mostly showed low and moderate viral load during the first 2 days after infection. patients over 60 years old have high viral load up to the second week after the start of symptoms, indicating the virus stays present in them longer. these findings suggest the viral load in swabs from the nose would help to monitor the coronavirus infection in mild coronavirus disease 2019 cases."
"detecting cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), which causes a breathing-related viral disease, is based on the count of people which a certain molecular test (real-time rt-pcr) detects. viral amount by real-time rt-pcr may be a signal of the sars-cov-2 infection. however, the link between viral amount and severity of the disease is unknown. nasal samples from 458 patients were tested by rt-pcr for sars-cov-2. most common symptoms were cough (75.8%), muscle pain (66.7%), and fever (48.5%). high blood pressure (18.2%), brain-related diseases (15.1%), and asthma and reduced thyroid function, which affects metabolism, (12.1%) were the most frequent associated conditions. fever, either alone or with other symptoms, was linked with a high virus amount. the peak of the virus amount was detected in the first week after symptoms started in mild patients up to 60 years-old. children under 10 years have a high virus amount in the first 2 days after infection with a sharp decline after. cases between 10 and 49 years mostly showed low to medium virus amount during the first 2 days after infection. patients over 60 years have a high virus amount up to the second week after symptoms start, indicating the longer presence of the virus in them. the virus amount in nasal swabs may help monitor the sars-cov-2 infection in cases of mild coronavirus disease 2019, a breathing-related viral disease."
"knowledge of the sensitivities of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) antibody tests beyond 35 days after the clinical onset of covid-19 is insufficient. we aimed to describe positivity rate of sars-cov-2 assays employing three different measurement principles over a prolonged period. two hundred sixty-eight samples from 180 symptomatic patients with covid-19 and a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) test followed by serological investigation of sars-cov-2 antibodies were included. we conducted three chemiluminescence (including electrochemiluminescence assay (eclia)), four enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa), and one lateral flow immunoassay (lfia) test formats. positivity rates, as well as positive (ppvs) and negative predictive values (npvs), were calculated for each week after the first clinical presentation for covid-19. furthermore, combinations of tests were assessed within an orthogonal testing approach employing two independent assays and predictive values were calculated. heat maps were constructed to graphically illustrate operational test characteristics. during a follow-up period of more than 9 weeks, chemiluminescence assays and one elisa igg test showed stable positivity rates after the third week. with the exception of eclia, the ppvs of the other chemiluminescence assays were ≥95% for covid-19 only after the second week. elisa and lfia had somewhat lower ppvs. igm exhibited insufficient predictive characteristics. an orthogonal testing approach provided ppvs ≥ 95% for patients with a moderate pretest probability (e.g., symptomatic patients), even for tests with a low single test performance. after the second week, npvs of all but igm assays were ≥95% for patients with low to moderate pretest probability. the confirmation of negative results using an orthogonal algorithm with another assay provided lower npvs than the single assays. when interpreting results from sars-cov-2 tests, the pretest probability, time of blood draw, and assay characteristics must be carefully considered. an orthogonal testing approach increases the accuracy of positive, but not negative, predictions."
"there is not enough information on how well tests for coronavirus (which causes covid-19 - a breathing-related illness) can correctly diagnose a positive case (which signals presence of the virus) beyond 35 days after the start of covid-19. this study aims to describe the percentage of positive coronavirus tests out of all tests, also called positivity rate, using three different measurements over a long period of time. researchers took 268 samples from 180 covid-19 patients with symptoms. these samples are tested using an rt-pcr test that finds traces of genetic material of the virus and a blood test to look for antibodies (proteins used by the immune system to fight infection). researchers used 3 electrochemiluminescence assay (eclia) test formats that can look for multiple types of antibodies in the blood, 4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) tests that test for antibodies for the coronavirus and can provide information about past exposure to covid-19, and 1 lateral flow immunoassay (lfia) test format that can detect active coronavirus. after the first clinical sign for covid-19 starts, the positivity rate and other measures to find the percentage of positive and negative (no virus) results in tests that are true positive, called positive predictive value, and true negative results, called negative predictive value, are calculated each week. combinations of tests are measured to better understand how the primary tests are working. maps are created to show how the different tests operate. during a follow-up period of more than 9 weeks, a type of eclia and one elisa antibody test showed stable positivity rates after the third week. except for eclia, the positive predictive value (percentage of positive tests that are true positives) of the other tests similar to eclia are ≥95% for covid-19 only after the second week. elisa and lfia have somewhat lower positive predictive values. the igm antibody that suggests a recent infection did not have enough information to do predictive calculations. an orthogonal testing approach is when a person who tests positive are tested again with a second test. orthogonal testing provided a positive predictive value of ≥ 95% for patients who probably had the disease (e.g., symptomatic patients). after the second week, negative predictive values (percentage of negative test results that are true negatives) of all but the igm antibody test are ≥95% for patients with a low or moderate chance of likely having the disease before being tested. when reading results from coronavirus tests, the estimate of the chance of having the disease before confirming with a test, the time that blood is drawn, and test characteristics must be considered. an orthogonal testing approach when a person with a positive results receives a second test increases the accuracy of positive, but not negative, predictions."
"the number of serological assays for sars-cov-2 has skyrocketed in the past year. concerns have been raised regarding their performance characteristics, depending on the disease severity and the time of the analysis post-symptom onset (pso). thus, independent validations using an unbiased sample selection are required for meaningful serology data interpretation. we aimed to assess the clinical performance of six commercially available assays, the seroconversion, and the dynamics of the humoral response to sars-cov-2 infection. the study included 528 serum samples from 156 patients with follow-up visits up to six months pso and 161 serum samples from healthy people. the igg/total antibodies positive percentage increased and remained above 95% after six months when chemiluminescent immunoassay (clia) igg antis1/s2 and electro-chemiluminescent assay (eclia) total antinp were used. at early time points pso, chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (cmia) igm antis achieved the best sensitivity. igm and igg appear simultaneously in most circumstances, and when performed in parallel the sensitivity increases. the severe and the moderate clinical forms were significantly associated with higher seropositivity percentage and antibody levels. high specificity was found in all evaluated assays, but the sensitivity was variable depending on the time pso, severity of disease, detection method and targeted antigen."
"the number of blood tests that check for antibodies (infection-fighting proteins) for the coronavirus (which causes covid-19, the lung infection) has skyrocketed in the past year. concerns have been raised on the performance of the tests, depending on the disease severity and the time of the test after symptoms start. therefore, confirming the performance of the test using an unbiased sample is required in order to understand and describe the antibody data. researchers aim to assess the performance of six available blood tests, the seroconversion (when the body starts producing antibodies), and how the body creates antibodies in response to coronavirus infection. the study included 528 blood samples from 156 patients with follow-up visits up to 6 months after the start of symptoms and 161 blood samples from healthy people. the total amount of antibodies increased and remained above 95% after six months when using certain tests to identify antibodies. at early times after the start of symptoms, a blood test that looks for certain antibodies that suggest recent infection has the best ability to correctly diagnose a positive (or virus-containing) case. two types of antibodies, igm and igg, appear at the same time in most circumstances, and when performed together, the ability to correctly diagnose a positive diagnosis increases. the severe and the moderate clinical forms have major associations with a higher number of positive tests and antibody levels. the ability to correctly have a negative (or no virus) test among negative people is found in all evaluated blood tests, but the ability to correctly diagnose a true positive varies depending on the time after the start of symptoms and the type of test."
"this study aimed to monitor severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) viral loads and specific serum-antibodies (immunoglobulin [ig] g and m) among confirmed patients and asymptomatic carriers from returning healthy travelers. the throat swabs, sputum, and stool samples from 57 hospitalized coronavirus disease (covid-19) patients and 8 asymptomatic carriers, among 170 returning healthy travelers were tested using reverse-transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction. sars-cov-2 igm/igg antibodies were detected via serum chemiluminescence assay. sequential results showed higher viral rna loads in the throat, sputum, and stool samples at 3-12 and 6-21 days after symptom onset among severely ill covid-19 patients. shorter viral habitation time (1-8 days) was observed in the oropharyngeal site and intestinal tract of asymptomatic carriers. the igg and igm response rates were 19/37 (51.4%) and 23/37 (62.6%) among the 29 confirmed patients and 8 asymptomatic carriers, respectively, within 66 days from symptom or detection onset. the median duration between symptom onset and positive igg and igm results was 30 (n=23; interquartile range [iqr]=20-66) and 23 (n=19; iqr=12-28) days, respectively. of 170 returning healthy-travelers to china, 4.7% were asymptomatic carriers (8/170) within 2 weeks, and the igg and igm positivity rate was 12.8% (12/94). igm/igg-positivity confirmed 3 suspected sars-cov-2 cases, despite negative results for sars-cov-2 rna. compared with other respiratory viral infectious diseases, covid-19 has fewer asymptomatic carriers, lower antibody response rates, and a longer antibody production duration in recovered patients and the contacted healthy population. this is an indication of the complexity of covid-19 transmission."
"this study aims to monitor the amount of coronavirus (which causes covid-19 - the breathing-related illness) in the blood, also called viral load, and the specific, infection-fighting proteins used by the immune system, called antibodies, among patients with coronavirus and healthy travelers who have the virus but no symptoms. samples from 57 hospitalized covid-19 patients and 8 asymptomatic carriers (people who have the virus but no symptoms) are tested. among seriously ill covid-19 patients, there is a higher viral load in the throat, sputum (lung), and stool samples at 3-12 and 6-21 days after symptoms start. among carriers with no symptoms, the viral load is found to stay for a shorter time period (1-8 days) in the throat and in the digestive system. antibodies to fight the viruses responded in 51.4% of confirmed patients and 62.6% among asymptomatic people within 66 days from symptom starting. the average time between the start of symptoms and positive (or detected) antibodies is 30 days for the igg antibody, and 23 days for the igm antibodies, which often suggest a recent infection. of 170 returning healthy-travelers to china, 4.7% were asymptomatic carriers within 2 weeks, and the positive result among them for the igg and igm antibodies is 12.8%. the igm/igg antibodies confirmed 3 suspected coronavirus cases, even though they tested negative for coronavirus using another test. when compared to other viruses that impact the lungs, covid-19 has fewer asymptotic carriers and has a lower antibody response. covid-19 also has a longer period of time developing antibodies in recovered patients. these findings highlight how complex transmission or spread is in covid-19."
"this study monitors virus amonts and naturally-created blood antibodies, which combat foreign viruses, of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), which causes a breathing-related viral disorder, among infected patients and carries without symptoms from returning healthy travelers. the throat swabs, mucus, and poop samples from 57 hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease (covid-19), caused by sars-cov-2, and 8 virus carries without symptoms, among 170 returning healthy travelers, were tested with a molecular tool. results show higher virus amount in throat, mucus, and stool samples at 3-12 and 6-21 days after symptoms first showed among severely ill covid-19 patients. shorter virus lifetime (1-8 days) was seen in the throat near the mount and digestive tract of carriers without symptoms. specific blood antibody detection rates were 18/37 (51.4%) and 23/37 (62.6%) among the 29 confirmed patients and 8 carriers without symptoms, respectively, within 66 days from start of symptoms or detection. average duration between start of symptoms and antibody results was 30 and 23 days, respectively. of the 170 returning healthy-travelers to china, 4.7% were infected showing no symptoms (8/170) within 2 weeks. antibdoy detection rate was 12.8% (12/94). antibody detection confirmed 3 suspected sars-cov-2 cases, despite other test results not detecting the virus. relative to other breathing-related viral infectious diseases, covid-19 has fewer carriers without symptoms, lower antibody response rates, and a longer antibody production duration in recovered and contacted healthy people. these results show the complexity of covid-19 spread."
"the introduction of technologically advanced methods of lithotripsy into medical practice changes the nature of postoperative complications. among them, the main complications are inflammatory infections. this largely determines the search for new, improved methods of stone fragmentation avoiding small stone fragments and dissemination of the pelvicalyceal system of the kidney with stone-associated infection. the authors have developed a method for controlled stone fragmentation using a continuous-wave diode laser with a hot-spot effect at the optical fiber end. the aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of controlled urinary stone fragmentation using a continuous-wave diode laser with a highly heated distal end of the optical fiber light guide as a method of preventing inflammatory infections in clinical practice. materials and methods: we analyzed 1666 case histories of urolithiasis patients who underwent percutaneous nephrolithotripsy/ nephrolithoextraction and contact ureterolithotripsy/ureteroextraction, we also performed a prospective analysis of complications based on the clavien-dindo classification in 90 patients who underwent fine fragmentation of stones with various lithotripters: ultrasonic, pneumatic, and holmium laser. the method of controlled stone fragmentation by a diode laser with a hot-spot effect was tested on postoperative samples of 26 renal calculi. for the first time in clinical practice, this method was tested in the bladder cavity (n=10). results: in the percutaneous nephrolithotripsy group, postoperative infectious and inflammatory complications occurred in 34.1% of cases, in the percutaneous nephrolithoextraction group - in 24.6%, in the contact ureterolithotripsy group - in 7.8%, in the ureterolithoextraction group - in 2.5%. the analysis made it possible to identify factors promoting the development of infectious and inflammatory complications. for the first time in clinical practice, there were successfully performed ten operations of stone fragmentation using a continuous-wave diode laser with a hot-spot effect. controlled coarse fragmentation of stones providing the possibility to reduce the number of infectious and inflammatory complications was performed in the bladder as a model for testing the method. conclusion: the method of laser-induced controlled coarse fragmentation of stones with a hot-spot effect, developed and tested in clinical practice, is promising for the prevention of infectious and inflammatory complications in patients with potentially infected stones since their fine fragmentation and, consequently, spread of stone-associated toxins and microflora within the urinary system is avoided."
"introducing lithotripsy, a non-surgical method to break masses like kidney stones into pieces, into medical practice changes the type of complications that may occur after operations. the main complications are inflammatory infections that may result in pain, redness, or swelling. new and improved methods of breaking down stones, avoiding small stone fragments and sending them through the kidneys to be released through urine are searched. the authors develop a method to break stones using a continuous-wave diode laser, which is a constant stream of laser light that can also reduce the scattering of stones by using a hot-spot or energy-focused effect. the aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of controlling the fragmenting of urinary stones (hard masses of minerals in the bladder), using a continuous-wave diode laser as a method of preventing inflammatory infections. researchers analyzed 1666 cases of patients with kidney stones who underwent different methods to remove kidney stones. these methods include percutaneous nephrolithotripsy/nephrolithoextraction (removal of stones by a small incision through the skin and stones pulled out of the incision) and ureterolithotripsy/ureteroextraction (when a flexible tube is inserted through the bladder and the ureter which connects the kidneys and bladder and stones are found with a camera and removed). an additional analysis on 90 patients is also done on patients with stones that were fragmented into tiny pieces using different lithotripters, non-surgical devices that crush stones using shock waves. the method of controlled stone fragmentation by a diode laser with a hot-spot effect is tested on samples of 26 kidney stones during or after operations. for the first time in clinical practice, this method is tested in the bladder (with 10 patients). in the group that underwent a small incision to remove the stone, infections and inflammation complications after the procedure occurred in 34.1% of cases. in the group that had stones removed from the incision (nephrolithoextraction) had complications in 24.6%, and in the ureterolithotripsy group where a tube and camera are used, there are 7.8% cases with complications. in the ureterolithoextraction group, there are complications in 2.5%. the analysis makes it possible to find things that lead to the development of infectious or inflammatory complications. for the first time, there are successfully performed ten operations of stone fragmentation using a continuous-wave diode laser with a hot-spot effect. controlling the scattering of fragments of stones makes it possible to reduce the number of infectious and inflammatory complications and is done in the bladder as an example for testing this method. in conclusion, using a laser to control fragmented stones with the hot spot effect is a promising way to prevent infection and inflammation complications in patients with possibly infected stones since small pieces of stones and their spread within the urinary system is avoided."
"new advanced technology for breaking up stones in the kidney and the tube to the bladder changes the nature of issues after operation. among them, the main issues are inflammatory infections. this influences the search for new, improved ways of breaking up stones to avoid small fragments and spreading stone-associated infection in the kidney and bladder system. we have created a method for controlled breaking up of stones with a special laser with a hot-spot at one end. this study evaluates the effectiveness of controlled breaking up of stones in urine using a special laser with a hot-spot at one end to prevent inflammatory infections in clinics. we analyzed 1666 patient cases of patients with kidney stones who had operations to remove the stones in the kidney and urine. we also analyzed any complications in 90 patients who had treatment with various devices to break up stones: sound waves, pressurized air, and lasers. the method of controlled breaking up of stones with a special laser with a hot-spot was tested on 26 kidney stone samples collected after surgery. for the first time in clinical practice, this method was tested in the hole in the bladder of 10 patients. in the group that had a small cut to remove kidney stones, infections and inflammatory issues after surgery occured in 34.1% of cases. in the group that had a cut and small tube to remove stones, infections and issues occured in 24.6%. in the group that had a small cut to remove stones in the urine, infections and issues occured in 7.8%. in the group that had a cut and tube to remove stones, infections and issues occured in 2.5%. the analysis helped identify factors that promoted infectious and inflammatory issues. for the first time in clinical practice, there were 10 successful operations of breaking up stones with a special laser with a hot-spot. controlled breaking up of stones, which may reduce the number of infectious and inflammatory effects, was done in the bladder to test the method. the method of using a laser with a hot-spot to break up stones, developed and tested in clinical practice, may prevent infectious and inflammatory effects in patients with possibly infected stones since their previous stone fragmentation. this method may also prevent spread of stone-associated toxins and bacteria in the urinary system."
"introduction: we determine the effect of patient characteristics (age, sex, and body mass index bmi) and stone characteristics (density, location, and size) by non-contrast computed tomography of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (ct-kub) in predicting the success of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (eswl) in the treatment of kidney and ureteric stones. we present this study to further enrich the knowledge of physicians towards the effect of different patient characteristics upon predicting extra-corporal shock wave lithotripsy success rates. methods: we evaluated 155 patients who received eswl for renal and ureteric stone measuring 3-20 mm (mm), over a 3-month period. the stone size in millimeters, density in hounsfield units (hu) and its location was determined on pre-treatment ct-kub. eswl was successful if post-treatment residual renal stone fragments were ≤3 mm and for ureteric stones should be totally cleared. results: the overall success of eswl treatment was observed in 65.8% of the 155 patients. there was no significant difference seen when the effect of patients age, sex and bmi were studied with eswl outcome with p values were 0.155, 0.101 and 0.415 respectively. also, stone location either in the kidney or ureter has no statistically significant effect on eswl response rate. while stone density and size determined on ct kub have statistically significant effect on the success rate of eswl with a p-value of 0.002 and 0.000 respectively. conclusions: this study shows that determination of stone density and stone size on ct kub pre eswl can help to predict the outcome of eswl. we propose that stone density <500 hu and stone size < 5 mm are highly likely to result in successful eswl."
"extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (eswl) is a procedure to break up stones in the body by using shock waves and an x-ray to target the stones. researchers search for the effects of patient characteristics (age, sex, and body mass index or bmi) and stone characteristics (density, location, and size) on how successful eswl procedure is on stones in the kidneys, ureters (tubes that carry urine from the kidney to the urinary bladder), and bladder. this study is intended to increase the knowledge of doctors on the effect of different patient characteristics on predicting how successful using extra-corporal shock wave lithotripsy is. researchers evaluate 155 patients who receive eswl for stones in the kidney and ureter (tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder) over a 3-month period. the stone size in millimeters (mm), density, and its location is determined using an x-ray scan before patients received treatment. eswl is considered to be successful if the size of remaining kidney stone fragments after the procedure are ≤3 mm and if ureteric stones are totally cleared. the overall success of eswl treatment was observed in 65.8% of the 155 patients. there is no major difference seen when the effect of age, sex, and bmi of patients are studied with eswl outcomes. also, stone location either in the kidney or ureter (the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder) has no statistically significant effect (not likely to happen randomly or by chance) on the success of eswl. stone density and size based on the scanned images have a statistically significant effect on the success rate of eswl. in conclusion, this study shows that finding out the density and size of stones using a scanned x-ray image before extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (eswl) can help predict the outcome of eswl. researchers of this study suggest that low stone density and size are highly likely to result in successful eswl."
"introduction: although spinal anesthesia (sa) may reduce postoperative morbidity, most urologists perform flexible ureterorenoscopy (furs) under general anesthesia (ga). the objective of our study is to provide technical details, results, complications, and patients' satisfaction with furs performed under exclusive sa. methods: we analyzed all consecutive furs performed under sa to treat renal stones from march 2011 to february 2017. details of technique, operative time, outcomes, need for further treatments, complications, and patients' satisfaction were evaluated. results: two hundred thirty-four furs under sa were considered. sa was performed through l2-l3 vertebral interspace in 64.1%. patients were discharged the same day of surgery. mean stone burden was 13.5 ± 6.6 mm and mean operative time 76.9 ± 34.6 min. single-procedure sfr was 69.7%. further treatments were performed in 22.8%. 96.6% had no anesthesia-related complications. no clavien-dindo grade ≥ iiib complications were noticed. 99.6% of patients were satisfied with sa. no cases of conversion from sa to ga occurred. conclusion: furs can be performed safely and efficiently under sa, taking into account a few details of the technique. patients' satisfaction with sa is very high, and complications are rare. although sa is usually adopted in unfit patients for ga, it may be considered as a viable alternative in fit patients."
"spinal anesthesia (sa) are medicines that numbs the back of patients to reduce pain after surgery. however, most urologists (doctors who specialize in conditions of the urinary or urine-related tract) use general anesthesia that puts a patient into a heavy sleep when doing a flexible ureterorenoscopy (furs), a procedure that uses a telescope, and occasionally a laser, to break stones in the kidney into pieces. the objective of this study is to provide technical details, results, complications, and patients' satisfaction with furs when performed under only spinal anesthesia to numb only parts of the body. researchers analyzed all flexible ureterorenoscopy (furs) done under spinal anesthesia to treat kidney stones from march 2011 to february 2017. details of the technique, how long the procedure takes, results, need for additional treatments, complications, and patients' satisfaction are evaluated. there are 234 furs procedures done under spinal anesthesia considered. sa was done in a certain area of the lower spine in 64.1%. patients are sent home the same day of surgery. the average stone burden was 13.5 millimeters (± 6.6 millimeters), and the average procedure time is 76.9 minutes ( ± 34.6 minutes). the percentage of patients who are stone free after one procedure is 69.7%. additional treatments are done in 22.8% of patients. overall, 96.6% had no anesthesia-related complications. no complications that required general anesthesia or other major complications are noticed. 99.6% of patients are satisfied with spinal anesthesia. no cases of changing from spinal anesthesia to general anesthesia occurred. in conclusion, flexible ureterorenoscopy (furs)can be performed safely and efficiently under spinal anesthesia when accounting for a few details of the procedure. patients' satisfaction with spinal anesthesia is very high, and complications are rare. although spinal anesthesia is usually used in unfit patients for general anesthesia, it may be considered as a good alternative in fit patients."
"the mini percutaneous nephrolithotomy (mini-pcnl) has become a versatile tool to remove kidney stones >2 cm, lower pole stones >1 cm, renal stones previously unresponsive to shockwave therapy or inaccessible by ureteroscopy (within a caliceal diverticulum), stones within complex urinary tracts (urinary diversions, transplanted kidney, and horseshoe kidneys), and large impacted proximal ureteral stones. after positioning in either the supine or prone position, a cystoscopy is performed to place an open-ended catheter, occlusion balloon, or accordian device into the collecting system. a foley catheter is placed in the bladder. an ultrasound with a curvilinear probe is used to survey the kidney and guide access into the collecting system with an 18 g percutaneous needle. once access is obtained, a small 0.5 cm skin incision is made and the percutaneous tract is dilated over a wire. a 16.5f metallic or self-dilating suctioning access sheath is positioned with fluoroscopic guidance. a 12f rigid mini-pcnl nephroscope is used to evaluate the collecting system. once a calculus is observed, options for stone fragmentation include a lithotripter with ultrasonic and ballistic energy, or laser lithotripsy using holmium or thulium laser fibers. flexible ureteroscopy can be considered to ensure clearance of the collecting system. a 6f ureteral stent can be placed in either a retrograde or antegrade approach for drainage. the tract is sealed using surgiflo hemostatic matrix with thrombin. guidelines for postoperative care and troubleshooting techniques for mini-pcnl are reviewed along with the surgical steps in the accompanying video (supplementary video s1). there are few randomized trials comparing mini-pcnl with standard pcnl and ureteroscopy. there is some evidence to suggest a difference in transfusion rates comparing mini- and standard pcnl, as well as differences in stone-free rates when comparing mini-pcnl with ureteroscopy for the treatment of lower pole stones."
"mini percutaneous nephrolithotomy (mini-pcnl) is when a doctor makes a small incision in the patient and uses a small camera to help remove kidney stones. the mini-pncl has become a useful tool to remove kidney stones of different sizes, stones that did not respond to other treatments, and it can also remove stones in the urinary tract, the body's drainage system to remove urine. when lying either flat on the back (supine position) or on the stomach and face down (prone position), a hollow tube with a lens is inserted into the urethra tube that goes to bladder to allow another device such as a catheter (a clean tube that goes into the bladder) into the collecting system which is the series of tubes and ducts of the kidney. a foley catheter (soft tube that is inserted into your bladder to drain urine) is placed in the bladder. an ultrasound (a technology that uses sound waves to take images of the inside the body) is used to look at the kidney and guide access to the collecting system with a needle. once access is obtained, a small incision (cut) on the skin is made, and the tract through the skin is increased in size. a device called a suctioning access sheath is positioned to act like a vacuum and absorb fragments. a mini-pcnl nephroscope (telescope with camera) is used to evaluate the collecting system. once the kidney stone is seen, options to break it up include a machine that pulverizes stones with shock waves or ballistic energy, or a laser is used to break up kidney stones. a flexible tube can be used to ensure removal from the collecting system. a thin, flexible tube that holds ureters (tubes that carry urine from the kidney to the urinary bladder) open called a stent can be used for drainage. the tract is sealed. guidelines for care after the procedure and for troubleshooting techniques for mini-pcnl are reviewed along with the surgical steps in an available video. there are few clinical trials comparing mini percutaneous nephrolithotomy (mini-pncl) with standard percutaneous nephrolithotomy and ureteroscopy, a procedure where a small telescope is inserted through the urethra and bladder and up the ureter tube to where the stone is located. there is some evidence to suggest a difference in those needing blood transfusions or transfers when comparing mini- and standard pcnl, as well as differences in stone-free rates when comparing mini-pcnl with ureteroscopy for the treatment of lower pole stones, common kidney stones that are unlikely to pass on their own."
"mini percutaneous nephrolithotomy (mini-pcnl) is a tool to remove a variety of stones including: large kidney stones > 2 cm, lower kidney stones > 1 cm, kidney stones unaffected by shockwaves or surgical extraction, stones in complex tubes transporting urine, and large, unchanged stones causing inflammation in tubes carrying urine. after lying down, an open-ended tube to collect urine, device to collect stone fragments, or device to block escape of stone framgents is inserted into the urine tube. a thin tube is placed in the bladder to drain pee. guided sound waves are used to explore the kidney and reach the urine-collecting system with an 18 g surgical needle. once access is obtained, a small 0.5 cm skin cut is made and the opening is enlarged with wires. a metallic or self-enlarging vacuum is placed with x-ray guidance. a rigid, small tube with a lens is used to explore the urine-collecting system. once a stone is observed, options for breaking it up include using a device with sound waves and bullet energy, or special laser. using a tube with a scope can ensure full removal from the urine-collecting system. a tube to keep the urine flowing can be placed against or with urine flow for drainage. the opening is sealed with a special surgical sealant. the accompanying video (supplementary video s1) shows guidelines for care after surgery and troubleshooting techniques for mini-pcnl along with the actual surgery. there are a few trials comparing mini-pcnl with the standard treatment option. there may be a difference in urine transfer rates between mini- and standard pcnl. there may also be differences in stone-free rates between mini-pcnl and the standard treatment of lower kidney stones."
"background: this study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy (mpcnl) versus standard percutaneous nephrolithotomy in patients with renal and upper ureteric stones. methods: we conducted a pooled analysis on randomized controlled trials (rcts). the eligible rcts were selected from the following databases: medline, embase, web of science, and the cochrane library. the reference lists of retrieved studies were also investigated. results: our analysis included 10 rcts with 1612 patients. pooled data from 10 rcts revealed the following: stone-free rate (odds ratio = 1.46, 95% confidence interval (ci) [1.12,1.88], p = .004), operative time (mean difference [md] = 4.10, 95% ci [-1.37,9.56], p = .14), length of hospital stay (md = -15.31, 95% ci [-29.43,-1.19], p = .03), hemoglobin decrease (md = -0.86, 95% ci [-1.19,-0.53], p < .00001), postoperative fever (md = 0.83, 95% ci [0.49,1.40], p = .49), and urine leakage (md = 0.59, 95% ci [0.25,1.37], p = .22). besides, we performed sub-group analysis based on vacuum suction effect and multiple kidney stones. for vacuum suction effect, it revealed the following: stone-free rate in vacuum suction group (p = .007) and in non-vacuum suction group (p = .19). operative time in vacuum suction group (p = .89), non-vacuum suction group (p = .16). postoperative fever in vacuum suction group (p = .49), non-vacuum suction group (p = .85). conclusion: this pooled analysis indicated that mpcnl was a safe and effective method for treating renal stones compared with standard percutaneous nephrolithotomy. besides, the vacuum suction effect in mpcnl played a more important role. when it comes to multiple or staghorn stones, the longer operative time in mpcnl could not be ignored."
"this study aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy (mpcnl), when a doctor makes a small incision in the patient and uses a scope to remove kidney stones versus the standard percutaneous nephrolithotomy that uses a larger instrument to remove stones. researchers analyze data from published clinical trials. eligible trials are from the following databases: medline, embase, web of science, and the cochrane library. the articles of these clinical trials included a list of other existing studies that are also reviewed. the analysis includes 10 trials with 1612 patients. the data gathered and analyzed from the 10 trials found revealed information on the following: stone-free rate, how long the procedures take, length of hospital stay, red blood cells decrease, fever after the procedure, and urine leakage. researchers also analyzed additional data on the effects of vacuum suction (vacuuming up stone fragments) and multiple kidney stones. for vacuum suction effect, it reveals a difference in the stone-free rate in the vacuum suction group but not in the non-vacuum suction group. there is no significant difference in how long the procedure took between the vacuum suction group and the non-vacuum suction group. there is no significant difference in having a fever after the procedure between the vacuum suction group and the non-vacuum suction group. in conclusion, this analysis suggests that minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy (mpcnl) is a safe and effective method for treating kidney stones compared with the standard percutaneous nephrolithotomy process. additionally, the vacuum suction effect in mpcnl played a more important role. when it comes to multiple or staghorn (larger) stones, the longer procedure time in mpcnl could not be ignored."
"mini-percutaneous nephrolithotomy (m-pcnl) and retrograde intrarenal surgery (rirs) are commonly used methods in treatment of kidney stones. the aim of our study is to compare the efficacy and safety of m-pcnl and rirs in kidney stone treatment over 50 years old patients. a total of 125 patients, 65 of whom had rirs, and 60 of whom had m-pcnl, were included in the study. age, gender, bmi (body-mass index), asa (american society of anesthesiology) scores of the patients; stone size, stone location, operation side, eswl history, hu (hounsfield unit) values, hospital stay durations, sfr, complication rates according to clavien modification system, postoperative hemoglobin loss, postoperative transfusion rates, and patients who needed a secondary operation were recorded. sfr values were calculated in the postoperative third and sixth months. the data between the two groups had similar characteristics in terms of age, gender, bmi, hu, stone size, operation side, stone location, eswl history, operation time, postoperative transfusion rate, postoperative clavien complications (p > 0.05). when the asa categories were evaluated, the mean asa scores, asa i, and asa ii data had similar characteristics in both groups (p > 0.05). when the asa 3 scores were evaluated, the number of asa iii patients in the rirs group was statistically significantly higher (p < 0.05). when hospital stay duration and postoperative hemoglobin loss were examined, rirs group was found to be advantageous (p < 0.05). postoperative third month sfr and postoperative sixth month values were statistically significantly higher in m-pcnl group (p < 0.05). m-pcnl and rirs are methods that can be used safely and effectively over 50 years old patients in kidney stone surgery. m-pcnl has been found to be more advantageous in terms of sfr rates and as it requires less secondary intervention. rirs is advantageous in terms of short hospital stay, postoperative hemoglobin loss, and applicability to patients who are not suitable for the prone position."
"two common ways to treat kidney stones are: the mini-percutaneous nephrolithotomy (m-pcnl), which is when a doctor makes a small incision in the patient and uses a scope to remove kidney stones, and retrograde intrarenal surgery (rirs), a procedure that uses a laser and a viewing tube to remove kidney stones and does not make an external incision. the aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of m-pcnl and rirs in kidney stone treatment in patients over 50 years old. a total of 125 patients, 65 who had rirs, and 60 who had m-pcnl, are included in the study. age, gender, bmi (body-mass index), asa (american society of anesthesiology) scores of the patients; stone size, stone location, operation side, having extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy or eswl procedure in the past, hu (hounsfield unit) values to measure the density of stones, length of hospital stays, stone-free rates, complication rates, blood loss after the procedure, transfusions needed after the procedure, and patients who needed a second operation are recorded. stone-free rates are calculated 3 months and 6 months after the procedure. the data between the rirs and m-pcnl groups have similar characteristics in age, gender, bmi, hu, stone size, operation side, stone location, eswl history, operation time, transfusion rates needed after the procedure, and complications after the procedure. when the asa categories are evaluated to determine the risk of surgery before the procedure, the average asa scores, asa i, and asa ii data had similar characteristics in both groups. when the asa 3 scores are evaluated, the number of asa iii patients in the rirs group is statistically significantly (the result is unlikely to be random or by chance) higher. when hospital stay duration and blood loss after surgery are examined, the rirs group is found to be beneficial. the stone-free rate at the 3rd and 6th months after surgery are statistically significantly higher in the m-pcnl group. m-pcnl and rirs are methods that can be used safely and effectively in patients over 50 years old who need kidney stone surgery. m-pcnl is found to be more advantageous in terms of stone-free rates, and it requires less secondary interventions, such as a second procedure. rirs is beneficial in terms of short hospital stays, blood loss after surgery, and applicability to patients who are not suitable for the prone position when patients are face down on the stomach."
"renal stones pose a significant burden on the health care system. the prevalence of renal stones has increased from 3.8% in 1970 to 8.8% in 2010 in the united states, with annual healthcare costs of usd 3.8 billion. it is estimated that more than half a million people a year visit the emergency room for kidney stone problems. the most common presenting symptoms include hematuria, pain in the flank, groin, or abdomen. there are many treatment modalities available for managing renal stones. they range from completely non-invasive outpatient procedures to invasive procedures requiring hospital admission and increased risks of complications. extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (eswl) is a truly non-invasive procedure as opposed to other surgical treatments used, such as retrograde intrarenal surgery (rirs) and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (pcnl). the efficacy of eswl lies in its ability to pulverize calculi in vivo into smaller segments, which are them expelled spontaneously by the boy. shockwaves are generated and are then focused on a point within the body. the shockwaves propagate through the body with minimal dissipation of energy (and therefore damage) due to minimal difference in density of the soft tissues. at the stone fluid interface, a relatively significant difference in density, combined with a large concentration of multiple shockwaves in a small area, produces a significant dissipation of energy. through the different mechanisms, this energy can overcome the tensile strength of the stone resulting in fragmentation. repetition of this process leads to the pulverization of the stone into small fragments that the body then can pass painlessly and spontaneously."
"kidney stones are a major burden on the health care system. the number of kidney stones has increased from 3.8% in 1970 to 8.8% in 2010 in the united states, and yearly healthcare costs are at $3.8 billion. it is estimated that more than half a million people a year visit the emergency room for kidney stone problems. the most common symptoms include blood in the urine, pain in the back and sides, groin, or stomach area (abdomen). there are many treatment methods available for managing kidney stones. these options range from non-invasive (non-surgical) outpatient procedures that do not require hospital stays to invasive (surgical) procedures requiring staying in the hospital and an increased risk of complications. extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (eswl) is a truly non-invasive procedure as opposed to other surgical treatments used, such as retrograde intrarenal surgery (rirs) and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (pcnl) that require an incision into the skin. eswl is effective because it can crush stones inside the body into smaller parts, which are then released from the body when going to the bathroom. shockwaves are generated and focused on a point within the body. the shockwaves go through the body with little damage to surrounding tissues. when the stone changes, there is a big difference in the density of the stone which may produce a larger reach of energy due to a lot of shockwaves in a small area of the body. this energy can overpower the strength of the stone, resulting in breaking the stone into smaller parts. repeating this process leads to the pulverizing of the stone into small fragments that the body can then pass through the body with no pain."
"kidney stones are a major burden on health care. the proportion of cases of kidney stones has increased from 3.8% in 1970 to 8.8% in 2010 in the united states, with yearly healthcare costs of 3.8 billion us dollars. more than half a million people a year visit the emergency room for kidney stone issues. the most common symptoms are blood in the urine and pain at or near the abdomen. there are many treatment options for kidney stones. they range from non-surgical away-from-hospital treatments to surgical procedures needing hospital care and increased risks of side effects. extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (eswl), or kidney stone removal with shockwaves, is a truly non-srugical procedure compared to other surgical treatments like kidney surgery with a camera tube and making a small skin cut to remove stones. the success of eswl comes from pulverizing stones into small stones, which are removed naturally by the body. shockwaves are created and focused on a point in the body. the shockwaves spread through the body with minimal loss of energy (and therefore damage) due to small density or hardness differences of the surrounding body parts. at the boundary between the stone and body fluid, a large difference in hardness, along with many shockwaves in one area, creates a large burst of energy. via different mechanisms, this energy can break up the stone. repeating this process pulverzies the stone into small fragments that the body can remove painlessly and naturally."
"background percutaneous nephrolithotomy (pcnl) is the first choice treatment of renal stones larger than 2 cm. we aimed to evaluate if lasers perform as equal as non-laser devices in patients with kidney stones candidate to pcnl. materials and methods a comprehensive literature search was performed in medline via pubmed, scopus and cochrane central register of controlled trials (central) to assess the differences in the perioperative course, incidence of postoperative complications, and stone free-rate (sfr) in patients with kidney stones undergoing laser versus non-laser pcnl in randomized studies. the incidences of complications were pooled using the cochran-mantel-haenszel method with the random effect model and expressed as risk ratios (rr), 95% confidence intervals (ci), and p-values. surgical time and length of stay were pooled using the inverse variance of the mean difference (md) with a random effect, 95% ci, and p-values. analyses were two-tailed, with a significance set at p ≤0.05. results six papers including 732 patients (311 patients undergoing holmium laser and 421 non-laser pcnl) were included in meta-analysis. surgical time and postoperative stay were shorter in the non-laser group (md:11.14, 95% ci:2.32-19.96, p=0.002; md:-0.81, 95%ci:-2.18-0.57 p=0.25, respectively). sfr was significantly higher in the non-laser group (rr:1.08, 95% ci:1.01-1.15, p=0.03). patients undergoing laser pcnl had a non-significant higher risk of postoperative fever >38°c (rr:0.64, 95%ci: .31-1.30, p=0.22). transfusion rate did not differ between the two groups (rr:1.02, 95% ci:0.50-2.11 p=0.95). the need for stent positioning due to urine extravasation was higher risk in the laser group but the difference did not reach significance (rr:0.49, 95% ci:0.17-1.41 p=0.19). conclusions non-laser pcnl showed better perioperative outcomes and sfr as compared to holmium laser pcnl."
"percutaneous nephrolithotomy (pcnl) is a procedure that involves making an incision in the skin, inserting a tube to reach the stone, breaking it up into small pieces - sometimes using a laser, and removing it from the body. pcnl is the first choice treatment of kidney stones larger than 2 cm. this study aims to evaluate if lasers perform as well as non-laser devices in patients with kidney stones. researchers searched published studies to find the differences in the preparation before or during surgery, the number of complications after surgery, and the stone-free rate (patients that no longer have stone or stone fragments) in patients with kidney stones who had either laser or non-laser pcnl. the number of complications are pooled together and analyzed. how long the procedure takes and length of stay at the hospital or doctor office are also analyzed. six papers including 732 patients (311 patients underwent the procedure with a laser pcnl and 421 with a non-laser pcnl) are included in the analysis. surgical time and post-operation stay were shorter in the non-laser group. the stone free rate is significantly higher in the non-laser group. patients undergoing laser pcnl had a slightly higher risk of a fever >100.4°f after the procedure. the need for a blood transfusion (transfer) is not different between the laser and non-laser group. there is a higher need in the laser group for a thin tube called a stent to be placed in the body to help drain urine, but it is not a major difference between the two groups on needing a stent. in conclusion, non-laser percutaneous nephrolithotomy (pcnl) shows better surgical outcomes and a better stone free rate when compared to the laser pcnl."
"the primary goals of medical expulsive therapy are to increase the rate of stone expulsion along the ureter to avoid ureteral obstruction and reduce ureteral colic and thus avoid the need for surgical and more invasive interventions. this review focussed on the findings from in vivo and in vitro animal and human studies that have investigated the pharmacological mechanisms controlling ureteral motility and their translation to current and potentially new clinically used drugs for increasing the rate of stone expulsion along the ureter. the complicated contractility profile of the ureter, which alters with age, tissue segment region, orientation and species contributes to the difficulty of interpreting studies on ureteral pharmacology, which translates to the complexity of discovering ideal drug targets for medical expulsive therapy. nevertheless, the current drug classes clinically used for patients with stone lodgement include α1 -adrenoceptor antagonists, calcium channel blockers and nsaids, whilst there are promising targets for drug development that require further clinical investigations including the phosphodiesterase type 5 enzyme, β-adrenoceptors and 5-ht receptors."
"medical expulsive therapy uses medication to relax certain muscles in the body to release small kidney stones. the main goals of medical expulsive therapy are to increase stone release along the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder called the ureter to avoid obstruction, reduce pain, and avoid the need for surgical and other procedures. this review focuses on the findings from animal and human studies that investigate the ways drugs work in the ureter and how drugs may potentially help release stones from the body. how the ureter tube, that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder, is able to contract changes over time and makes interpreting results from studies on drugs difficult and, therefore, hard to find the best drugs for medical explusive therapy. however, the current types of drugs used for patients with stones include α1 -adrenoceptor antagonists and calcium channel blockers, that can increase the size of the urinary tube to allow stones to pass, as well as nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (nsaids) for pain. there are promising drugs under development for study."
"the landscape of managing ureteric stones has evolved over the last few decades and several treatment options exist depending on the stone size, location, and other patient and stone factors. while open surgery is now rarely performed, the use of medical expulsive therapy (met) has been controversial and perhaps only recommended for large distal ureteric stones. the mainstay treatment balances between shockwave lithotripsy (swl) and ureteroscopy (urs), with the latter usually recommended for larger stones. while the principles of ureteric stone management have remained largely unchanged, the modern era has generated new methods and means to deliver it. advancements have occurred in all domains of endourology to try and refine treatment and balance it with cost, patient choice and quality of life. dissemination of technologies and demonstration of their efficacy and safety will eventually result in new recommendations among international guidelines and evolution of new gold standards."

"treating kidney stones in urine tubes has changed over the last few decades. many treatments exist depending on stone size, location, and other factors. while large-cut surgery is rarely performed, drug treatment for removing stones is controversial and perhaps only recommended for large stones away from the kidney. main treatments include using shockwaves or a flexible telescope to help remove kidney stones, with the latter usually recommended for larger stones. while the general idea of how to manage kidney stones has remain largely unchanged, the modern era has made new treatments to do so. advances have occured in all areas of treating the urinary system. these advances try to improve treatment while balancing cost, patient choice, and quality of life. spreading these technologies and demonstrating their success and safety will lead to new recommendations for international guidelines and new standard treatments."
"eight types of short-chain lys acylations have recently been identified on histones: propionylation, butyrylation, 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation, succinylation, malonylation, glutarylation, crotonylation and β-hydroxybutyrylation. emerging evidence suggests that these histone modifications affect gene expression and are structurally and functionally different from the widely studied histone lys acetylation. in this review, we discuss the regulation of non-acetyl histone acylation by enzymatic and metabolic mechanisms, the acylation 'reader' proteins that mediate the effects of different acylations and their physiological functions, which include signal-dependent gene activation, spermatogenesis, tissue injury and metabolic stress. we propose a model to explain our present understanding of how differential histone acylation is regulated by the metabolism of the different acyl-coa forms, which in turn modulates the regulation of gene expression."
"acylations are parts of molecules that help groups of atoms called acyl groups connect to compounds in the body. eight acylations are recently identified on histones, which are proteins that provide structural support to a chromosome (dna) and sometimes act as the spool that the thread-like dna wraps around. these 8 types are called propionylation, butyrylation, 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation, succinylation, malonylation, glutarylation, crotonylation and β-hydroxybutyrylation. new evidence suggests that these histone changes affect how information from genes are used to build proteins or other molecules. these histones are also built different and have different functions from other common histones. in this review, researchers discuss how some histones are regulated in the body and how some acylation proteins bring about the effects of other acylations and their functions. researchers develop a model to explain their understanding of how different histone acylations is regulated by metabolism (digestion) of other enzymes, which then adjust the regulation of genes."
"over time, the knowledge on the role of histones has significantly changed. initially, histones were only known as dna packaging proteins but later, it was discovered that they act extracellularly as powerful antimicrobial agents and also as potentially self-detrimental agents. indeed, histones were found to be the most abundant proteins within neutrophil extracellular traps what ultimately highlighted their microbicidal function. in addition, extracellular histones proved to be involved in triggering exacerbated inflammatory and coagulation responses, depending on the cell type affected. consequently, several investigations were conducted towards studying the potential of histones and their derivatives as either biomarkers or therapeutic target candidates in different diseases in which inflammation and thrombosis have a key pathophysiological role, such as sepsis, thrombosis and different types of cancer. the main objective of this review is to summarize and discuss the current state of the art with regard to both beneficial and harmful roles of histones and also their possible use as biomarkers and therapeutic targets."
"histones are proteins that provide structural support to a chromosome and sometimes act as the spool that the thread-like dna wraps around. over time, the knowledge on the role of histones has significantly changed. at first, histones were only known as dna packaging proteins, but later it was discovered that they act outside of cells as a powerful antimicrobial, an agent that can kill microorganisms or stop their growth. they may also be self-destructive agents. histones were found to be the most abundant proteins within neutrophil extracellular traps (net like structures that protect against infection) and highlighted their microbicidal function that kills microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria, and viruses. also, histones outside of cells proved to be involved in triggering worsening inflammatory (the body's natural reaction against injury and infection) and blood clotting responses, depending on the cell type affected. because of this, several investigations were conducted to study the potential of histones and the substances they may produce as either a sign of a normal or abnormal process in the body (biomarkers or signalers of normal or abnormal processes) or possible ways to use them to fight different diseases. the main objective of this review is to summarize and discuss the most up to date and advanced information on the beneficial and harmful roles of histones and also their possible use as biomarkers and treatments."
"histones are known for their ability to bind to and regulate expression of dna. however, histones are also present in cytoplasm and extracellular fluids where they serve host defense functions and promote inflammatory responses. histones are a major component of neutrophil extracellular traps that contribute to bacterial killing but also to inflammatory injury. histones can act as antimicrobial peptides and directly kill bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses, in vitro and in a variety of animal hosts. in addition, histones can trigger inflammatory responses in some cases acting through toll-like receptors or inflammasome pathways. extracellular histones mediate organ injury (lung, liver), sepsis physiology, thrombocytopenia and thrombin generation and some proteins can bind histones and reduce these potentially harmful effects"
"histones proteins are known for their ability to attach to and regulate how instructions and information from dna are used to build proteins or other molecules. however, histones are also present inside and outside cells where they help protect cells and promote inflammatory responses, the body's natural responses to disease or injury. histones are a major part of neutrophil extracellular traps (net like structures that protect against infection) that contribute to killing bacteria but also to inflammatory injury. histones can also directly kill bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses, outside the body in lab experiments and in a variety of animals. in addition, histones can trigger inflammatory responses in some cases acting through receptors (target sites) on cells or other receptors and sensors that are part of the immune system. histones outside cells help address organ injury (lung or liver) and the process of sepsis which occurs when the body's response to an infection damages its own tissues. it also helps with low blood platelet counts that help the immune system and blood clotting."
"histones are proteins that bind to and influence dna expression. however, histones are also located both inside and outside the cell away from dna to defend the host and promote inflammation. histones help certain immune cells kill bacteria but also lead to injury from inflammation. histones can also directly kill microorganisms like bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses inside and outside the host body. also, histones can trigger inflammation by contacting certain target sites or pathways. histones outside of cell influence organ injury (lung, liver), sepsis (life-threatening self-attack from immune cells due to an infection), low count of blood platelet (which help make blood clots), and blood clot generation. some proteins can bind and block these possibly harmful actions of histones."
"background: the oncogenic role of histone mutations is one of the most relevant discovery in cancer epigenetics. recurrent mutations targeting histone genes have been described in pediatric brain tumors, chondroblastoma, giant cell tumor of bone and other tumor types. the demonstration that mutant histones can be oncogenic and drive the tumorigenesis in pediatric tumors, led to the coining of the term ""oncohistones."" the first identified histone mutations were localized at or near residues normally targeted by post-translational modifications (ptms) in the histone n-terminal tails and suggested a possible interference with histone ptms regulation and reading. main body: in this review, we describe the peculiar organization of the multiple genes that encode histone proteins, and the latter advances in both the identification and the biological role of histone mutations in cancer. recent works show that recurrent somatic mutations target both n-terminal tails and globular histone fold domain in diverse tumor types. oncohistones are often dominant-negative and occur at higher frequencies in tumors affecting children and adolescents. notably, in many cases the mutations target selectively only some of the genes coding the same histone protein and are frequently associated with specific tumor types or, as documented for histone variant h3.3 in pediatric glioma, with peculiar tumors arising from specific anatomic locations. conclusion: the overview of the most recent advances suggests that the oncogenic potential of histone mutations can be exerted, together with the alteration of histone ptms, through the destabilization of nucleosome and dna-nucleosome interactions, as well as through the disruption of higher-order chromatin structure. however, further studies are necessary to fully elucidate the mechanism of action of oncohistones, as well as to evaluate their possible application to cancer classification, prognosis and to the identification of new therapies."
"the cancer or tumor causing role of changes to histone proteins is one of the most important discoveries in cancer research. histones are proteins that provide structural support to a chromosome and sometimes act as the spool that the thread-like dna wraps around. recurring mutations (changes) that target histone genes are described in brain tumors in children, in a rare type of noncancerous bone tumor that begins in cartilage chondroblastoma (noncancerous bone tumors in cartilage), and in giant tumors of bones and other types of tumors. the finding that mutant histones can cause cancer and tumors, also called oncogenic, and drive development of tumors in children lead to the new term ""onchohistones"". in this review, researchers describe the organization of the multiple genes that build histone proteins and the role of histone mutations in cancer. recent works show that recurring mutations during pregnancy target both n-terminal (nitrogen-containing) tails that are on histones and interact with dna and the central part of the histone that folds in different types of tumors. oncohistones (the mutant histones that can cause tumors) often occur more in tumors affecting children and adolescents. notably, in many cases, the mutations target only some of the genes that interact with histone proteins and are frequently associated with specific tumor types or with tumors that come from specific locations. in conclusion, the overview of recent advances suggests that it's possible histones mutation can form cancer or tumors. however, further studies are necessary to fully describe the process of histone proteins that may cause cancer (oncohistones), as well as to evaluate how they might influence cancer classification, the course of the disease, and the identification of new treatments."
"extracellular histones released from injured or dying cells following trauma and other severe insults can act as potent damage-associated molecular patterns. in fact, elevated levels of histones are present in human circulation in hyperinflammatory states such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis. the molecular mechanisms owing to histone-induced pathologies are at the very beginning of elucidating. however, neutralization of histones with antibodies, histone-binding or histone-degrading proteins, and heparan sulfates have shown promising therapeutic effects in pre-clinical acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis models. various cell types undergoing necrosis and apoptosis or activated neutrophils forming neutrophil extracellular traps have been implicated in excessive release of histones which further augments tissue injury and may culminate in multiple organ failure. at the molecular level, an uncontrolled inflammatory cascade has been considered as the major event; however, histone-activated coagulation and thrombosis represent additional pathologic events reflecting coagulopathy. furthermore, epigenetic regulation and chemical modifications of circulating histones appear to be critically important in their biological functions as evidenced by increased cytotoxicity associated with citrullinated histone. herein, we will briefly review the current knowledge on the role of histones in acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis, and discuss the future potential of anti-histone therapy for treatment of these life-threatening disorders."
"histones are proteins that provide structural support to a chromosome and sometimes act as the spool that the thread-like dna wraps around. histones that are released from injured or dying cells and remain outside of cells can lead to damaged molecules. in fact, there are high levels of histones in humans during hyperinflammatory states, when the immune system goes into overdrive, such as acute respiratory or breathing-related distress or sepsis, which occurs when the body's response to an infection damages its own tissues. understanding this process of changes in molecules because of histones is just starting. however, making histones ineffective with antibodies (infection-fighting proteins), histones that attach to or break down proteins, and certain carbohydrate (sugar-containing) molecules that regulate functions of blood vessel walls have shown promising treatment effects in computer models of acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis. various cell types that are dying or are activated in the neutrophil extracellular traps (net like structures that protect against infection) are likely involved in too many histones being released which can worsen tissue injury and may result in multiple organ failure. an uncontrolled inflammation response is considered as the major event; however, blood clotting or scabbing because of histones are new events showing a bleeding disorder. also, regulating how the environment can cause changes that affect the way genes work and chemical changes of histones appear to be very important in their functions. in this paper, researchers review the current knowledge of the role of histones in acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis, and discuss potential anti-histone treatment of these life-threatening disorders."
"linker histones are major players in chromatin organization and per se are essential players in genome homeostasis. as the fifth class of histone proteins the linker histones not only interact with dna and core histones but also with other chromatin proteins. these interactions prove to be essential for the higher levels of chromatin organization like chromatin loops, transcription factories and chromosome territories. our recent results have proved that saccharomyces cerevisiae linker histone - hho1p, physically interacts with the actin-related protein 4 (arp4) and that the abrogation of this interaction through the deletion of the gene for the linker histone in arp4 mutant cells leads to global changes in chromatin compaction. here, we show that the healthy interaction between the yeast linker histone and arp4p is critical for maintaining genome stability and for controlling cellular sensitivity to different types of stress. the abolished interaction between the linker histone and arp4p leads the mutant yeast cells to premature ageing phenotypes. cells die young and are more sensitive to stress. these results unambiguously prove the role of linker histones and chromatin remodelling in ageing by their cooperation in pertaining higher-order chromatin compaction and thus maintaining genome stability."
"histones are proteins that provide structural support to a chromosome and sometimes act as the spool that the thread-like dna wraps around. linker histones play a major role in organizing dna and proteins to create the nucleus (genetic material) inside cells (a process called chromatin organization) and are key players in balancing the genome, which is an organism's complete set of genetic instructions. linker histones not only interact with dna and other histones but also with other chromatin (dna-attached) proteins. these interactions prove to be very important for the higher levels of chromatin organization. recent results find that one linker histone, called hho1p, physically interacts with another protein (arp4) and that the removal of this interaction by deleting the gene for the linker histone leads to many changes in the physical folding of dna structures (a process called chromatin compaction). here, researchers show that the healthy interaction between the yeast linker histone and arp4p is critical for keeping the genome stable and for controlling how sensitive cells are to different types of stress. the interaction that stopped between the linker histone and arp4p leads the changed yeast cells to start aging early. cells die young and are more sensitive to stress. these results prove the role of linker histones and chromatin changes in aging cells through their cooperation in chromatin compaction (folding of dna structure) and thus maintaining genome stability."
"linker histones are major proteins for organizing dna and affect the balance of genes. as the fifth type of histone proteins, the linker histones not only work with dna and other histones but also other proteins that bind to dna. these interactions organize certain dna regions like dna loops, dna expression sites, and nucleus regions with specific dna segments. our recent results show that a specific histone - hho1p - of brewer's yeast physically interacts with another protein called actin-related protein 4 (arp4). removing this interaction via deletion of the gene for the linker histone in arp4 mutant cells leads to global change in dna binding. we show that healthy interaction between the yeast linker histone and arp4p is needed for dna stability and controlling cellular sensitity to different forms of stress. the removed link between the linker histone and arp4p leads the mutant yeast cells to premature aging. cells die young and are more sensitive to stress. these results show the role of linker histones and dna-protein remodeling in aging by their role in dna binding and maintaining dna stability."
"the linker histones (h1, h1 zero, h5, etc.) and a group of abundant non-histone chromosomal proteins (hmg1/2) bind to linker dna in chromatin and exhibit both generalized and specific effects on gene transcription. the two classes of proteins share many features of dna binding behaviour, although they are structurally unrelated. while the linker histones and hmg1/2 exhibit direct competition in binding to such structures as four-way junction dna, whether they compete for binding to the nucleosome has not been investigated. the possibility for either opposite or synergistic effects on gene regulation must be considered at this point."
"linker histones are proteins that play a major role in organizing dna and proteins to create the nucleus (chamber holding the dna) inside cells and how instructions from genes are used. linker histones, and non-histone proteins called hmg1/2, can have an effect on making a copy of a gene. the two types of proteins attach to dna is similar ways, although they are different in how they structured. whether linker histones and non-histone proteins compete for binding (attaching) to the nucleosome (a section of dna that is wrapped around a core of proteins) has not been investigated. the possibility for either opposite or cooperative effects on regulating genes must be considered at this point."
"histones constitute the chief protein component of dna. they help to maintain chromatin structure and regulate gene expression. the long double-stranded dna molecule winds around histone octamers to form nucleosomes which serve the purpose of compacting dna within the confines of the nuclear membrane. there are five major types of histones, namely h1/h5, h2, h3 and h4. h3.3 is a subtype of h3 histone and can be encoded either by the h3f3a or h3f3b genes independently. amino acids such as lysine and arginine found in the histone tails are sites of post-translational modifications (ptms) such as methylation and acetylation. these ptms in histones are involved in the regulation of gene expression by chromatin remodelling and by controlling dna methylation patterns. mutations in histone genes can affect sites of ptms causing changes in local and global dna methylation status. these effects are directly linked to neoplastic transformation by altered gene expression. recurrent h3.3 histone mutations are increasingly identified in several malignancies and developmental disorders. the following review attempts to shed light on the diseases associated with h3.3 histone mutations."
"histones make up the chief protein part of dna. they help to maintain the structure of chromatin, which helps package the dna in a compact form so it fits in the cell nucleus (chamber holding the dna in a cell), and regulate how the instructions from genes are used. the long double-stranded dna molecule winds around a group of histone proteins to form a structure called nucleosomes. nucleosomes compact dna within the cell wall. there are five major types of histones, namely h1/h5, h2, h3 and h4. h3.3 is a subtype of h3 histone and can be encoded (given instructions on how to structure it) either by the h3f3a or h3f3b genes independently. molecules that combine to build proteins are called amino acids. some are found in the histone tails and are sites of changes to the properties and make-up of proteins, a process called post-translational modifications (ptms). these changes in histones are involved in regulating how genetic information is used from genes. mutations (changes) in histone genes can affect sites of ptms, causing changes in how genes can be silenced or slowed. these effects are directly linked to changes in cells by altered genes. ongoing changes in h3.3 histone are increasingly identified in several illnesses and developmental disorders. this review attempts to shed light on the diseases associated with h3.3 histone mutations."
"chistone posttranslational modifications (ptms) are essential for regulating chromatin and maintaining gene expression throughout cell differentiation. despite the deep level of understanding of immunophenotypic differentiation pathways in hematopoietic cells, few studies have investigated global levels of histone ptms required for differentiation and maintenance of these distinct cell types. here, we describe an approach to couple fluorescence-activated cell sorting (facs) with targeted mass spectrometry to define global ""epi-proteomic"" signatures for primary leukocytes. facs was used to sort closely and distantly related leukocytes from normal human peripheral blood for quantitation of histone ptms with a multiple reaction monitoring lc-ms/ms method measuring histone ptms on histones h3 and h4. we validate cell sorting directly into h2so4 for immediate histone extraction to decrease time and number of steps after facs to analyze histone ptms. relative histone ptm levels vary in t cells across healthy donors, and the majority of ptms remain stable up to 2 days following initial blood draw. large differences in the levels of histone ptms are observed across the mature lymphoid and myeloid lineages, as well as between different types within the same lineage, though no differences are observed in closely related t cell subtypes. the results show a streamlined approach for quantifying global changes in histone ptms in cell types separated by facs that is poised for clinical deployment."

"background: while the genomes of eukaryotes and archaea both encode the histone-fold domain, only eukaryotes encode the core histone paralogs h2a, h2b, h3, and h4. with dna, these core histones assemble into the nucleosomal octamer underlying eukaryotic chromatin. importantly, core histones for h2a and h3 are maintained as neofunctionalized paralogs adapted for general bulk chromatin (canonical h2 and h3) or specialized chromatin (h2a. z enriched at gene promoters and cenh3s enriched at centromeres). in this context, the identification of core histone-like ""doublets"" in the cytoplasmic replication factories of the marseilleviridae (mv) is a novel finding with possible relevance to understanding the origin of eukaryotic chromatin. here, we analyze and compare the core histone doublet genes from all known mv genomes as well as other mv genes relevant to the origin of the eukaryotic replisome. results: using different phylogenetic approaches, we show that mv histone domains encode obligate h2b-h2a and h4-h3 dimers of possible proto-eukaryotic origin. mv core histone moieties form sister clades to each of the four eukaryotic clades of canonical and variant core histones. this suggests that mv core histone moieties diverged prior to eukaryotic neofunctionalizations associated with paired linear chromosomes and variant histone octamer assembly. we also show that mv genomes encode a proto-eukaryotic dna topoisomerase ii enzyme that forms a sister clade to eukaryotes. this is a relevant finding given that dna topo ii influences histone deposition and chromatin compaction and is the second most abundant nuclear protein after histones. conclusions: the combined domain architecture and phylogenomic analyses presented here suggest that a primitive origin for mv histone genes is a more parsimonious explanation than horizontal gene transfers + gene fusions + sufficient divergence to eliminate relatedness to eukaryotic neofunctionalizations within the h2a and h3 clades without loss of relatedness to each of the four core histone clades. we thus suggest mv histone doublet genes and their dna topo ii gene possibly were acquired from an organism with a chromatinized replisome that diverged prior to the origin of eukaryotic core histone variants for h2/h2a.z and h3/cen h3. these results also imply that core histones were utilized ancestrally in viral dna compaction and/or protection from host endonucleases."
"eukaryotes are cells commonly identified by having a nucleus (chamber to hold dna). eukaryotes provide genetic instructions to the following histone proteins that are similar but not identical: h2a, h2b, h3, and h4. histones are proteins that provide structural support to a chromosome and sometimes act as the spool that the thread-like dna wraps around. with dna, these core histones come together into the basic structural unit of dna packaging called the nucleosomal octamer. importantly, histones for h2a and h3 are maintained as genes that develop a new function and are applied for chromatin, a substance within a chromosome made up of dna and protein. in this context, the identification of core histone-like genes in the fluid that fills cells in marseilleviridae viruses is a new finding with possible importance to understanding the origin of eukaryotic chromatin. this study analyzes and compares core histone-like genes from the genes of all known marseilleviridae viruses, as well as other marseilleviridae genes relevant to the beginning of the eukaryotic dna replication machine. using different approaches, researchers show that marseilleviridae histone provide genetic information to h2b-h2a and h4-h3 structures. marseilleviridae core histones form similar copies to each of the four eukaryotic histone groups. this suggests that parts of the marseilleviridae core histone changed before eukaryotes changed functions. researchers also show that marseilleviridae genes provide information to other enzymes that form organisms similar to eukaryotes. this is a relevant finding given that dna unwinding enzymes influences histone structure and the folding of dna and is the second most abundant nuclear protein after histones. in conclusion, an early origin for marseilleviridae histone genes is a more limited explanation than gene transfers + gene fusions + enough changes to remove relatedness to eukaryotic changes in functions within the h2a and h3. it is suggested that marseilleviridae histone genes and their dna genes are possibly taken from an organism that can replicate dna that diverged before the beginning of eukaryotic core histone types for h2/h2a.z and h3/cen h3. these results also imply that core histones are used in viral dna folding and/or protection from viral-degrading, host enzymes called endonucleases."
"while dna of multi-celled and some one-celled organisms both encode a specific dna-binding region, only multi-celled organisms encode the core proteins that dna wraps around (core histones). with dna, these core histones assemble into an 8-piece in the nucleus that binds dna in multi-celled organisms. importantly, certain core histones are kept as proteins capable of general-purpose or region-specific dna-binding proteins. in this context, identifying core histone-like ""duplicates"" in the replication factories for the virus marseilleviridae (mv) is a new finding with usefuleness to understanding the origin of chromosomes in multi-celled organisms (eukaryotes). here, we analyze the core histone duplicate genes from all known mv genes and other mv genes related to the origin of the dna replication site for multi-celled organisms. with different evolutionary approaches, we show that specific mv dna-binding areas encode necessary histones of possible pre-eukaryotic origin. mv core histones form similar groups to each of the four eukaryotic groups of known and variant core histones. mv core histone groups may have divered before eukaryotic duplicate genes gained new functions (neofunctionalization) associated with paired linear chromosomes and variable histone group assembly. we also show that mv genes encode a pre-eukaryotic dna replication enzyme that forms a sister group to eukaryotes. this is a useful finding since these dna replication enzymes affect histone settlement and dna compaction and is the second most common nuclear protein after histones. the combined region architecture and evolutionary analyses shown here suggest a primitive origin for mv histone genes is a tighter explanation than gene transfers + fusions + mutations to eliminate relatedenss to eukaryotic neofunctionalizations within histone groups without loss of relatedness to each of the four core histone sister groups. we thus suggest that mv histone doublet genes and their dna replication gene were possible obtained from an organism with a specific dna replication site that diverged before the origin of eukaryotic core histone variation. core histones may have been used before in viral dna compaction and protection from host proteins."
"therapeutic success in treating patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) is limited by the multivariate disease etiology, multi-organ presentation, systemic involvement, and complex immunopathogenesis. agents targeting b-cell differentiation and survival are not efficacious for all patients, indicating a need to target other inflammatory mediators. one such target is the type i interferon pathway. type i interferons upregulate interferon gene signatures and mediate critical antiviral responses. dysregulated type i interferon signaling is detectable in many patients with sle and other autoimmune diseases, and the extent of this dysregulation is associated with disease severity, making type i interferons therapeutically tangible targets. the recent approval of the type i interferon-blocking antibody, anifrolumab, by the us food and drug administration for the treatment of patients with sle demonstrates the value of targeting this pathway. nevertheless, the interferon pathway has pleiotropic biology, with multiple cellular targets and signaling components that are incompletely understood. deconvoluting the complexity of the type i interferon pathway and its intersection with lupus disease pathology will be valuable for further development of targeted sle therapeutics. this review summarizes the immune mediators of the interferon pathway, its association with disease pathogenesis, and therapeutic modalities targeting the dysregulated interferon pathway."
"successfully treating patients with systematic lupus erythematosus (lupus - when your immune system attacks healthy cells) is limited by the different causes, its presence in multiple organs and systems, and a complex immune response. treatments that target certain inflammatory (infection-fighting) processes in the body may be needed for some patients. one such target is the type i interferon pathway, a specific immune system pathway. type i interferons increase the production of interferon genes (genes that allow communication between cells to activate the immune system) and brings about critical immune responses to fight viruses. problems with the signaling in type i interferons are found in patients with lupus, and the extent of the problem is connected to how serious the disease is, making type i interferons possible targets for treatment. the recent approval of the type i interferon-blocking antibody medicine, anifrolumab, by the us food and drug administration for treating patients with lupus shows the value of targeting this pathway. nevertheless, the interferon pathway has multiple cells and signaling parts that are not completely understood. understanding the type i interferon pathway and how it relates to lupus will be valuable for future development of lupus treatments. this review summarizes the immune process of the interferon pathway, its association with disease development, and therapeutic methods that target problems interferon pathway."
"treatment success for patients with full-body or systemic lupus erythematosus (sle), an inflammatory disease in which immune cells mistakely attack joints, skin, brain cells and more, is limited by muti-factor disease causes, multi-organ damage, full-body effect, and complex causes for immune cell dysfunction. treatment targeting creation and survival of antibody-creating immune cells are not effective for all patients, indicating a need to target other inflammatory groups. one target group is the type i interferon pathway, a cellular signaling pathway that affects the entire immune system. type i interferons increase the amount of certain signaling proteins and influence important antiviral responses. impaired type i interferon signaling is detectable in many with sle and similar diseases. the extent of this impairment is linked with disease severity, making type i interferons a possible treatment target. the recent approval of the type i interferon blocking molcule or antibody, anifrolumab, by a government agency for treating sle demonstrates the value of targeting this pathway. still, the interferon pathway affects multiple targets and signaling pathways that are incompletely understood. understanding the complex type i interferon pathway and its influence on lupus disease will be valuable for further development of targeted sle treatments. this review summarizes the immune middlemen of the interferon pathway, its link with disease creation, and treatments targeting the pathway when it is impaired."
"as treatment options in advanced systematic lupus erythematosus (sle) are limited, there is an urgent need for new and effective therapeutic alternatives for selected cases with severe disease. bortezomib (btz) is a specific, reversible, inhibitor of the 20s subunit of the proteasome. herein, we report clinical experience regarding efficacy and safety from all patients receiving btz as therapy for sle in sweden during the years 2014-2020. 8 females and 4 males were included with a mean disease duration at btz initiation of 8.8 years (range 0.7-20 years). renal involvement was the main target for btz. reduction of global disease activity was recorded by decreasing sledai-2k scores over time and remained significantly reduced at the 6-month (p=0.007) and the 12-month (p=0.008) follow-up visits. from btz initiation, complement protein 3 (c3) levels increased significantly after the 2nd treatment cycle (p=0.05), the 6-month (p=0.03) and the 12-month (p=0.04) follow-up visits. the urine albumin/creatinine ratio declined over time and reached significance at the 6-month (p=0.008) and the 12-month follow-up visits (p=0.004). seroconversion of anti-dsdna (27%), anti-c1q (50%) and anti-sm (67%) was observed. 6 of 12 patients experienced at least one side-effect during follow-up, whereof the most common adverse events were infections. safety parameters (c-reactive protein, blood cell counts) mainly remained stable over time. to conclude, we report favorable therapeutic effects of btz used in combination with corticosteroids in a majority of patients with severe sle manifestations irresponsive to conventional immunosuppressive agents. reduction of proteinuria was observed over time as well as seroconversion of some autoantibody specificities. in most patients, tolerance was acceptable but mild adverse events was not uncommon. special attention should be paid to infections and hypogammaglobinemia."

"systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) is a chronic autoimmune disease. although previous studies have demonstrated that sle is related to the imbalance of cells in the immune system, including b cells, t cells, and dendritic cells, etc., the mechanisms underlying sle pathogenesis remain unclear. therefore, effective and low side-effect therapies for sle are lacking. recently, mesenchymal stem cell (msc) therapy for autoimmune diseases, particularly sle, has gained increasing attention. this therapy can improve the signs and symptoms of refractory sle by promoting the proliferation of th2 and treg cells and inhibiting the activity of th1, th17, and b cells, etc. however, msc therapy is also reported ineffective in some patients with sle, which may be related to msc- or patient-derived factors. therefore, the therapeutic effects of mscs should be further confirmed. this review summarizes the status of msc therapy in refractory sle treatment and potential reasons for the ineffectiveness of msc therapy from three perspectives. we propose various msc modification methods that may be beneficial in enhancing the immunosuppression of mscs in sle. however, their safety and protective effects in patients with sle still need to be confirmed by further experimental and clinical evidence."

"significance: metformin has been proposed as a treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus (sle). the primary target of metformin, the electron transport chain complex i in the mitochondria, is associated with redox homeostasis in immune cells, which plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. this review addresses the evidence and knowledge gaps on whether a beneficial effect of metformin in lupus may be due to a restoration of a balanced redox state. recent advances: clinical trials in sle patients with mild to moderate disease activity and preclinical studies in mice have provided encouraging results for metformin. the mechanism by which this therapeutic effect was achieved is largely unknown. metformin regulates redox homeostasis in a context-specific manner. multiple cell types contribute to sle, with evidence of increased mitochondrial oxidative stress in t cells and neutrophils. critical issues: the major knowledge gaps are whether the efficacy of metformin is linked to a restored redox homeostasis in the immune system, and if it does, in which cell types it occurs? we also need to know which patients may have a better response to metformin, and whether it corresponds to a specific mechanism? finally, the identification of biomarkers to predict treatment outcomes would be of great value."

"metformin, an anti-diabetic medication, may treat full-body or systemic lupus erythematosus (sle), an inflammatory disease in which immune cells mistakely attack joints, skin, brain cells and more. the primary target of metformin, a specific energy-generator in the cell, is linked with electrical balance in immune cells, which influence the creation of diseases in which immune cells mistakely attack healthy cells. this article reviews the evidence and knowledge gaps on whether metformin's beneficial effects in lupus may be due to a restored, balanced electrical state. clinical trials in sle patients with mild to moderate disease severity and mice studies show encouraging results for metformin. how this beneficial effect is achieved is largely unknown. metformin monitors electrical balance depending on the situation. multiple cell types contribute to sle, with evidence of increased cellular stress in certain immune cells called t cells and neutrophils. the major knowledge gaps are whether the success of metformin is linked to a restored electrical balance in the immune system. if it does, in which cell types it occurs? we also need to know which patients may have a better response to metformin, and if it corresponds to a specfic biological process? finally, identifying markers to predict treatment outcomes would be very useful."
"introduction: low-dose interleukin-2 (il-2) selectively restores disturbances of regulatory t cells (treg) and conventional t cells, resulting in the induction of remission in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. however, to date no research has been carried out on the efficacy of low-dose il-2 in the treatment of refractory lupus nephritis (ln). the aim of the study reported here was to investigate the renal response to low-dose il-2 in patients with refractory ln. methods: the study population comprised ten patients with refractory ln who failed to achieve complete response or who had relapsed while being treated with at least two conventional immunosuppressive agents. one treatment cycle consisted of il-2 at a dose of 1 million iu administered subcutaneously every other day for 2 weeks followed by a 2-week break. all patients received three cycles of il-2 and were then followed up for another 12 weeks without any increase in the dose of previous immunosuppressive agents and steroids. results: of the ten patients enrolled in the study, seven (70%) achieved ≥ 50% improvement in proteinuria at 12 weeks after initiating treatment with il-2. median proteinuria was significantly reduced by 50.3% at week 12, from 1.83 (interquartile range [iqr] 1.23-3.21) g/24 h at baseline to 0.91 (iqr 0.52-1.60) g/24 h at 12 weeks (p = 0.005). this was accompanied by a 71% reduction in urine erythrocytes, from 64/µl (iqr 24-102/µl) at baseline to 18/µl (iqr 2-20/µl) at 12 weeks (p = 0.018). anti-ds dna was decreased from 27.9 (iqr 7.6-40.28) iu/ml at baseline to 14.1 (iqr 7.3-20.12) iu/ml (p = 0.021) at week 12, while complements c3 and c4 were slightly increased (p = 0.445, p = 0.241, respectively). a significant expansion of treg cells, from 9.3% at baseline to 16.6% at 12 weeks, was also found (p < 0.05). no serious adverse events occurred during the treatment period. conclusions: low-dose il-2 therapy may have a promising role in the treatment of refractory ln as an alternative and safe therapeutic approach. it may be used as multi-target combination therapy in clinical practice."
"interleukin-2 (il-2) is a type of protein that promotes and develops immune cells at the start of an immune response and keeps them alive. a low-dose of interleukin-2 can restore changes of immune cells called t cells and treg cells, resulting in the start of remission (recovery) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus - when your immune system attacks healthy cells). however, to date, no research has been carried out on the effectiveness of low-dose il-2 in the treatment of lupus nephritis, a type of kidney disease caused by lupus. the aim of this study is to investigate the kidney response to low-dose il-2 in patients with lupus nephritis that is not responding to standard treatment. the study includes 10 patients with lupus nephritis who failed to achieve a complete response to standard treatment or who improved and then worsened while being treated with at least two standard treatments. one treatment cycle consists of il-2 given by an injection every other day for 2 weeks followed by a 2-week break. all patients receive three cycles of il-2 and are then followed up for another 12 weeks without any increase in the dose of the previous treatments or steroids. of the 10 patients enrolled in the study, 7 (70%) achieved 50% or more improvement in proteinuria (elevated levels of protein in the urine) at 12 weeks after starting il-2 treatment. average proteinuria is significantly reduced by 50.3% at week 12. there is also a 71% decrease in red blood cells in urine at 12 weeks. an antibody (infection-fighting molecule) associated with lupus called anti-ds dna decreased from the start of the study to week 12, while protein complements c3 and c4 used to monitor the immune systems are slightly increased. a significant expansion of the immune treg cells, from 9.3% at the start of the study to 16.6% at 12 weeks, is also found. no serious negative events occurred while patients receive the treatment. in conclusion, low-dose il-2 therapy may have a promising role in the treatment of refractory lupus nephritis as an alternative and safe treatment approach. low-dose il-2 may be used in combination with other medicines in clinical practice."
"objective: randomised trials of type i anti-cd20 antibodies rituximab and ocrelizumab failed to show benefit in proliferative lupus nephritis (ln). we compared obinutuzumab, a humanised type ii anti-cd20 monoclonal antibody that induces potent b-cell depletion, with placebo for the treatment of ln in combination with standard therapies. methods: patients with ln receiving mycophenolate and corticosteroids were randomised to obinutuzumab 1000 mg or placebo on day 1 and weeks 2, 24 and 26, and followed through week 104. the primary endpoint was complete renal response (crr) at week 52. exploratory analyses through week 104 were conducted. the prespecified alpha level was 0.2. results: a total of 125 patients were randomised and received blinded infusions. achievement of crr was greater with obinutuzumab at week 52 (primary endpoint, 22 (35%) vs 14 (23%) with placebo; percentage difference, 12% (95% ci -3.4% to 28%), p=0.115) and at week 104 (26 (41%) vs 14 (23%); percentage difference, 19% (95% ci 2.7% to 35%), p=0.026). improvements in other renal response measures, serologies, estimated glomerular filtration rate and proteinuria were greater with obinutuzumab. obinutuzumab was not associated with increases in serious adverse events, serious infections or deaths. non-serious infusion-related reactions occurred more frequently with obinutuzumab. conclusions: improved renal responses through week 104 were observed in patients with ln who received obinutuzumab plus standard therapies compared with standard therapies alone. obinutuzumab was well tolerated and no new safety signals were identified."
"clinical trials studying the infection-fighting antibodies called rituximab and ocrelizumab failed to show benefit in severe cases of lupus nephritis, a kidney disease caused by lupus (when your immune system attacks healthy cells). obinutuzumab is an antibody that reduces b-cells, a type of protein that produces antibodies but also associated with diseases such as lupus. researchers compared obinutuzumab with a placebo (inactive substance that looks like a medicine) for the treatment of lupus nephritis in combination with standard therapies. patients with lupus nephritis receiving standard treatments such as steroids are randomly put in a group to either receive obinutuzumab or a placebo. the drug or placebo are given on day 1 and weeks 2, 24 and 26, and followed through week 104. the main result is complete kidney response at week 52. additional analyses through week 104 are also done. a total of 125 patients are randomly placed into either the obinutuzumab or the placebo group and did not know which group they are in. achievement of complete kidney response is greater with obinutuzumab at week 52 and at week 104. improvements in other kidney and blood tests are greater with obinutuzumab. obinutuzumab is not associated with increases in serious negative events, serious infections or deaths. reactions related to the infusion (injection) occurred more frequently with obinutuzumab but are not serious reactions. in conclusion, improved kidney responses through week 104 are observed in patients with lupus nephritis who received obinutuzumab plus standard treatment compared with standard treatments alone. patients were able to tolerate side effects of obinutuzumab, and no new safety issues were identified."

"objectives: level of βhcg and the presence of any uterine mass of hydatidiform mole need a careful review or monitoring in order to prevent metastasis, provide an early treatment and avoid unnecessary chemotherapy. case presentation: a 36-year old fifth gravida patient who had a missed abortion was diagnosed as having a molar pregnancy with beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (βhcg) level of 509,921 iu/l. her lung field was clear and she underwent suction and curettage (s & c) procedure. however, after six weeks, aa presented to the emergency department with a massive bleeding, although her βhcg level had decreased to 65,770 iu/l. a trans-abdominal ultrasound indicated the presence of an intra-uterine mass (3.0 × 4.4 cm). nevertheless, her βhcg continued to show a declining trend (8,426 iu/l). aa was advised to undergo a chemotherapy but she refused, citing preference for alternative medicine like herbs instead. she opted for an ""at own risk"" (aor) discharge with scheduled follow up. subsequently, her condition improved with her βhcg showing a downward trend. surprisingly, at six months post s & c, her βhcg ameliorated to 0 iu/l with no mass detected by ultrasound. conclusions: brucea javanica fruits, pereskia bleo and annona muricata leaves can potentially be useful alternatives to chemotherapy and need further studies."
"level of βhcg (a pregnancy hormone) and the presence of any uterine (womb) mass of hydatidiform mole (a cluster of fluid filled sacs) need a careful review or monitoring. these measures are to prevent metastasis (spreading of the cancer to other organs), provide an early treatment, and avoid unnecessary chemotherapy (therapy to combat cancer). a 36-year old, pregnant patient who had a missed abortion was diagnosed as having a molar pregnancy with beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (βhcg) level of 509,921 iu/l. a molar pregnancy is a rare complication where a noncancerous tumor develops in the uterus. her lung field was clear. she underwent suction and curettage (s & c) procedure, a process that uses a vacuum to remove a fetus. however, after six weeks, aa presented to the emergency department with a massive bleeding. the patient's βhcg level had decreased to 65,770 iu/l. an abdominal ultrasound indicated the presence of an intra-uterine mass. nevertheless, her βhcg continued to decline. aa was advised to undergo a chemotherapy. the patient refused, citing preference for alternative medicine like herbs instead. she opted for an ""at own risk"" (aor) discharge with scheduled follow up. her condition improved with her βhcg showing a downward trend. surprisingly, at six months following s & c, her βhcg improved to 0 iu/l. no mass was detected by ultrasound. brucea javanica fruits along with pereskia bleo annona muricata leaves can potentially be useful alternatives to chemotherapy. this idea needs further study."
"objective: to examine patients after embryo transfer for predictive influence of the human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg) level on the probability of finishing pregnancy with delivery. methods: 490 patients pregnant after ivf + et treatment placed in the study. the influence of other factors: age (patients 20-50), number of transferred embryos (one, two and more) and the length of cultivation on the probability of finishing pregnancy with delivery or loss and the possibility to predict multiple pregnancy was also related to the known hcg value. the transferred embryos were divided into two groups - early (cultivation 48 and 72 hrs) and prolonged cultivation (pc 96 and 120 hrs). the answer here, therefore, is a multinomial variable with four levels. for that reason the data was analysed through a multinomial logistic model vs. multinomial distribution of a mistake and generalised logistic link function. results: the hcg level grows exponentially in the course of the 9th to 17th day after an embryo transfer (et). the probability of one child delivery after the transfer of one embryo overdue after prolonged cultivation (96 or 120 hrs) grows with the average and above-average hcg values on the day of the draw. the hcg value was 678 (564-815) iu/l1 on the 14th day after et in pregnancy ended in delivery, 321 (216-477) iu/l on average in abortion, 82 (51-132) iu/l in biochemical pregnancy and 1070 (737-1554) iu/l in multiple pregnancy. the probability of multiple pregnancy increased with hcg values greatly above the average and on the other hand, below-average values indicated abortion or biochemical pregnancy. the patients age was not proven to be of significant influence, the hcg level slightly decreased with higher age. on the contrary, an increasing frequency of abortions depending on the increasing age of the mother was once again confirmed. conclusion: the measured hcg values are considerably different depending on the pregnancy result, which is why this value is considered a quality predictive factor of the pregnancy result."

"the objective was to determine the strength of relationship between maternal free beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hcg) concentrations and rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes. consecutive records of the database of our down screening project were assessed for free β-hcg levels and pregnancy outcomes. pregnancies with foetal chromosomal or structural anomalies and those with underlying disease were excluded. free β-hcg levels of < 0.5, > 0.5 and < 2.0, and ≥ 2.0 mom were categorised as low, normal and high, respectively. of 17,082 screened women, 13,620 were available for analysis. in the first trimester (n = 8150), low β-hcg levels significantly increased risk for intrauterine growth restriction (iugr), preterm birth, low birth weight (lbw) and low apgar score with relative risk of 1.66, 1.43, 1.83 and 2.89; whereas high β-hcg group had a significant decreased risk of preterm birth and gdm with relative risk of 0.73 and 0.62. in the second trimester (n = 5470), both low and high β-hcg groups had significant increased risks of the most common adverse outcomes, i.e. spontaneous abortion, iugr and preterm birth. in conclusion, abnormally low (< 0.5mom) or high (> 2.0 mom) free β-hcg levels are generally associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. nevertheless, high free β-hcg levels in the first trimester may possibly decrease risk of preterm delivery and gdm."
"the objective was to determine the correlation (link) between maternal free beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hcg - a pregnancy hormone) concentrations and rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes. database records were assessed for free β-hcg levels and pregnancy outcomes. pregnancies with fetal chromosomal or structural anomalies and those with underlying disease were excluded. free β-hcg levels of < 0.5, > 0.5 and < 2.0, and ≥ 2.0 mom were categorized as low, normal and high, respectively. of 17,082 screened women, 13,620 were analyzed. in the first trimester, low β-hcg levels significantly increased risk for intrauterine (normal inner-womb) growth restriction (iugr), preterm birth, low birth weight (lbw), and low apgar (newborn test) score. high β-hcg group had a significant decreased risk of preterm birth and gestational diabetes mellitus (gdm). in the second trimester, both low and high β-hcg groups had significant increased risks of common adverse outcomes. abnormally low (< 0.5mom) or high (> 2.0 mom) free β-hcg levels are associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. high free β-hcg levels in the first trimester may possibly decrease risk of preterm delivery and gdm."
"human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg) is generally quantified in serum, but spot urine samples are also used to assess hcg levels in japan. the purpose of the present study was to elucidate whether urinary hcg can be used clinically as a substitute for serum hcg. a total of 189 samples of serum and spot urine were collected from patients, including cases of normal pregnancy (np) -13, abortion (ab) -21, extrauterine pregnancy (ep) 25, and hydatidiform mole (mol) -7, during medical treatment and comparisons were made concerning serum and urinary hcg levels. the histogram of relative urinary/serum hcg(u-hcg.act/s-hcg) of the samples showed a wide distribution of values, but tended to converge to a narrow distribution by creatinine correction (u-hcg.cor/s-hcg). u-hcg.cor/s-hcg of the ab, ep, and mol groups decreased 1 day to 14 days or was no earlier than 15 days postoperatively compared to preoperatively. the alteration of serum intact/total tended to be similar to that of u-hcg.cor/s-hcg in clinical course. the presented case indicated that u-hcg.act/s-hcg did not correspond to serum hcg levels. because urinary hcg levels are inconsistent depending on whether spot urine is concentrated or diluted, the levels of hcg in spot urine do not always correlate with serum levels of hcg. therefore, the data of urinary hcg should be interpreted after creatinine correction. overall, it is recommended to determine serum hcg levels rather than creatinine corrected urinary hcg levels, considering that the relative urinary/serum hcg was not constant postoperatively."
"human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg - a pregnancy hormone) is generally measured in serum (blood). however, spot urine samples are also used to assess hcg levels in japan. the purpose of this study was to understand if urinary hcg can be used clinically as a substitute for serum hcg. a total of 189 samples of serum and spot urine were collected from patients. samples were collected from patients of normal pregnancy (np) -13, abortion (ab) -21, extrauterine (outer-womb) pregnancy (ep) 25, and hydatidiform mole (mol) -7. sample comparisons were made concerning serum and urinary hcg levels. hydatidiform mole leads to a cluster of fluid filled sacs from a noncancerous tumor developing in the uterus from a nonviable pregnancy. initial analysis of sample urinary/serum hcg showed a wide distribution of values. however, the difference in distribution decreased after sample normalization. urinary/serum hcg of the ab, ep, and mol groups showed no difference before or after surgery. serum measurements tended to be similar to that of urinary/serum hcg levels. the presented case indicated that urinary/serum hcg did not correspond (were not linked) to serum hcg levels. urinary hcg levels are inconsistent depending on whether spot urine is concentrated or diluted. because of this, hcg levels in spot urine do not always correlate with serum levels of hcg. data of urinary hcg should be interpreted only after normalization. the authors recommended to determine serum hcg levels rather than normalized urinary hcg levels. this is because the relative urinary/serum hcg was not constant following surgery."
"objective: the aim of this study was to investigate whether subfertility, measured as longer time-to-pregnancy (ttp) in spontaneously conceived pregnancies, affects the first trimester levels of pregnancy-associated plasma protein-a (papp-a) and free beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (β-hcg) and hence the risk estimates in down syndrome screening. methods: the study included a cohort of 10 469 singleton pregnant women who underwent first trimester combined screening and responded to a questionnaire regarding ttp. papp-a and free β-hcg levels were measured between gestational week 8 + 0 and 13 + 6 and were related to ttp. results: the median papp-a and free β-hcg moms were significantly lower in women with a ttp ≥24 months compared with the reference group with a ttp <6 months (papp-a: 0.96 vs 1.06 mom, p = 0.003; free β-hcg: 1.04 vs 1.12 mom, p = 0.03). this led to an increased odds for trisomy 21 risk ≥1 : 300 for ttp ≥24 months compared with ttp <6 months, but when adjusting for potential confounders, the odds ratio (or) lost significance (or 1.4, 95% confidence interval; 0.8-2.4). conclusion: time-to-pregnancy ≥24 months in spontaneously conceived pregnancies is associated with decreased levels of papp-a and free β-hcg."

"human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg) is a chemical created by trophoblast tissue, tissue typically found in early embryos and which will eventually be part of the placenta. measuring hcg levels can be helpful in identifying a normal pregnancy, pathologic pregnancy, and can also be useful following an aborted pregnancy. there is also a benefit in measuring hcg in a variety of cancers including choriocarcinoma and extra-uterine malignancies."

"human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg) is a pregnancy hormone secreted by the placental synctiotrophoblast cell layer that has been linked to fetal growth and various placental, uterine and fetal functions. in order to investigate the effects of hcg on clinical endpoints, knowledge on reference range (rr) methodology and determinants of gestational hcg levels is crucial. moreover, a better understanding of gestational hcg physiology can improve current screening programs and future clinical management. serum total hcg levels were determined in 8195 women participating in the generation r study. gestational age specific rrs using 'ultrasound derived gestational age' (us rrs) were calculated and compared with 'last menstrual period derived gestational age' (lmp rrs) and a model-based rr. we also investigated which pregnancy characteristics were associated with hcg levels. compared to the us rrs, the lmp rrs were lower, most notably for the median and lower limit levels. no considerable differences were found between rrs calculated in the general population or in uncomplicated pregnancies only. maternal smoking, bmi, parity, ethnicity, fetal gender, placental weight and hyperemesis gravidarum symptoms were associated with total hcg. we provide gestational rrs for total hcg and show that total hcg values and rr cut-offs during pregnancy vary depending on pregnancy dating methodology. this is likely due to the influence of hcg on embryonic growth, suggesting that ultrasound based pregnancy dating might be less reliable in women with high/low hcg levels. furthermore, we identify different pregnancy characteristics that influence total hcg levels considerably and should therefore be accounted for in clinical studies."

"family physicians often use quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg) testing to assess first-trimester bleeding. while we anticipate a range of normal results for any given week in the first trimester, we predict an approximate doubling over 48 hours in a normal pregnancy during the first trimester. human chorionic gonadotropin tends to peak at about 10 weeks’ gestation before declining and stabilizing. when hcg levels plateau prematurely or fail to rise as expected, we consider that the pregnancy might not be viable."

"the first trimester screening programme offers a noninvasive option for the early detection of aneuploidy pregnancies. this screening is done by a combination of two biochemical markers i.e. serum free β-human chorionic gonadotrophin (free β-hcg) and pregnancy associated plasma protein a (papp-a), maternal age and fetal nuchal translucency (nt) thickness at 11 + 0-13 + 6 weeks of gestation. a beneficial consequence of screening is the early diagnosis or trisomies 21, 18 and 13. at 11 + 0-13 + 6 weeks, the relative prevalence of trisomies 18 and 13 to trisomy 21 are found to be one to three and one to seven, respectively. all three trisomies are associated with increased maternal age, increased fetal nt and decreased papp-a, but in trisomy 21 serum free β-hcg is increased whereas in trisomies 18 and 13 free β-hcg is decreased."
"the first trimester screening program offers a noninvasive (nonsurgical) option for the early detection of aneuploidy pregnancies. aneuploidy refers to the conditions of having an abnormal number of chromosomes. this screening is done by evaluating serum (blood) free β-human chorionic gonadotrophin (free β-hcg - a preganancy hormone), pregnancy associated plasma protein a (papp-a), maternal age, and fetal nuchal translucency (nt - area of tissue at the back of an unborn baby's neck) thickness at 11 to 13 weeks of gestation. a beneficial consequence of screening is the early diagnosis of chromosomal anomalies. at 11 to 13 weeks, the relative prevalence of chromosomal anomalies are found to be 1:3 and 1:7, respectively. chromosomal anomalies are associated with increased maternal age, increased fetal nt, and decreased papp-a. however, in a specific chromosomal anomalies, known as trisomy 21, serum free β-hcg is increased. in trisomies 18 and 13, various types of chromosomal anomalies, free β-hcg is decreased."
"the comparative absorption of zinc after oral administration of three different complexed forms was studied in 15 healthy human volunteers in a double-blind four-period crossover trial. the individuals were randomly divided into four groups. each group rotated for four week periods through a random sequence of oral supplementation including: zinc picolinate, zinc citrate, and zinc gluconate (equivalent to 50 mg elemental zinc per day) and placebo. zinc was measured in hair, urine, erythrocyte and serum before and after each period. at the end of four weeks hair, urine and erythrocyte zinc levels rose significantly (p less than 0.005, p less than 0.001, and p less than 0.001) during zinc picolinate administration. there was no significant change in any of these parameters from zinc gluconate, zinc citrate or placebo administration. there was a small, insignificant rise in serum zinc during zinc picolinate, zinc citrate and placebo supplementation. the results of this study suggest that zinc absorption in humans can be improved by complexing zinc with picolinic acid."
"we studied how much zinc gets into the body of 15 healthy volunteers after they took different supplements. the volunteers were split into four groups in no particular order. volunteers in each group took one of these supplements for four weeks: zinc picolinate, zinc citrate, zinc gluconate or placebo (a pill that contains no drugs). the pills contained the same amount of zinc. the groups switched to a different drug every week in no particular order. zinc was measured in hair, urine, and blood before and after each switch. at the end of four weeks levels of zinc in hair, urine and red blood cells were much higher in those who took zinc picolinate. there was no change in the levels of zinc in the body after taking zinc gluconate, zinc citrate or placebo. there was a small rise in the levels of zinc in the clear liquid part of the blood after taking zinc picolinate, zinc citrate and placebo. levels of zinc in the body can be improved by supplements that combine zinc with picolinic acid, a natural product found in many organisms."
"this study compared three different types of zinc drugs. the study included 15 healthy people. the people were divided into four groups. each group took a different type of zinc pill each week for four weeks. the zinc pill types were zinc picolinate, zinc citrate, zinc gluconate, and a fake zinc pill. researchers measured the amount of zinc in each person's hair, urine, red blood cells, and blood each week. there was more zinc in each person's body after a week of taking the zinc picolinate pills. those people taking zinc gluconate, zinc citrate, or the fake zinc pills did not have more zinc in their body after a week of taking the pills. the researchers found a very small increase of zinc in the blood of people after the a week of taking the zinc picolinate, zinc citrate, or fake zinc pills. this means that zinc picolinate is the best pill to take to get more zinc into a person's body."
"the anti-vsc (volatile sulphur compounds) effect of zinc is known to be associated with free zinc ions. objective: to examine whether zinc salts with low stability constants were more suitable as sources of zinc in zinc lozenges than zinc salts with high stability constants. the former provide free zinc ions upon dissolution in water, whereas the latter provide few such ions. design and participants: identical lozenges were produced which contained either zinc acetate, zinc gluconate (low stability constants), zinc citrate or amino-acid chelated zinc (extremely high stability constants). all the lozenges contained 0.1 per cent of zinc. a test panel of 10 volunteers used the different lozenges randomly. vsc were measured by gc. results and conclusion: the lozenge with the highest stability constant was as effective as those with very low stability constants. the anti-vsc effect was thus not related to this constant. these findings may be explained by the possibility that alternative ligands with stronger affinity for zinc than the original ligands in the lozenges may be present in the oral cavity. an in vitro experiment indicated that the sulphide ion (s2-) may be such a ligand."
"zinc is known to interfere with volatile sulphur compounds, chemicals that have rotten egg smell and barnyard smell. we studied which zinc salts are better to use in zinc lozenges. some zinc salts break down in water more easily and let out more free zinc. we prepared similar lozenges that contained one of the zinc salts that easily let out zinc (zinc acetate or zinc gluconate) or the chemicals that do not let zinc out easily (zinc citrate or amino-acid chelated zinc). all the lozenges contained a hundredth part of zinc. 10 volunteers used the different lozenges in no particular order. we measured the poor smelling sulfur gases. all lozenges worked similarly. this means that suppression of the sulfur chemicals by zinc is not related to how easily zinc salts dissolve in water. similar results for all lozenges may be due to some chemicals in the mouth interacting with zinc stronger than the salts in the lozenges. lab experiments suggest the chemical in the mouth that interacts with zinc may be a form of sulfur."
"zinc's anti-vsc (volatile sulphur compounds) effect comes from free zinc ions, which are the chemicals that allow zinc to work in the body. the objective of this study was to see which type of zinc lozenges work best, the type that has what is called high stability constants or the type that has low stability constants. a lot of free zinc ions appear when low stability constant zinc is dissolved in water, which high stability constant zinc gives few ions. all lozenges looked identical but contained one of four different types of zinc forms, two for each type of stability constants. all of the lozenges contained a small amount of zinc. 10 volunteers took the different lozenges randomly. the results show that the zinc lozenges were effective no matter the stability constant. the stability constant has no effect on the zinc ions' anti-vsc effect. one explanation is that free zinc ions are attracted to chemicals in the mouth more strongly than those in the lozenge. a lab experiment showed that sulphide ions from vscs may attract free zinc ions to create the anti-vsc effect."
"currently much attention has been given to the neurotoxicity of zinc, yet little is known about the influence of the counterions present. therefore, we investigated the influence of different zn(2+)-salts (concentrations range 0.05-0.3 mm) on cell viability, atp and glutathione concentration and caspase activation in differentiated pc12 cells as a model for neuronal cells. generally, at concentrations of 0.05 mm most zn(2+)-salts were not cytotoxic except for zinc-citrate. at concentrations between 0.1 and 0.3 mm zn(2+) a significant decrease in gsh and atp levels preceded cell death induced by all salts, except of zinc-histidinate. zinc-citrate and zinc-sulphate turned out to be the most toxic salts particularly at low concentrations. analyses of caspase 3/7 activity showed that dependent on the concentration and the type of the salt used cell death may show more or less signs of both, necrosis and apoptosis. interestingly, the uptake of zn(2+) from zinc-sulphate and zinc-citrate was significantly higher than that of other salts, implicating a correlation between uptake and toxicity. in conclusion, zn(2+)-salts could be divided into three categories with high (zinc-citrate, zinc-sulphate), moderate (zinc-orotate, zinc-acetate, zinc-chloride(,) zinc-gluconate) and low cytotoxicity (zinc-histidinate)."
"much attention is given to toxic effect of zinc on the neural system, but little is known about about the other chemicals that accompany zinc. we study how different zinc salts affect nerve cells' ability to work and live. in very small doses, zinc salts were no toxic, except for zinc-citrate. at higher doses of all salts except of zinc-histidinate, the levels of protective cell chemicals decreased and the cells died. zinc-citrate and zinc-sulphate turned out to be the most toxic salts particularly at low doses. depending on the dose and type of salt, cells die of different combinations of lack of blood supply to the cell or a pre-determined cell death mechanism. zinc-sulphate and zinc-citrate provided free zinc in higher doses then other salts, possibly indicating there is a connection between taking in zinc and its toxic effect on the cell. zinc salts could be divided into three categories with high (zinc-citrate, zinc-sulphate), moderate (zinc-orotate, zinc-acetate, zinc-chloride, zinc-gluconate) and low cell totoxicity (zinc-histidinate)."
"research is focused on the ways that zinc is bad for the body's cells, but researchers don't how everything works. this study looks at how various forms of zinc effect cells in the body by testing the zinc on rat cells. the various forms of zinc did not have bad effects on the cells when used at small sizes, except for the form called zinc citrate. all of the various forms of zinc caused cells to die at high amounts except for the form called zinc histidinate. the most toxic of the zinc forms were zinc-citrate and zinc-sulphate. they had bad effects even when used in low amounts. the type of zinc and how much was used affected the way cells died. the cells absorbed more zinc from the zinc-sulphate and zinc-citrate forms. this means that there may be a relationship between the amount of zinc absorbed and how bad it is for the cells. the forms of zinc can be divided into three different categories based on how toxic they are to cells."
"background: there is a clinical need for new therapeutic products against herpes simplex virus (hsv). the pomegranate, fruit of the tree punica granatum l, has since ancient times been linked to activity against infection. this work probed the activity of pomegranate rind extract (pre) and co-administered zinc (ii) ions. materials and methods: pre was used in conjunction with zinc (ii) salts to challenge hsv-1 and aciclovir-resistant hsv in terms of virucidal plaque assay reduction and antiviral activities in epithelial vero host cells. cytotoxicity was determined by the mts assay using a commercial kit. results: zinc sulphate, zinc citrate, zinc stearate and zinc gluconate demonstrated similar potentiated virucidal activity with pre against hsv-1 by up to 4-fold. a generally parabolic relationship was observed when hsv-1 was challenged with pre and varying concentrations of znso4, with a maximum potentiation factor of 5.5. punicalagin had 8-fold greater virucidal activity than an equivalent mass of pre. however, antiviral data showed that punicalagin had significantly lower antiviral activity compared to the activity of pre (ec50 = 0.56 μg ml-1) a value comparable to aciclovir (ec50 = 0.18 μg ml-1); however, pre also demonstrated potency against aciclovir-resistant hsv (ec50 = 0.02 μg ml-1), whereas aciclovir showed no activity. antiviral action of pre was not influenced by znso4. no cytotoxicity was detected with any test solution. conclusions: the potentiated virucidal activity of pre by coadministered zinc (ii) has potential as a multi-action novel topical therapeutic agent against hsv infections, such as coldsores."
"new treatments are needed for herpes simplex virus (hsv) that causes cold sores or genital herpes. pomegranate is considered to help against infection since ancient times. we studied the activity of pomegranate rind extract (pre) combined with zinc. pke and zinc salts were used against different types of hsv. toxic effect on cells was measured by identifying working cells using commercial chemicals. zinc sulphate, zinc citrate, zinc stearate and zinc gluconate worked similarly against hsv that causes cold sores, and increased the effect of pke up to 4-fold. punicalagin, a chemical extracted from pomegranate, was 8 times more effective against the virus than an equivalent amount of pke. punicalagin, a chemical extracted from pomegranate, was 8 times more effective killing the virus than an equivalent amount of pke. punicalagin was less effective than pke in fighting the virus and suppressing its growth. pke was comparable to the drug aciclovir. pke also worked against the viruses that are resistant to aciclovir. zinc sulfate did not affect how pke worked against the virus and its growth. none of the zinc-pke combinations had toxic effects on cells. zinc increases pke ability to kill viral cells. the combination could become a new treatment applied locally to cold sores."
"new treatments are needed for herpes. the pomegranate fruit has been used to fight infections since ancient times. this study looked at how zinc and extract from pomegranate rinds (pre) affect herpes. pre and zinc were used against herpes and drug resistant herpes in monkey cells. four types of zinc pills with pre were strong against the herpes virus. another compound found in certain plants including pomegranates called punicalagin is 8 times more active against viruses than the same amount of pre. however, other data showed that punicalagin was less active against viruses than pre and was comparable to the drug aciclovir. pre was still effective against drug resistant herpes unlike aciclovir. zinc sulfate did not affect the ability of pre to fight the herpes virus. there were no bad effects on the cells from any of the test treatments. the ability of pre to fight viruses with zinc could be a new treatment for herpes infections such as cold sores."
"the normal human prostate accumulates the highest levels of zinc (zn) of any soft tissue in the body. the pool of zinc available to the body is known to significantly decrease with age. it is suggested that dietary zn supplementation protects against oxidative damage and reduces the risk of cancer. zinc sulfate and zinc gluconate were the most frequently mentioned in per os administration in studies on zn supplementation. the major aim of the study was to compare the bioavailability of different zn compounds (sulfate, gluconate and citrate) in the prostate after their daily administration to male rats at three different doses (3.0; 15.0; and 50.0 mg zn/kg b.w.) for 30 days. the results show that bioavailability in the prostate differs significantly between individual zinc preparations. a significantly elevated zn concentration in the dorso-lateral lobe of the prostate, compared to controls, was found in the rats supplemented with two compounds only: zinc gluconate and zinc citrate. however, after administration of zinc gluconate, this effect occurred even at the lowest dose. the lowest zinc bioavailability in the prostate was found in the rats administered zinc sulfate: no significant zn increase was seen in particular zones of the prostate. to sum up, the use of zinc gluconate is worth considering as a possible means of zinc supplementation in men."
"prostate, a a small gland below the bladder that helps men make semen, contains the highest amount of zinc in the body. the amount of zinc available to the body decreases with age. taking zinc supplements may protect the body against damage caused by the environment and reduces the risk of cancer. the most frequently discussed supplements are zinc sulfate and zinc gluconate we compare the amounts of available zinc in the prostate of male rats after giving them three different doses of zinc sulfate, zinc gluconate, or zinc citrate for 30 days. the availability of zinc in the prostate was very different for different zinc supplements. the availability of zinc in rat prostate was higher only after taking zinc gluconate and zinc citrate. for zinc gluconate, the availability was higher even at the lowest dose. in the rats that got zinc sulfate, availability of zinc has not increased in some parts of the prostate. to sum up, zinc gluconate is worth considering as a zinc supplement for men."
"men collect the most zinc in their prostate. the amount of zinc in the body decreases as a person gets older. taking zinc pills protects the body from chemical imbalance and lessens the risk of cancer. the two types of zinc pills most often studied are zinc sulfate and zinc gluconate. this study compared the different types of zinc pills and doses when taken by rats for 30 days. the results show that the amount of zinc in prostate was different depending on the type of zinc pill taken. the rats had a lot more zinc in their prostates when taking zinc gluconate and zinc citrate compared to rats that did not take any zinc pills. the amount of zinc in the prostate was high even when the rats took zinc gluconate at the lowest dose. there was no increase of zinc in rats that took zinc sulfate. to sum up, zinc gluconate is a worthwhile zinc pill for men who need more zinc."
"the water-soluble zinc salts gluconate, sulfate, and acetate are commonly used as supplements in tablet or syrup form to prevent zinc deficiency and to treat diarrhea in children in combination with oral rehydration. zinc citrate is an alternative compound with high zinc content, slightly soluble in water, which has better sensory properties in syrups but no absorption data in humans. we used the double-isotope tracer method with (67) zn and (70) zn to measure zinc absorption from zinc citrate given as supplements containing 10 mg of zinc to 15 healthy adults without food and compared absorption with that from zinc gluconate and zinc oxide (insoluble in water) using a randomized, double-masked, 3-way crossover design. median (iqr) fractional absorption of zinc from zinc citrate was 61.3% (56.6-71.0) and was not different from that from zinc gluconate with 60.9% (50.6-71.7). absorption from zinc oxide at 49.9% (40.9-57.7) was significantly lower than from both other supplements (p < 0.01). three participants had little or no absorption from zinc oxide. we conclude that zinc citrate, given as a supplement without food, is as well absorbed by healthy adults as zinc gluconate and may thus be a useful alternative for preventing zinc deficiency and treating diarrhea. the more insoluble zinc oxide is less well absorbed when given as a supplement without food and may be minimally absorbed by some individuals."
"zinc salts that dissolve in water are commonly used as supplements. tablets or syrup with zinc gluconate, zinc sulfate or zinc acetate are used to prevent zinc deficiency and to treat diarrhea (loose stools) in children. another source of zinc is zinc citrate that somewhat dissolves in water. it tastes better in syrups, but it is not known if it gets into the body. we measured how much zinc gets into the body of 15 healthy adults after they took zinc supplements without food. the supplements were zinc citrate, zinc gluconate and zinc oxide, which does not mix with water). same as for zinc gluconate, about half of the zinc from zinc citrate got into the body. much smaller amounts of zinc got into the body from zinc oxide. three people did not get any zinc from zinc oxide. zinc citrate supplement taken without food provided as much zinc to healthy adults as zinc gluconate. it may be another useful supplement for preventing zinc deficiency and treating diarrhea. zinc oxide, which doesn't mix with water, does not get into the body that well, or not at all in some people."
various types of zinc are commonly used as supplements in tablet or syrup forms. these supplements prevent the body from lacking zinc and help treat children's diarrhea along with liquids. zinc citrate is a form of zinc that dissolves slightly in water and allows more zinc into the body. it is better in syrup form but there is no data on how well its zinc is absorbed in the human body. this study compared how well zinc from zinc citrate is absorbed in the body by giving 15 people 10 mg of the zinc citrate without requiring them to take it along with food. the results were compared to how well zinc gulconate and zinc oxide were absorbed. zinc citrate was as good as zinc gluconate at being absorbed by the body. zinc oxide was the worst of the three at being absorbed by the body. three people did not absorb or barely absorbed any zinc from the zinc oxide. the results show that zinc citrate is as good as zinc gulconate at being absorbed by the human body. it is another good option to prevent lack of zinc in the body and for treating diarrhea. the zinc oxide form is not absorbed as well by the human body when given without food. some people may not absorb any zinc at all or may barely absorb any.,0
"objective: zinc supplementation is beneficial in some clinical conditions such as age-related macula degeneration (amd). it has been suggested that zinc absorption is influenced by the form in which zinc is ingested. therefore, the pharmacokinetics of zinc gluconate (organic) were compared with those of zinc oxide (inorganic). methods: 12 healthy male subjects aged between 21 and 31 years (24 years median) orally received daily doses of 20 mg metal zinc as zinc gluconate and 17.4 mg metal zinc as zinc oxide under randomized crossover conditions for 14 days each with at least 14 days as a washout. zinc plasma concentrations were measured by means of inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy. results: c(max) was found 18.3% (10.3 - 26.3%) higher following multiple-dose administration of zinc gluconate as compared to zinc oxide (mean; 0.95% confidence interval of the relative differences between both treatment conditions; p < 0.05). auc(0-24h) was noted 8.1% (1.9 - 14.3%) higher after zinc was given as zinc gluconate when compared to zinc oxide (p < 0.05) whereas t(max) did not differ between both treatment conditions. conclusions: zinc absorption in humans could be improved by zinc complexation with gluconate."
"zinc supplements help with some problems, such as age-related macular degeneration (amd), an eye disease that can blur vision. how much zinc gets into the body may depend on the form in which zinc is taken. we compared the movement of zinc in the body after taking zinc gluconate or zinc oxide. 12 healthy males 21 to 31 years old took zinc gluconate and zinc oxide for 14 days each, waiting for at least 14 days between switching to the other supplement. zinc levels were measured in their blood. the highest level of zinc in the blood was higher for zinc gluconate as compared to zinc oxide. the levels of zinc in the blood were higher after zinc was given as zinc gluconate when compared to zinc oxide, but the time it took to reach the highest levels was the same. getting zinc into human bodies could be improved by using zinc gluconate."
"extra zinc is good for conditions like eye diseases that cause loss of sight. research suggests that how much zinc is absorbed by the body is affected by the form of the zinc taken. this study compares using two different forms of zinc, zinc gluconate and zinc oxide. this study included men ages 21 to 31. they received one type of zinc pills for two weeks, then the other form of zinc pills for two weeks with a two week break between the sets. the maximum amount of zinc in the blood was higher after taking zinc gluconate than when taking zinc oxide. the amount of zinc in the blood over a day was higher when taking zinc gluconate than when taking zinc oxide. however the time it took to be at max zinc was the same for both forms of zinc. in conclusion, people absorb zinc better when it is in the zinc gluconate form."
"zinc (zn)-enriched yeast and gluconate are considered two of the more biologically available supplements. however, there have been few reports comparing the bioavailability of these supplements. the objective of this study was to demonstrate whether zn was absorbed better by healthy male volunteers when given supplements where the mineral is found organically bound in yeast or as a salt gluconate form. the trial used a randomized, two-way crossover design. urine, blood, and fecal samples were collected and analyzed over a 48-h period after a single dose of supplement. the net zn balance and the relative bioavailability were calculated. no differences were observed in urine excretion of the two supplements. zinc gluconate gave higher zn concentrations in the blood in the first 6 h but also showed greater losses in the feces. zinc yeast also increased in blood with time but showed significantly less loss in the feces. thus, the net zn balance after 48 h for zn yeast was 9.46 but for zn gluconate it was -2.00, indicating that zn gluconate supplementation contributed to a net loss of zn. it was concluded that organic zn yeast supplements are more biologically available than zn gluconate salts."
"zinc is considered to get into the body easily when taken as yeast enriched with zinc or zinc gluconate. these two supplements have not been compared to each other. we study if zinc gets into the body of healthy male volunteers better when given with yeast compared to zinc gluconate. the volunteers took the two supplements sequentially, in no particular order. we examined urine, blood and stools over 48 hours after volunteers took a single dose of supplement. we measured the total amount of zinc and its availability in the body. there was no difference in getting the two supplements out of the body through urine. there was more zinc in the blood in the first six hours after taking zinc gluconate, but more of it was removed with the stools. zinc yeast also increased in blood with time but was removed less with the stools. the amount of zinc in the body 48 hours after taking zinc yeast was high, but after zinc gluconate the body lost more zinc than it had before. organic zinc yeast supplements provide the body with more zinc than the zinc gluconate salts."
"yeast with added zinc and the supplement zinc gluconate are two of the best options to get more zinc in your body. hardly any research exists comparing the two supplements. this study wanted to see which supplement was better in healthy men. researchers collected urine, blood, and poop samples over two days after the men took one dose of the supplement. the researchers calculated the amount of zinc in the body in multiple ways. the researchers found no differences in the amount of zinc lost from urinating. men had higher amounts of zinc in the blood during the first 6 hours after taking it, but lost more zinc from poop. men also had higher zinc in the blood after taking the yeast with zinc. however, men lost a lot less zinc through poop. the results show that the zinc gluconate supplement may result in a loss of zinc in the body. in conclusion, the yeast with zinc supplement gave the body more zinc than the zinc gluconate supplement."
"unlike iron, zinc absorption is influenced by dietary zinc intake, not zinc status. as dietary zinc increases, the total amount of absorbed zinc increases while the percent absorbed declines. the gastrointestinal tract maintains whole-body zinc homeostasis by adjusting endogenous zinc losses to the amount absorbed. at intakes below about 9 mg/day, zinc absorption occurs primarily by a saturable (carrier) process involving zip4, znt1, and other transporters. there is no evidence that past zinc intakes, or status, influences zinc absorption. instead, current zinc intake is the chief determinant of zinc absorption. supplemental zinc taken with water in the post-absorptive state initially is absorbed more efficiently than food zinc, but absorption efficiency declines within 24 hours presumably due to down-regulation of the zinc transporters. more research is needed to understand the effect of physiological state on zinc absorption."
"unlike iron, zinc gets into the body proportionately to taking it in with food, not depending on zinc presence in the body. as the amount of zinc in the food increases, the total amount of zinc that the body takes in increases, while the proportion of zinc that the body takes in goes down. the digestive system maintains the balance of zinc in the body by adjusting how much zinc it removes from the body while taking in zinc from the food. if the amount of zinc in food is below 9 milligrams a day, the body uses special chemicals to take zinc into the body. the process of taking in zinc does not depend on how much zinc the body took in the past or currently has. instead, zinc consumed with food determines how much zinc will get into the body. zinc supplements taken with water get into the body more efficiently than food zinc. this efficiency goes down within 24 hours, maybe because the body slows down the special chemicals that take zinc in."
the amount of zinc a person's body absorbs is affected by the amount of zinc a person takes in through food or supplements. the body absorbs more zinc when zinc is larger part of a person's diet. the percentage of zinc absorbed by the body is less however. the body's digestive system makes sure that the body has the zinc it needs by absorbing enough zinc to make up for what the body has lost. zinc is absorbed in the body through special proteins when 9mg or less is gotten in a day. there is no evidence that the amount of zinc a person had in the past affects the way zinc is absorbed in the body now. the amount of zinc a person takes in now is what mainly affects the absorption of zinc. the zinc in zinc supplements is better absorbed than zinc brought into the body by food. the different in absorption disappears within 24 hours though. more research needs to be done to understand how the body absorbs zinc in different situations.,0
"zinc has earned recognition recently as a micronutrient of outstanding and diverse biological, clinical, and global public health importance. regulation of absorption by zinc transporters in the enterocyte, together with saturation kinetics of the absorption process into and across the enterocyte, are the principal means by which whole-body zinc homeostasis is maintained. several physiologic factors, most notably the quantity of zinc ingested, determine the quantity of zinc absorbed and the efficiency of absorption. other factors are age and the time over which zinc is ingested. zinc from supplements has not been shown to be absorbed differently from that taken with meals that lack inhibitors of zinc absorption. the principal dietary factor known to impair zinc bioavailability is inositol hexa- (and penta-) phosphate or phytate. modeling of zinc absorption as a function of dietary zinc and phytate accounts for >80% of the variability in the quantity of zinc absorbed. fitting the model to new data has resulted in continual improvement in parameter estimates, which currently indicate a maximal absorption in adults of approximately 6 mg zn/d and that the average estimated dietary requirement doubles with 1000 mg dietary phytate/d. intestinal excretion of endogenous zinc is regulated in response to recent absorption and to zinc status. the quantitative relation of intestinal excretion of endogenous zinc to zinc absorption is currently considered to be of major importance in the determination of zinc requirements. the effects of phytate on intestinal losses of endogenous zinc merit further investigation but are probably not of the same magnitude as its inhibitory effects on absorption of exogenous zinc."
"zinc is now believed to be an extremely important micronutrient. micronutrients are vitamins and minerals that are needed for healthy development, disease prevention, and wellbeing. the body maintains the balance of zinc through special chemicals that take the zinc into cells according to needs. how much and how well zinc is taken into the body depends on its amount in the food and other factors. other factors are age and the time over which zinc is ingested. there is no difference between the ways zinc from supplements and the meals are taken into the body. the foods, such as grains, which contain phytates, chemicals that prevent minerals from getting into the body, may prevent zinc from getting into the body. models show that the majority of differences in how much zinc will get into the body is due to the presence of zinc and phytate in the food. our model shows that an adult body takes in about 6 milligrams a day. if the daily meals contain a gram of phytate, twice the recommended daily amount of zinc is needed. zinc is removed with stools depending on how much zinc the body took in and how much was present. the relation between zinc that is taken in and removed determines how much zinc should be taken. phytate might play a role on how much zinc that is already in the body is removed with stools. this role is probably not as important as in preventing zinc in the food from getting into the body."
doctors have realized recently that zinc is very important to health. the cells in the intestines keep the body's zinc level balanced. many factors determine how much and how well zinc is absorbed by the body. the most important factor is the amount of zinc a person gets. two other factors are a person's age and the length of time zinc is taken. the amount of zinc absorbed by the body is not different whether the zinc comes from supplements like pills or from food. some compounds found in certain foods can make it harder for the body to absorb zinc. the body absorbs zinc differently depending on the amount of zinc or the amount of phytate in the amount already. the results were added to previous data and now we know that adults can absorb at most 6mg of zinc a day. a person needs to take double the normal amount of zinc if getting 1000mg of phytate through food and medication. the body gets rid of zinc according to how much zinc is already in the body and how much has been absorbed recently. how much zinc is lost and how much is absorbed is important to know so that people get the right amount of zinc. the way that phylate affects how much zinc is removed from the body needs to be looked at more. but that effect is probably not as important as the way phylate affects how much zinc gets absorbed in the body.,0
"iron is a micronutrient essential for a wide range of metabolic processes in virtually all living organisms. during infections, a battle for iron takes place between the human host and the invading pathogens. the liver peptide hepcidin, which is phylogenetically and structurally linked to defensins (antimicrobial peptides of the innate immunity), plays a pivotal role by subtracting iron to pathogens through its sequestration into host cells, mainly macrophages. while this phenomenon is well studied in certain bacterial infections, much less is known regarding viral infections. iron metabolism also has implications on the functionality of cells of the immune system. once primed by the contact with antigen presenting cells, lymphocytes need iron to sustain the metabolic burst required for mounting an effective cellular and humoral response. the covid-19 pandemic has boosted an amount of clinical and translational research over the possible influences of nutrients on sars-cov-2 infection, in terms of either susceptibility or clinical course. here we review the intersections between iron metabolism and covid-19, belonging to the wider domain of the so-called ""nutritional immunity"". a better understanding of such connections has potential broad implications, either from a mechanistic standpoint, or for the development of more effective strategies for managing covid-19 and possible future pandemics."
"iron is a necessary nutrient for many metabolic processes in almost all living organisms. during infections, a battle for iron takes place between the human and disease-causing organisms (pathogens). the liver protein hepcidin, which is linked to defensins (bacteria-fighting proteins of the immune system), plays an important role by taking iron from pathogens by moving iron into human cells, mainly immune cells. while this event is well known in certain bacterial infections, much less is known about viral infections. iron metabolism may also affect the function of cells of the immune system. once stimulated by touching cells with parts of foreign organisms attached to them, immune cells need iron to sustain the energy needed for an effective cellular and immune response. the covid-19 pandemic (caused by a virus causing a lung infection) has boosted clinical and medical research over the possible influences of nutrients on sars-cov-2 infection, in terms of either contracting or aiding the infection. here we review the links between iron metabolism and covid-19, belonging to the wider field of study of the so-called ""nutritional immunity"". a better understanding of these links may help develop more effective strategies for managing covid-19 and possible future pandemics."
"background and aims: iron is an essential trace element to almost all organism, and the delicate balance between host defend system and viral proliferation plays an important role in infective conditions. while the association of the iron metabolism with the prognosis of covid-19 remains poorly understood. we aimed to estimate the associations of systemic iron metabolism parameters with the severity and risks of adverse outcomes in covid-19. methods: in this retrospective cohort study, we included 158 confirmed covid-19 patients in tongji hospital, wuhan, china (27 january to 5 april, 2020). demographic data, comorbidities, laboratory examinations, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. multivariable poisson regression was used to estimate the association of iron parameter levels with the severity and risks of adverse outcomes in covid-19 patients. results: we identified 60 (38%) severe cases in 158 covid-19 patients. the median age was 63 years (interquartile range [iqr]: 54-73) and the median length of hospital stay was 28 days (iqr: 17-40). after adjusting for age, sex, il-6, and pre-existing comorbidities, all iron parameters were associated with the severity of covid-19 with adjusted risk ratio of 0.42 [95% ci: 0.22-0.83], 4.38 [95% ci: 1.86-10.33], 0.19 [95% ci: 0.08-0.48], and 0.25 [95% ci: 0.10-0.58] for serum iron, ferritin, transferrin, and total iron-binding capacity, respectively. these iron indices were also related to the risk of ards, coagulopathy, acute cardiac injury, acute liver injury, and acute kidney injury in covid-19 patients and high cytokine concentrations. conclusions: patients with low serum iron status likely suffered from severe condition and multiple-organ injury in covid-19. the iron metabolism parameters might be risk factors and clinical biomarkers for covid-19 prognosis."
"the background of this study is that iron is a necessary element to almost all living beings. the delicate balance between host immune system and viral growth plays an important role in infections. the link between iron metabolism and recovery from covid-19 (a viral lung infection) remains poorly understood. we aimed to estimate the links between full-body iron metabolism with the severity and risks of side effects in covid-19. in this clinical study, we included 158 confirmed covid-19 patients in tongji hospital, wuhan, china (27 january to 5 april, 2020). basic background data, other diseases, lab tests, treatments, and clinical results were all collected. a specific mathematical test was used to estimate the links between iron levels with the severity and risks of side effects in covid-19 patients. as a result, we identified 60 (38%) severe cases in 158 covid-19 patients. the average age was 63 years, and the average length of hospital stay was 28 days. after adjusting for age, sex, immune signals, and pre-existing diseases, all iron measures were linked with the severity of covid-19 for blood iron and iron-containing proteins. these iron measures were also linked to the risk of a serious lung condition that leads to low blood oxygen, excessive bleeding or clotting, immediate heart-related injury, immediate liver injury, and immediate kidney injury in covid-19 patients and high immune signal levels. in conclusion, patients with low blood iron likely suffered from severe effects of and multiple-organ injury in covid-19. the iron metabolism measures might be risk factors and clinical markers for covid-19 recovery."
"large variability in covid-19 clinical progression urges the need to find the most relevant biomarkers to predict patients' outcomes. we evaluated iron metabolism and immune response in 303 patients admitted to the main hospital of the northern region of portugal with variable clinical pictures, from september to november 2020. one hundred and twenty-seven tested positive for sars-cov-2 and 176 tested negative. iron-related laboratory parameters and cytokines were determined in blood samples collected soon after admission. demographic data, comorbidities and clinical outcomes were recorded. patients were assigned into five groups according to severity. serum iron and transferrin levels at admission were lower in covid-19-positive than in covid-19-negative patients. the levels of interleukin (il)-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (mcp-1) were increased in covid-19-positive patients. the lowest serum iron and transferrin levels at diagnosis were associated with the worst outcomes. iron levels negatively correlated with il-6 and higher levels of this cytokine were associated with a worse prognosis. serum ferritin levels at diagnosis were higher in covid-19-positive than in covid-19-negative patients. serum iron is the simplest laboratory test to be implemented as a predictor of disease progression in covid-19-positive patients."

"this report provides perspectives concerning dual roles of serum ferritin as a measure of both iron status and inflammation. we suggest benefits of a lower range of serum ferritin as has occurred for total serum cholesterol and fasting blood glucose levels. observations during a prospective randomized study using phlebotomy in patients with peripheral arterial disease offered unique insights into dual roles of serum ferritin both as an iron status marker and acute phase reactant. robust positive associations between serum ferritin, interleukin 6 [il-6], tissue necrosis factor-alpha, and high sensitivity c-reactive protein were discovered. elevated serum ferritin and il-6 levels associated with increased mortality and with reduced mortality at ferritin levels <100 ng ml-1. epidemiologic studies demonstrate similar outcomes. extremely elevated ferritin and il-6 levels also occur in individuals with high mortality due to sars-cov-2 infection. disordered iron metabolism reflected by a high range of serum ferritin level signals disease severity and outcomes. based upon experimental and epidemiologic data, we suggest testing the hypotheses that optimal ferritin levels for cardiovascular mortality reduction range from 20 to 100 ng ml-1 with % transferrin levels from 20 to 50%, to ensure adequate iron status and that ferritin levels above 194 ng ml-1 associate with all-cause mortality in population cohorts."
"this report talks about dual roles of blood ferritin (an iron-containing protein) as a measure of both iron status and inflammation (an infection-fighting process in the body). we suggest benefits of a lower range of blood ferritin like with total blood cholesterol and fasting blood sugar levels. studying phlebotomy (vein puncturing) in patients with peripheral arterial disease (blockage of veins to the blood) offered unique insights into dual roles of blood ferritin both as an iron status marker and inflammation marker. we found links between higher blood ferritin, higher interleukin 6 [il-6] and tissue necrosis factor-alpha (immune signaling molecules), and high sensitivity c-reactive protein (a marker of inflammation). increased blood ferritin and il-6 levels were linked with increased death rates and with reduced death rates at low ferritin levels. other large-population studies show similar results. extremely increased ferritin and il-6 levels also occur in individuals with high death risks due to sars-cov-2 infection (infection from a virus causing a lung disease). disordered iron metabolism seen in a high range of blood ferritin level signals disease severity and results. based upon experiments and large patient group data, we suggest testing the idea that optimal ferritin levels for heart-related death rate reduction range from 20 to 100 ng/ml with % transferrin levels from 20 to 50%. this is to ensure a healthy iron status and that ferritin levels above 194 ng/ml link with all-cause death risk in patient groups."
"while it took decades to arrive to a conclusion that ferritin is more than an indicator of iron storage level, it took a short period of time through the covid-19 pandemic to wonder what the reason behind high levels of ferritin in patients with severe covid-19 might be. unsurprisingly, acute phase reactant was not a satisfactory explanation. moreover, the behavior of ferritin in patients with severe covid-19 and the subsequent high mortality rates in patients with high ferritin levels necessitated further investigations to understand the role of ferritin in the diseases. ferritin was initially described to accompany various acute infections, both viral and bacterial, indicating an acute response to inflammation. however, with the introduction of the hyperferritinemic syndrome connecting four severe pathological conditions such as adult-onset still's disease, macrophage activation syndrome, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome, and septic shock added another aspect of ferritin where it could have a pathogenetic role rather than an extremely elevated protein only. in fact, suggesting that covid-19 is a new member in the spectrum of hyperferritinemic syndrome besides the four mentioned conditions could hopefully direct further search on the pathogenetic role of ferritin. doubtlessly, improving our understanding of those aspects of ferritin would enormously contribute to better coping with severe diseases in terms of treatment and prevention of complications. the origin, history, importance, and the advances of searching the role of ferritin in various pathological and clinical processes are presented hereby in our article. in addition, the implications of ferritin in covid-19 are addressed."
"while it took decades to learn that ferritin (an iron-containing protein) is more than a marker of iron storage level, it took some time during the covid-19 pandemic (a pandemic caused by a virus that causes lung infections) to wonder why there are high levels of ferritin in patients with severe covid-19. unsurprisingly, inflammation markers were not a satisfactory explanation. also, how ferritin acts in patients with severe covid-19 and the resulting high death rates in patients with high ferritin levels forced further studies to understand the role of ferritin in the diseases. ferritin was at first described to accompany many immediate infections, both viral and bacterial, indicating an immediate response to inflammation. however, with hyperferritinemic syndrome (high ferritin levels) linking four severe disease conditions such as adult-onset still's disease, macrophage activation syndrome, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome, and septic shock (immune- or infection-related diseases) added another aspect of ferritin where it could have a disease-causing role rather than an extremely increased protein only. in fact, suggesting that covid-19 is a new member in the range of hyperferritinemic syndrome besides the four mentioned conditions could hopefully direct further search on the disease-causing role of ferritin. without doubt, improving our understanding of those aspects of ferritin would enormously contribute to better treatment and side effect management with severe diseases. we present the origin, history, importance, and the advances of searching the role of ferritin in various disease-causing and clinical processes in our article. also, the possibilities of ferritin in covid-19 are addressed."
"sars-cov-2 infection is characterized by a protean clinical picture that can range from asymptomatic patients to life-threatening conditions. severe covid-19 patients often display a severe pulmonary involvement and develop neutrophilia, lymphopenia, and strikingly elevated levels of il-6. there is an over-exuberant cytokine release with hyperferritinemia leading to the idea that covid-19 is part of the hyperferritinemic syndrome spectrum. indeed, very high levels of ferritin can occur in other diseases including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, macrophage activation syndrome, adult-onset still's disease, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome and septic shock. numerous studies have demonstrated the immunomodulatory effects of ferritin and its association with mortality and sustained inflammatory process. high levels of free iron are harmful in tissues, especially through the redox damage that can lead to fibrosis. iron chelation represents a pillar in the treatment of iron overload. in addition, it was proven to have an anti-viral and anti-fibrotic activity. herein, we analyse the pathogenic role of ferritin and iron during sars-cov-2 infection and propose iron depletion therapy as a novel therapeutic approach in the covid-19 pandemic."
"sars-cov-2 infection (a viral lung infection) can cause effects ranging from patients with no symptoms to life-threatening conditions. severe covid-19 patients often display a severe lung effect and develop altered levels of immune cells and strikingly increased levels of il-6 (an immune signaling molecule called a cytokine). there is an increased cytokine release with hyperferritinemia (high levels of ferritin - an iron-containing protein). this leads to the idea that covid-19 is part of the hyperferritinemic syndrome disease group. indeed, very high levels of ferritin can occur in other diseases including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, macrophage activation syndrome, adult-onset still's disease, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome and septic shock (immune- or infection-related diseases). many studies have shown the immune-system-regulating effects of ferritin and its links with death risks and high inflammation. high levels of free iron are harmful in the body, especially through damage that can lead to scarring. iron binding represents a pillar in the treatment of iron overload. also, it was proven to have an anti-viral and anti-scarring activity. herein, we analyse the disease-causing role of ferritin and iron during sars-cov-2 infection and propose iron depletion treatment as a new treatment in the covid-19 pandemic."
"background: several studies have suggested that covid-19 is a systemic disease that can affect several organs, including the brain. in the brain, specifically, viral infection can cause dyshomeostasis of some trace elements that promote complex biochemical reactions in specialized neurological functions. objective: understand the neurovirulence of sars-cov-2 and the relationship between trace elements and neurological disorders after infection, and provide new insights on the drug development for the treatment of sars-cov-2 infections. methods: the main databases were used to search studies published up september 2021, focusing on the role of trace elements during viral infection and on the correct functioning of the brain. results: the imbalance of important trace elements can accelerate sars-cov-2 neurovirulence and increase the neurotoxicity since many neurological processes can be associated with the homeostasis of metal and metalloproteins. some studies involving animals and humans have suggested the synapse as a vulnerable region of the brain to neurological disorders after viral infection. considering the combined evidence, some mechanisms have been suggested to understand the relationship between neurological disorders and imbalance of trace elements in the brain after viral infection. conclusion: trace elements play important roles in viral infections, such as helping to activate immune cells, produce antibodies, and inhibit virus replication. however, the relationship between trace elements and virus infections is complex since the specific functions of several elements remain largely undefined. therefore, there is still a lot to be explored to understand the biochemical mechanisms involved between trace elements and viral infections, especially in the brain."
"as background for this article, several studies have suggested that covid-19 (a viral lung infection) is a full-body disease that can affect several organs, including the brain. in the brain, specifically, viral infection can cause imbalances of some nutrients that promote complex biochemical reactions in certain brain functions. the study's objective is to understand the disease-causing ability of sars-cov-2 (the virus causing covid-19) in the brain and the link between certain nutrients and brain disorders after infection. the objective is also to provide new insights on the drug creation for the treatment of sars-cov-2 infections. databases were used to search studies published up september 2021, focusing on the role of specific elements during viral infection and on the correct functioning of the brain. the imbalance of important elements can increase sars-cov-2 effects in the brain and increase the damage to the brain since many brain processes can be linked with the balance of metal and metal-carrying proteins. some studies involving animals and humans have suggested the link between brain cells as a vulnerable region of the brain to brain disorders after viral infection. considering all the evidence, some mechanisms have been suggested to understand the link between brain disorders and imbalance of specific elements in the brain after viral infection. in conclusion, certain elements play important roles in viral infections, such as helping to activate immune cells, produce antibodies that fight infections, and block virus growth. however, the link between specific elements and virus infections is complex since the specific functions of several elements is largely unknown. thus, there is much to be explored to understand the biochemical processes involved between specific elements and viral infections, especially in the brain."
"the importance of ferritin as an inflammatory marker is well recognized. however, it is unknown whether this differs between covid-19 and non-covid-19 patients. the blood levels of ferritin, white blood cells (wbc), c-reactive protein (crp), and lactate dehydrogenase may all be measured to check whether there is a difference. the researchers want to see if the inflammatory process changes between these two kinds (ldh). methodology: blood samples were collected from 119 covid-19 patients in the hospital and 50 healthy persons. corona virus was discovered when a nasopharyngeal swab was collected and tested using the rt-pcr technique. ferritin, ldh, wbc, and crp were also tested using min vidus, accent 200, ruby system, and latx in that sequence. the study revealed that covid-19 patients had higher levels of ferritin, wbc, crp, and ldh in their blood than healthy people, with values of 539,08 ng/ml, 44.7109/l, 22.95 mg/l, and 403.95 u/l for covid-19 patients versus 77.103 ng/ml, 4.9.4109/l, 6.53 mg/l, and 171.56 u/l for healthy people. according to the existing data, males are more likely to be infected with covid-19 (81%) than females (32%), and females had greater ferritin, crp, wbc, and ldh levels than males. because they are related to an optimum test for predicting covid-19 infection, the recommended cut-off values for ferritin, wbc, crp, and ldh are 109.8 ng/ml, 14.9109/l, 10.15 mg/l, and 229.33 u/l, respectively. finally, an increase in ferritin levels in the inflammatory response to covid-19 is linked to an increase in inflammatory markers including crp, wbc, and ldh, which may assist in the diagnosis of covid-19 infection."
"the importance of ferritin (an iron-containing protein) as an inflammatory marker is well known. however, it is unknown whether this differs between covid-19 (a viral lung infection) and non-covid-19 patients. the blood levels of ferritin, white blood cells (wbc - specific immune cells), c-reactive protein (crp - a marker of inflammation), and lactate dehydrogenase (ldh; an enzyme that helps make energy) may all be measured to check whether there is a difference. the researchers want to see if the inflammatory process changes between these two kinds. blood samples were collected from 119 covid-19 patients in the hospital and 50 healthy persons. corona virus (which causes covid-19) was discovered when a nose swab was collected and tested for fragments of the virus. ferritin, ldh, wbc, and crp were also tested in that sequence. the study revealed that covid-19 patients had higher levels of ferritin, wbc, crp, and ldh in their blood than healthy people. from the existing data, males are more likely to be infected with covid-19 (81%) than females (32%). females had greater ferritin, crp, wbc, and ldh levels than males. because they are related to a test for predicting covid-19 infection, the recommended cut-off values for ferritin, wbc, crp, and ldh are 109.8 ng/ml, 14.9109/l, 10.15 mg/l, and 229.33 u/l, respectively. finally, an increase in ferritin levels in the inflammatory response to covid-19 is linked to an increase in inflammatory markers including crp, wbc, and ldh. this understanding may assist in the identification of covid-19 infection."
"ferritin, which includes twenty-four light and heavy chains in varying proportions in different tissues, is primarily responsible for maintaining the body's iron metabolism. its normal value is between 10 and 200 ngml-1 in men and between 30-300 ngml-1 in women. iron is delivered to the tissue via them, and they act as immunomodulators, signaling molecules, and inflammatory markers. when ferritin level exceeds 1000 µgl-1, the patient is categorized as having hyperferritinemia. iron chelators such as deferiprone, deferirox, and deferoxamine are currently fda approved to treat iron overload. the inflammation cascade and poor prognosis of covid-19 may be attributed to high ferritin levels. critically ill patients can benefit from deferasirox, an iron chelator administered orally at 20-40 mgkg-1 once daily, as well as intravenous deferoxamine at 1000 mg initially followed by 500 mg every 4 to 12 hours. it can be combined with monoclonal antibodies, antioxidants, corticosteroids, and lactoferrin to make iron chelation therapy effective for covid-19 victims. in this article, we analyze the antiviral and antifibrotic activity of iron chelators, thereby promoting iron depletion therapy as a potentially innovative treatment strategy for covid-19."

"during infections, the host redistributes iron in order to starve pathogens from this nutrient. several proteins are involved in iron absorption, transport, and storage. ferritin is the most important iron storage protein. it is composed of variable proportions of two peptides, the l- and h-ferritins (ftl and fth). we previously showed that macrophages increase their expression of fth1 when they are infected in vitro with mycobacterium avium, without a significant increase in ftl. in this work, we investigated the role of macrophage fth1 in m. avium infection in vivo. we found that mice deficient in fth1 in myeloid cells are more resistant to m. avium infection, presenting lower bacterial loads and lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines than wild-type littermates, due to the lower levels of available iron in the tissues. importantly, we also found that fth1 produced by myeloid cells in response to infection may be found in circulation and that it plays a key role in iron redistribution. specifically, in the absence of fth1 in myeloid cells, increased expression of ferroportin is observed in liver granulomas and increased iron accumulation occurs in hepatocytes. these results highlight the importance of fth1 expression in myeloid cells for iron redistribution during infection."
"during infections, the human moves around iron in order to starve disease-causing molecules (pathogens) from this nutrient. several proteins are involved in iron absorption, transport, and storage. ferritin is the most important iron storage protein. it is made up of different amounts of two proteins, the l- and h-ferritins (ftl and fth). we previously showed that macrophages (specific immune cells) increase their amount of fth1 when they are infected as cells in a test tube with mycobacterium avium (bacteria related to tuberculosis), without a significant increase in ftl. in this work, we tested the role of macrophage fth1 in m. avium infection as cells in a living organism. we found that mice low in fth1 in myeloid cells (specific bone marrow cells) are more resistant to m. avium infection. they have lower bacterial amounts and lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (infection signaling molecules) than normal mice, due to the lower levels of available iron in their bodies. importantly, we also found that fth1 made by myeloid cells due to infection may be found in blood and that it plays a key role in iron redistribution. specifically, without fth1 in myeloid cells, increased amounts of ferroportin (iron-transporting proteins) is observed in liver granulomas (small areas of inflammation) and increased iron storage occurs in liver cells. these results show the importance of fth1 in myeloid cells for iron redistribution during infection."
