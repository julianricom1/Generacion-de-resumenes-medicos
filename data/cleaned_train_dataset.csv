"inborn errors of metabolism (iem) are hereditary diseases that affect how the body processes nutrients. they vary both in how they appear in a patient and in they underlying genetic causes. to date, more than 1000 different iem have been identified. though each individual disease is rare, taken altogether the rate has been shown to be upwards of 1 in 800. the way the diseases appear in patients can vary. this makes it difficult it diagnose them. iem are present in all ethnic groups and across every age. some iem can be treated, with promising outcomes. however, doctors suspecting these diseases from patient exams is not enough alone to reduce health problems and death. in the last decade, expanded newborn screening has become a mandatory public health strategy in most developed and developing countries. this is due to the advent of a chemical detection technology called tandem mass spectrometry. this technology allows more than 30 different metabolic disorders to be detected at low cost in one single blood spot specimen. the cost is about 10 dollars per baby, and the tests are highly accurate. studies of cost-effectiveness have confirmed that the savings from expanded newborn screening programs are much greater than the costs of running them. the side effects of false positives (when the test is positive but the patient does not have the disease) are not significant in light of the economic and health benefits produced by expanded newborn screening. further, these side effects could be lessened with more education, better communication, and improved technology. local screening agencies should be given the freedom to create their own screening programs so they can keep up with international advancements. improvements in knowledge of genes and how they affect the body are closely linked with expanded newborn screening. this knowledge is growing because of advancements in nanotechnology (working with things at the microscopic level) and molecular genomics (the study of how changes dna drive hereditary outcomes). the potential of tandem mass spectrometry is extending to cover more disorders. in fact, one promising example is the use of genetic markers for severe combined immunodeficiency (scid), a disease that makes people extremely vulnerable to germs. newborn screening represents the highest volume of genetic testing. it is more than a test and it calls for providing organized healthcare before, during, and after the test. there should be a comprehensive reporting system requiring genetic counselling as well as short-term and long-term follow-up. it is essential to integrate existing clinical iem services with the expanded newborn screening program. this is to enable close communication between the laboratory, clinicians, and allied health parties. in this article reviewing the topic, we will discuss the history of iem, how it appears in children and adults, and its rate among different ethnicities. we will also discuss the history and recent expansion of newborn screening, its cost-effectiveness, associated pros and cons, and the ethical issues that can arise. finally, we will discuss the technical aspects of tandem mass spectrometry and considerations for interpreting results.",0
"monoclonal antibodies are medicines recommended in mild to moderate covid-19 patients who are at risk of progressing to a severe stage of the disease. monoclonal antibodies are medicines that may block the virus that causes covid-19 (a breathing-related disease) from attaching to human cells, making it more difficult for the virus to reproduce. monoclonal antibodies are not widely used in the united states because there is little data on the impact of these drugs, and it is difficult to give these drugs to patients. this study aimed to assess the outcomes of monoclonal antibodies in patients who were mostly from ethnic minority groups and to study the challenges in providing the treatment in an inner-city hospital in the south bronx. researchers looked at data previously collected from 49 patients who were offered monoclonal antibody medicines. the 38 patients who received the monoclonal antibody therapy were put in the treatment group. eleven people did not want to receive the medicines, so they were made the comparison group. a majority of patients (76%) reported improvement in their symptoms the day after receiving the medicine. there was a big reduction in hospital stays due to covid-19 and death in the group that received monoclonal antibody medicines. monoclonal antibody medicines reduced both hospital stays and deaths in this predominantly hispanic group of patients with mild or moderate covid-19.",0
"fetal hemoglobin (hbf) makes the severity of sickle cell anemia (sca) better. the major specific genetic areas effecting hbf levels are in the hbb cluster, bcl11a, and hmip-2 (hbs1l-myb) genes. researchers need to know more about how the areas of these genes effect the process of hbf levels and the outcome of disease in sca. researchers analyzed the function and relationship of 14 mutations in 5 specific genetic areas of the genes with hbf levels and disease outcomes in 250 children with sca in southeastern brazil. they found single mutations that were linked to hbf levels in bcl11a and hmip-2a and hmip-2b genes. patients who had minor mutations (carriers) that increased hbf levels (hbf-boosting) had reduced white blood cells counts. carriers of other minor mutations (genetic differences) showed higher levels of oxygen in the blood. patients carrying still other minor genetic differences in bcl11a showed lower risk of transfusions. these findings were separate from the hbf effect. carriers of other minor mutations showed lower risk of acute chest syndrome. carriers of the standard minor genetic change showed lower risk of infection. patients carrying hbf-boosting minor mutations of bcl11a and hmip-2 genes had milder disease. higher hbf levels may be the cause of this effect.",0
"central nervous system adverse effects are commonly reported with pregabalin (pgb). on the other hand, movement disorders (mds) associated with this drug were rarely described. however, their occurrence could significantly affect the quality of life of pgb users. this literature review aims to evaluate the clinical epidemiological profile, pathological mechanisms, and management of pgb-associated mds. relevant reports in six databases were identified and assessed by two reviewers without language restriction. a total of 46 reports containing 305 cases from 17 countries were assessed. the mds encountered were as follows: 184 individuals with ataxia, 61 with tremors, 39 with myoclonus, 8 with parkinsonism, 1 with restless legs syndrome, 1 with dystonia, 1 with dyskinesia, and 1 with akathisia. the mean age was 62 years (range: 23-94). the male sex was slightly predominant with 54.34%. the mean pgb dose when the md occurred was 238 mg, and neuropathic pain was the most common indication of pgb. the time from pgb start to md was < 1 month at 75%. the time from pgb withdrawal to recovery was < 1 week at 77%. all the individuals where the follow-up was reported had a full recovery. the most common management was pgb withdrawal. in the literature, the majority of the cases did not report information about timeline events, neurological examination details, or electrodiagnostic studies. the best management for all mds is probably pgb withdrawal. if the patient is on dialysis program, perhaps an increased number of sessions will decrease recovery time. furthermore, the addition of a benzodiazepine could accelerate recovery.",1
"selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) are a recently developed class of drugs with significantly greater antidepressant efficacy than placebo. generally, in double-blind comparative trials, all ssris demonstrated antidepressant efficacy similar to that of the 'standard' tricyclic antidepressants amitriptyline and imipramine; a meta-analysis of controlled trials found the efficacy of the ssris to be equivalent to that of the 2 tricyclics. nevertheless, because of small patient numbers included in most studies that compare ssris with other antidepressants, no definitive statements about relative efficacy can be made. in these studies it is simply possible to state that no statistically significant differences were identified between ssris and the comparative antidepressants. importantly, differences in clinical characteristics exist between the ssris-differences in elimination half-life (t1/2 beta) between fluoxetine and/or its metabolite (total t1/2 beta = 330 hours) and other ssris (t1/2 beta range = 15 to 30 hours), for example. this has implications in terms of potential drug interactions and must be considered when patients have to be switched to treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors. studies with fluvoxamine have been conducted in both in- and outpatients, whereas trials with other ssris have been confined largely to outpatient populations. fluvoxamine has been associated with a high incidence of nausea (37%), although this may have resulted from high initial dosages (rather than upward dose titration protocols) used in early trials. of further interest, fluoxetine doses of 20mg may be sufficient to produce a satisfactory antidepressant response, and this ssri may be particularly useful in patients with chronic retarded depression. more clinical data are required before the efficacy of sertraline and citalopram relative to standard antidepressants can be clearly defined. preliminary data indicate that ssris are effective in the treatment of panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd), eating (e.g. anorexia and bulimia) and personality disorders (e.g. anger, impulsiveness) and substance abuse (e.g. alcoholism); early results with fluvoxamine in the treatment of panic disorder and ocd, and with fluoxetine in the treatment of bulimia, personality disorders and alcohol abuse, have been encouraging. ssris have a more favourable tolerability profile than tricyclic antidepressants and, unlike the tricyclics, are not associated with anticholinergic adverse effects, sedation, cardiotoxicity or weight gain. ssris are associated with a relatively high incidence of nausea, particularly if high doses are used at the start of treatment. however, the incidence of nausea appears to decrease as treatment is continued.",1
"sickle cell disease (scd) is a monogenetic disorder due to a single base-pair point mutation in the β-globin gene resulting in the substitution of the amino acid valine for glutamic acid in the β-globin chain. phenotypic variation in the clinical presentation and disease outcome is a characteristic feature of the disorder. understanding the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disorder is central to the choice of therapeutic development and intervention. in this special edition for newborn screening for haemoglobin disorders, it is pertinent to describe the genetic, pathologic and clinical presentation of sickle cell disease as a prelude to the justification for screening. through a systematic review of the literature using search terms relating to scd up till 2019, we identified relevant descriptive publications for inclusion. the scope of this review is mainly an overview of the clinical features of pain, the cardinal symptom in scd, which present following the drop in foetal haemoglobin as young as five to six months after birth. the relative impact of haemolysis and small-vessel occlusive pathology remains controversial, a combination of features probably contribute to the different pathologies. we also provide an overview of emerging therapies in scd.",1
"pacemakers are electronic devices that stimulate the heart with electrical impulses to maintain or restore a normal heartbeat. in 1952, a physician named zoll described an effective way of supporting patients with internal heart pacemaker activity and/or sending pulses through tissue by an artificial, electric, external pacemaker device. the pacing of the heart was accomplished by electrodes placed under the skin but could be maintained only for a short period. in 1957, complete heart block was treated using electrodes directly attached to the heart. these early observations started the idea that cardiac electrical failure (in which the heart cannot maintain a normal heart rate) can be controlled. it ultimately led to the development of the totally implantable (permanently under the skin) pacemaker by chardack, gage, and greatbatch. since then, there have been several advancements in pacemakers, and the modern-day permanent pacemaker is placed under the skin. there are 3 types of artificial pacemakers: implantable pulse generators; external, miniaturized, patient portable, battery-powered, pulse generators to temporarily control heart rates; console battery or ac-powered devices or monitors with high-current external pads placed on top of the skin, or low-current inside the body for temporary pacing in uncoordinated contracting of the heart or at infrequent times. all heart pacemakers consist of 2 components: a pulse generator which provides the electrical impulse for stimulation on the heart muscle and 1 or more electrodes or leads which deliver the electrical impulse from the generator to the heart muscle.",0
"neuropathic pain is caused by damage to the nervous system (like brain and spinal cord) and is often described as a shooting pain, burning sensation, or numbness. gabapentin is a common medication used to treat neuropathic pain, including neuropathic pain caused by diabetes. the objective of this study is to evaluate the role of diabetes and controlling blood sugar on people taking gabapentin. a clinical trial is conducted in patients with neuropathic pain due to type 2 diabetes (19 people) or a slipped disc in the neck or spine (10 people). all participants are treated with a single dose of gabapentin by mouth. blood is sampled up to 24 hours after gabapentin is given. data are analyzed using computer models. other information are included in the model including weight, sex, kidney functions and other changes in genes that impact how the medication works. the total clearance of gabapentin from the body depends on how well the kidneys are able to process and filter the drug. the estimated total clearance of the drug (completely removed) in the population is 14.7 liters per hour. no major association is found with having high blood sugar levels, a diabetes diagnosis, or with age, sex, weight or other factors evaluated. this model studying how the drug is processed in the body estimates gabapentin concentrations in patients with neuropathic pain. the distribution and clearance processes of gabapentin are not affected by having high blood sugar levels or diabetes.",0
"hyperhomocysteinemia (hhcy), when there is excess homocysteine in the blood, is a risk factor for cardiovascular, or blood- and heart-related, and cerebrovascular, or blood- and brain-related, diseases. homocysteine is an intermediate amino acid (molecule that form proteins). a specific genetic variation or gene change, known as c677t 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) gene polymorphism, which alters the mthfr protein involved in blood pressure, increases homocysteine (hcy) levels. this study analyzed the relationship between c677t mthfr variation and the therapeutic, beneficial effect (response after a treatment) of lowering hcy in stroke patients with hhcy. baseline data, meaning prior to treatment, was collected from stroke patients with hhcy for this study. the c677t mthfr genotype was detected, and the therapeutic effect to reduce hcy was compared. of 200 stroke patients, 162 completed follow-up and were evaluated. most of them responded well to treatment, but 59 patients were in the poor efficacy or poor effect group. there was a significant difference in terms of age, hypertension (high blood pressure), hyperuricemia (high uric acid or waste), hcy after treatment, and mthfr genotype between the poor efficacy and effective groups. the poor efficacy group had more participated with tt genotype of the genetic variant. statistical analysis showed that the t allele (an alternative form of a gene) was associated with poor efficacy. the tt genotype was associated with poor outcomes. the study concluded the t allele and tt genotype of the mthfr c677t genetic variation was associated with poor hcy reduction treatment efficacy in stroke patients with hhcy.",0
"we explored the terms used to refer to the mental and tiredness related side effects and their frequency in clinical trials of anti-seizure or anti-epileptic drugs (aeds). we took data from publicly available government documents and from public literature. target drug doses were calculated as drug amounts and divided into low, average, and high. we calculated the chances of developing side effects for each drug amount and if there was a link between the amount of dose and the bodily response. we found that mental terms used across trials varied. data on drug stoppage rates were limited. dummy treatment rates for mental side effects ranged from 0 to 10.6%. the same rates for fatigue ranged from 2.5 to 37.7%. with the inconsistent dummy treatment rates and terminology in mind, the majority of aeds showed a link between dose amount and bodily response. except for the drugs brivaracetam and zonisamide, they also showed increased chance of mental side effects at high doses. except for the drugs tiagabine, topiramate, and zonisamide, they also showed increased chance of fatigue side effects at high doses. due to their health-related relevance and impact on life, new trials should make data about the amount and stoppage rates of these side effects publicly available. given the clear link between dose amount and bodily response, physicians should consider lower drug amount to improve tolerability.",0
"vitamin d is a key regulator of the renin-angiotensin system that is exploited by sars-cov-2 for entry into the host cells. further, vitamin d modulates multiple mechanisms of the immune system to contain the virus that includes dampening the entry and replication of sars-cov-2, reduces concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increases levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, enhances the production of natural antimicrobial peptide and activates defensive cells such as macrophages that could destroy sars-cov-2.",1
"sickle cell anemia (sca) is caused by a single gene mutation. sca varies in different patients mainly due to the fetal hemoglobin (hbf) level in the blood. no large research studies have ever compared factors seen in patients with the major different beta-globin genetic types; for example, senegal (sen), benin (ben), and bantu/central african republic (car). this research studies the importance of alpha genes, different beta gene types, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd-an enzyme that protects red blood cells from damage) activity in patients before and after treatment with the medicine, hydroxyurea. this study included boys and girls who inherited the sickle hemoglobin (hbs) from both parents (ss -creteil pediatric group). facts about the alpha-gene and beta-globin genetic types were known. children who inherited the major different beta-globin genetic types from both parents made up 74% all patients car/car, ben/ben, and sen/sen. hydroxyurea (hu) was given to 168 children with sickle cell anemia (sca). factors in the blood were recorded when hbf was highest. changes were analyzed after hydroxyurea (hu) was given. before hu, the car beta-globin genetic type and the alpha-gene were separately linked to lower hemoglobin and higher lactate dehydrogenase (an enzyme from tissue damage). higher hbf was linked to lower car genetic type numbers but higher ben and sen genetic type numbers. a bcl11a gene mutation is linked to the favorable higher hbf levels. this gene mutation was also linked to higher ben, but lower car genetic type numbers. with hu treatment, positive changes and higher hbf numbers were linked to the ben genetic type. ben/ben patients had higher hbf and hemoglobin (hb) levelsthan car/car and sen/sen patients. this research shows that children inheriting ben mutations from both parents (ben/ben) have the best response on hydroxyurea. this could be related to the more likely presence of favorable genetic mutations for hbf production in these patients.",0
"most swallowing problems can be fixed, although the treatment depends on the type of trouble swallowing. a team of surgeons, doctors who treat organs involved in speech production, and people who treat communication and swallowing disorders is needed to figure out the best treatment. information provided by the patient, examination of the swallowing muscles, and using a flexible tube with a camera to see swallowing of different foods help decide whether swallowing exercises are enough, or whether drugs or surgery are also needed to prevent something entering the airway or lungs by accident, prevent a lack of nutrients in the body, and prevent a lack of fluid in the body.",0
"phenylketonuria (pku) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a large number of mutations at the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) locus, most of which are strongly associated with specific rflp or vntr haplotypes. one of the major questions remaining in pku research is why this apparently maladaptive disorder has been maintained at a frequency of approximately 1 in 10,000 among caucasians. a growing number of studies have provided evidence that both the relatively high frequency of pku and the strong mutation/haplotype associations might reflect the existence of multiple founding populations for pku. examples of putative founding populations for pku in both europe and asia will be presented. some pah mutations are associated with multiple haplotypes, suggesting recurrence. evidence for and against recurrence as the mechanism responsible for the association of the r408w mutation with rflp haplotypes 1 and 2 will be discussed.",1
"researchers studied ways to treat patients with upper respiratory tract symptoms due to disorder of a nerve supplying sensation (sensory neuropathy) to the throat-the recurrent laryngeal nerve. researchers studied patients who had symptoms of sensory neuropathy including disorders of speech (dysphonia), spasms of the muscles of the voice box (laryngospasm), and chronic cough. the patients were followed to see if their symptoms improved after starting a neuromodulator (a drug that has an effect on nerves). patients were asked if the drug improved their symptoms. in 12 patients, tests showed 75% had motor neuropathy (disorder of the nerves controlling the muscles) of the throat. also, 83% had chronic cough treated with a neuromodulator. they were followed for about 20 months. two neuromodulator drugs were used in the study, amitriptyline hydrochloride (about 25 mg a day) and gabapentin (about 300 mg three times a day). it took about 2 months for complete symptom improvement after the drugs were first started. these neuromodulator drugs often help the symptoms if doctors suspect neuropathy of the recurrent laryngeal nerve as the cause. in patients with chronic cough and recurrent laryngospasm, doctors may add therapy to prevent reflux and decrease stoamch acid. patient who have motor neuropathy seem to have better improvement with neuromodulator drugs.",0
"the role of undetected infection within the uterus in preterm labor (between week 20 and 27 of pregnancy) was evaluated in 40 patients and control subjects. the 24 preterm labor patients with a negative (no detection) c-reactive protein value responded to tocolysis, a procedure to delay delivery, most of the time. these patients had an average delay of delivery for 35.5 days and an average gestational (pregnant) age of 36.9 weeks. c-reactive protein is a type of protein found in the blood that increases during times of internal inflammation (redness and swelling from infection-fighting). the 16 patients with a positive (with detection of) c-reactive protein value responded to tocolysis less than half of the time. these patients had an average delay of delivery of 14.4 days and an average gestational age of 33.2 weeks. evidence of chorioamnionitis, an infection within the membranes surrounding a fetus, was present in 32.9% of 310 preterm deliveries. evidence of chorioamnionitis was only found in 22.3% of 1631 term deliveries. the presence of undetected infection must be considered in cases of preterm labor, especially among patients for whom tocolytic therapy is unsuccessful.",0
"phenylketonuria (pku) is an inborn error of metabolism (iem) most often caused by missense mutations in the gene encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) which catalyzes the hydroxylation of phenylalanine (phe) generating tyrosine (tyr). pku belongs to a class of amino acid aminoacidopathies termed “toxic accumulation-iems” where the circulating toxin is an amino acid or its metabolites. mutations in an enzyme, such as pah, are recessive since one functioning enzyme with the wild-type allele is sufficient. tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4) binds to the catalytic domain of pah and is a cofactor for this reaction. pah is primarily a hepatic enzyme. elevated blood phe levels and decreased tyr levels characterize pku. newborns with pku can appear normal at birth with the first signs appearing after several months. these signs can include musty odor from skin and urine, fair skin, eczema, seizures, tremors, and hyperactivity.",1
"treatment of bedsores is a serious medical problem. often, a bedsore is hard to cure, especially when it is deep and covers a large area, and usually has a poor prognosis (plan for recovery). treating bedsores requires specialized dressings, which play an important role in the healing process. we aim to rate how well active specialized dressings, which promote healing by keeping the wound moist, work to treat bedsores. we looked at 40 patients, 18 (45%) women and 22 (55%) men, with bedsores differing in size and depth, located near the bottom of the spine, lasting from 1.5 to 3.0 months. we randomly assigned patients to two groups of 20 people each and treated them with two different specialist dressings for 4 weeks. we used atrauman ag, which contains silver ions, in the first group and paraffin (waxy) gauze of bactigras type in the second group. we measured the progress of bedsore healing by measuring the wound's boundaries, which calculates the surface area. results showed average bedsore surface area significantly decreased in the first group by 60.2% and in the second group by 32.95%, suggesting dressings with silver ions worked better. we conclude that specialist dressings significantly decrease bedsore surface area, and dressings with silver ions work better than those without.",0
"the covid-19 virus has caused a pandemic in humans and targets the organs and tissues that help people breathe. it also causes viral pneumonia which is an infection in the lungs. this unusual viral pneumonia is quickly spreading to all parts of the world and is currently impacting about 105 million people with 2.3 million deaths. reviews describe the history of the covid-19 virus, its genetic make-up, how it replicates, and how it develops with attention to nigella sativum (n. sativum), a black seed from a plant that may be a possible treatment. n. sativum seeds have been used for centuries, both for prevention and treatment of different diseases. this review summarizes the potential role of n. sativum seeds against covid-19 infection using computers and lab and animal experiments.",0
"phosphatidylserine (ps), a fatty substance, may have beneficial effects on cognitive (or thinking-related) functions. this study evaluated the effectiveness of a unique formula of ps (ps-dha or ps with omega-3 fatty acids) in non-demented elderly with memory complaints. the study evaluated 157 participants. the participants were randomly assigned one of two treatment groups: ps-dha or placebo (sham treatment). treatments were given for 15 weeks. effectiveness measures were assessed before and after treatment. clinicians' global impression of change (a point scale to determine if illness has improved) was assessed (measured) following 7 and 15 weeks of treatment. 131 participants completed the study. however, 9 were excluded as they did not follow the study rules. at the end of the study, verbal immediate recall was significantly improved in the ps-dha group compared to the placebo group. post-study analysis showed that a subset of participants with relatively good cognitive performance prior to treatment had significant treatment-associated improvements in cognitive function. these favorable results were further supported by the proportion of participants who achieved a pre-defined level of improvement. the results indicate that ps-dha may improve cognitive performance in non-demented elderly with memory complaints. post-study analysis of subgroups suggests that participants with higher baseline cognitive status were most likely to respond to ps-dha. the results of this study should be followed up by additional studies to confirm the tentative conclusions made here.",0
"this article aims to cover the basics of how well levothyroxine (lt4 - a common thyroid medication) is absorbed when taken by mouth, reasons why people may have continuously high blood levels of thyroid stimulating hormone, and other ways to take levothyroxine. although lt4 tablets taken by mouth are most commonly used for thyroid hormone replacement in people with underactive thyroids, studies show that taking lt4 in liquid-form by mouth, shot to a vein or muscle, and through the rectum can work to treat poorly-controlled underactive thyroid. underactive thyroid is one of the most common hormone disorders doctors see. lt4 is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in the world and is the recommended treatment for underactive thyroid. generally, people with underactive thyroids will take lt4 tablets by mouth and track thryoid levels with common blood thyroid tests, including measuring levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone. taking lt4 tablets by mouth does not keep blood thyroid-stimulating hormone levels at the right level for many people. some of these people may have poorly-controlled underactive thyroids, or refractory underactive thyroids. this group of people might need to take lt4 in other forms or other ways, including liquid-form by mouth, shot to a vein or muscle, or even through the rectum.",0
"animal and human studies suggest that vitamin b6 deficiency affects both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. lymphocyte differentiation and maturation are altered by deficiency, delayed-type hypersensitivity responses are reduced, and antibody production may be indirectly impaired. although repletion of the vitamin restores these functions, megadoses do not produce benefits beyond those observed with moderate supplementation. additional human studies indicate that vitamin b6 status may influence tumor growth and disease processes. deficiency of the vitamin has been associated with immunological changes observed in the elderly, persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), and those with uremia or rheumatoid arthritis. future research efforts should focus on establishing the mechanism underlying the effects of vitamin b6 on immunity and should attempt to establish safe intake levels that optimize immune response.",1
"uncontrolled bleeding is the leading cause of shock in trauma patients. delays in recognition and treatment have been linked to adverse outcomes. for quick detection and management of hypovolemic shock, atls(®) suggests four shock classes. these classes are based upon vital signs and an estimated blood loss in percent. hypovolemic shock is due to volume loss with blood vessels or blood vascular system. although this classification has been widely used, there is no clear evidence to fully support this classification. in contrast, it has recently been shown that this classification may be associated with substantial deficits. evaluation of data derived from the traumaregister dgu(®) indicated only 9.3% of all trauma patients could be placed into one of the atls(®) shock classes when a combination of the three vital signs was assessed (measured). because of this, more than 90% of all trauma patients could not be classified according to the atls(®) classification of hypovolemic shock. further review included data from the uk-based tarn registry. this evaluation suggested that atls(®) may overestimate the degree of tachycardia (high heart rate) associated with low blood pressure and underestimate mental disability in the presence of hypovolemic shock. this finding was independent from pre-hospital treatment and from the presence or absence of a severe traumatic brain injury. the underlying trauma mechanism, or what caused the injury, had no influence on the number of patients who could be categorized. considering these potential gaps associated with the atls(®) classification of hypovolemic shock, an online survey was conducted. the survey assessed 383 european atls(®) course instructors and directors. the survey was completed to assess the understanding and confidence in this tool during daily clinical trauma care. less than half of all respondents declared that they would assess a potential circulatory depletion within the primary survey according to the atls(®) classification of hypovolemic shock. based on these observations, a critical reappraisal (revision) of the current atls(®) classification of hypovolemic is needed.",0
"as covid-19 (a viral respiratory disease) spreads rapidly worldwide and variants emerge, the creation and use of safe, effective vaccines are urgently needed. here, we created a pre-protein, moleculer vaccine based on a specific molecular region (labeled tf-rbd) of a unique protein combined to iron-containing molecules. compared to the molecular vaccine binding to the region without iron, vaccines binding the same region but with iron-containing molecules delivered via muscle show vigorous, long-lasting immunity and specific immune responses. after adding the live respiratory virus, immunization with a two-shot low-dose schedule of the tf-rbd vaccine protected infected mice. also, the molecular template of the tf-rbd vaccine was easily altered to address specific respiratory viral mutations. the tf-rbd, multi-variant-sensitive vaccine created general-purpose antibodies against multiple variants. this molecular vaccine based on a specific, self-created, triple-unit region is a model for creating molecular vaccines targeting the respiratory sars-cov-2 virus.",0
"newborn screening is important for the early detection of many hereditary and metabolic disorders. it is aimed at the earliest possible recognition and management of affected newborns, to prevent the health problems, deaths, and disabilities associated with an inherited metabolic disorder. this comprehensive system includes; testing, education, follow up, diagnosis, treatment, management, and evaluation. there are major differences among many of the disorders being considered for inclusion in newborn screening programs. in recent times, advances in laboratory technology such as tandem mass spectrometry (ms/ms), has increased the number of genetic conditions that can be diagnosed through newborn screening programs at birth. with a single dried filter paper blood spot, ms/ms can identify more than 30 inherited metabolic disorders in around two to three minutes. advances have been made in the diagnosis and treatment of genetic disorders related to metabolism. our understanding of the natural history of these disorders has also increased. both these improvements have produced pressure to implement expanded newborn screening programs in many countries. even as many countries throughout the world have made newborn screening mandatory, in iran, nationwide newborn screening for inherited metabolic disorders has not been started, except for hypothyroidism. because of this, there is not much information about these diseases. this article aims to review the recent advances in newborn metabolic screening and its situation in iran and other countries.",0
"we aimed to test the effect of monoclonal antibodies (mabs), antibodies that bind to only one site of a foreign organism. we determine if mabs may help grow mutated virus variants that may weaken mab effectiveness. we test the effect of mabs on the virus species and amount in the upper throat of mab-treated patients. the mabs used were: bamlanivimab alone (4 patients), bamlanivimab/etesevimab (23 patients), and casirivimab/imdevimab (5 patients). the amount of sars-cov-2 viruses, which cause a respiratory illness, in the upper throats of mab-treated patients decreased 7 days after treatment. five patients with an impaired immune system and given bamlanivimab/etesevimab had mutations that reduced the effect of mabs. two patients with sars-cov-2 variants had a mutations 7 days after treatment, along with a third patient 14 days after treatment. the fourth patient had a variant with a mutation 7 days after treatment, along with a fifth patient on day 21. the onset of the mutation came with a rebound or stabilization of virus amount in 3/5 patients. two-mab treatment can lead to resistant sars-cov-2 variants in patients with an impaired immune system. patients given mabs should be monitored and measures to limit virus spread reinforced.",0
"hiatus hernia refers to conditions in which elements of the abdominal cavity, most commonly the stomach, herniate through the oesophageal hiatus into the mediastinum. with the most common type (type i or sliding hiatus hernia) this is associated with laxity of the phrenooesophageal membrane and the gastric cardia herniates. sliding hiatus hernia is readily diagnosed by barium swallow radiography, endoscopy, or manometry when greater than 2 cm in axial span. however, the mobility of the oesophagogastric junction precludes the reliable detection of more subtle disruption by endoscopy or radiography. detecting lesser degrees of axial separation between the lower oesophageal sphincter and crural diaphragm can only be reliably accomplished with high-resolution manometry, a technique that permits real time localization of these oesophagogastric junction components without swallow or distention related artefact.",1
"postpartum depression is one of the most prevalent psychopathologies. its prevalence is estimated to be between 10% and 15%. despite its multifactorial etiology, it is known that genetics play an important role in the genesis of this disorder. this paper reviews epidemiological evidence supporting the role of genetics in postpartum depression (ppd). the main objectives of this review are to determine which genes and polymorphisms are associated with ppd and discuss how this association may occur. in addition, this paper explores whether these genes are somehow related to or even the same as those linked to major depression (md). to identify gaps in the current knowledge that require investigation, a systematic review was conducted in the electronic databases pubmed, lilacs and scielo using the index terms ""postpartum depression"" and ""genetics"". literature searches for articles in peer-reviewed journals were made until april 2014. ppd was indexed 56 times with genetics. the inclusion criteria were articles in portuguese, spanish or english that were available by institutional means or sent by authors upon request; this search resulted in 20 papers. genes and polymorphisms traditionally related to md, which are those involved in the serotonin, catecholamine, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and tryptophan metabolism, have been the most studied, and some have been related to ppd. the results are conflicting and some depend on epigenetics, which makes the data incipient. further studies are required to determine the genes that are involved in ppd and establish the nature of the relationship between these genes and ppd.",1
"background: whereas the frequency of alopecia to cytotoxic chemotherapies has been well described, the incidence of alopecia during endocrine therapies (i.e., anti-estrogens, aromatase inhibitors) has not been investigated. endocrine agents are widely used in the treatment and prevention of many solid tumors, principally those of the breast and prostate. adherence to these therapies is suboptimal, in part because of toxicities. we performed a systematic analysis of the literature to ascertain the incidence and risk for alopecia in patients receiving endocrine therapies. results: data from 19,430 patients in 35 clinical trials were available for analysis. of these, 13,415 patients had received endocrine treatments and 6,015 patients served as controls. the incidence of all-grade alopecia ranged from 0% to 25%, with an overall incidence of 4.4% (95% confidence interval: 3.3%-5.9%). the highest incidence of all-grade alopecia was observed in patients treated with tamoxifen in a phase ii trial (25.4%); similarly, the overall incidence of grade 2 alopecia by meta-analysis was highest with tamoxifen (6.4%). the overall relative risk of alopecia in comparison with placebo was 12.88 (p < .001), with selective estrogen receptor modulators having the highest risk. conclusion: alopecia is a common yet underreported adverse event of endocrine-based cancer therapies. their long-term use heightens the importance of this condition on patients' quality of life. these findings are critical for pretherapy counseling, the identification of risk factors, and the development of interventions that could enhance adherence and mitigate this psychosocially difficult event.",1
"objective: to determine the effect of morning exercise in the fasting condition vs afternoon exercise on blood glucose responses to resistance exercise (re). research design and methods: for this randomized crossover design, 12 participants with type 1 diabetes mellitus [nine females; aged 31 ± 8.9 years; diabetes duration, 19.1 ± 8.3 years; hba1c, 7.4% ± 0.8% (57.4 ± 8.5 mmol/mol)] performed ∼40 minutes of re (three sets of eight repetitions, seven exercises, at the individual's predetermined eight repetition maximum) at either 7 am (fasting) or 5 pm. sessions were performed at least 48 hours apart. venous blood samples were collected immediately preexercise, immediately postexercise, and 60 minutes postexercise. interstitial glucose was monitored overnight postexercise by continuous glucose monitoring (cgm). results: data are presented as mean ± sd. blood glucose rose during fasting morning exercise (9.5 ± 3.0 to 10.4 ± 3.0 mmol/l), whereas it declined with afternoon exercise (8.2 ± 2.5 to 7.4 ± 2.6 mmol/l; p = 0.031 for time-by-treatment interaction). sixty minutes postexercise, blood glucose concentration was significantly higher after fasting morning exercise than after afternoon exercise (10.9 ± 3.2 vs 7.9 ± 2.9 mmol/l; p = 0.019). cgm data indicated more glucose variability (2.7 ± 1.1 vs 2.0 ± 0.7 mmol/l; p = 0.019) and more frequent hyperglycemia (12 events vs five events; p = 0.025) after morning re than after afternoon re. conclusions: compared with afternoon re, morning (fasting) re was associated with distinctly different blood glucose responses and postexercise profiles.",1
"total knee arthroplasty (tka) is among the most common elective procedures performed worldwide. recent efforts have been made to significantly improve patient outcomes, specifically with postoperative rehabilitation. despite the many rehabilitation modalities available, the optimal rehabilitation strategy has yet to be determined. therefore, this systematic review focuses on evaluating existing postoperative rehabilitation protocols. specifically, this review analyses the study designs, rehabilitation methods, and outcome measures of postoperative rehabilitation protocols for tka recipients in the past five years. the pubmed, embase, and cochrane library databases were queried for studies evaluating rehabilitation protocols following primary tka. of the 11,013 studies identified within the last five years, 70 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. after assessing for relevance and removing duplicates, a final count of 20 studies remained for analysis. level-of-evidence was determined by the american academy of orthopaedic surgeons (aaos) classification system. our findings demonstrated that continuous passive motion and inpatient rehabilitation may not provide additional benefit to the patient or healthcare system. however, early rehabilitation, telerehabilitation, outpatient therapy, high intensity, and high velocity exercise may be successful forms of rehabilitation. additionally, weight-bearing biofeedback, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, and balance control appear to be beneficial adjuncts to conventional rehabilitation. postoperative rehabilitation following tka facilitates patient recovery and improves quality of life. this systematic review analyzed the existing rehabilitation protocols from the past five years. some studies did not accurately describe the conventional rehabilitation protocols, the duration of therapy sessions, and the timing of these sessions. as such, future studies should explicitly describe their methodology. this will allow high-quality assessments and the conception of standardized protocols.",1
"no clinical trials with patients have been developed to compare medical treatments after surgery in parkinson's disease (a brain disorder that affects movement and coordination). the objective of this study is to compare the performance and safety of levodopa (a drug that enters the brain and helps replace missing dopamine, a chemical that carries signals between brain cells) versus dopamine agonist (a drug that imitates the actions of dopamine in the body) single therapy after deep brain stimulation (surgery that implants devices to stimulate certain areas of the brain) in patients with parkinson's disease. in this study, 35 patients who are planning to undergo surgery are randomly assigned to receive either levodopa or dopamine agonist after surgery. all patients are evaluated in short (3 months), mid (6 months), and long-term (2.5 years) follow-up appointments after the surgery. the key outcome (result) researchers planned to evaluate is the change in the non-motor symptoms scale, a scale to count and measure severity of non-motor (unrelated to movement) symptoms such as pain and tiredness, 3 months after surgery. a second outcome is the percent of patients staying on only one drug, change in motor (movement) symptoms, and specific non-motor symptoms. the analysis mainly focuses on the patients who were enrolled and randomly assigned to treatment. being randomly assigned into treatments did not significantly affect the key outcome from the non-motor symptoms scale between the two treatment groups. in the 3-month and 6-month follow-up appointments, single therapy (only one drug) is safe and practical in more than half of patients, but it was more often possible for patients on levodopa. the ability to maintain dopamine agonist as the only treatment drug is related to the best contact location. in the 2.5 year follow-up, levodopa single therapy is feasible only in a small number of patients, whereas dopamine agonist single therapy is not tolerated (unable to handle side effects) due to worsening of motor conditions or occurrence of impulse control disorders (disorders in which temptations or thoughts cannot be resisted). in conclusion, this study provides evidence for simplifying drug treatment after brain surgery for parkinson's disease. the reduction in dopamine agonists should be attempted while monitoring for development of non-motor symptoms, such as lack of motivation and sleep disturbances.",0
"achalasia is an esophageal motility disorder characterized by aberrant peristalsis and insufficient relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter. patients most commonly present with dysphagia to solids and liquids, regurgitation, and occasional chest pain with or without weight loss. high-resolution manometry has identified 3 subtypes of achalasia distinguished by pressurization and contraction patterns. endoscopic findings of retained saliva with puckering of the gastroesophageal junction or esophagram findings of a dilated esophagus with bird beaking are important diagnostic clues. in this american college of gastroenterology guideline, we used the grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation process to provide clinical guidance on how best to diagnose and treat patients with achalasia.",1
"diets low in carbohydrates and proteins but high in fat stimulate the liver to make fat-related energy molecules called ketone bodies (kb). ketone bodies are molecules used as alternate fuel to produce energy for tissues in the body. making and using ketone bodies is carefully controlled within the body at the molecule and hormone level. one hormone, known as the master regulator of the process to develop ketone bodies, helps activate the cell networks that control fatty acids and ketogenesis, the process that creates ketone bodies. new factors, such as circadian rhythms (the natural cycle of mental and physical changes in the body over 24 hours) and paracrine signals (cell signaling to communicate with other cells nearby), are becoming important aspects of this metabolic regulation that controls and monitors cell energy stores. however, ketone bodies are currently considered not only as an energy supply but also as signaling molecules that send messages to other cells or parts of the body. ketogenic diets are currently used to treat different forms of infantile epilepsy (the onset of seizures in infancy), which is also caused by genetic defects. however, several researchers are now focusing on the possibility to use ketogenic diets in other diseases, such as cancer, brain-related and metabolic disorders. nonetheless, clear-cut evidence of the performance of ketogenic bodies in other disorders is needed in order to suggest using such diets.",0
"pallister-hall syndrome (phs) is a rare disorder caused by mutations in gli3 that produce a transcriptional repressor (gli3r). individuals with phs present with a variably penetrant variety of urogenital system malformations, including renal aplasia or hypoplasia, hydroureter, hydronephrosis or a common urogenital sinus. the embryologic mechanisms controlled by gli3r that result in these pathologic phenotypes are undefined. we demonstrate that germline expression of gli3r causes renal hypoplasia, associated with decreased nephron number, and hydroureter and hydronephrosis, caused by blind-ending ureters. mice with obligate gli3r expression also displayed duplication of the ureters that was caused by aberrant common nephric duct patterning and ureteric stalk outgrowth. these developmental abnormalities are associated with suppressed hedgehog signaling activity in the cloaca and adjacent vesicular mesenchyme. mice with conditional expression of gli3r were utilized to identify lineage-specific effects of gli3r. in the ureteric bud, gli3r expression decreased branching morphogenesis. in six2-positive nephrogenic progenitors, gli3r decreased progenitor cell proliferation reducing the number of nephrogenic precursor structures. using mutant mice with gli3r and gli3 null alleles, we demonstrate that urogenital system patterning and development is controlled by the levels of gli3r and not by an absence of full-length gli3. we conclude that the urogenital system phenotypes observed in phs are caused by gli3r-dependent perturbations in nephric duct patterning, renal branching morphogenesis and nephrogenic progenitor self-renewal.",1
"as of january 20, 2021, a total of 24,135,690 cases of covid-19 (a viral, respiratory disease) and 400,306 associated deaths have been reported in the united states. in december 2020, the food and drug administration (fda) issued an emergency use authorization, where unapproved medicines are allowed to be used, for the moderna covid-19 vaccine given as 2 doses, 1 month apart to prevent covid-19. a group of medical and public health experts called the advisory committee on immunization practices made a temporary recommendation for using the moderna vaccine. as of january 2021, a reported 4,041,396 first doses of the moderna vaccine have been given in the united states. additionally, reports of 1,266 (0.03%) unexpected serious side effects (adverse events) after receiving the moderna vaccine are sent to the vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers), a national vaccine safety tracking system that accepts reports of adverse events after vaccination. among these adverse events, 108 cases are identified for additional review for possible cases of severe allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis - a life-threatening allergic reaction. anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction that occurs rarely after vaccination and usually starts within minutes to hours of receiving the vaccine. among these case reports, 10 cases are determined to be anaphylaxis, including 9 in people with a history of allergies or allergic reactions, 5 of whom had a previous history of anaphylaxis. the average time from receiving the vaccine to symptoms of anaphylaxis starting is 7.5 minutes, but the time ranges between 1 minute - 45 minutes. among 8 people with follow-up information available, all have recovered or are sent home. among the remaining reports that are not anaphylaxis, 47 are found to be allergic reactions that are not anaphylaxis, and 47 are considered nonallergic adverse events. for 4 case or individual's reports, investigators have been unable to obtain enough information to assess the possibility of anaphylaxis. this report summarizes the case reports of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and allergic reactions that are not anaphylaxis, after receiving the first dose of the moderna vaccine during december 21, 2020-january 10, 2021, in the united states. cdc has issued updated temporary clinical guidance for use of covid-19 vaccines currently allowed in the united states and temporary guidance for preparing for people who experience anaphylaxis.",0
"increased infection-fighting (inflammatory) molecules and lasting (chronic) pain are associated with shorter white blood cell gene end or telomere length (ltl), a measure of cellular aging. micronutrients, such as 25-hydroxyvitamin d (vitamin d) and omega 3, have anti-inflammatory properties. little is known about the relationships between vitamin d, omega 6:3 ratio, ltl, inflammation, and chronic pain. we investigate links between vitamin d, omega 6:3 ratio, ltl, and c-reactive protein (crp, a marker of imflammation) in people living with/without chronic pain overall and grouped by chronic pain status. an analysis of 402 individuals (63% women, 79.5% with chronic pain) was done. basic and health information was collected. chronic pain was measured as pain experienced for at least three months. ltl was measured in gene dna isolated from blood white blood cells, and micronutrients and crp were measured in blood samples. data were analyzed with general mathematical analysis. although a link between the continuous micronutrients and ltl was not found, a positive link between omega 6:3 ratio and crp was detected. in individuals with chronic pain, based on medical categories, significant links between vitamin d, omega 6:3 ratio, and crp were observed. findings show the complex relationships between anti-inflammatory micronutrients, inflammation, cellular aging, and chronic pain.",0
"histone deacetylase (hdac) enzymes regulate transcription through epigenetic modification of chromatin structure, but their specific functions in the kidney remain elusive. we discovered that the human kidney expresses class i hdacs. kidney medulla-specific inhibition of class i hdacs in the rat during high-salt feeding results in hypertension, polyuria, hypokalemia, and nitric oxide deficiency. three new inducible murine models were used to determine that hdac1 and hdac2 in the kidney epithelium are necessary for maintaining epithelial integrity and maintaining fluid-electrolyte balance during increased dietary sodium intake. moreover, single-nucleus rna-sequencing determined that epithelial hdac1 and hdac2 are necessary for expression of many sodium or water transporters and channels. in performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of serious adverse events associated with clinical hdac inhibitor use, we found that hdac inhibitors increased the odds ratio of experiencing fluid-electrolyte disorders, such as hypokalemia. this study provides insight on the mechanisms of potential serious adverse events with hdac inhibitors, which may be fatal to critically ill patients. in conclusion, kidney tubular hdacs provide a link between the environment, such as consumption of high-salt diets, and regulation of homeostatic mechanisms to remain in fluid-electrolyte balance.",1
"background: inflammation-mediated lung injury is a major cause of health problems in many countries and has been the leading cause of morbidity/mortality in intensive care units. in the current covid-19 pandemic, the majority of the patients experienced serious pneumonia resulting from inflammation (acute respiratory distress syndrome/ards). pathogenic infections cause cytokine release syndrome (crs) by hyperactivation of immune cells, which in turn release excessive cytokines causing ards. currently, there are no standard therapies for viral, bacterial or pathogen-mediated crs. purpose: this study aimed to investigate and validate the protective effects of dehydrozingerone (dhz) against lps induced lung cell injury by in-vitro and in-vivo models and to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms that mediate these therapeutic effects. methods: the therapeutic activity of dhz was determined in in-vitro models by pre-treating the cells with dhz and exposed to lps to stimulate the inflammatory cascade of events. we analysed the effect of dhz on lps induced inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and cell damage markers expression/levels using various cell lines. we performed gene expression, elisa, and western blot analysis to elucidate the effect of dhz on inflammation and its modulation of mapk and nf-κb pathways. further, the prophylactic and therapeutic effect of dhz was evaluated against the lps induced ards model in rats. results: dhz significantly (p < 0.01) attenuated the lps induced ros, inflammatory cytokine, chemokine gene expression and protein release in macrophages. similarly, dhz treatment protected the lung epithelial and endothelial cells by mitigating the lps induced inflammatory events in a dose-dependent manner. in vivo analysis showed that dhz treatment significantly (p < 0.001) mitigated the lps induced ards pathophysiology of increase in the inflammatory cells in balf, inflammatory cytokine and chemokines in lung tissues. lps stimulated neutrophil-mediated events, apoptosis, alveolar wall thickening and alveolar inflammation were profoundly reduced by dhz treatment in a rat model. conclusion: this study demonstrates for the first time that dhz has the potential to ameliorate lps induced ards by inhibiting cytokine storm and oxidative through modulating the mapk and nf-κb pathways. this data provides pre-clinical support to develop dhz as a potential therapeutic agent against ards.",1
"in december 2020, the food and drug administration (fda) issued emergency use authorizations (when unapproved medicines may be used) for pfizer-biontech and moderna covid-19 vaccines (vaccines for the viral, respiratory disease). in february 2021, the fda issued an emergency authorization for the janssen (johnson & johnson) covid-19 vaccine. after each emergency authorization was issued, short-term recommendations for vaccine use were issued. currently, pfizer is authorized and recommended for persons aged 12 years or older and moderna and janssen for persons aged 18 years and older. the pfizer and moderna vaccines require two shots and use a strand of genetic code that the body uses to build a protein that’s found in the coronavirus. the janssen vaccine requires one shot and delivers instructions by dna that the virus cannot replicate. as of july 22, 2021, 187 million people in the united states received at least one shot of the covid-19 vaccine, and it has been demonstrated that serious side effects are rare. three medical conditions have been reported after getting the covid-19 vaccine, but the association between these conditions and the vaccine is mainly based on timing, in which the condition and vaccine occur around the same time. two of these conditions are reported after getting the johnson & johnson vaccine. they are 1) thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome [tts], a rare condition with blood clots in the veins and arteries and low blood platelet counts (platelets help the body form blood clots to stop bleeding from injury), and 2) guillain-barré syndrome [gbs], a rare disorder characterized by muscle weakness and paralysis. one condition (myocarditis, cardiac inflammation or heart-related swelling from an infection) has been reported after the pfizer or moderna vaccine, usually after the second dose. these two vaccines will be referred to as mrna covid-19 vaccination. data associated with these reports of serious side effects, in addition to the benefits and risks associated with vaccination, have been reviewed by the advisory committee on immunization practices (acip). during the most recent meeting in july 2021, acip determined that, overall, the benefits of covid-19 vaccination in preventing covid-19 illness and death outweigh the risks for these rare serious side effects in adults aged 18 years or older. this balance of benefits and risks was different by age and sex. acip continues to recommend covid-19 vaccination in all people aged 12 years and older. cdc and fda continue to closely monitor reports of serious side effects and will present any additional data to acip for review. information on risks and how they vary by age, sex, and type of vaccine should be shared with providers, people who receive the vaccine, and the public.",0
"tardive dyskinesia (td) is characterized by uncontrolled movements, usually of the face muscles and also of the arms, legs, and other muscles. td is related to antipsychotic use. because reasons to prescribe and unapproved uses for antipsychotics have increased, more patients are taking antipsychotic drugs than in the past. although data suggest that patients taking second-generation (newer) antipsychotics are less likely to develop td than those taking first-generation (older) antipsychotics, the decreased risk is not as great as originally thought. in addition, patients with long-term mental conditions often need long-term antipsychotics use, putting them at risk for td. this article looks at the total number of td cases at a given time, risk factors, and prevention of td; ways to measure td including signs and symptoms and questionnaires; and td treatments, including 2 newly approved drugs: deutetrabenazine and valbenazine.",0
"purpose: to investigate the comparative effectiveness of dopamine agonists and monoamine oxidase type-b (mao-b) inhibitors available for treatment of parkinson's disease. methods: we performed a systematic literature search identifying randomized controlled trials investigating 4 dopamine agonists (cabergoline, pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine) and 3 mao-b inhibitors (selegiline, rasagiline, safinamide) for parkinson's disease. we extracted and pooled data from included clinical trials in a joint model allowing both direct and indirect comparison of the seven drugs. we considered dopamine agonists and mao-b inhibitors given as monotherapy or in combination with levodopa. selected endpoints were change in the unified parkinson's disease rating scale (updrs) score, serious adverse events and withdrawals. we estimated the relative effectiveness of each dopamine agonist and mao-b inhibitor versus comparator drug. results: altogether, 79 publications were included in the analysis. we found all the investigated drugs to be effective compared with placebo when given as monotherapy except safinamide. when considering combination treatment, the estimated relative effects of selegiline, pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine, cabergoline, rasagiline and safinamide were 2.316 (1.819, 2.951), 2.091 (1.889, 2.317), 2.037 (1.804, 2.294), 1.912 (1.716, 2.129), 1.664 (1.113, 2.418), 1.584 (1.379, 1.820) and 1.179 (1.031, 1.352), respectively, compared with joint placebo and levodopa treatment. conclusions: dopamine agonists were found to be effective as treatment for parkinson's disease, both when given as monotherapy and in combination with levodopa. selegiline and rasagiline were also found to be effective for treating parkinson's disease, and selegiline was the best option in combination with levodopa among all the drugs investigated.",1
"acute traumatic abdominal wall hernia (tawh) is a rare type of hernia that happens when the stomach wall hits a smooth object at low or high speed with few cases reported. tears in the stomach wall that allow stomach contents to spill out often result from stomach injury and likely require surgery for bleeding and controlling the source of the body's extreme response to the spillage. we report a case where a high-speed impact of the stomach wall against a tree stump caused a tawh with stomach tearing in a 20-year-old man who needed abdominal surgery and repair of the wound. the physical exam, no history of stomach hernia, and air in the stomach suggested tawh, which was confirmed during surgery. the patient had a strong stomach wall 3 months after surgery. it is important to not rule out tawh based on the physical exam.",0
"background: potassium (k(+)) is the major intracellular cation, with 98% of the total pool being located in the cells at a concentration of 140-150 mmol/l, and only 2% in the extracellular fluid, where it ranges between 3.5 and 5 mmol/l. a fine regulation of the intracellular-extracellular gradient is crucial for life, as it is the main determinant of membrane voltage; in fact, acute changes of k(+) plasma levels may have fatal consequences. summary: an integrated system including an 'internal' and 'external' control prevents significant fluctuations of plasma levels in conditions of k(+) loading and depletion. the internal control regulates the intra-extracellular shift, a temporary mechanism able to maintain a constant k(+) plasma concentration without changing the total amount of body k(+). the external control is responsible for the excretion of the ingested k(+), and it has the kidney as the major player. the kidney excretes nearly 90% of the daily intake. along the proximal tubule and the thick ascending limb on henle's loop, the amount of k(+) reabsorption is quite fixed (about 80-90%); conversely, the distal nephron has the ability to adjust k(+) excretion in accordance with homeostatic needs. the present review analyzes: (1) the main molecular mechanisms mediating k(+) reabsorption and secretion along the nephron; (2) the pathophysiology of the principal k(+) derangements due to renal dysfunction, and (3) the effect of ingested k(+) on blood pressure and renal electrolyte handling. key messages: maintaining plasma k(+) levels in a tight range is crucial for life; thus, multiple factors are implicated in k(+) homeostasis, including kidney function. recent studies have suggested that k(+) plasma levels, in turn, affect renal salt absorption in animal models; this effect may underlie the reduction of blood pressure observed in hypertensive subjects under k(+) supplementation.",1
"a pacemaking system consists of a generator the produces pulses and lead or leads to carry the electrical impulse to the patient's heart. specific codes for pacemaker and implantable cardioverter defibrillator are made to describe the type of pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator implanted in the patient. the american college of cardiologists (heart doctors) gave guidelines for connecting and fitting a pacemaker to regulate the heart rate and implanting a cardioverter defibrillator, a battery powered device placed under the skin that keeps track of the heart rate. certain pacemakers have magnet-operated switches; however, using a magnet can have serious negative effects. therefore, devices should be considered programmable unless known otherwise. when a patient who has a device undergoes any procedure (with or without anesthesia), special precautions have to be taken including a history of the patient's health and a physical exam, checking the pacemaker before and after the procedure to make sure its working, emergency drugs/temporary pacing and defibrillation, reprogramming of the pacemaker, and disabling certain pacemaker functions if required. monitoring of problems with electrolytes and the metabolism and avoiding certain drugs and equipments that can interfere with pacemaker function are also reviewed. if unexpected interactions between the pacemaker and other devices are found, consider stopping the procedure until the source of interference can be eliminated or managed. all other measures should be taken to ensure proper pacemaker function. after the procedure, the heart rate and rhythm should be monitored continuously, and emergency drugs and equipment should be ready, if needed. also, discussing with a heart specialist or a service that focuses on pacemaker-implantable cardioverter defibrillators may be necessary.",0
"the main blood test to determine active attack of the insulin-producing beta-cells by the body is based on islet cell antibodies (ica; proteins made against insulin-producing cells). the main ica test has drawbacks like needing human tissue from the pancreas and difficulty in getting results in the form of a number. based on the description of beta-cell proteins in test tubes in the past 10 years, new measuring tools for self-made proteins were made with high accuracy for disease detection and no detection to predict type 1 diabetes. we looked at whether combined blood tests in test tubes, such as self-made proteins to insulin (iaa), the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (gada), and ica512 (ica512a), could replace the main ica test. we tested blood samples of 114 newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes patients, aged 12 plus or minus 5 years (ranging from 2 months to 29 year) for ica, iaa, gada, and ica512a. we found that more blood samples scored positive (detected the presence of the disease) for 1 or more of iaa, gad, or ica512 than for ica and/or iaa. we conclude that testing for iaa, gad and ica512 together can replace the traditional ica/iaa test to predict type 1 diabetes and is helpful to doctors in telling the different between type 1 and type 2 diabetes.",0
"postpartum depression (ppd) is a major public health problem affecting 10-57% of adolescent mothers which can affect not only adolescent mothers but also their infants. thus, there is a need for interventions to prevent ppd in adolescent mothers. however, recent systematic reviews have been focused on effective interventions to prevent ppd in adult mothers. these interventions may not necessarily be applicable for adolescent mothers. therefore, the purpose of this review was to examine the effectiveness of the existing interventions to prevent ppd in adolescent mothers. a systematic search was performed in medline, cinahl, and scopus databases between january 2000 and march 2017 with english language and studies involving human subjects. studies reporting on the outcomes of intervention to prevent ppd particularly in adolescent mothers were selected. non-comparative studies were excluded. from 2002 identified records, 13 studies were included, reporting on 2236 adolescent pregnant women. the evidence from this systematic review suggests that 6 of 13 studies from both psychological and psychosocial interventions including (1) home-visiting intervention, (2) prenatal antenatal and postnatal educational program, (3) cbt psycho-educational, (4) the reach program based on interpersonal therapy, and (5) infant massage training is successful in reducing rates of ppd symptoms in adolescent mothers in the intervention group than those mothers in the control group. these interventions might be considered for incorporation in antenatal care interventions for adolescent pregnant women. however, this review did not find evidence identifying the most effective intervention for preventing postpartum depression symptoms in adolescent mothers.",1
"hip and knee replacement surgery is associated with significant pain around the time of the procedure. this can make recovery worse by increasing the risk of additional problems, length of stay, and cost. historically, opioids were the main way to control pain around the time of surgery. however, opioids are associated with significant downsides. using several pain treatments at once (called multimodal pain management) before pain starts has become the standard way to manage pain after hip and knee replacement. multimodal pain management uses drugs taken by mouth, injections into nerves, injections into joints, and other tools to reduce the need for opioids. using several treatments at once promises to decrease additional problems, improve outcomes, and increase patient satisfaction after hip and knee replacement.",0
"phenylketonuria (pku) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of phenylalanine metabolism caused by deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase that converts phenylalanine into tyrosine. if left untreated, pku results in increased phenylalanine concentrations in blood and brain, which cause severe intellectual disability, epilepsy and behavioural problems. pku management differs widely across europe and therefore these guidelines have been developed aiming to optimize and standardize pku care.",1
"recent studies have shown that antihypertensive drugs like diuretics increase plasma homocysteine (hcy) levels. however, the effect of other antihypertensive drugs on plasma hcy levels has not been tested extensively. the aim of present study was to investigate the effect of antihypertensive therapy (aht) on hcy levels in essential hypertensive subjects. a case-control study of 273 patients with essential hypertension (eh) and 103 normotensive controls was undertaken. plasma hcy levels were measured before and after 6 weeks of aht. the genotyping of mthfr c677t polymorphism was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors and beta-blockers significantly decreased and hydrochlorothiazides significantly increased the plasma hcy levels in hypertensive patients (p<0.05). no significant association between mthfr c677t genotypes and changes in hcy levels in response to antihypertensive was observed in eh patients. the decrease in hcy induced by beta-blockers and ace inhibitors observed in our study may be due to the improvement of endothelial function along with improved renal function. thus, our results suggest that ace inhibitors and beta-blockers may provide additional beneficial therapeutic effects to the eh patients by decreasing hcy levels.",1
"buspirone hydrochloride (hcl)1 is a new anxiolytic with a unique chemical structure. its mechanism of action remains to be elucidated. unlike the benzodiazepines, buspirone lacks hypnotic, anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant properties, and hence has been termed 'anxioselective'. as evidenced by a few double-blind clinical trials, buspirone 15 to 30 mg/day improves symptoms of anxiety assessed by standard rating scales similarly to diazepam, clorazepate, alprazolam and lorazepam. like diazepam, buspirone is effective in patients with mixed anxiety/depression, although the number of patients studied to date is small. in several studies, a 'lagtime' of 1 to 2 weeks to the onset of anxiolytic effect has been noted; hence motivation of patient compliance may be necessary. sedation occurs much less often after buspirone than after the benzodiazepines; other side effects are minor and infrequent. in healthy volunteers, buspirone does not impair psychomotor or cognitive function, and appears to have no additive effect with alcohol. early evidence suggests that buspirone has limited potential for abuse and dependence. thus, although only wider clinical use for longer periods of time will more clearly define some elements of its pharmacological profile, with its low incidence of sedation buspirone is a useful addition to the treatments available for generalised anxiety. it may well become the preferred therapy in patients in whom daytime alertness is particularly important.",1
"we have found oral perphenazine 8 mg (op8) useful as follows: (1) as a nonsedating antiemetic; (2) as a preventative measure similar to the antihistamine promethazine against ketamine-induced psychotomimetic effects; and (3) as a safe single-dose drug (only 1.3 extrapyramidal events per 10,000 patients receiving 4–8 mg oral dose, with all events easily treated). additionally, we evaluated the efficacy of single-dose op8 to a single 40 mg dose of aprepitant given preoperatively in colorectal surgery patients at our academic center within an enhanced recovery protocol, which was designed to mitigate opioid utilization, reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting (ponv), and optimize patient recovery. in this retrospective study, no differences were noted in antiemetic requirement on postoperative days 0 and 1 between patients receiving op8 versus aprepitant. as enhanced recovery protocols become more widespread and continue to be applied to other surgical specialties, effective ponv prevention is imperative for improving patient outcomes. op8 deserves to be properly evaluated (by clinical study, and/or in routine clinical practice) as a part of a cost-effective multimodal enhanced recovery strategy.",1
"tardive duskinesia is a movement disorder of irregular, repetitive, and jerking movements linked with using antipsychotic medication for treating mental illnesses. we aim to provide recommendation on treating tardive dyskinesia. preventing tardive dyskinesia is very important. clinicians should follow the best policies for prescribing antipsychotic medication. these include limiting the amount for specific symptoms, using the minimum effective dose, and minimising the duration of treatment. the first-to-try treatment of tardive dyskinesia is removing antipsychotic medication if clinically possible. yet, for many patients with serious mental illness, removing antipsychotics is not possible due to disease reappearance. switching from one class to another class of antipsychotics, like clozapine or quetiapine, may help reduce tardive dyskinesia symptoms. the strongest evidence for a suitable co-treatment for tardive dyskinesia comes from tests with new vmat inhibitors, deutetrabenazine and valbenazine, which treat movement disorders. these drugs have not been approved for use in canada. data on tardive dyskinesia treatment is limited. the best treatment remains prevention. we need more long-term safety and effectiveness data for deutetrabenazine and valbenazine. their regular availability to patients outside the usa is unknown.",0
"neural facial pain is caused by the nerves that transmit sensation to the head. if medicines do not help, surgery may be used. surgeries relieve compressed nerves (microvascular decompression); or shrink tissues using radio waves (radiofrequency (rf) ablation) or local radiation (stereotactic radiosurgery). other surgeries prevent the nerve from transmitting signals (percutaneous balloon decompression.) we discuss using radio waves (rf ablation) to treat chronic facial pain. we summarize what is known about rf ablation for facial pain, including treatment results and complications. we summarize the pain relief results, patient satisfaction, quality of life, decrease in the drug use, and how often the pain returns. combining two different types of radio wave treatments (continuous radiofrequency (crf) and pulsed radiofrequency (prf))reduced pain the best. crf treatment was second best, followed by prf. all treatments improved patient satisfaction and quality of life, and decreased drug use and return of the pain. common complications of the treatment included facial numbness, weakness of facial muscles, bruised cheeks, failure to blink when the eye is touched, and dry eyes. we conclude that radio wave treatment (rf ablation) is efficient in treating patients with facial pain. it also improves quality of life and reduces drug use. maximal pain control is achieved using combined crf and prf therapy. complications of the treatment were not frequent and included facial numbness, weakness of facial muscles, bruised cheeks, failure to blink when the eye is touched, and dry eyes.",0
"background: scn1 a is one of the most important epilepsy-related genes, with disease-causing variants leading to a range of physical effects with varying disease severity. different attributes have been hypothesized to influence scn1a-related physical effects. we investigate the presence of rare and more common gene types in epilepsy-related genes as possible influencers of scn1a-related disease severity. in the study's methods, 87 patients with scn1a-related epilepsy were investigated. whole-body gene labeling was performed by the beijing genomics institute (bgi). functional gene types in 422 genes linked with epilepsy and/or brain excitability were checked. differences in amounts of gene types between the epilepsy genes and four unrelated gene sets were calculated and compared to the amounts of gene types in the same genes in a specific gene database. the study results show that excesses of gene types in epilepsy genes were observed in the complete group and in the combined group of mildly and severely affected patients, espeically for gene types with minor gene frequencies of <0.05. patients with severe physical effects showed much greater excesses of epilepsy gene types than patients with medium physical effects. in conclusion, our results show that relatively common gene types in epilepsy genes, which would not necessarily be classified as disease-causing, may play a large role in influencing scn1a physical effects. they may influence the physical effects of both severely and mildly affected patients. our results may be a first step toward meaningful testing of influencing gene types in regular diagnostics for individual patients, to provide a better estimation of disease severity for newly identified patients.",0
"medical nutrition therapy (mnt) plays an important role in the care of gestational diabetes mellitus (a type of high blood sugar affecting pregnant women), and it has a significant impact on women and newborns. the main objective of mnt is to make sure to have enough pregnancy weight gain and fetus (unborn baby) growth while having stable blood sugar levels (euglycemia) and avoiding ketones (alternative fuels for the body made when blood sugar is low). however, the best diet remains an unanswered question. overall, the nutritional and food requirements for gestational diabetes mellitus are similar for all pregnancies, but special attention is paid to carbohydrates (foods that provide sugar and energy for the body). despite the usual care practice of limiting carbohydrates, the latest evidence, although limited, favors a low-glycemic index diet (a diet that helps control blood sugar from spiking). there is general agreement in studies about limiting calories in the case of being overweight or obese. experimental studies are necessary to investigate the best medical nutrition therapy for gestational diabetes mellitus because this knowledge may provide health benefits and save money.",0
"introduction: facial pain (fp) is a type of neuropathic pain which recognizes both central and peripheral causes. it can be difficult to treat because it can often become resistant to pharmacological treatments. motor cortex stimulation (mcs) has been used in selected cases, but the correct indications of mcs in fp have not been fully established. here we systematically reviewed the literature regarding mcs in fp analysing the results of this technique and studying the possible role of different factors in the prognosis of these patients. methods: a literature search was performed through different databases (pubmed, scopus, and embase) according to prisma guidelines using the following terms in any possible combination: ""facial pain"" or ""trigeminal"" or ""anaesthesia dolorosa"" and ""motor cortex stimulation."" results: 111 articles were reviewed, and 12 studies were included in the present analysis for a total of 108 patients. overall, at latest follow-up (fu), 70.83% of patients responded to mcs. the preoperative vas significantly decreased at the latest fu (8.83 ± 1.17 and 4.31 ± 2.05, respectively; p < 0.0001). younger age (p = 0.0478) and a peripheral fp syndrome (p = 0.0006) positively affected the definitive implantation rate on univariate analysis. younger age emerged as a factor strongly associated to a higher probability to go to a definitive mcs implant on multivariate analysis (p = 0.0415). conclusion: our results evidenced the effectiveness of mcs in treating fp. moreover, the younger age emerged as a positive prognostic factor for definitive implantation. further studies with longer fu are needed to better evaluate the long-term results of mcs.",1
"sars-cov-2 infection has caused a global pandemic that has severely damaged both public health and the economy. the nucleocapsid protein of sars-cov-2 is multifunctional and plays an important role in ribonucleocapsid formation and viral genome replication. in order to elucidate its functions, interaction partners of the sars-cov-2 n protein in human cells were identified via affinity purification and mass spectrometry. we identified 160 cellular proteins as interaction partners of the sars-cov-2 n protein in hek293t and/or calu-3 cells. functional analysis revealed strong enrichment for ribosome biogenesis and rna-associated processes, including ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis, ribosomal large and small subunits biogenesis, rna binding, catalysis, translation and transcription. proteins related to virus defence responses, including mov10, eif2ak2, trim25, g3bp1, zc3hav1 and zcchc3 were also identified in the n protein interactome. this study comprehensively profiled the viral-host interactome of the sars-cov-2 n protein in human cells, and the findings provide the basis for further studies on the pathogenesis and antiviral strategies for this emerging infection.",1
"abnormalities of essential fatty acid (efa) incorporation into phospholipid are found in chronic diseases. more recently changes in circulating efa metabolites (efam) together with efam hypo-responsiveness of immune cells and efam production from cells have been found associated with disease. we hypothesize that changes in ratio of efams are the normal physiological responses to stressors, but when stressors are excessive or prolonged, efam systems may become unpredictably hypo-responsive owing to factors such as receptor down regulation and substrate depletion. in time, many homeostatic system become deranged and held in that state by minor stressors. literature review of chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs) shows hyper and hypo-responsiveness in immune function, several hypothalamo-pituitary (hp) axes and sympathetic nervous system, all relatable to dysfunctional changes in efa metabolism. for the first time, we explain chronic immune system activation and hypo-responsive immune function in cfs; through efams. dietary efa modulation (defa) can alter ratios of both membrane efas and produced efams, and if maintained can restore hypo-responsive function. we discuss dietary strategies and relevance in cfs, and a case series of cfs patients applying defa with other titrated published managements which saw 90% gaining improvement within 3 months and more than 2/3 fit for full time duties. this hypothesis and defa may have relevance in other chronic conditions.",1
"total hip replacement (thr) and, particularly, total knee replacement (tkr), are painful surgical procedures. effective postoperative pain management leads to a better and earlier functional recovery and prevents chronic pain. studies on the control of pain during the postoperative rehabilitation period are not common. the aim of this study is to present results of a perioperative anesthetic protocol, and a pain treatment protocol in use in the orthopaedic and the rehabilitation intensive units of our hospital. 100 patients (50 thr and 50 tkr) were retrospectively included in this observational study. numeric rating scale (nrs) for pain at rest registered in the clinical sheet was retrieved for all patients and analyzed with respect to the spinal anaesthesia given for the surgery, local analgesia, analgesia protocol adopted during the postoperative days in the orthopaedic unit, the antalgic treatment given during the stay within the rehabilitation unit, the postoperative consumption of rescue pain medication, and any collateral effect due to the analgesic therapy. patients reached standard functional abilities (walking at least 50 meters and climbing/descending stairs) at a mean length of 8 days without medication-related complications. mean nrs during the time of stay was 1.3 ± 0.3 for thr and 1.3 ± 0.2 for tkr) and maximum mean nrs was 1.8 ± 0.5 for tkr and 1.8 ± 0.6 for thr. the use of rescue therapy in the rehabilitation guard was correlated with the mean nrs pain and the maximum nrs pain. a very good control of pain with the perioperative anesthetic protocol and pain treatment protocol in use was obtained.",1
"the aim of this study is to measure ketonemia (amount of ketones, a substance that the body makes if cells don't get enough blood sugar, in the body) in a control (comparison) population of pregnant women and in a population of women with gestational diabetes (women diagnosed with diabetes for the first time during pregnancy). this study also aims to define normal ketonemia levels for the comparison group and to determine whether or not this level could play a role in the care of women with gestational diabetes. this study included 56 women with normal oral glucose tolerance test results (a test that measures how the body moves sugar from blood to the tissues). women in the comparison group agreed to monitor glycaemia (blood sugar levels) and ketonemia themselves 3 times a day. in addition, women with gestational diabetes were asked to measure their blood glucose after a meal. glycaemia and ketonemia measurements are performed using a small finger stick device. study participants keep a 24-hour food diary twice a week. the average ketonemia is lower in the comparison group than in the gestational diabetes group. ketonemia values measured before the midday meal and before the evening meal are lower for the comparison group than for patients with gestational diabetes. fasting (no food) ketonemia is unrelated to ketonuria (high amounts of ketones in the urine) in the gestational diabetes group, whereas there is a connection in the comparison group. at least one chronic (recurring) increase in ketonemia levels is observed in 47% of the women with gestational diabetes, compared with only 12% in the comparison group. the lowest levels of evening glycaemia correlated with the highest levels of ketonemia; women with gestational diabetes reported lower food and carbohydrate intakes than the comparison group. in conclusion, this work has established ketonemia standards in pregnant women who do not have diabetes. if ketonemia does indicate overly restrictive dietary behavior, this measure could be used for monitoring how well people stick to the nutritional recommendations for gestational diabetes.",0
"local infiltration analgesia (lia) a method for managing pain and encouraging walking early after joint surgery. it involves injecting several painkillers directly into the surgical wound during and after the procedure. we applied lia and have found more and more that patients are able to go home earlier. this study uses national data on hip and knee surgery provided by the royal australasian college of surgeons and medibank private. it compares the national data with our outcomes using lia and rapid recovery. this study followed patients over time and was done by one surgeon. it included surgery on knees and 165 hips in the two years leading up to june 2016. we compared the two groups using several factors. these included length of stay, number of patients either transferred to rehabilitation or intensive care unit (icu) or readmitted within 30 days, and average total cost upon leaving the hospital. we found that the average length of stay for hip replacement in our data was nights, compared to five nights for national data. inpatient rehabilitation was 7% versus 36%, icu admission was zero versus 4%, and readmission rate was 4% versus 6%. the average total cost on leaving the hospital was $17,813 for our data, versus $26,734 for national data. for knee replacement, we found that the average length of stay in our study was one night versus five nights for national data. rate of transfer to icu was 0.5% versus 3% rate of transfer to rehabilitation was 4.5% versus 43%. the rate of patient readmission was 6% versus 7%, and the average total cost upon leaving the hospital in our group was $16,437 versus $27,505 for the national data. in conclusion, the comprehensive approach of lia and rapid recovery allows patients to have shorter hospitalization, lower rates of rehabilitation and, as a result, a reduction in healthcare expenses.",0
"research has shown that having patients walk early with physical therapy (pt) after knee replacement has benefits. however, the impact of early pt on rehab performance and opioid use is still unclear. we looked at the effect of same-day pt on how well patients functions and opioid use while in the hospital. to do this, we looked at 2 past groups of knee replacement patients from july 2016 to december 2017. the first group had 295 patients and had pt on the day of surgery. the second group had 392 patients and received pt on the day after surgery. the outcomes we looked at included the number of feet walked in the first 3 days after surgery, patient reported pain scores, amount of morphine or similar drugs used, length of stay, and where the patient was sent on discharge. in comparison to the second group (which had pt the day of after surgery), the first group (which had pt the day of the surgery) walked significantly more steps on the first 3 days after surgery. the first group walked, on average, 348 feet the first day after, while the second group walked 167 feet. the second day, the first group walked 342 feet while the second group walked 203. the third day after surgery, the first group walked 190 feet while the second group walked 129 feet. there was no difference between the 2 groups for pain reported. the first group (which had pt the day of the surgery) also used significantly less morphine or similar drugs when compared to the second group (which had pt the day after surgery). the first group also had a significantly shorter length of stay compared to the second group (on average 2.7 days vs 3.2 days). more patients were discharged home in the first group (81.7% vs 54.8%). in conclusion, we observed that starting pt the day of surgery led to better pt performance, reduced drug use during hospitalization, and more patients discharged home.",0
"polydactyly is a relatively common abnormality in infants. however, it can be a marker of a wide variety of neurological and systemic abnormality. hence, it is important for pediatrician and physician to have insight into the various association of this apparently innocuous anomaly. in this write-up, we report an extremely rare syndrome associated with polydactyly that is pallister-hall syndrome. a 10-month-old male child born by lower segment cesarean section presented with global delay associated with microcephaly, frontal bossing, hypertelorism, flat nose, short philtrum, incomplete cleft in the upper lip and hard palate, polydactyly, and syndactyly. the child presented with repeated vomiting and crying episodes. the patient was investigated which revealed a hypothalamic hamartomas. pallister-hall syndrome is a very rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder due to mutation in gli3 gene in the short arm of chromosome 7 with variable penetrance and expressivity.",1
"hypophosphatasia is the inborn error of metabolism characterized by low serum alkaline phosphatase activity (hypophosphatasaemia). this biochemical hallmark reflects loss-of-function mutations within the gene that encodes the tissue-nonspecific isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase (tnsalp). tnsalp is a cell-surface homodimeric phosphohydrolase that is richly expressed in the skeleton, liver, kidney and developing teeth. in hypophosphatasia, extracellular accumulation of tnsalp natural substrates includes inorganic pyrophosphate, an inhibitor of mineralization, which explains the dento-osseous and arthritic complications featuring tooth loss, rickets or osteomalacia, and calcific arthopathies. severely affected infants sometimes also have hypercalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia due to the blocked entry of minerals into the skeleton, and pyridoxine-dependent seizures from insufficient extracellular hydrolysis of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, the major circulating form of vitamin b6, required for neurotransmitter synthesis. autosomal recessive or dominant inheritance from ~300 predominantly missense alpl (also known as tnsalp) mutations largely accounts for the remarkably broad-ranging expressivity of hypophosphatasia. high serum concentrations of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate represent a sensitive and specific biochemical marker for hypophosphatasia. also, phosphoethanolamine levels are usually elevated in serum and urine, though less reliably for diagnosis. tnsalp mutation detection is important for recurrence risk assessment and prenatal diagnosis. diagnosing paediatric hypophosphatasia is aided by pathognomic radiographic changes when the skeletal disease is severe. hypophosphatasia was the last type of rickets or osteomalacia to await a medical treatment. now, significant successes for severely affected paediatric patients are recognized using asfotase alfa, a bone-targeted recombinant tnsalp.",1
"dystonias are disorders with a lot of uncontrollable muscle contractions leading to awkward poses and/or repetitive movements. checking the symptoms can help identify patterns that focus identification testing on possible causes. if a cause is found, specific cause-based treatments may be available. in most cases, a specific cause cannot be found, and treatments are based on symptoms. treatment includes counseling, education, oral medications, botox (used as a muscle relaxant), and surgeries. a noticeable decrease in symptoms and improved quality of life is achieved in most patients by combining these options.",0
"background: while coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) vaccines are highly effective, breakthrough infections are occurring. booster vaccinations have recently received emergency use authorization (eua) for certain populations but are restricted to homologous mrna vaccines. we evaluated homologous and heterologous booster vaccination in persons who had received an eua covid-19 vaccine regimen. methods: in this phase 1/2 open-label clinical trial conducted at ten u.s. sites, adults who received one of three eua covid-19 vaccines at least 12 weeks prior to enrollment and had no reported history of sars-cov-2 infection received a booster injection with one of three vaccines (moderna mrna-1273 100-μg, janssen ad26.cov2.s 5×10 10 virus particles, or pfizer-biontech bnt162b2 30-μg; nine combinations). the primary outcomes were safety, reactogenicity, and humoral immunogenicity on study days 15 and 29. results: 458 individuals were enrolled: 154 received mrna-1273, 150 received ad26.cov2.s, and 153 received bnt162b2 booster vaccines. reactogenicity was similar to that reported for the primary series. injection site pain, malaise, headache, and myalgia occurred in more than half the participants. booster vaccines increased the neutralizing activity against a d614g pseudovirus (4.2-76-fold) and binding antibody titers (4.6-56-fold) for all combinations; homologous boost increased neutralizing antibody titers 4.2-20-fold whereas heterologous boost increased titers 6.2-76-fold. day 15 neutralizing and binding antibody titers varied by 28.7-fold and 20.9-fold, respectively, across the nine prime-boost combinations. conclusion: homologous and heterologous booster vaccinations were well-tolerated and immunogenic in adults who completed a primary covid-19 vaccine regimen at least 12 weeks earlier.",1
"twenty-five patients with a primary dsm-iii-r diagnosis of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia were treated openly with the serotonin uptake inhibitor fluoxetine for up to 12 months. for most patients, treatment was initiated at 5 mg/day to minimize adverse effects previously reported with initiation at higher doses. nineteen (76%) experienced moderate to marked improvement in panic attacks. four (16%) were unable to tolerate fluoxetine due to adverse effects. initiating treatment of panic disorder with low doses of fluoxetine may increase its acceptability and permit more patients to benefit from fluoxetine.",1
"this study aims to evaluate the impact of monoclonal antibodies, medicines that may block the virus that causes covid-19 (a viral lung infection) from attaching to human cells, making it more difficult for the virus to reproduce. the study also aims to determine if certain monoclonal antibodies can lead to spread of virus variants through mutations that may reduce the effectiveness of monoclonal antibodies. researchers evaluate the impact of monoclonal antibodies on the viral load (quantity of the virus) found in the nose and the number of mutations in patients treated with monoclonal antibodies. the monoclonal antibodies used are bamlanivimab alone (in 4 patients), bamlanivimab/etesevimab (in 23 patients), and casirivimab/imdevimab (in5 patients). the viral load in the nose of monoclonal antibodies-treated patients decreased 7 days after the medicines were given. five patients with a weak immune system who were given bamlanivimab/etesevimab are found to have reduced mutations that allow the virus to enter cells and cause infection. two patients with coronavirus variants have a mutation that enabled the virus to enter cells 7 days after the medicines are given. the same occurred with a third patient 14 days after the medicines are given. the fourth patient with a variant has a mutation 7 days after the medicine is stopped, and the fifth patient has a variant with a mutation on day 21. the start of the mutation is connected with a stable or increased viral load in the nose in 3 out of 5 patients. in conclusion, two monoclonal antibody drugs can drive the targeting of coronavirus variants in patients with weak immune systems. patients given monoclonal antibody should be closely monitored, and measures to limit virus spread should be strengthened.",0
"coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by a novel betacoronavirus sars-cov-2 has been an ongoing global pandemic. several vaccines have been developed to control the covid-19, but the potential effectiveness of the mucosal vaccine remains to be documented. in this study, we constructed a recombinant l. plantarum lp18: rbd expressing the receptor-binding domain (rbd) of the sars-cov-2 spike protein via the surface anchoring route. the amount of the rbd protein was maximally expressed under the culture condition with 200 ng/ml of inducer at 33 °c for 6 h. further, we evaluated the immune response in mice via the intranasal administration of lp18:rbd. the results showed that the lp18:rbd significantly elicited rbd-specific mucosal iga antibodies in respiratory tract and intestinal tract. the percentages of cd3 + cd4+ t cells in spleens of mice administrated with the lp18:rbd were also significantly increased. this indicated that lp18:rbd could induce a humoral immune response at the mucosa, and it could be used as a mucosal vaccine candidate against the sars-cov-2 infection. we provided the first experimental evidence that the recombinant l. plantarum lp18: rbd could initiate immune response in vivo, which implies that the mucosal immunization using recombinant lab system could be a promising vaccination strategy to prevent the covid-19 pandemic.",1
"this review focuses on the rheumatological features of achondroplasia, which is the most common skeletal dysplasia and the most frequent cause of short-limbed dwarfism. it is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner but results in the majority of cases of de novo mutations. the disease is related to a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 (fgfr3) gene encoding one member of the fgfr subfamily of tyrosine kinase receptors, which results in constitutive activation of the receptor. biochemical studies of fgfr3 combined with experiments in knock-out mice have demonstrated that fgfr3 is a negative regulator of chondrocytes proliferation and differentiation in growth plate. this mutation induces a disturbance of endochondral bone formation. the diagnosis of achondroplasia is based on typical clinical and radiological features including short stature, macrocephaly with frontal bossing, midface hypoplasia and rhizomelic shortening of the limbs. the most common rheumatological complications of achondroplasia are medullar and radicular compressions due to spinal stenosis and deformities of the lower limbs. current treatment and future therapies are discussed.",1
"products that serve as a barrier to protect the skin are important in defending the skin against chemically damaging effects of bodily fluids, including fluid produced from the healing process, urine, liquid faeces, output from an opening in the body and sweat. many treatments exist, which can be grouped based on ingredients. this study describes the differences in how barrier products work, including petroleum jelly (vaseline) and/or zinc oxide, polymers (substances made of very large molecules) that form silicone (type of polymer) film, and cyanoacrylates (group of strong fast-acting adhesives). studies suggest all barrier products work, with few studies that compare ingredients to show one works better than another. film-forming polymers and cyanoacrylates are easier to apply and cost less. limited lab data suggest that a concentrated cyanoacrylate made a more notable layer that stuck more to pig tissue than a less-concentrated cyanoacrylate and protected the skin from rubbing and moisture better than a film-forming polymer. finally, a silicon-based cream with vitamins and minerals needed by the body in very small amounts significantly reduced bedsore occurrence when used with other approaches.",0
"we rated the number and variation (or differences) across the country of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry tests (dxas - useful tests for measuring bone density) repeated in under 2 years (short-interval) in people on medicare during a specific period. use of short-interval dxas varied across the country and unlike other dxas, use went down with medicare payment cuts. a campaign to avoid unnecessary medical tests, treatments and procedures found measuring bone density more often than every 2 years as care ""physicians and patients should question."" we rated the number and variation across the country of short-interval dxas in people on medicare during a specific period and estimated the testing cost and how much is changed based on payment. we used only information from medicare claims in 2006-2011 to find dxas and short-term dxas for females over age 66 on medicare. we found out how many dxas and short-term dxas were done, and how many medicare dollars were spent on short-interval dxas, across the country and by healthcare markets. from 2008-2011, dxa use was steady (12.4 to 11.5 dxas per 100 women). dxa use varied across healthcare markets. short-interval dxa use changed a lot based on payment; other dxas did not. in 2011, medicare spent about $16 million usd on short-interval dxas, which made up 10.1% of all dxas. we conclude that one out of 10 dxas was done sooner than recommended, costing medicare considerably. dxa use varied across the country. short-interval dxa use changed based on payment, suggesting policy and payment changes may decrease this low-value care.",0
"this literature review focuses on the role of disease biomarkers in the management of patients with diabetic retinopathy (dr) investigating in detail the problem of retinal neurodegeneration in such patients. identification and assessment of the significance of qualitative and quantitative biomarkers of dr and neurodegeneration can complement screening examination, as well as help predict the course of the disease and the response to therapy. a comprehensive analysis of these factors allows for effective treatment and prevention of complications in patients with dr based on prognostic models and dynamic monitoring of these indicators.",1
"the immune system is critical in preventing infection and cancer, and malnutrition can weaken different aspects of the immune system to undermine immunity. previous studies suggested that vitamin b6 deficiency could decrease serum antibody production with concomitant increase in il4 expression. however, evidence on whether vitamin b6 deficiency would impair immune cell differentiation, cytokines secretion, and signal molecule expression involved in jak/stat signaling pathway to regulate immune response remains largely unknown. the aim of this study is to investigate the effects of vitamin b6 deficiency on the immune system through analysis of t lymphocyte differentiation, il-2, il-4, and inf-î³ secretion, and socs-1 and t-bet gene transcription. we generated a vitamin b6-deficient mouse model via vitamin b6-depletion diet. the results showed that vitamin b6 deficiency retards growth, inhibits lymphocyte proliferation, and interferes with its differentiation. after cona stimulation, vitamin b6 deficiency led to decrease in il-2 and increase in il-4 but had no influence on ifn-î³. real-time pcr analysis showed that vitamin b6 deficiency downregulated t-bet and upregulated socs-1 transcription. meanwhile, the appropriate supplement of vitamin b6 could benefit immunity of the organism.",1
in 1997 the american diabetes association lowered the threshold for diagnosis of diabetes from a fasting (having not eaten food recently) blood glucose (sugar) level of 7.8 mmol/l to 7.0 mmol/l and advised that the by-mouth glucose tolerance test no longer be used in regular clinical practice. in 1999 the world health organization supported the reduction in fasting blood glucose threshold but recommended keeping the by-mouth glucose tolerance test for anyone with affected fasting glucose (6.1 mmol/l-6.9 mmol/l). this review discusses the effect of these changes on the prevalance of diabetes and checks how it affects individuals and specific high-risk groups. the physical effects of those identified with diabetes and the predictive value for the development of side effects according to the different criteria are compared. it is clear that these changes in identification criteria have major importance both for individuals and for planning at a national level.,0
"the objective of this study is to perform an analysis on how the nerve-related pain medication gabapentin performs in healthy korean participants and to investigate the possible effect of genetic changes in the drug-resistant abcb1 gene on how gabapentin is absorbed and distributed in the body. data are collected from other studies where 173 people received three different doses by mouth (orally) of gabapentin. only data on the drug design and performance are used. how the body handles and uses gabapentin is measured. gabapentin shows a lot of variation or differences between people in how it is absorbed, distributed and released from the body. blood concentration of gabapentin is used to understand the process of distributing and eliminating the medication from the body. how the dose amount impacts availability in the body is measured. the oral clearance is estimated to be 11.1 liters per hour. the volume of distribution was characterized as 81.0 l. how quickly the medication enters the body remains steady. availability of the drug from the oral dose is estimated to be 68.8% at a dose of 300 mg, 62.7% at a dose of 400 mg, and 47.1% at a dose of 800 mg. clearing creatinine (a waste product that comes from wear and tear of the muscles) influences the oral clearance, and abcb1 genes influence how quickly gabapentin is absorbed by the body. however, genes showed no significant effect on gabapentin drug activity parameters. the results of this study suggest that the availability of gabapentin to the body when taken by mouth is decreased when the dosage is increased. in addition, changes in the abcb1 gene can explain the major differences in how gabapentin is absorbed by the body between people.",0
"pressure ulcers, also known as bed sores, pressure sores, or decubitus ulcers develop because of a localized (regionalized) injury to the skin or underlying tissue, or both. the ulcers usually occur in a bony area of the body. ulcers are recognized as a common medical problem affecting people confined to a bed or wheelchair for long periods of time. anabolic (muscle building) steroids are used as off-label drugs. this means they are often used without doctor approval. they have been used to increase healing alongside usual treatment with dressings, debridement (removal of damaged tissue from a wound), nutritional supplements, systemic antibiotics (full-body medicines that fight infection) and antiseptics (antimicrobial skin medication). all of these measures are considered to be supportive in pressure ulcer healing. anabolic steroids are considered because of their ability to encourage protein synthesis and build muscle mass. thorough evidence is required to encourage decision making in regards to the benefits and harms of using anabolic steroids. the goal of this study is to evaluate the effects of anabolic steroids for treating pressure ulcers. the review contains a medical trial of 212 participants, all with spinal cord injury and open pressure ulcers classed as stage iii and iv. the participants were mainly male with an average age of 58.4 years in the group receiving oxandrolone (synthetic steroid) treatment. participants were all male with an average age of 57.3 years in the placebo group. placebos are harmless pills used as control treatments. this trial compared oxandrolone (20 mg/day, administered orally) with placebo treatment. this study reported data on complete healing of ulcers and adverse side effects. there was very low-certainty evidence on the relative effect of oxandrolone on complete ulcer healing at the end of a 24-week treatment period. therefore, it is unclear if oxandrolone improves or reduces the complete healing of pressure ulcers. there was low-certainty evidence on the risk of non-serious adverse events reported in participants treated with oxandrolone compared with placebo. treatment with oxandrolone may increase the risk of non-serious negative side events reported in participants. there was very low-certainty evidence on the risk of serious adverse events reported in participants treated with oxandrolone compared with placebo. five serious adverse events were reported in the oxandrolone-treated group. however, none were classed by the trial teams as being related to treatment. it is unclear if oxandrolone increases or decreases the risk of serious adverse events. secondary outcomes were not reported in the included trial. secondary outcomes include pain, length of hospital stay, change in wound size or wound surface area, incidence of different type of infection, cost of treatment, and quality of life. overall the evidence in this study was of very low quality. this is due to lack of precision (low confidence in results) and indirectness (only males were evaluated) in data. the trial was stopped early when deeper investigation showed that oxandrolone had no benefit over the placebo for improving ulcer healing. the authors concluded there is no high quality evidence to support the use of anabolic steroids in treating pressure ulcers. further well-designed, low-bias trials in several different facilities are needed to assess (measure) the effect of anabolic steroids on treating pressure ulcers. however, careful consideration of the current trial and its early termination are required when planning future research.",0
"a 74-year-old man with peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes presented with deliberate ingestion of 450 mg of pregabalin (pbg) over a period of 8 hours followed by altered mental status. a bedside electroencephalogram was performed to rule out nonconvulsive status epilepticus, which showed continuous triphasic waves (tws) with slow background activity. he recovered after 48 hours of stopping pbg, and his repeat electroencephalogram after 72 hours did not show any tws. we present a rare case of pbg-induced tws thereby highlighting the extent of the etiologic spectrum of tws and discussing the literature related to this association.",1
"background: we endeavored to develop clinically translatable nonhuman primate (nhp) models of severe polytraumatic hemorrhagic shock. methods: nhps were randomized into five severe pressure-targeted hemorrhagic shock (pths) ± additional injuries scenarios: 30-min pths (pths-30), 60-min pths (pths-60), pths-60 + soft tissue injury (pths-60+st), pths-60+ st + femur fracture (pths-60+st+ff), and decompensated pths+st+ff (pths-d). physiologic parameters were recorded and blood samples collected at five time points with animal observation through t = 24 h. results presented as mean ± sem; statistics: log transformation followed by two-way anova with bonferroni multiple comparisons, wilcoxon nonparametric test for comparisons, and the friedmans' one-way anova; significance: p < 0.05. results: percent blood loss was 40% ± 2, 59% ± 3, 52% ± 3, 49% ± 2, and 54% ± 2 for pths-30, pths-60, pths-60+st, pths-60+st+ff, and pths-d, respectively. all animals survived to t = 24 h except one in each of the pths-60 and pths-60+st+ff groups and seven in the pths-d group. physiologic, coagulation, and inflammatory parameters demonstrated increasing derangements with increasing model severity. conclusion: nhps exhibit a high degree of resilience to hemorrhagic shock and polytrauma as evidenced by moderate perturbations in metabolic, coagulation, and immunologic outcomes with up to 60 min of profound hypotension regardless of injury pattern. extending the duration of pths to the point of decompensation in combination with polytraumatic injury, evoked derangements consistent with those observed in severely injured trauma patients which would require icu care. thus, we have successfully established a clinically translatable nhp trauma model for use in testing therapeutic interventions to trauma.",1
"the process of stimulating the heart grew from life-saving devices that prevent asystole (when the activity in the heart stops or ""flatline"") to the treatment of heart rhythm disorders and heart failure. cardiac stimulation nowadays aims to correct the physical root cause of heart problems in different heart diseases. doctors' experiences have led to an awareness of the hidden risks of standard pacing methods to get the heart beat back to normal that can lead to unexpected heart problems. new pacing methods have come about, leading to a new idea of what truly represents 'physiologic pacing' beyond making sure the two parts of the heart beat in a good rhythm. this article analyzes new evidence that supports the available methods to create a setting in bradycardia (slow heart beat) pacing that is tailored for the individual. the article also discusses future developments. the expert opinion is that 'physiologic stimulation' methods should develop to allow effective and far-reaching use. in one way, new guiding catheters (flexible tubes), the use of specific tests to check the heart's electrical system, and implanting devices using imaging tools are needed to make pacing successful and effective in the long term, but leads to a shorter procedure time. in the other way, stimulation without using wires needs to upgrade to a better physical setting to mimic customary ddd (dual-chamber antibradycardia that can stimulate the chambers of the heart) pacing and possibly his-purkinje pacing, the rapid electric conduction in the ventricles (lower heart chambers).",0
"a spigelian hernia (or lateral ventral hernia involving bulging of digestive organs) develops through muscles found in the abdominal wall. so far, about 1000 of these hernia cases have been seen worldwide. these hernias are hard to diagnose, because they do not cause swelling and often can cut off blood supply to one or more essential organs (e.g., small or large intestine). we look at the case of a 36-year-old female with a history of pain and lumpiness in her left lower stomach, both of which got better when she lay down. she came to the emergency room with severe pain at the same place that went away on its own. a ct scan showed a spigelian hernia, and a doctor performed surgery. spigelian hernias are rare and often can cut off blood supply to one or more essential organs. knowledge of symptoms and signs is important to diagnose and treat these rare hernias.",0
"by 2020, about 12.3 million people in the united states older than 50 years are expected to have osteoporosis, a condition in which bones become weak and brittle. broken bones from osteoporosis, especially hip breaks, are related to a limited ability to walk, long-term pain and disability, loss of independence, and reduced quality of life. 21% to 30% of people who break a hip die within 1 year. the number of people during a specific period with primary osteoporosis (i.e., osteoporosis not resulting from other disease), goes up with age and changes depending on race/ethnicity. with the u.s. population getting older, the possible cost of preventable disease is expected to go up in the future. we aim to update a 2011 expert panel suggestion on checking for osteoporosis. the expert panel looked at scientific studies on checking for and treatment of bone breaks due to osteoporosis in men and women, and tools to measure risk, periods between checks, and how well checks and treatment work in smaller groups. the group that was checked for osteoporosis was women who had gone through menopause (a point in time 12 months after the last period) and older men who had never had a known bone break due to osteoporosis and no known conditions or drug use known to cause osteoporosis. the expert panel found strong proof that bone measurement tests are correct for finding osteoporosis and predicting bone breaks due to osteoporosis in women and men. the expert panel found some proof that tools to measure risk are somewhat correct in finding risk of osteoporosis and bone breaks due to osteoporosis. the expert panel found strong proof that drugs decrease later bone break rates in women who have gone through menopause. the expert panel found there is not enough proof to measure how well drugs work to decrease later bone break rates in men without previous bone breaks. the expert panel suggests checking for osteoporosis with bone measurement testing to prevent bone breaks from osteoporosis in women 65 years and older. the expert panel suggests checking for osteoporosis with bone measurement testing to prevent bone breaks from osteoporosis in women younger than 65 years who have gone through menopause who have a greater risk of osteoporosis, as decided by a tool used by doctors to measure risk. the expert panel concludes there is not enough data to measure the pros versus cons of checking for osteoporosis to prevent bone breaks from osteoporosis in men.",0
"boosters that are not of the same type as the first covid-19 vaccine can make global covid-19 immunization easier. however, we know that getting astrazeneca and pfizer 4 weeks apart causes more side effects than getting the same vaccine. we report the safety and protective strength of different ways to combine astrazeneca and pfizer vaccines. healthy adults aged 50 years and older that did not have covid-19 participated in a clinical trial. most participants got two doses of astrazeneca or pfizer or a combination of pfizer/astrazeneca or astrazeneca/pfizer 28 or 84 days apart. 100 of the participants that had the vaccines 28 days apart was checked for the protective chemicals in the blood more often. participants did not know which vaccines they got. 28 days after boost, chemicals that fight the sars-cov-2 virus were measured in patients' blood. different-vaccine boosters were considered to be as good as the same-vaccine if the increase in the protective chemicals after the booster was the same or higher for the different vaccines. protection against covid-19 was measured in all participants. safety of the vaccine was measured among participants that had at least one dose of the vaccine. for 463 participants with 28 days between the first vaccine and the booster, the results are reported here. the participants were 54 to 65 years old. about half (212) were women and a quarter (117) were from ethnic minorities. 28 days after the booster, in people who got boosted with pfizer after astrazeneca, protection against the sars-cov-2 virus was not worse than in those who got the same astrazeneca booster. boosting with astrazeneca after pfizer was not as good as getting the second dose of the same pfizer vaccine. four people had serious health problems during the trial. the problems were not related to getting the vaccines. although getting astrazeneca after pfizer was not as good as getting only pfizer or pfizer after astrazeneca, there were still more protective chemicals against sars-cov-2 in the blood compared to getting only astrazeneca. getting only astrazeneca is known to protect against covid-19 and hospitalization. this trial supports using boosters that are not the same as the first covid-19 vaccine.",0
"there is little evidence regarding the association between serum vitamin b6 concentration and subsequent mortality. we aimed to evaluate the association of serum vitamin b6 concentration with all-cause, cardiovascular disease (cvd), and cancer mortality in the general population using data from the national health and nutrition examination survey (nhanes). our study examined 12,190 adults participating in nhanes from 2005 to 2010 in the united states. the mortality status was linked to national death index (ndi) records up to 31 december 2015. pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (plp) is the biologically active form of vitamin b6. vitamin b6 status was defined as deficient (plp < 20 nmol/l), insufficient (plp â‰¥ 20.0 and <30.0 nmol/l), and sufficient (plp â‰¥ 30.0 nmol/l). we established cox proportional-hazards models to estimate the associations of categorized vitamin b6 concentration and log-transformed plp concentration with all-cause and cause-specific mortality by calculating hazard ratios (hrs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%cis). in our study, serum vitamin b6 was sufficient in 70.6% of participants, while 12.8% of the subjects were deficient in vitamin b6. during follow-up, a total of 1244 deaths were recorded, including 294 cancer deaths and 235 cvd deaths. after multivariate adjustment in cox regression, participants with higher serum vitamin b6 had a 15% (hr = 0.85, 95% ci = 0.77, 0.93) reduced risk of all-cause mortality and a 19% (hr = 0.81, 95%ci = 0.68, 0.98) reduced risk for cvd mortality for each unit increment in natural log-transformed plp. a higher log-transformed plp was not significantly associated with a lower risk for cancer mortality. compared with sufficient vitamin b6, deficient (hr = 1.37, 95% ci = 1.17, 1.60) and insufficient (hr = 1.19, 95%ci = 1.02, 1.38) vitamin b6 level were significantly associated with a higher risk for all-cause mortality. there was no significant association for cause-specific mortality. participants with higher levels of vitamin b6 had a lower risk for all-cause mortality. these findings suggest that maintaining a sufficient level of serum vitamin b6 may lower the all-cause mortality risk in the general population.",1
"this study examines the links between aromatase inhibitor therapy (drugs commonly used to treat breast cancer) and hair loss or hair thinning among female breast cancer survivors. we analyzed data from 851 female breast cancer survivors who responded to a hospital survey. data on hair loss, hair thinning, background information, and health habits were self-reported. data on aromatase inhibitor therapy were collected by the survey and verified with medical records. the relationship between aromatase inhibitor therapy and hair outcome was mathematically estimated and adjusted for possible misleading variables, like age and chemotherapy treatment. 22.4% of the breast cancer survivors reported hair loss. 31.8% reported hair thinning. breast cancer survivors who were within 2 years of starting aromatase inhibitor treatment at the time of the survey were around two and a half times more likely to report hair loss or thinning in the past 4 weeks compared to those never treated with an aromatase inhibitor. current aromatase inhibitor use for 2 or more years at the time of the survey and past use were linked with hair thinning but not hair loss. findings from the study suggest that aromatase inhibitor use is linked with an increased risk of hair loss and thinning regardless of chemotherapy and age. these side effects are likely from the reduction in estrogen (a female sex hormone) from the drug treatment. future research should examine the links in a future-oriented manner with more detailed and measurable measures of hair loss and thinning.",0
"background: a severe mismatch between the supply and demand of oxygen is the common feature of all types of shock. we present a newly developed, clinically oriented classification of the various types of shock and their therapeutic implications. results: there are only four major categories of shock, each of which is mainly related to one of four organ systems. hypovolemic shock relates to the blood and fluids compartment while distributive shock relates to the vascular system; cardiogenic shock arises from primary cardiac dysfunction; and obstructive shock arises from a blockage of the circulation. hypovolemic shock is due to intravascular volume loss and is treated by fluid replacement with balanced crystalloids. distributive shock, on the other hand, is a state of relative hypovolemia resulting from pathological redistribution of the absolute intravascular volume and is treated with a combination of vasoconstrictors and fluid replacement. cardiogenic shock is due to inadequate function of the heart, which shall be treated, depending on the situation, with drugs, surgery, or other interventional procedures. in obstructive shock, hypoperfusion due to elevated resistance shall be treated with an immediate life-saving intervention. pathogenesis and pathophysiology: the characteristic feature of both, hemorrhagic and traumatic hemorrhagic shock is bleeding. however, differences exist between the two subcategories in terms of the extent of soft tissue damage. clinically the most significant cause of hemorrhagic shock is acute bleeding from an isolated injury to a large blood vessel, gastrointestinal bleeding, nontraumatic vascular rupture (e.g., aortic aneurysm), obstetric hemorrhage (e.g., uterine atony), and hemorrhage in the region of the ear, nose, and throat (vascular erosion). the shock is triggered by the critical drop in circulating blood volume; massive loss of red blood cells intensifies the tissue hypoxia.",1
"background: the epigene network was created in 2014 by four multidisciplinary teams composed of geneticists, pediatric neurologists and neurologists specialized in epileptology and neurophysiology. the ambition of the network was to harmonize and improve the diagnostic strategy of mendelian epileptic disorders using next-generation sequencing, in france. over the years, five additional centers have joined epigene and the network has been working in close collaboration, since 2018, with the french reference center for rare epilepsies (crã©er). results: since 2014, biannual meetings have led to the design of four successive versions of a monogenic epilepsy gene panel (pagem), increasing from 68 to 144 genes. a total of 4035 index cases with epileptic disorders have been analyzed with a diagnostic yield of 31% (n = 1265/4035). the top 10 genes, scn1a, kcnq2, stxbp1, scn2a, scn8a, prrt2, pcdh19, kcnt1, syngap1, and grin2a, account for one-sixth of patients and half of the diagnoses provided by the pagem. conclusion: these results suggest that a gene-panel approach is an efficient first-tier test for the genetic diagnosis of mendelian epileptic disorders. in a near future, french patients with ""drug-resistant epilepsies with seizure-onset in the first two-years of life"" can benefit from whole-genome sequencing (wgs), as a second line genetic screening with the implementation of the 2025 french genomic medicine plan. the epigene network has also promoted scientific collaborations on genetic epilepsies within crã©er.",1
"background: clinical practice guidelines recommend use of fracture risk scores for screening and pharmacologic treatment decisions. the timing of occurrence of treatment-level (according to 2014 national osteoporosis foundation guidelines) or screening-level (according to 2011 us preventive services task force guidelines) fracture risk scores has not been estimated in postmenopausal women. methods: we conducted a retrospective competing risk analysis of new occurrence of treatment-level and screening-level fracture risk scores in postmenopausal women aged 50 years and older, prior to receipt of pharmacologic treatment and prior to first hip or clinical vertebral fracture. results: in 54,280 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 64 years without a bone mineral density test, the time for 10% to develop a treatment-level frax score could not be estimated accurately because of rare incidence of treatment-level scores. in 6096 women who had frax scores calculated with bone mineral density, the estimated unadjusted time to treatment-level frax ranged from 7.6 years (95% confidence interval [ci], 6.6-8.7) for those aged 65 to 69, to 5.1 years (95% ci, 3.5-7.5) for those aged 75 to 79 at baseline. of 17,967 women aged 50 to 64 with a screening-level frax at baseline, 100 (0.6%) experienced a hip or clinical vertebral fracture by age 65 years. conclusions: postmenopausal women with sub-threshold fracture risk scores at baseline were unlikely to develop a treatment-level frax score between ages 50 and 64 years. after age 65, the increased incidence of treatment-level fracture risk scores, osteoporosis, and major osteoporotic fracture supports more frequent consideration of frax and bone mineral density testing.",1
"attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) is the most commonly diagnosed behavioral disorder of childhood. it affects 3-5% of school-age children. this study investigated if supplementation of soy-derived phosphatidylserine (ps), a naturally occurring phospholipid or the fatty part of a cell's boundaries, improves adhd symptoms in children. thirty six children, aged 4-14 years, who had not previously received any drug treatment related to adhd, were recruited. 17 kids received placebos (sham treatment) for 2 months, and 19 kids received 200 mg/day ps for 2 months. several measurements were taken to determine effectiveness. ps supplementation resulted in significant improvements in: adhd, ad, and hd. there was also improvement in short-term auditory memory, inattention, and impulsivity. no significant differences were observed in other measurements and in the placebo group. ps was well-tolerated and showed no adverse effects. ps significantly improved adhd symptoms and short-term auditory memory in children. ps supplementation might be a safe and natural nutritional strategy for improving mental performance in young children suffering from adhd.",0
"coronavirus infection (a viral, respiratory disease) is associated with different types of symptoms, as well as damage to the immune system and changes in gut microbiota, which are important microorganisms in the digestive system that process food and help the body use nutrients. the nutrition and chemical processes of one's diet can alter the microbiota in the stomach, which may play a role in the body's ability to fight possible infections. in the covid-19 pandemic, besides developing medicines and vaccines, a healthy diet with antioxidants (vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that protect and repair cells) may be a useful option. many studies show that vitamins and probiotic (good bacteria) therapies have positive effects on the treatment and prevention of oxidative stress (a condition that happens when antioxidant levels are low leading to cell and tissue damage) and inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) in covid-19. research on the relationship between the gut microbiota in the digestive system and its environment is linked to the protein receptor of the cell surface that allows the virus to enter, called ace2, suggesting that covid-19 may be linked to the gut microbiota. the protein and its ace2 receptor that allows viruses to attach to cells play central roles in controlling the renin-angiotensin system (ras), which is the system that regulates blood pressure and fluids in the body. in addition, ace2 has functions that act without influence by the ras. ace2 is the receptor for the sars coronavirus that causes covid-19, and ace2 is essential for the production of amino acids (molecules that form proteins) in the gut. in this instance, ace2 controls natural immunity or infection prevention and influences what substances make up the gut microbiota. malnutrition is one of the leading underlying causes of illness and death across the world and, including other health problems, may be a major cause of worse outcomes and higher deaths among covid-19 patients. this paper reviews the existing research on food and diets, with a focus on vitamins, antioxidants, and probiotics, and their impact on the gut bacteria during the coronavirus pandemic.",0
"background: tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (tnsalp) is an enzyme that assists in breaking down phosphate groups. phosphate groups are important in activating proteins. tnsalp is encoded by a gene, known as alpl, that is of particular importance for bone mineralization or when minerals deposit onto bone. mutation, or a structural change, in the alpl gene can cause persistent low alkaline phosphatase (alp) activity. alp is an enzyme that helps bone strength. low alp activity can result in the rare disease hypophosphatasia (hpp). hpp is characterized by disturbed bone and dental or tooth mineralization. severe forms of hpp are extremely rare. however, there is an estimated prevalence of 1/100,000 people. recent studies suggest that moderate hpp is more common with an estimated prevalence of 1/508 people. the aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of low alp levels in the population based on laboratory measurements. the prevalence of low ap activity and elevated pyridoxal-5-phosphate (plp) levels was analyzed in 6,918,126 measurements from 2011 to 2016. plp is a co-enzyme or helper in several body processes. only laboratory values of subjects older than 18 years of age were included. only the first measurement was included. all repeated values were excluded. in total, 8.46% of the measurements showed a value < 30 u/l. 0.59% of the subjects with an alp activity below 30 u/l had an additional plp measurement. of the participants, 6.09% showed elevated pyridoxal-5-phosphate (plp) levels. this suggest that 0.52% of subjects show signs of hpp. these data support the estimation that the prevalence of moderate forms of hpp is higher than expected. the authors recommend automatic measurement of plp in cases of low alp activity. physicians should be notified that hpp should be included in the diagnosis and further exploration is recommended.",0
"trouble swallowing is common but may be underreported. specific symptoms, not the area where they are thought to come from, should guide the first exam and visual tests. symptoms of difficulty breathing that seem to come from the throat or neck may actually be caused by damage in the lower esophagus. difficulty swallowing that happens in the mouth or the throat shows up as difficulty starting swallowing, coughing, choking, or something entering the airway or lungs by accident. it is most often caused by long-term brain conditions such as stroke, parkinson's, or memory, language, and thinking loss. symptoms should be looked at closely due to the risk of something entering the airway or lungs by accident. people with problems that happen during swallowing may describe a feeling of food getting stuck after swallowing. problems that happen during swallowing is most often caused by stomach-related reflux diseases and disorders of the esophagus with symptoms like heartburn and chest pain. a long-term allergic condition of the esophagus is set off by food allergens and is more and more common. to diagnose this condition, a small part of the esophagus should be removed for examination. dysfunction of the esophagus that causes difficulty swallowing such as a disorder in which your esophagus is unable to move food and liquids down into your stomach are pretty rare and may be overdiagnosed. dysfunction of the esophagus caused by opioids is becoming more common. using a flexible tube with a camera to look at the esophagus, stomach and part of the small intestine is used to look at difficulty swallowing that happens in the mouth and throat, together with barium and x-rays. cancer of the esophagus and other serious conditions are not common, and low-risk people may take acid reducers for 4 weeks before undergoing testing. many weak older adults with progressive deterioration in functioning have serious but unseen difficulty swallowing, which really increases their risk of pneumonia (lung infection) caused by something entering the airway or lungs by accident and risk of lacking nutrients in the body. in these people, the diagnosis of difficulty breathing should lead to a conversation about what is important to the person before suggesting possibly harmful treatments. people who treat communication and swallowing disorders and other specialists, working with family doctors, can evaluate and make suggestions for safe swallowing, care for people living with a serious illness, or rehab.",0
"the objective of this case report (a summary of an individual patient's symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment) is to identify the sign or symptoms and causes of complex regional pain syndrome (a form of ongoing pain that affects the arm or leg) and if a pain treatment called stellate ganglion blockade (an injection of medication into nerves at the front of the neck that can relieve pain) has any effect on the pain. complex regional pain syndrome can occur in the arms or legs after a minor injury, fracture, surgery, or nerve damage. it appears as sudden, random pain, changes in skin temperatures and color, swelling in ankles, feet or legs, and uncontrollable movements in the body. disease-related physical changes are likely to involve outer and central parts, nerve-related elements, and inflammatory elements, the body's natural response to injury or infection. there is no consistent approach to treatment with a wide variety of specialists involved. diagnosis can be difficult. sometimes it is over-diagnosed (diagnosis of a medical condition that would never have caused any symptoms or problems) from too much attention on the pain even though other symptoms are not present. sometimes it can be under-diagnosed (diagnosed less often than its occurrence) when less obvious symptioms are not recognized. a professional medical association for the study of pain supports the kind of pain block used in stellate ganglion blockade to reduce sensory nerves and relieve pain sympoms. educational reviews promote stellate ganglion blockade as beneficial. three blocks (injections) were given at 8, 10 and 13 months after the initial injury under local anaesthesia and clean conditions. physical therapy was provided after the patient received an injection to allow more movement of the joint and tissues and to help restore use of the injured finger. this case shows that healthcare providers need to be able to identify clinical signs of complex regional pain syndrome to start treatment immediately. it also shows that stellate ganglion blockade is a preferable method to an iv of local anaesthetic (one-time injection of medicine that numbs a small area of the body) in the upper arm to help finger pain associated with complex regional pain syndrome.",0
"dietary strategies aimed at preventing covid-19 and dangerous pneumonia are continually being considered. unfortunately, as in the case of drugs, studies in humans have not confirmed any specific food components to be effective in the case of covid-19. we know that the immune system is the key to reducing the severity of covid-19, and perhaps by modulating it in the right way we can save human lives with preventive measures. numerous clinical studies have shown that nutraceuticals can beneficially stimulate the immune response in patients with various diseases, such as cancer or aids, and in healthy people at risk of viral infections. natural compounds are commonly recognized as valuable agents in the fight against viruses due to their structural diversity and safety. many products consumed by people and used in traditional medicine have been shown to contain substances with anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antiviral properties, e.g., vitamin c in the fruit or juice of raspberries or elderberries, hesperidin in st. john’s wort, kaempferol and methylglyoxal in honey, allicin in garlic and onion, gingerols in ginger, curcumin in turmeric, and piperine in black pepper. however, there is no strong scientific evidence, nor are there any systematic literature reviews with meta-analyses indicating that herbs, spices, health-promoting food ingredients, or dietary supplements prevent infection with sars-cov-2, mitigate covid-19 symptoms, or can even be used to treat infections, including severe covid pneumonia, acute lung failure, a cytokine storm, clotting disorders, or multiple organ failure.",1
"this consensus-based guideline was developed by all relevant german pediatric medical societies. ultrasound is the standard imaging modality for pre- and postnatal kidney cysts and should also exclude extrarenal manifestations in the abdomen and internal genital organs. mri has selected indications. suspicion of a cystic kidney disease should prompt consultation of a pediatric nephrologist. prenatal management must be tailored to very different degrees of disease severity. after renal oligohydramnios, we recommend delivery in a perinatal center. neonates should not be denied renal replacement therapy solely because of their age. children with unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney do not require routine further imaging or nephrectomy, but long-term nephrology follow-up (as do children with uni- or bilateral kidney hypo-/dysplasia with cysts). arpkd (autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease), nephronophthisis, bardet-biedl syndrome and hnf1b mutations cause relevant extrarenal disease and genetic testing is advisable. children with tuberous sclerosis complex, tumor predisposition (e. g. von hippel lindau syndrome) or high risk of acquired kidney cysts should have regular ultrasounds. even asymptomatic children of parents with adpkd (autosomal dominant pkd) should be monitored for hypertension and proteinuria. presymptomatic diagnostic ultrasound or genetic examination for adpkd in minors should only be done after thorough counselling. simple cysts are very rare in children and adpkd in a parent should be excluded. complex renal cysts require further investigation.",1
"background and purpose: in childhood epilepsy, genetic etiology is increasingly recognized in recent years with the advent of next generation sequencing. this has broadened the scope of precision medicine in intractable epilepsy, particularly epileptic encephalopathy (ee). developmental disorder (dd) is an integral part of childhood uncontrolled epilepsy. this study was performed to investigate the genetic etiology of childhood epilepsy and dd. methods: in this study, 40 children with epilepsy and dd with positive genetic mutation were included retrospectively. it was done in a tertiary care referral hospital of bangladesh from january 2019 to december 2020. genetic study was done by next generation sequencing. in all cases electroencephalography, neuroimaging was done and reviewed. results: in total, 40 children were enrolled and the average age was 41.4â±35.850 months with a male predominance (67.5%). generalized seizure was the predominant type of seizure. regarding the association, intellectual disability and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder was common. seventeen cases had genetically identified early infantile ee and common mutations observed were scn1a (3), scn8a (2), slc1a2 (2), kcnt1 (2), and etc. five patients of progressive myoclonic epilepsy were diagnosed and the mutations identified were in kctd7, mfsd8, and cln6 genes. three cases had mitochondrial gene mutation (mt-nd5, mt-cyb). some rare syndromes like gibbs syndrome, kohlschã¼tter-tã¶nz syndrome, cockayne syndrome, pitt-hopkins syndrome and cerebral creatine deficiency were diagnosed. conclusions: this is the first study from bangladesh on genetics of epilepsy and dd. this will help to improve the understanding of genetics epilepsy of this region as well as contribute in administering precision medicine in these patients.",1
"phenylketonuria (pku) is a disorder inherited from both parents in which the body cannot properly turn food into energy. this is caused by not enough of a specific protein (phenylalanine hydroxylase, pah) that changes one molecule into another molecule. if not treated, pku causes higher phenylalanine levels in the blood and brain, which causes intellectual disability, seizure disorder and behavioral problems. the european guidelines on pku were made to improve and reduce the variation or differences in care because pku treatment differs a lot across europe.",0
"there is evidence that changes in blood fatty acid make-up may play a role in certain brain disorders. this patient study was conducted to test the link between blood fatty acid levels and mental retardation in korean children. blood fatty acids, blood fat levels, dietary fatty acids and selected nutrients were measured in 31 mentally retarded boys (average age 9.93 +/-1.5 yrs) and normal boys. total blood omega-3 fatty acids (sigmaw3), docosahexaenoic acid (dha; specific omega-3 fatty acids) and high density lipoprotein (hdl - good cholesterol) concentrations were much lower. the sigmaomega-6/sigmaomega-3 ratio was much higher in affectedpatients than in normal patients. the odds in favor of mental retardation increased by 69 % for each unit increase in the sigmaomega-6/ sigmaomega-3 ratio. significant variation in blood sigmaomega-3 and the sigmaomega-6/ sigmaomega-3 ratio was explained by mental retardation and blood hdl concentrations (45% and 37 % respectively). there was a significant opposite link between blood dha and mental retardation. as one goes up, the other goes down. for each unit increase in blood dha, odds of mental retardation decreased by 74 %. there was no significant difference in either total dietary fat or fatty acids intakes between affected patients and normal patients. the energy intake of affected patients was significantly higher than the healthy patients. these results suggest that amount of plasma sigmaomega-3 fatty acids, particularly, dha, and the sigmaomega-6/ sigmaomega-3 ratio are linked with mental retardation in children in this study.",0
"islet cell antibodies (ica) are an indicator of type 1 diabetes. ica are found in 60-80% of patients with type 1 diabetes when symptoms first appear. type 2 diabetics with ica are likely to develop type 1 diabetes. the current way to measure ica is not always reliable. a reliable standardized test could use pancreas tissue, tissue from an organ that monitors blood sugar levels. a standardized test to measure ica is under way. scientists have recently developed a standardized test to measure anti-glutamate decarboxylase (gad) antibody, a rare protein. anti-gad antibodies and ica have similar meanings. the standardized test to measure anti-gad can be repeated and is easy to do, so it should be used widely at the same time as the test to measure ica.",0
"parkinson's disease, the second most frequent brain disorder that impacts movement and coordination, is linked to increased central (brain and spinal cord) and peripheral (nerves) inflammation (the body's natural reaction against injury and infection). although the response of the immune system to dopamine drugs is not fully understood, dopaminergic agonists (a medication that imitates the actions of dopamine in the body to relieve symptoms related to low levels of dopamine) are known to show immune system-regulating characteristics which may, at least in part, explain their effect in parkinson's disease. there is a need to analyze immune characteristics in long-term studies on parkinson's disease patients who are receiving specific drugs. in this study, patients with parkinson's disease are included in a two-year prospective study (a study that takes a set number of subjects and follows them over a long period). this study compares the effect of levodopa (a drug that enters the brain and helps replace missing dopamine) alone and a combination of levodopa and pramipexole (dopamine-promoting) drugs on several regulating and pro-inflammatory (capable of causing inflammation) immune cells in the body. researchers demonstrate that patients with parkinson's disease show decreased levels of important cells that regulate the immune system. in particular, when given alone, levodopa decreases the levels of functional bregs (a type of regulating immune cell) and slamf1+ tolerogenic dcs (immune receptors and cells that direct and regulate the immune response) and increases the levels of total and hla dr+classical monocytes (molecules that produce antigens and fight inflammation). the combination of levodopa and pramipexole drugs may promote treg- and tolerogenic dc responses (cells that regulate responses and may suppress immune response). these results suggest that treatment plans based on levodopa alone may promote a pro-inflammatory type of response in patients with parkinson's disease, but when combined with pramipexole, it promotes a clinically helpful regulatory-type environment.",0
"kidney-related potassium (k) secretion helps maintain k balance. kidney-related k removal commonly focuses on specific parts of sub-kidney units. in these units, k is pulled in by outer-facing protein, which transports k and sodium across a boundary, and is secreted into the inner tube by romk (kir1.1), a k-specific transport protein, and calcium-activated k-specific transport channel. recently, gene-related studies and animal models have shown that inwardly correcting potassium channel 4.1 (kir4.1 or kcnj10) in a specific region of sub-kidney units may monitor potassium secretion in the hormone-sensitive, outward sub-kidney unit by targeting the sodium-chloride cotransporter. this review summarizes recent improvements regarding the role of kir4.1 channel in regulating the sodium-chloride cotransporter and potassium secretion. kir4.1 is active in the outer-facing boundary of a specific region of the sub-kidney units and helps transport potassium outward and create a negative boundary charge. kir4.1 is also the target of a high-energy transporting protein. this transporting protein activates kir4.1 activity in a specific region of sub-kidney units. the gene-related deletion or silencing of kir4.1 changes the charge of the boundary of a specific region of sub-kidney units, blocks a high-energy transporting protein, and prevents sodium-chloride channel activity. also, reducing kir4.1 activity increases boundary-lining sodium channel activity in a specific region of sub-kidney units and k removal via urine. finally, mice with low kir4.1 activity in a specific region of sub-kidney units have low blood magnesium and low blood potassium. recent progress in exploring the monitoring and use of kir4.1 in a specific region of sub-kidney units shows that kir4.1 helps begin the monitoring of kidney-related k removal by targeting sodium-chloride channels. kir4.1 may also be a k sensor in the kidney.",0
"pallister-hall syndrome (phs) is a rare disease passed down from one of the parents. its signs are six fingers and toes, shortened or split flap that protects the windpipe, problems with the organs in the chest and belly, non-cancer mass in the brain that often causes problems with pituitary gland, which regulates body functions and growth. signs of phs in different patients are very different. phs ranges from mild with good outcomes to severe that can lead to death of the newborns. we describe a two-year-old girl with deformities of the face, hand and feet and dwarfism. phs was diagnosed on the basis of the presented symptoms and genetic tests. abnormalities, such as the presence of extra or fewer than five fingers or toes, are associated with disorders of the endocrine system, which includes the glands that regulate body functions through chemicals called hormones. quick and correct diagnosis would help in planning treatment for the child and advise the family regarding the next pregnancy of the child's mother.",0
"a pressure ulcer is an injury to the skin or underlying tissue, usually over a bony portion of the body, caused by unrelieved pressure. factors that make someone more likely to have a pressure ulcer are classified as intrinsic (internal factors) or extrinsic (external factors). intrinsic factors include limited mobility, poor nutrition, comorbidities, or aging skin. extrinsic factors include pressure, friction, shear (vertical force), or moisture. there are several preventative protocols for pressure ulcers that can be used. these protocols include identifying at-risk persons and implementing specific prevention measures. preventative measures include repositioning patients on a schedule, keeping hospital beds at a low and safe elevation to prevent shear, using pressure-reducing surfaces, and assessing (measuring) nutrition and providing supplementation. when an ulcer occurs, wound assessment is needed. when assessing each ulcer, there are several factors that need to be identified. these include ulcer size, location, dead or irregular tissue, discharge, odor, sinus tracts (channels in the skin), wound edge erosion or edge removal, infection, and appropriate staging (i through iv). treatment involves managing local and spreading infections, removal of dead tissue, maintenance of a moist environment for wound healing, and possibly surgery. debridement, or removal of damaged tissue from a wound, is indicated when necrotic or dead tissue is present. urgent sharp debridement should be performed if advancing skin or bleed infection occurs. mechanical (surgery), enzymatic (chemical agents), and autolytic debridement (body's natural defense system) methods are nonurgent treatments. wound cleansing, preferably with normal saline (salt water) and appropriate dressings, is common for treatment for clean ulcers and after removal of damaged skin. bacterial load, or the amount of bacteria within the body, can be managed with cleansing. topical antibiotics are bacterial-fighting medicines applied to the skin. they should be considered if there is no improvement in healing after 14 days. systemic antibiotics are medicines normally taken in pill form that effects the whole body. these are used in patients with advancing deep skin infection, bone infection, or whole body infection.",0
"background: corona virus disease 2019 has become a global health issue. the goal of this study was to investigate the characteristics and outcomes of patients with corona virus disease 2019 undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation and identify factors associated with mortality. methods: ninety four consecutive critically ill patients with confirmed corona virus disease 2019 undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation were included in this retrospective, single-center, observational study. the outcome variable was mortality of patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation and factors associated with it during intensive care unit stay. results: seventy nine (84%) out of 94 patients with confirmed corona virus disease 2019 who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation didn't survive. ninety four percent of patients who had type 2 diabetes mellitus did not survive in comparison to 72 percent of patients who didn't have type 2 diabetes mellitus. similarly, 48 (94.1%) out of 51 patients with a positive c-reactive protein value didn't survive in comparison to 31 (72%) out of 43 patients with a negative c-reactive protein. conclusions: the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and a positive c-reactive protein value were strongly associated with mortality. patients with a sequential organ failure assessment score of more than eight at intensive care unit admission and peak d-dimer level of more than or equal to two during intensive care unit stay didn't show significant association with mortality. these findings need further exploration through larger prospective studies.",1
"introduction: maturity onset diabetes of the young (mody) is a rare form of monogenic diabetes. being clinically and genetically heterogeneous, it is often misdiagnosed as type 1 or type 2 diabetes, leading to inappropriate therapy. mody is caused by a single gene mutation. thirteen genes, defining 13 subtypes, have been identified to cause mody. a correct diagnosis is important for the right therapy, prognosis, and genetic counselling. material and methods: twenty-nine unrelated paediatric patients clinically suspected of having mody diabetes were analysed using trusight one panel for next-generation sequencing (ngs) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (mlpa) assay. results: in this study we identified variants in mody genes in 22 out of 29 patients (75.9%). using two genetic tests, ngs and mlpa, we detected both single nucleotide variants and large deletions in patients. most of the patients harboured a variant in the gck gene (11/22), followed by hnf1b (5/22). the rest of the variants were found in the neurod1 and hnf1a genes. we identified one novel variant in the gck gene: c.596t>c, p.val199ala. the applied genetic tests excluded the suspected diagnosis of mody in two patients and revealed variants in other genes possibly associated with the patient's clinical phenotype. conclusions: in our group of mody patients most variants were found in the gck gene, followed by variants in hnf1b, neurod1, and hnf1a genes. the combined ngs and mlpa-based genetic tests presented a comprehensive approach for analysing patients with suspected mody diabetes and provided a successful differential diagnosis of mody subtypes.",1
"objectives. to establish a database of literature and other evidence on neonatal screening programmes and technologies for inborn errors of metabolism. to undertake a systematic review of the data as a basis for evaluation of newborn screening for inborn errors of metabolism. to prepare an objective summary of the evidence on the appropriateness and need for various existing and possible neonatal screening programmes for inborn errors of metabolism in relation to the natural history of these diseases. to identify gaps in existing knowledge and make recommendations for required primary research. to make recommendations for the future development and organisation of neonatal screening for inborn errors of metabolism in the uk. how the research was conducted. there were three parts to the research. a systematic review of the literature on inborn errors of metabolism, neonatal screening programmes, new technologies for screening and economic factors. inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, and a working database of relevant papers was established. all selected papers were read by two or three experts and were critically appraised using a standard format. seven criteria for a screening programme, based on the principles formulated by wilson and jungner (who, 1968), were used to summarise the evidence. these were as follows. clinically and biochemically well-defined disorder. known incidence in populations relevant to the uk. disorder associated with significant morbidity or mortality. effective treatment available. period before onset during which intervention improves outcome. ethical, safe, simple and robust screening test. cost-effectiveness of screening. a questionnaire which was sent to all newborn screening laboratories in the uk. site visits to assess new methodologies for newborn screening. the classical definition of an inborn error of metabolism was used (i.e., a monogenic disease resulting in deficient activity in a single enzyme in a pathway of intermediary metabolism). research findings. inborn errors of metabolism. phenylketonuria (pku) (incidence 1:12,000) fulfilled all the screening criteria and could be used as the 'gold standard' against which to review other disorders despite significant variation in methodologies, sample collection and timing of screening and inadequacies in the infrastructure for notification and continued care of identified patients. of the many disorders of organic acid and fatty acid metabolism, a case can only be made for the introduction of newborn screening for glutaric aciduria type 1 (ga1; estimated incidence 1:40,000) and medium-chain acyl coa dehydrogenase (mcad) deficiency (estimated incidence 1:8000-1:15,000). therapeutic advances for ga1 offer prevention of neurological damage but further investigation is required into the costs and benefits of screening for this disorder. mcad deficiency is simply and cheaply treatable, preventing possible early death and neurological handicap. neonatal screening for these diseases is dependent upon the introduction of tandem mass spectrometry (tandem ms). this screening could however also simultaneously detect some other commonly-encountered disorders of organic acid metabolism with a collective incidence of 1:15,000. neonatal screening for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (cah) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (incidence 1:17,000) has been shown to be beneficial in other countries and similar benefits should accrue in the uk. a national programme of neonatal screening for cah would be justified, with reassessment after an agreed period. biotinidase deficiency is of low incidence in the uk (estimated 1:100,000), but this may be outweighed by the simplicity of the screening methodology and the benefits in prevention.",1
"phenylketonuria (pku) is a disorder in which the body cannot properly turn food into energy often caused by not enough of a specific protein (phenylalanine hydroxylase, pah) that changes one molecule (phenylalanine, phe) into another molecule (tyrosine, tyr). pku is a type of molecular (amino acid) metabolism disorder called ""toxic accumulation iems,"" in which the buildup of the molecule is toxic. changes to dna of a protein, such as pah, are made in both copies of the gene that is altered, because one working copy of the gene allows the protein to function. pah is mainly a liver protein. pku is associated with high blood phe levels and low tyr levels. newborns with pku can look normal at birth with the first signs showing many months later. signs of pku can include a musty smell from skin and pee, fair skin, red and itchy skin, seizures, tremors, and an active and disruptive behavior.",0
"newborn screening is the largest genetic screening program in the united states with approximately four million newborns screened yearly. it has been available and in continuous development for more than 50 years. each state manages, funds, and maintains its own individual program, which encompasses newborn screening as well as the diagnosis and coordination of care for affected infants and children. the ideal disorder for screening is one in which newborn intervention prevents later disabilities or death for infants who may appear normal at birth. there are 31 core conditions that are currently recommended for incorporation into state screening programs. to obtain a sample, several drops of blood are collected from the newborn's heel and applied to filter paper. although testing for core disorders is fairly standardized, more extensive screening varies by state and the rigorous evaluation of new disorders for inclusion in state screening panels is ongoing. as genomic medicine becomes more accessible, screening newborns for chronic diseases that may affect their long-term health will need to be addressed as well as the use of the residual blood spots for research. obstetric providers should, at some time during pregnancy, review the basic process of newborn screening with parents to prepare them for this testing in the neonatal period. this information can be reviewed as it best suits incorporation in an individual's practice; verbal discussion and the distribution of written materials with resources for further information are encouraged.",1
"disease-causing variants in the sodium transporter gene (scn1a) are amongst the most common genetic causes of childhood epilepsies (a brain disorder leading to seizures). there is considerable variation in both the types of causative gene types and associated physical effects. a recent increase of the physical effects of scn1a-related epilepsies now includes an early severe growth and epileptic encephalopathy (epilepsy leading to brain damage) with reduction in growth and a abnormal movement disorder. we report a female with a growth-related and worsening epileptic-movement-related encephalopathy, distinct and more severe than classic dravet syndrome (lifelong epilepsy). medical diagnostics indicated a inherited gene type of scn1a. whole-body gene labeling found a second inherited, likely disease-causing gene type of scn1a. biophysical measurements of both mutant gene types found gain-of-function effects in both scn1a products; and a more severe persistent physical effect from the second gene type. using mathematical analysis, we show that large persistent electrical activity from sodium in the body causes hyper-excitability in brain neurons, thus linking the severe physical effects to the sodium current dysfunction. these findings further broaden the spectrum of physical effects of scn1a linked epilepsies and highlight the importance of testing for inheritance in epileptic encephalopathies. detailed biophysical tests and mathematical analysis further highlight the role of gain-of-function gene types in the disease-causing attributes of the most severe physical effects linked with scn1a.",0
"muscle cramps are a common problem characterized by a sudden, painful, involuntary contraction of muscle. these true cramps, which originate from peripheral nerves, may be distinguished from other muscle pain or spasm. medical history, physical examination, and a limited laboratory screen help to determine the various causes of muscle cramps. despite the ""benign"" nature of cramps, many patients find the symptom very uncomfortable. treatment options are guided both by experience and by a limited number of therapeutic trials. quinine sulfate is an effective medication, but the side-effect profile is worrisome, and other membrane-stabilizing drugs are probably just as effective. patients will benefit from further studies to better define the pathophysiology of muscle cramps and to find more effective medications with fewer side-effects.",1
"endocrine therapy-induced hair loss (etihl) (hair loss from hormonal therapy) linked with aromatase inhibitors (drugs used to treat breast cancer) and tamoxifen (estrogen-influencing medication) is reported but remains unsolved in patients with breast cancer (bc). this is largely because the number of studies regarding this hair loss management is limited. we checked the possible causes of this medical problem and its link to hormonal therapies used for bc survivors. we also made practical recommendations based on relevant medical studies to provide optimal management. based on medical papers, common causes of hair loss besdies hormonal therapies should be checked with a starting evaluation workup and then corrected if found. treatment with 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (drugs for treating hair loss) applied on skin and vitamin c and omega-3 fatty acid supplements may be the best treatment for etihl without causing serious side effects on bc recovery. however, more in-depth studies are needed to confirm our results and identify the effects of this problem on bc patients.",0
"introduction: the complex nature of facial pain conditions creates a diagnostic challenge which may necessitate specialist referral. aim: to identify the case mix presenting to a specialist tertiary care facial pain clinic. methods: a retrospective review of 112 patient records was undertaken. trends in provisional diagnoses from referrers and the correlation to diagnoses made following specialist consultation were reviewed. results: the most common provisional diagnoses recorded in referral letters were painful temporomandibular disorders, trigeminal neuralgia and persistent idiopathic facial pain (pifp). over a quarter of referrals did not include a provisional diagnosis. following assessment, only one case was not given a definitive diagnosis and no patients were diagnosed with pifp. a causative factor was identified in all the initially queried pifp cases, and painful post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathic pain was found in multiple patients. conclusions: painful post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathic pain should be considered if pain onset coincides with dental treatment or other traumatic events. pifp is a rare facial pain diagnosis and may be over-diagnosed by dental and medical practitioners. it is important to systematically exclude other causes before reaching this diagnosis. this will facilitate effective treatment, manage patient expectations and potentially reduce unnecessary referrals.",1
"the objective of this paper is to evaluate the performance and safety of antiviral antibody therapies that help the body fight off or prevent a virus and blood products used to treat covid-19. published data from other studies is summarized on an ongoing basis and compares data from different medicines, including an analysis to fill in the gaps for studies that have limited data. the data sources for this summary are the world health organization (who) covid-19 and six chinese databases that store data up to july 21, 2021. in clinical trials, people with suspected covid-19 (person has symptoms and/or exposure to covid but is not tested), probable covid-19 (person who has tested positive with other tests but not confirmatory test), or confirmed covid-19 are randomly put into different treatment groups or a placebo, where they receive something that looks like a drug but is not active. two reviewers determine if the different clinical studies will be included in the summary. after data are collected from the clinical studies, the data are analyzed. the confidence that the results in the studies are accurate is graded using an established process. clinical trials with 100 or more patients or 20 or more events per treatment type are analyzed. as of july 21st 2021, 47 trials that evaluated different blood products and medicines, including monoclonal antibodies, are found. patients with non-severe disease who receive antiviral monoclonal antibodies (medicines that may block the virus from attaching to human cells) have lower risk of being hospitalized than those who received placebo. antiviral monoclonal antibodies did not have an important impact on any other outcome. there is no major difference between monoclonal antibodies. no other treatment intervention is found to have any meaningful effect on any outcome in patients with non-severe covid-19. no intervention, including antiviral antibodies, has an important impact on any outcome in patients with severe or critical covid-19, except casirivimab-imdevimab, which may reduce death in patients who had a negative blood test. in conclusion, patients with non-severe covid-19, the drug casirivimab-imdevimab probably reduces hospital stays; bamlanivimab-etesevimab, bamlanivimab, and sotrovimab may reduce hospitalization. other antibody and cell interventions may not provide any meaningful benefit.",0
"hand osteoarthritis is a musculoskeletal problem involving hand pain, stiffness, practical limitation, decreased grip strength, and reduced quality of life. the objective is to measure the use of nighttime braces on the second or third finger of the dominant hand in controlling pain in women with typical osteoarthritis (oa) in the finger knuckles. fifty-two women with typical oa and bony lumps in the finger knucles were randomly assigned to the treatment group or the control group. the treatment group used a nighttime brace on the second or third finger of the dominant hand. both groups took part in an informational session. pain, grip and pinch strength, funciton, and manual performance were measured. the treatment group showed a noticeable improvement in pain and hand function. the improvement in pain paralleled functionality test scores and the loss of bony lumps in the third finger. they are predictors of the best recovery for treatment with a nighttime brace. nighttime braces are useful in reducing pain and improving hand function in women with hand osteoarthritis. they are recommended for non-medication treatment of hand osteoarthritis. braces can be used, along with hand exercises and joint protection, to reduce symptoms and improve hand function in people with hand osteoarthritis. this study can help occupational therapists, who help patients perform everyday activities, choose useful treatments for those with osteoarthritis.",0
"elevated expression of β-amyloid (aβ1-42) and tau are considered risk-factors for alzheimer's disease in healthy older adults. we investigated the effect of aging and cerebrospinal fluid levels of aβ1-42 and tau on 1) frontal metabolites measured with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (mrs) and 2) cognition in cognitively normal older adults (n = 144; age range 50-85). levels of frontal gamma aminobutyric acid (gaba+) and myo-inositol relative to creatine (mi/tcr) were predicted by age. levels of gaba+ predicted cognitive performance better than mi/tcr. additionally, we found that frontal levels of n-acetylaspartate relative to creatine (tnaa/tcr) were predicted by levels of t-tau. in cognitively normal older adults, levels of frontal gaba+ and mi/t cr are predicted by aging, with levels of gaba+ decreasing with age and the opposite for mi/tcr. these results suggest that age- and biomarker-related changes in brain metabolites are not only located in the posterior cortex as suggested by previous studies and further demonstrate that mrs is a viable tool in the study of aging and biomarkers associated with pathological aging and alzheimer's disease.",1
"hypokalemia (ie, potassium levels less than 3.5 meq/l) occurs in fewer than 1% of healthy individuals, but is present in up to 20% of hospitalized patients, 40% of patients taking diuretics, and 17% of patients with cardiovascular conditions. hypokalemia often is asymptomatic; symptoms are more common in older adults. common symptoms are cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness or pain. management consists of intravenous potassium replacement during cardiac monitoring for patients with marked symptoms, echocardiogram (ecg) abnormalities, or severe hypokalemia (ie, level less than 3.0 meq/l). oral replacement is appropriate for asymptomatic patients with less severe hypokalemia. hyperkalemia (ie, level greater than 5.5 meq/l) also can cause cardiac arrhythmias and muscle symptoms. urgent management is warranted for patients with potassium levels of 6.5 meq/l or greater, if ecg manifestations of hyperkalemia are present regardless of potassium levels, or if severe muscle symptoms occur. urgent management includes intravenous calcium, intravenous insulin, and inhaled beta agonists. hemodialysis can be used in urgent situations. for patients with less severe hyperkalemia, renal elimination drugs sometimes are used, as are gastrointestinal elimination drugs. for all patients with hypokalemia or hyperkalemia, drug regimens should be reevaluated and, when possible, hypokalemia- or hyperkalemia-causing drugs should be discontinued.",1
"the aim of this paper was to determine how c-reactive protein volume in patients can help diagnose bacterial infections in children. c-reactive protein is a type of protein found in the blood that increases during times of internal inflammation (redness and swelling from infection-fighting). the study evaluated 11 children. the group consisted of six boys and five girls that were between 3 months to 3 years of age. all of the children's' initial crp levels were < 1.0 mg/dl despite bacterial infection. c-reactive protein was measured at the first medical examination. the eleven children were diagnosed with various illnesses. these include: 4 with urinary tract infection, 2 with bacterial meningitis (inflammation with intense headaches), 2 with sepsis (life-threatening condition when the body's response to infection damages itself), 2 with pneumonia (lung infection) and 1 with arthritis of the hip joint. crp levels were increased during the course of infection. the cause of the bacterial infections were not specified. eight patients were examined within 12 h of illness. three showed negative crp values despite the duration of the illness over 12 h. six patients were tentatively diagnosed as having a bacterial infection. the other five were not. each patient was treated. treatment led to better health status without any serious complications. low levels of crp do not rule out the possibility of bacterial infection in children. the initial value of crp may be negative, even in patients with severe bacterial infection or even after 12 h from onset. the data suggest that doctors of children should always be aware of the possibility of bacterial infection even if the initial crp test result is negative (no detection) and that serial (multiple) crp measurements appear to be practical.",0

"aim: the aim of this study was to summarize the characteristics, efficacy, and safety of vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (vmat-2) inhibitors for treating tardive dyskinesia (td). materials and methods: we conducted a literature search in pubmed, cochrane database, and clinicaltrials.gov, screening for systematic reviews, meta-analyses or double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials (dbrpcts) reporting efficacy or safety data of vmat-2 inhibitors (tetrabenazine, deutetrabenazine, and valbenazine) in patients with td. a random effects meta-analysis of efficacy and safety data from dbrpcts was performed. results: two acute, 12-week dbrpcts with deutetrabenazine 12-48 mg/day (n=413) and 4 acute, 4-6-week double-blind trials with valbenazine 12.5-100 mg/day (n=488) were meta-analyzable, without meta-analyzable, high-quality data for tetrabenazine. regarding reduction in total abnormal involuntary movement scale (aims) scores (primary outcome), both deutetrabenazine (k=2, n=413, standardized mean difference [smd] =-0.40, 95% confidence interval [ci] =-0.19, -0.62, p<0.001; weighted mean difference (wmd) =-1.44, 95% ci =-0.67, -2.19, p<0.001) and valbenazine (k=4, n=421, smd =-0.58, 95% ci =-0.26, -0.91, p<0.001; wmd =-2.07, 95% ci =-1.08, -3.05, p<0.001) significantly outperformed placebo. results were confirmed regarding responder rates (≥50% aims total score reduction; deutetrabenazine: risk ratio [rr] =2.13, 95% ci =1.10, 4.12, p=0.024, number-needed-to-treat [nnt] =7, 95% ci =3, 333, p=0.046; valbenazine: rr =3.05, 95% ci =1.81, 5.11, p<0.001, nnt =4, 95% ci =3, 6, p<0.001). less consistent results emerged from patient-rated global impression-based response (p=0.15) and clinical global impression for deutetrabenazine (p=0.088), and for clinical global impression change for valbenazine (p=0.67). in an open-label extension (ole) study of deutetrabenazine (≤54 weeks) and a dose-blinded valbenazine study (≤48 weeks), responder rates increased over time. with valbenazine, discontinuation effects were studied, showing td symptom recurrence towards baseline severity levels within 4 weeks after valbenazine withdrawal. no increased cumulative or specific adverse (aes) events versus placebo (acute trials) in extension versus acute trial data were observed. conclusion: the 2 vmat-2 inhibitors, valbenazine and deutetrabenazine, are effective in treating td, both acutely and long-term, without concerns about increased risk of depression or suicide in the td population. no head-to-head comparison among vmat-2 inhibitors and no high-quality, meta-analyzable data are available for tetrabenazine in patients with td.",1
"in patients with advanced-stage chronic kidney disease (ckd), progressive kidney function decline leads to increased risk for hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.0 or >5.5 meq/l). medications such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors pose an additional hyperkalemia risk, especially in patients with ckd. when hyperkalemia develops, clinicians often recommend a diet that is lower in potassium content. this review discusses the barriers to adherence to a low-potassium diet and the impact of dietary restrictions on adverse clinical outcomes. accumulating evidence indicates that a diet that incorporates potassium-rich foods has multiple health benefits, which may also be attributable to the other vitamin, mineral, and fiber content of potassium-rich foods. these benefits include blood pressure reductions and reduced risks for cardiovascular disease and stroke. high-potassium foods may also prevent ckd progression and reduce mortality risk in patients with ckd. adjunctive treatment with the newer potassium-binding agents, patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, may allow for optimal renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor therapy in patients with ckd and hyperkalemia, potentially making it possible for patients with ckd and hyperkalemia to liberalize their diet. this may allow them the health benefits of a high-potassium diet without the increased risk for hyperkalemia, although further studies are needed.",1
"this study represents an analysis on the china stroke primary prevention trial (csppt). individual variation in total homocysteine (thcy)-lowering response was measured after an average of 4.5 years of 0.8 mg daily folic acid (or specific vitamin) therapy. homocysteine is a chemical your body produces to help make proteins. this study was completed in chinese hypertensive (high blood pressure) adults. this study evaluated effect modification by methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) c677t genotypes (a person's specific gene type for a specific protein) and serum or blood folate (derivative of folic acid) levels. the study included 16,413 participants from the csppt study. the participants were randomly assigned to 2 double-blind treatment groups. double-blind indicates the study participants were not told which treatment group they were apart of. the participants received either 10-mg enalapril (common blood pressure medication) +0.8-mg folic acid or 10-mg enalapril daily. the participants had individual measurements of serum folate and thcy levels at baseline (before study) and exit (end of study) visits and mthfr c677t genotypes. average baseline thcy levels were similar between the 2 treatment groups. after 4.5 years of treatment, mean or average thcy levels were reduced in the enalapril+folic acid group, but almost stayed the same in the enalapril group. however, thcy lowering varied by mthfr genotypes and serum folate levels. participants with a specific mthfr genotype (tt) required higher folate levels to eliminate the differences in thcy between them and the other two genotypes (cc and ct). the study concluded that the tt genotype group showed that as folate levels increased, thcy levels decreased. however, this difference in thcy between the genotype groups was removed when plasma or blood folate levels reached ≈15 ng/ml or higher. this study suggests to tailor folic acid therapy by mthfr genotype and folate status.",0
"forty-four patients with dsm-iii-r generalized anxiety disorder participated in this double-blind, randomized study. patients were on a benzodiazepine before the study and were stabilized on 3 to 5 mg/day lorazepam for 5 weeks (weeks 0 to 5). thereafter, they were randomized to 15 mg/day buspirone or placebo for the following 6 weeks (weeks 6 to 11). during the first 2 weeks of double-blind, randomized treatment (weeks 6 to 7), lorazepam was tapered off. during weeks 12 to 13, patients received single-blind placebo. assessment included the hamilton rating scale for anxiety, the state-trait anxiety inventory, the zung and eddy self-rating scale of anxiety symptoms, the hamilton rating scale for depression, and the rome depression inventory, completed at weeks 0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 13. side effects were assessed through the dosage treatment emergent symptoms at the same times. the benzodiazepine-withdrawal syndrome was evaluated through a 27-symptom checklist (clinical-rated benzodiazepine withdrawal symptom schedule) at weeks 0, 5, 6, 7, 11, and 13. the results showed that buspirone was more effective than placebo and comparable to lorazepam. buspirone-treated patients showed no rebound anxiety or benzodiazepine-withdrawal syndrome compared with placebo. buspirone caused fewer side effects than lorazepam and was not different from placebo in this respect. finally, buspirone maintained its anxiolytic effect for at least 2 weeks after the discontinuation of treatment.",1
"background: muscle cramp is a painful, involuntary muscle contraction, and that occurs during or following exercise is referred to as exercise-associated muscle cramp (eamc). the causes of eamc are likely to be multifactorial, but dehydration and electrolytes deficits are considered to be factors. this study tested the hypothesis that post-exercise muscle cramp susceptibility would be increased with spring water ingestion, but reduced with oral rehydration solution (ors) ingestion during exercise. methods: ten men performed downhill running (dhr) in the heat (35-36 °c) for 40-60 min to reduce 1.5-2% of their body mass in two conditions (spring water vs ors) in a cross-over design. the body mass was measured at 20 min and every 10 min thereafter during dhr, and 30 min post-dhr. the participants ingested either spring water or ors for the body mass loss in each period. the two conditions were counter-balanced among the participants and separated by a week. calf muscle cramp susceptibility was assessed by a threshold frequency (tf) of an electrical train stimulation to induce cramp before, immediately after, 30 and 65 min post-dhr. blood samples were taken before, immediately after and 65 min after dhr to measure serum sodium, potassium, magnesium and chroride concentrations, hematocrit (hct), hemoglobin (hb), and serum osmolarity. changes in these varaibles over time were compared between conditions by two-way repeated measures of analysis of variance. results: the average (±sd) baseline tf (25.6 ± 0.7 hz) was the same between conditions. tf decreased 3.8 ± 2.7 to 4.5 ± 1.7 hz from the baseline value immediately to 65 min post-dhr for the spring water condition, but increased 6.5 ± 4.9 to 13.6 ± 6.0 hz in the same time period for the ors condition (p < 0.05). hct and hb did not change significantly (p > 0.05) for both conditions, but osmolarity decreased (p < 0.05) only for the spring water condition. serum sodium and chloride concentrations decreased (< 2%) at immediately post-dhr for the spring water condition only (p < 0.05). conclusions: these results suggest that ors intake during exercise decreased muscle cramp susceptibility. it was concluded that ingesting ors appeared to be effective for preventing eamc.",1
"background: post-partum depression is a serious mood disorder in women that might be triggered by peripartum fluctuations in reproductive hormones. this phase 2 study investigated brexanolone (usan; formerly sage-547 injection), an intravenous formulation of allopregnanolone, a positive allosteric modulator of γ-aminobutyric acid (gabaa) receptors, for the treatment of post-partum depression. methods: for this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, we enrolled self-referred or physician-referred female inpatients (≤6 months post partum) with severe post-partum depression (hamilton rating scale for depression [ham-d] total score ≥26) in four hospitals in the usa. eligible women were randomly assigned (1:1), via a computer-generated randomisation program, to receive either a single, continuous intravenous dose of brexanolone or placebo for 60 h. patients and investigators were masked to treatment assignments. the primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in the 17-item ham-d total score at 60 h, assessed in all randomised patients who started infusion of study drug or placebo and who had a completed baseline ham-d assessment and at least one post-baseline ham-d assessment. patients were followed up until day 30. this trial is registered with clinicaltrials.gov, number nct02614547. findings: this trial was done between dec 15, 2015 (first enrolment), and may 19, 2016 (final visit of the last enrolled patient). 21 women were randomly assigned to the brexanolone (n=10) and placebo (n=11) groups. at 60 h, mean reduction in ham-d total score from baseline was 21·0 points (se 2·9) in the brexanolone group compared with 8·8 points (se 2·8) in the placebo group (difference -12·2, 95% ci -20·77 to -3·67; p=0·0075; effect size 1·2). no deaths, serious adverse events, or discontinuations because of adverse events were reported in either group. four of ten patients in the brexanolone group had adverse events compared with eight of 11 in the placebo group. the most frequently reported adverse events in the brexanolone group were dizziness (two patients in the brexanolone group vs three patients in the placebo group) and somnolence (two vs none). moderate treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in two patients in the brexanolone group (sinus tachycardia, n=1; somnolence, n=1) and in two patients in the placebo group (infusion site pain, n=1; tension headache, n=1); one patient in the placebo group had a severe treatment-emergent adverse event (insomnia). interpretation: in women with severe post-partum depression, infusion of brexanolone resulted in a significant and clinically meaningful reduction in ham-d total score, compared with placebo. our results support the rationale for targeting synaptic and extrasynaptic gabaa receptors in the development of therapies for patients with post-partum depression. a pivotal clinical programme for the investigation of brexanolone in patients with post-partum depression is in progress.",1
"this review article focuses on the role of biological disease markers in treating patients with diabetic retinopathy (dr), or eye diseases from diabetes. the article also investigates how nerve cells in the eye die in these patients. evaluating the importance of non-measurable and measurable disease markers of dr and nerve cell degeneration can help disease detection, prediction, and treatment. an analysis of these markers allows for effective treatment and prevention of health hazards in patients with dr based on measuring and monitoring these markers.",0
"parkinson's disease (pd), the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease, has been linked to increased central and peripheral inflammation. although the response of the immune system to dopaminergic treatment remains to be fully understood, dopaminergic agonists are known to exhibit immunoregulatory properties which may, at least in part, explain their therapeutic effect in pd. this highlights the need of analyzing immune parameters in longitudinal studies on pd patients receiving specific therapeutic regimes. in this work, pd patients were included in a two-year prospective study comparing the effect of levodopa alone and a levodopa/pramipexole combo therapy on several regulatory and pro-inflammatory immune cell populations. we demonstrated that pd patients show decreased circulating levels of several important regulatory subpopulations, as determined by flow cytometry. notably, when administered alone, levodopa decreased the levels of functional bregs and slamf1+ tolerogenic dcs and increased the levels of total and hla-dr+ classical monocytes, while the pramipexole/levodopa combo may promote treg- and tolerogenic dc-mediated regulatory responses. these results suggest that a regime based on levodopa alone may promote a pro-inflammatory-type response in pd patients, but when combined with pramipexole, it promotes a clinically beneficial regulatory-type environment.",1
"gabapentin is a new antiepileptic drug (aed) with an attractive pharmacokinetic profile. it is absorbed by an active and saturable transport system, and has a high volume of distribution. gabapentin is not bound to plasma proteins, does not induce hepatic enzymes and is not metabolized. at steady state, it has a half-life of 6-8 h, and is eliminated unchanged by renal route with a plasma clearance proportional to the creatinine clearance. it is devoid of significant drug-drug interactions when administered with the established aeds or with oral contraceptives. gabapentin used as an add-on aed significantly reduced the frequency of partial seizures and secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures in three large double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trails. it is well tolerated, with transient somnolence and dizziness being the most frequent adverse effects. although the mechanism of action of gabapentin is not fully established, there is strong evidence to suggest a novel mechanism of action. gabapentin is a unique and promising drug that could improve the quality of life of patients with epilepsy and is a welcome addition to the armamentarium of currently available aeds for the treatment of patients with seizures of partial onset.",1
"methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) is a critical folate (specific vitamin)-metabolizing enzyme which requires riboflavin as its co-factor. co-factors are needed for enzymes, catalysts for chemical reactions in the body, to complete their roles. a common variation (677c→t) in the mthfr gene results in reduced mthfr activity. this can caused impaired folate metabolism and increased homocysteine concentrations. homocysteine is a chemical your body produces to help make proteins. individuals can inherit the same form of a gene from both parents. when this occurs, a person has homozygosity. homozygosity for this genetic variation (tt genotype) is associated with an increased risk of a number of conditions. these conditions include heart disease and stroke. however, there is a large amount of variability or differences in the extent of excess risk in various reports. the study aimed to explore the evidence available that supports this genetic variation increasing the risk for several adverse or bad health outcomes. additionally, the study aimed to explore the evidence of how b-vitamins can help alleviate or lessen disease risk. there is strong evidence that links the genetic variation (tt genotype) with hypertension (hig blood pressure) and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, particularly preeclampsia. furthermore, high blood pressure was found to be highly responsive to or affected by riboflavin intervention or treatment specifically in individuals with the mthfr 677tt genotype. future intervention studies aimed at genetically predisposed or genetically risky individuals are required to further understand this gene-nutrient interaction. this genetic variation has also been associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects (ntd), brain-related damage, and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. however, the evidence on this subject has been inconsistent. initial evidence has suggested there may be a greater need for women with mthfr 677tt genotype to take folic acid prior to conception (or having a baby) for the prevention of ntd. however, this idea requires further investigation.",0
"each year, 4 to 5 million newborns receive state-mandated screening. the advisory committee on heritable disorders in newborns and children has identified 34 main conditions that should be included in screening programs. however, each state manages, funds, and maintains its own program. state programs include screening, as well as the diagnosis and coordination of care for newborns with positive test results. testing for the main disorders is fairly standardized, but more extensive screening varies widely by state. additionally, the rigorous evaluation of new screening panels is ongoing. the standard group of tests includes testing for three main categories of disorders: metabolic disorders, problems with hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen in the blood) and a group of assorted conditions, including congenital hearing loss. family doctors need to be familiar with the expanded newborn screening tests to effectively communicate the results to parents, and to create plans of action. these doctors also need to recognize signs of metabolic disorders that may not be detected by screening tests or that may not be a part of standard newborn screening in their state. for infants with positive screening results that lead to a diagnosis, long-term follow-up involves ongoing parental education, regular exams, and management at a metabolic treatment center. long-term follow-up also involves tests of brain development to detect relevant disorders in time for early action.",0
"in the 1990s, selenium was found to be a part of a protein that helps produce thyroid hormone. since this discovery, many scientists have studied how selenium might help thyroid health. selenium, which has antioxidant characteristics, is found in meat, seafood and grains. the amount of selenium eaten varies across the world due to different soils and how much of it plants absorb. eating too much or too little selenium can cause health problems, with a small ideal range for consumption. studies that look at how often diseases occur in different groups of people and why show a relationship between eating too little selenium and higher rates of inflamed thyroid caused by thyroid cells that are attacked by infection-preventing cells, graves disease (a disease in which infection-preventing cells attack healthy cells and lead to an overactive thyroid), and enlarged thyroids. studies of people taking selenium who have long-term inflamed thyroids caused by thyroid cells attacked by infection-preventing cells generally have bloodwork that suggests more normal thyroid function but no improvement in symptoms. in graves disease, taking selenium might make overactive thyroid go away faster and make quality of life and eye problems better in people with mild thyroid eye disease. although selenium is only recommended for people with thyroid eye disease, doctors prescribe selenium for other thyroid problems. current and future studies might help determine who should take selenium based, for example, on blood selenium levels and heredity.",0
"over 80 monoclonal antibody medicines have been shown to block the interaction between the coronavirus glycoprotein (a molecule that has a carbohydrate and a protein) and its cell receptor that can send signals, resulting in making the virus ineffective. the coronavirus causes covid-1, a viral breathing-related disorder, and monoclonal antibodies are medicines that may block the virus that causes covid-19 from attaching to human cells. some of those monoclonal antibodies show that they work well to reduce the effects of the virus and lung inflammation (redness and swelling in response to infection) in animal studies. the process used by monoclonal antibodies to make the virus ineffective in humans and animals is not fully understood, but the best protection is associated with the fc effector functions, which are the part of the antibody that interacts with other cells. approximately 30 monoclonal antibodies are currently being tested in clinical trials in covid-19 patients. some are granted emergency authorization (where unapproved medicines may be used) because they reduce the amount of virus in the body, lessen the seriousness of the disease, and reduce hospital stays in clinical trials. however, monoclonal antibodies are expensive for healthcare systems in many developing countries, meaning that most infected people would not have access to the medicine. another challenge for covid-19 medicines that use monoclonal antibodies is the new variants that change cell receptor activity for the glycoprotein. the variants of concern are more easily transmitted between people, are found worldwide, and include those designated as alpha, beta, epsilon, gamma, and delta. monoclonal antibody medicines, and antibodies in plasma (the liquid portion of blood) of vaccinated or recovering people, fail to efficiently make the variants of interest ineffective.",0
"introduction: trigeminal neuralgia is an exemplary neuropathic pain condition characterized by paroxysmal electric-shock-like pain. however, up to 50% of patients also experiences concomitant continuous pain. in this neuroimaging study, we aimed to identify the specific anatomical features of trigeminal nerve root in patients with concomitant continuous pain. methods: we enrolled 73 patients with a definitive diagnosis of classical and idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia and 40 healthy participants. the diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia was independently confirmed by two clinicians. patients were grouped as patients with purely paroxysmal pain (45 patients) and patients also with concomitant continuous pain (28 patients). all participants underwent a structured clinical examination and a 3t mri with sequences dedicated to the anatomical study of the trigeminal nerve root, including volumetric study. images analysis was independently performed by two investigators, blinded to any clinical data. results: in most patients with concomitant continuous pain, this type of pain, described as burning, throbbing or aching, manifested at the disease onset. demographic and clinical variables did not differ between the two groups of patients; the frequency of neurovascular compression and nerve dislocation were similar. conversely, trigeminal nerve root atrophy was more severe in patients with concomitant continuous pain than in those with purely paroxysmal pain (p = 0.006). conclusions: our clinical and neuroimaging study found that in patients with trigeminal neuralgia, concomitant continuous pain was associated with trigeminal nerve root atrophy, therefore suggesting that this type of pain is likely related to axonal loss and abnormal activity in denervated trigeminal second-order neurons.",1
"importance: the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic is threatening billions of people worldwide. tocilizumab has shown promising results in retrospective studies in patients with covid-19 pneumonia with a good safety profile. objective: to evaluate the effect of early tocilizumab administration vs standard therapy in preventing clinical worsening in patients hospitalized with covid-19 pneumonia. design, setting, and participants: prospective, open-label, randomized clinical trial that randomized patients hospitalized between march 31 and june 11, 2020, with covid-19 pneumonia to receive tocilizumab or standard of care in 24 hospitals in italy. cases of covid-19 were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction method with nasopharyngeal swab. eligibility criteria included covid-19 pneumonia documented by radiologic imaging, partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (pao2/fio2) ratio between 200 and 300 mm hg, and an inflammatory phenotype defined by fever and elevated c-reactive protein. interventions: patients in the experimental arm received intravenous tocilizumab within 8 hours from randomization (8 mg/kg up to a maximum of 800 mg), followed by a second dose after 12 hours. patients in the control arm received supportive care following the protocols of each clinical center until clinical worsening and then could receive tocilizumab as a rescue therapy. main outcome and measures: the primary composite outcome was defined as entry into the intensive care unit with invasive mechanical ventilation, death from all causes, or clinical aggravation documented by the finding of a pao2/fio2 ratio less than 150 mm hg, whichever came first. results: a total of 126 patients were randomized (60 to the tocilizumab group; 66 to the control group). the median (interquartile range) age was 60.0 (53.0-72.0) years, and the majority of patients were male (77 of 126, 61.1%). three patients withdrew from the study, leaving 123 patients available for the intention-to-treat analyses. seventeen patients of 60 (28.3%) in the tocilizumab arm and 17 of 63 (27.0%) in the standard care group showed clinical worsening within 14 days since randomization (rate ratio, 1.05; 95% ci, 0.59-1.86). two patients in the experimental group and 1 in the control group died before 30 days from randomization, and 6 and 5 patients were intubated in the 2 groups, respectively. the trial was prematurely interrupted after an interim analysis for futility. conclusions and relevance: in this randomized clinical trial of hospitalized adult patients with covid-19 pneumonia and pao2/fio2 ratio between 200 and 300 mm hg who received tocilizumab, no benefit on disease progression was observed compared with standard care. further blinded, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the results and to evaluate possible applications of tocilizumab in different stages of the disease.",1
"viral infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and the importance of public health practices including handwashing and vaccinations in reducing their spread is well established. furthermore, it is well known that proper nutrition can help support optimal immune function, reducing the impact of infections. several vitamins and trace elements play an important role in supporting the cells of the immune system, thus increasing the resistance to infections. other nutrients, such as omega-3 fatty acids, help sustain optimal function of the immune system. the main aim of this manuscript is to discuss of the potential role of micronutrients supplementation in supporting immunity, particularly against respiratory virus infections. literature analysis showed that in vitro and observational studies, and clinical trials, highlight the important role of vitamins a, c, and d, omega-3 fatty acids, and zinc in modulating the immune response. supplementation with vitamins, omega 3 fatty acids and zinc appears to be a safe and low-cost way to support optimal function of the immune system, with the potential to reduce the risk and consequences of infection, including viral respiratory infections. supplementation should be in addition to a healthy diet and fall within recommended upper safety limits set by scientific expert bodies. therefore, implementing an optimal nutrition, with micronutrients and omega-3 fatty acids supplementation, might be a cost-effective, underestimated strategy to help reduce the burden of infectious diseases worldwide, including coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19).",1
"introduction and importance: a littre's hernia (lh) is defined by the presence of meckel's diverticulum (md) in any kind of hernia sac. preoperative diagnosis of lh is a challenge because of its rarity and the absence of specific radiological findings and clinical presentation. surgery is the appropriate treatment of complicated lh that is an extremely rare condition with approximately 50 cases reported in the literature over the past 300 years. case presentation: a 46-year-old caucasian female was admitted to the emergency department with a two-day history of abdominal pain. physical examination revealed an irreducible and painfull mass in umbilical region. abdominal computed tomography scan showed the protrusion of greater omentum and small bowel loop through the umbilical ring. laboratory tests were unremarkable. after diagnosis of strangulated umbilical hernia, the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy: the irreducible umbilical hernial sac was opened with presence of incarcerated and strangulated omentum and uncomplicated md. resection of incarcerated and ischemic greater omentum alone was performed. the postoperative course of patient was uneventful. clinical discussion: meckel's diverticulum (md) is a vestigial remnant of the omphalomesenteric duct, representing the most common congenital malformation of the gastrointestinal tract. preoperative diagnosis of lh is very difficult and surgery represents the correct treatment of complicated lh. conclusion: lh represents an extremely rare complication of md difficult to diagnose and suspect because of the lack of specific radiological findings and clinical presentation. surgery represents the appropriate treatment of abdominal wall hernias and complicated md.",1
"dystonia is a neurological condition characterized by abnormal involuntary movements or postures owing to sustained or intermittent muscle contractions. dystonia can be the manifesting neurological sign of many disorders, either in isolation (isolated dystonia) or with additional signs (combined dystonia). the main focus of this primer is forms of isolated dystonia of idiopathic or genetic aetiology. these disorders differ in manifestations and severity but can affect all age groups and lead to substantial disability and impaired quality of life. the discovery of genes underlying the mendelian forms of isolated or combined dystonia has led to a better understanding of its pathophysiology. in some of the most common genetic dystonias, such as those caused by tor1a, thap1, gch1 and kmt2b mutations, and idiopathic dystonia, these mechanisms include abnormalities in transcriptional regulation, striatal dopaminergic signalling and synaptic plasticity and a loss of inhibition at neuronal circuits. the diagnosis of dystonia is largely based on clinical signs, and the diagnosis and aetiological definition of this disorder remain a challenge. effective symptomatic treatments with pharmacological therapy (anticholinergics), intramuscular botulinum toxin injection and deep brain stimulation are available; however, future research will hopefully lead to reliable biomarkers, better treatments and cure of this disorder.",1
"background: total knee arthroplasty (tka) alleviates pain, but muscle strength and function is reduced for a long period postoperatively. aim: to investigate whether maximal strength training (mst) is more effective in improving muscle strength than standard rehabilitation (sr) after tka. design: a randomized, controlled study. setting: community physical therapy centers and university hospital research department. population: forty-one adults <75 years with primary, unilateral osteoarthritis of the knee scheduled for tka. methods: participants were randomized to supervised mst of the lower extremities 3 times/week for 8 weeks and physiotherapy session1/week (n.=21) or to sr, including physiotherapy sessions/telephone contact 1/week and writing home exercise logs (n.=20). maximal strength in leg press and knee extension, 6-minute walk test, patient-reported functional outcome score and pain were assessed preoperatively, 7 days, 10 weeks and 12 months postoperatively. results: the mst group exceeded preoperative levels of muscle strength in leg press and knee extension by 37% and 43%, respectively at 10 weeks' follow-up, and the increase was higher than in the sr group (p≤0.001). strength differences persisted up to 12-months follow-up. at 12 months, both groups recovered to normative levels in the 6-minute walk test, with no statistically significantly difference between the groups. conclusions: participants undergoing mst experienced superior increases in leg press and knee extension muscle strength compared with those managed with sr from 7-day to 10-week follow-up. the difference in muscle strength was maintained at 12-month follow-up. no differences in functional performance were found at any time-point. clinical rehabilitation impact: exercises after tka should be performed with high intensity and target the operated leg specifically.",1
"when patients present with acute or chronic hand and/or finger pain after an injury, try placing a pencil first over and then under the proximal phalanx of the finger that is generating the pain. ask the patient to flex and extend the fingers several times. putting the affected metacarpal phalangeal (mp) joint more relatively flexed or extended than the other mp joints will often take away the pain with active movement with the pencil in place. when this happens, our hand therapist builds a relative motion splint that simulates the effect of the pencil. these are very functional splints that patients wear 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. most people can work with these splints on.",1
"hyperkalemia results either from the shift of potassium out of cells or from abnormal renal potassium excretion. cell shift leads to transient increases in the plasma potassium concentration, whereas decreased renal excretion of potassium leads to sustained hyperkalemia. impairments in renal potassium excretion can be the result of reduced sodium delivery to the distal nephron, decreased mineralocorticoid level or activity, or abnormalities in the cortical collecting duct. in some instances, all 3 of these perturbations are present. excessive intake of potassium can cause hyperkalemia but usually in the setting of impaired renal function. we discuss the clinical manifestations of hyperkalemia and outline an approach to its diagnosis and treatment.",1
"may-thurner syndrome (mts) is a condition in which the main right leg blood vessel compresses the main left leg blood vessel. mts puts the patient at risk of deep venous thrombosis (dvt), or deep blood clotting. we describe a 30-year-old female who arrived at the emergency department with worsening left leg swelling for four weeks, with low-risk chance for dvt. exams showed left leg swelling with serious swelling up to the knee. her lower leg calf muscle was tender to touch. various blood vessel pulsations in the leg were noticeable due to the swelling. however, the rest of her pulsations were examined by touch. therefore, the identification of possibly dvt was made. further invesetigations were requested. we present this case to highlight the symptoms of may-thurner syndrome, its identification, and treatment.",0
"exercise-associated muscle cramps (eamc) are a common type of muscle spasm, in which a muscle continually contracts without intention, causing pain. scientists have tried to explain why these cramps happen, but have not been able to. an idea commonly returned to throughout the years is that eamcs may be caused by heat. recently, though, more likely explanations are thought to include dehydration, lack of electrolytes, or issues with the nerves connecting to the muscles. the aim of this review is to look at recent research into how and why eamcs happen. we searched common online resources for papers. for search terms, we used: muscle cramps, neuromuscular hypothesis (or thesis), dehydration hypothesis, exercise-associated muscle cramps, nocturnal cramps, muscle spasm, muscle fatigue. the search returned 424 papers. we read and analyzed 69 of them. from the latest evidence, interactions of nerves with muscles explains muscle cramps better than dehydration. muscle contraction is normally balanced by special cells in the muscles that sense how stretched or contracted the muscles are. recent findings suggest malfunctions in these sensor cells result in spinal nerves sending unnecessary signals for the muscles to contract. in summary, the signal causing muscles to contract during a spasm seems to come from the spine rather than the nerve endings within the muscles.",0
"this is a review of the drugs called antihistamines because they help with allergies caused by the body chemical histamine. these drugs are used widely, but little is known about their interactions with human body. the max amount of antihistamines gets into the blood 2 to 3 hours after taking a pill or syrup. the amounts of the drug that made it into the blood were about a third of the taken pill for chlorpheniramine, about half for diphenhydramine, and about a quarter for promethazine. most of these drugs are processed in the body by the liver. these drugs are usually removed from the body at a rate of 5 to 12 milliliters per minute for each kilogram of body weight. half of the total amount of the drug is taken out of the body from about 3 hours to about 20 days. for cinnarizine it's about 3 hours; diphenhydramine about 4 hours; promethazine 10 to 14 hours; chlorpheniramine 14 to 25 hours; hydroxyzine about 20 hours; brompheniramine about 25 hours; astemizole about 7 to 20 days, when taken for a long time; and for flunarizine about 18 to 20 days. these drugs tend to go from the blood into the body tissues, meaning that a higher dose of a drug is needed to keep its levels in the blood. in children, chlorpheniramine and hydroxyzine go to half of the amount in the body faster than in adults. in patients with liver disease due to alcohol, time to get half of the diphenhydramine out lengthens from 9 to 15 hours. in patients with kidney disease, time to get out chlorpheniramine was very greatly prolonged. almost nothing is known about these drugs in the bodies of newborns, and pregnant or breastfeeding women. because half of the drug stays in the body longer for the older antihistamines such as brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine and hydroxyzine, they can be given to adults once daily.",0
"a major advancement has been made in the treatment related to central nervous system disorders (disorders impacting the brain and spinal cord), especially parkinson's disease. new medications and more information on how they change proteins in the body lead to new interest in many promising therapies for parkinson's disease. parkinson's disease is defined by neuronal degeneration (the loss of nerve cells in the brain) and neuroinflammation (inflammatory response within the brain or spinal cord due to the immune system responding to injury or infection). the presence of the neurofibrillary aggregates (accumulation of a protein inside neurons) is considered as the trait to help diagnose. additionally, it is also characterized by the presence of motor (movement) and non-motor (unrelated to movement such as pain and tiredness) symptoms, as seen in patients with parkinson's disease. many treatment options mainly focus on prevention measures or on treating the symptoms of parkinson's. neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration are the areas of interest to focus on in parkinson's disease. a thorough study of these areas helps address changing molecules that cause the neuronal degeneration and neuroinflammation in parkinson's disease. many drugs are available for the treatment of parkinson's disease, although levodopa (a drug that enters the brain and helps replace missing dopamine) is the preferred drug because it controls symptoms. however, it also has side effects. it is always suggested to use other drug therapies with levodopa. a number of major causes and therapeutic targets for parkinson's disease have been identified in the last 10 years. this text highlights the most significant of them. it is also found that structured treatment plans and therapies depend on the individual and should be made specifically for the individual patient's needs.",0
"we aimed to investigate the clinical and genetic predictors of painful vaso-occlusive crises (voc) in sickle cell disease (scd) in cameroon. socio-demographics, clinical variables/events and haematological indices were acquired. genotyping was performed for 40 variants in 17 pain-related genes, three fetal haemoglobin (hbf)-promoting loci, two kidney dysfunctions-related genes, and hba1/hba2 genes. statistical models using regression frameworks were performed in r® . a total of 436 hydoxycarbamide- and opioid-naïve patients were studied; median age was 16 years. female sex, body mass index, hb/hbf, blood transfusions, leucocytosis and consultation or hospitalisation rates significantly correlated with voc. three pain-related genes variants correlated with voc (cacna2d3-rs6777055, p = 0·025; drd2-rs4274224, p = 0·037; kcns1-rs734784, p = 0·01). five pain-related genes variants correlated with hospitalisation/consultation rates. (comt-rs6269, p = 0·027; faah-rs4141964, p = 0·003; oprm1-rs1799971, p = 0·031; adrb2-rs1042713; p < 0·001; ugt2b7-rs7438135, p = 0·037). the 3·7 kb hba1/hba2 deletion correlated with increased voc (p = 0·002). hbf-promoting loci variants correlated with decreased hospitalisation (bcl11a-rs4671393, p = 0·026; hbs1l-myb-rs28384513, p = 0·01). apol1 g1/g2 correlated with increased hospitalisation (p = 0·048). this first study from africa has provided evidence supporting possible development of genetic risk model for pain in scd.",1
"monoclonal antibodies are medicines that can make the coronavirus ineffective and have shown to be beneficial in cases of mild to moderate coronavirus infection, substantially reducing the risk for staying in the hospital and having severe symptoms of the disease. the coronavirus can cause covid-19, the viral breathing-related infection. treatment usually requires high doses of these monoclonal antibodies with limited ability in preventing complications or death among patients hospitalized with covid-19. this study reports on the development and evaluation of monoclonal antibodies enhanced with the fc (the part of the antibody that helps interactions with other cells) to prevent or treat covid-19. in several animal studies of covid-19, researchers show that activating certain parts of the fc proteins results in improvements in both preventing and treating weight loss and death from the disease. this helps reduce the dose required to gain full protection in animals who are not infected with the coronavirus. results highlight the importance of the fc proteins in increasing immunity to the virus. these findings may influence the development of fc monoclonal antibodies with improved functions to help strengthen immunity against covid-19.",0
"fibroblast growth factors (fgfs) and their receptors (fgfrs) play significant roles in vertebrate organogenesis and morphogenesis. fgfr3 is a negative regulator of chondrogenesis and multiple mutations with constitutive activity of fgfr3 result in achondroplasia, one of the most common dwarfisms in humans, but the molecular mechanism remains elusive. in this study, we found that chondrocyte-specific deletion of bmp type i receptor a (bmpr1a) rescued the bone overgrowth phenotype observed in fgfr3 deficient mice by reducing chondrocyte differentiation. consistently, using in vitro chondrogenic differentiation assay system, we demonstrated that fgfr3 inhibited bmpr1a-mediated chondrogenic differentiation. furthermore, we showed that fgfr3 hyper-activation resulted in impaired bmp signaling in chondrocytes of mouse growth plates. we also found that fgfr3 inhibited bmp-2- or constitutively activated bmpr1-induced phosphorylation of smads through a mechanism independent of its tyrosine kinase activity. we found that fgfr3 facilitates bmpr1a to degradation through smurf1-mediated ubiquitination pathway. we demonstrated that down-regulation of bmp signaling by bmpr1 inhibitor dorsomorphin led to the retardation of chondrogenic differentiation, which mimics the effect of fgf-2 on chondrocytes and bmp-2 treatment partially rescued the retarded growth of cultured bone rudiments from thanatophoric dysplasia type ii mice. our findings reveal that fgfr3 promotes the degradation of bmpr1a, which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of fgfr3-related skeletal dysplasia.",1
"sarcoidosis is characterized by granuloma formation, the macrophage being the most important building block. the activated macrophage in sarcoidosis produces interleukin-1 (ii-1). it is well known that interleukin-1, among other functions, stimulates the hepatic production of c-reactive protein. we therefore prospectively measured the serum c-reactive protein in 17 patients with active pulmonary sarcoidosis, 10 patients with other chronic interstitial lung diseases of unknown etiology, 11 patients with active lung tuberculosis, and 10 healthy volunteers. serum c-reactive protein was assayed by enzymoimmunodiffusion test. the serum c-reactive protein was negative in 13 patients suffering from active sarcoidosis and positive in four. patients with other interstitial lung diseases had negative results in 7 and positive in 3 cases. the analyses of c-reactive protein in patients with sputum positive lung tuberculosis were positive in 10 cases. all the healthy controls had negative c-reactive protein measurements. the difference between the groups was statistically significant when sarcoidosis and tuberculosis serum c-reactive protein measurements were compared (p less than 0.01), as well as the difference between the group of other interstitial lung diseases and tuberculosis (p less than 0.01). in this respect, the measurements of serum c-reactive protein are valuable in the differentiation of sarcoidosis and other chronic interstitial lung diseases of unknown etiology from tuberculosis and other diseases which are known to induce an acute phase response.",1
"over the past decade, there have been major advances in the development of pacemakers and the implantable defibrillator, a device that monitors your heart rate and delivers a strong electrical shock to restore the heartbeat to normal. the relationship between when the lower chambers of the heart are activated and how the heart pumps are now better understood. activating the lower chambers of the heart (ventricular activation) can now be achieved in many patients with pacing of the his bundle (a part of the electrical conduction system of the heart that transmits pulses). this approach provides an alternative to right ventricle pacing that may cause ventricles in the heart to not function properly. advances in the technology will increase ease and use of this form of pacing. when it is not possible to activate the ventricles from the his purkinje system that is the rapid electric conduction in the ventricles, left ventricle pacing for cardiac resynchronization therapy or crt (treatment that helps the heart beat at the right rhythm) will continue to be important for patients with slower ventricular function. surprisingly, cardiac resynchronization therapy (crt) is often beneficial even though current use is limited to the few places in the left ventricle. the development of pacing devices with multiple placements in the heart system is an important advance and provided multiple left ventricle pacing arrangements to select from to find the best site. this option also addresses problems of electric stimulation of the diaphragm and high pacing ceilings that often limit delivery of left ventricle pacing. these leads will also allow performance of simultaneous pacing from multiple left ventricle sites, which may improve mechanical performance in situations other than when there is a delay or blockage of electrical impulses to the left side of the heart.",0
"phenylketonuria (pku) is an inherited, metabolic disorder caused by a lack of a specific liver enzyme or protein. if left untreated, phenylketonuria may lead to intellectual disability. treating pku includes a diet low in the molecule phenylalanine and completed with other molecules. the diet starts within the first weeks of life after identification. while dietary treatment prevents intellectual disability in patients with early treated pku, the diet is hard to follow due to its taste. other issues with dietary treatment include deficiencies in vitamin d and b12. patients that do not follow the diet experience low cognitive function. there have been many attempts to improve the diet including its taste. changes like using new amino acids and protein units have been explored. gene therapy and enzyme replacement have been more promising recently. this article reviews current and possible treatments for pku.",0
"phenylketonuria (pku), caused by genetic alterations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene, is the most common disorder inherited from both parents in which the degree the body can properly turn food (and the protein phenylalanine) into energy can be predicted from genetic makeup. severe pku leads to an inability to properly convert food. we estimated that 0.45 million individuals have pku worldwide at a given point in time, occurring in 1 in 23,930 live births (range: 1 in 4,500 [italy]-1 in 125,000 [japan]). comparing genetic makeups and observable pku symptoms from 16,092 affected people showed differences in disease seriousness in 51 countries from 17 world regions, with the worldwide observable pku symptoms being 62% classic pku, 22% mild pku, and 16% mild elevated phenylalanine blood levels. observable pku symptoms and genetic makeups differ across europe, from classic pku in the east to mild pku in the southwest and mild elevated phenylalanine blood levels in the south. a specific genetic alteration can be followed from northern to western europe, from sweden through norway, to denmark, to the netherlands. the part of the population with classic pku at any point in time increases from europe (56%) through the middle east (71%) to australia (80%). of 758 genetic alterations, three were the most common (22.2%, 6.4%, and 5.5%, respectively) and caused two widespread genetic types at any point in time (11.4% and 2.6%, respectively). most genetic makeups (73%) were compound heterozygous (both forms of the gene have different mutations), 27% were homozygous (both forms of the gene have the same mutation), and 55% of 3,659 different genetic makeups happened in only one person. genetic alterations associated with pah were scored and connected with pre-treatment blood phenylalanine levels (6,115 patients) and results from a test to predict long-term treatment responsiveness (4,381 patients). this allowed prediction of both observable pku symptoms based on genetic makeup and treatment responsiveness. this study shows that large databases of genetic makeups allow correct prediction of observable pku symptoms, which allows doctors to choose the right therapies to improve patient results.",0
"objective: hypothyroidism is relatively common, occurring in approximately 5% of the general us population aged ≥12 years. levothyroxine (lt4) monotherapy is the standard of care. approximately, 5%-10% of patients who normalise thyroid-stimulating hormone levels with lt4 monotherapy may have persistent symptoms that patients and clinicians may attribute to hypothyroidism. a long-standing debate in the literature is whether addition of levotriiodothyronine (lt3) to lt4 will ameliorate lingering symptoms. here, we explore the evidence for and against lt4/lt3 combination therapy as the optimal approach to treat euthyroid patients with persistent complaints. methods: recent literature indexed on pubmed was searched in march 2017 using the terms ""hypothyroid"" or ""hypothyroidism"" and ""triiodothyronine combination"" or ""t3 combination."" relevant non-review articles published in english during the past 10 years were included and supplemented with articles already known to the authors. findings: current clinical evidence is not sufficiently strong to support lt4/lt3 combination therapy in patients with hypothyroidism. polymorphisms in deiodinase genes that encode the enzymes that convert t4 to t3 in the periphery may provide potential mechanisms underlying unsatisfactory treatment results with lt4 monotherapy. however, results of studies on the effect of lt4/lt3 therapy on clinical symptoms and thyroid-responsive genes have thus far not been conclusive. conclusions: persistent symptoms in patients who are biochemically euthyroid with lt4 monotherapy may be caused by several other conditions unrelated to thyroid function, and their cause should be aggressively investigated by the clinician.",1
"the respiratory and behavioral effects of the benzodiazepine receptor (bzr) inverse agonist ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-cce) were determined alone and in combination with buspirone, lorazepam, flumazenil, and sr 95195 in rhesus monkeys. for the respiratory studies, one group of monkeys inhaled either air or 5% co2 mixed in air according to a fixed alternating schedule; respiratory frequency and minute volume were monitored. for the behavioral studies, another group of monkeys responded under a fixed-ratio (fr 30) schedule of food presentation. the respiratory stimulant effects of beta-cce in both air and 5% co2 were enhanced by prior treatment with the 5-hydroxytryptamine1a (5-ht1a) partial agonist buspirone (0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg) and a weak bzr inverse agonist, sr 95195 (10.0 mg/kg). coadministration of buspirone (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) also potentiated the rate-decreasing effects of beta-cce under the fr schedule. the bzr agonist lorazepam (3.0 mg/kg) and bzr antagonist flumazenil (1.0 mg/kg) attenuated the effects of beta-cce on respiratory frequency and minute volume particularly under the 5% co2 condition, and lorazepam (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) and flumazenil (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) attenuated the effects of beta-cce on fr responding. these latter results show that the respiratory and behavioral effects of beta-cce in rhesus monkeys are at least in part due to effects at bzrs. moreover, the findings suggest either that coactivation of benzodiazepine and 5-ht1a sites lead to a greater than additive effect or that beta-cce and buspirone share a common mechanism of action that is unrelated to the receptor at which bzr inverse agonists act.",1
"researchers analyzed the effects of an alpha-thalassemia (another genetic blood disease) mutation and fetal hemoglobin-promoting quantitative trait loci (hbf-qtl (special section of dna)) in senegalese children and young adults with sickle cell anemia (sca) who have not received the medicine, hydroxyurea. steady biological signs and crises from blood vessel blockages (vaso-occlusive crises-voc) requiring emergency admission were recorded over a 2-year period in 301 children with sickle cell anemia (sca). the age of the first hospitalized voc was also recorded. these facts were compared to patients who had alpha-globin and hbf-qtl genes. three different gene regions on the hbf-qtl gene were studied in detail. a score was given to patients from zero to six depending on the different changes (mutations) at the 3 gene regions. a higher hbf-qtl score resulted in better signs of sca disease outcome only for patients without the alpha-thalassemia mutation. with the alpha-thalassemia mutation, a higher hbf-qtl score was linked to more voc (vaso-occlusive crises). the age of the first hospitalization for voc was older in patients with the alpha-thalassemia mutation and at least 2 hbf-qtl gene region mutations. the alpha-thalassemia mutation and the hbf-qtl gene mutations react with each other and can change the severity of sickle cell anemia. these genes and their mutations should be studied together, not separately, at least in children who have not received hydroxyurea.",0
"pregabalin is a nerve pain medication. the drug has been shown to help reduce opioid use (opioid-sparing) and have pain relieving (analgesic) effects in the early period following a surgery. however, effects before, during, and after surgery on cognition (thinking ability) have not been studied. a study in 80 patients that had one or both of their kidneys removed was previously conducted to evaluate the opioid-sparing, analgesic, and antihyperalgesic (reduction of pain sensitivity) effects of pregabalin. this paper describes a secondary investigation that tested if pregabalin would impair cognitive function when compared to a control (no treatment) group. eighty patients scheduled for donor nephrectomy (removal of one or both kidneys) participated in this study. pregabalin (150 mg twice daily) or placebo (a harmless pill) was administered (given) on the day of surgery and the first post-operation day. this was given in addition to a pain regimen consisting of opioids, steroids, local anesthetics, and acetaminophen (pain medication). cognitive tests measuring inhibition (restraint), sustained attention, psychomotor (movement) speed, visual memory, and strategy were performed before, 24 h, and 3 to 5 days after surgery. the spatial working memory test is used to determine if a participant can recall the configuration of a series of images. during the test, the number of errors increased with pregabalin treatment compared to placebo 24 h after surgery. furthermore, pregabalin significantly increased the number of errors in the stop-signal task stop-go test compared with placebo. there were no significant differences between treatment groups in the paired associated learning, reaction time, rapid visual processing, or spatial working memory strategy tests. perioperative (around surgery time) pregabalin significantly negatively affected several aspects of cognitive function when compared to placebo. however, psychomotor speed or movement was not changed.",0
"the objective of this study was to examine the associations between aromatase inhibitor therapy and hair loss or hair thinning among female breast cancer survivors. data were analyzed from 851 female breast cancer survivors who responded to a hospital registry-based survey. data on hair loss, hair thinning, demographic characteristics, and health habits were based on self-report; data on aromatase inhibitor therapy were collected on the survey and verified using medical record review. logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios (ors) and 95 % confidence intervals (cis) for the associations between aromatase inhibitor therapy and the hair outcome variables adjusted for potential confounders, including age and chemotherapy treatment. the results showed that 22.4 % of the breast cancer survivors reported hair loss and 31.8 % reported hair thinning. in the confounder-adjusted analyses, breast cancer survivors who were within 2 years of starting aromatase inhibitor treatment at the time of survey completion were approximately two and a half times more likely to report reporting hair loss (or 2.55; 95 % ci 1.19-5.45) or hair thinning (or 2.33; 95 % ci 1.10-4.93) within the past 4 weeks compared to those who were never treated with an aromatase inhibitor. current aromatase inhibitor use for two or more years at the time of the survey and prior use were significantly associated with hair thinning (current users, ≥2 years: or 1.86; prior users: or 1.62), but not hair loss. findings from this study suggest that aromatase inhibitor use is associated with an increased risk of hair loss and hair thinning independent of chemotherapy and age; these side effects are likely due to the substantial decrease in estrogen concentrations resulting from treatment with this drug. future research should focus on examining these associations in a prospective manner using more detailed and objective measures of hair loss and thinning.",1
"we looked at the effects of rubbing an ointment with capsaicin, found in different types of hot peppers, on the ears to improve swallowing function and create a new and safe treatment for old people who have the sensation of food stuck in the esophagus without physical blockage. we looked at 26 old people who had the sensation of food stuck in the esophagus without physical blockage. we used a q-tip to put ointment with 0.025% capsaicin (0.5 g) in the ear only once or once a day for 7 days before drinking 3 ml of colored water, which was recorded using a flexible tube with a camera and rated using a common test that measures how well one swallows. after putting 0.025% capsaicin ointment to the right ear, the common swallowing test showed less difficulty swallowing. this effect lasted for one hour. after putting the ointment on alternating ears once a day for 7 days, the common swallowing test showed less difficulty swallowing in people with more serious sensations of food stuck in the esophagus without physical blockage. of the eight people fed with tubes in this group, three began direct swallowing exercises using jelly, which then returned their ability to eat food by mouth. we concluded that putting ointment with capsaicin on the ear improves swallowing function in old people who have the sensation of food stuck in the esophagus without physical blockage. in the same way as other methods to stimulate the cough reflex, putting capsaicin on the ears may decrease how often people with difficulty swallowing develop pneumonia, caused by something entering the airway or lungs by accident, through a cough reflex stimulated by a nerve.",0
"polycystic kidney disease (pkd) is a genetic disorder characterized by aberrant renal epithelial cell proliferation and formation and progressive growth of numerous fluid-filled cysts within the kidneys. previously, we showed that there is elevated notch signaling compared to normal renal epithelial cells and that notch signaling contributes to the proliferation of cystic cells. quinomycin a, a bis-intercalator peptide, has previously been shown to target the notch signaling pathway and inhibit tumor growth in cancer. here, we show that quinomycin a decreased cell proliferation and cyst growth of human adpkd cyst epithelial cells cultured within a 3d collagen gel. treatment with quinomycin a reduced kidney weight to body weight ratio and decreased renal cystic area and fibrosis in pkd1rc/rc ; pkd2+/- mice, an orthologous pkd mouse model. this was accompanied by reduced expression of notch pathway proteins, rbpjk and heyl and cell proliferation in kidneys of pkd mice. quinomycin a treatments also normalized cilia length of cyst epithelial cells derived from the collecting ducts. this is the first study to demonstrate that quinomycin a effectively inhibits pkd progression and suggests that quinomycin a has potential therapeutic value for pkd patients.",1
"hashimoto's thyroiditis (ht) is the most common type of disease caused by thyroid cells that are attacked by infection-preventing cells and results in an underactive thyroid. recently, science has shown vitamin d can change how normal and cancer cells grow, divide, and change from one cell to another, how the heart works, and how the body's immune system changes. too little vitamin d is seen in people with hashimoto's thyroiditis. this study aimed to determine the effect of vitamin d on thyroid autoantibodies (substances that develop when a person's immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid) and thyroid hormone (t4, t3, and thyroid-stimulating hormone) blood levels in women. we split 42 women with ht disease into two groups and gave one group vitamin d and the other group sham treatment. we gave one group 50,000 international units of vitamin d and the other group sugar pills for 3 months. we measured blood levels of thyroid autoantibodies and thyroid hormones (t4, t3, and thyroid-stimulating hormone) at the beginning and end of the study using a common antibody-measuring tool. blood levels of one antibody and thyroid-stimulating hormone were lower at the end of the study in the group taking vitamin d. the group taking vitamin d and the group taking sugar pills had similar blood levels of another antibody. blood levels of t3 and t4 hormones did not change in either group. therefore, taking vitamin d can help people with hashimoto's thyroiditis. however, more large studies done over time are needed to see if it can be used in patient care.",0
"current expert panel guidance for osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become weak and brittle) testing states that not enough data exist on the best period of time in between tests and that periods of over 2 years may be needed to better predict the risk of breaking bones. in addition, the guidance mentions a study showing that measuring bmd after 8 years only helped a small amount to predict osteoporosis compared with initial bmd scan results. re-think the period of time between osteoporosis checks; for women who have gone through menopause (a point in time 12 months after the last period) with an initial normal bone mineral density (bmd) or slightly weaker than normal bones, 15 years between checks is likely enough.",0
"the new covid-19 (a viral, respiratory disease) is a serious threat to health and financial stability because of a lack of vaccines and treatments. low-grade inflammation (how the body responds to infection) is a common factor in cases that become more serious, and low levels of vitamins and minerals may contribute to this inflammation. the aim of this paper is to explore the usefulness of starting certain vitamins and minerals early, especially zinc, selenium (a mineral found in water and foods), and vitamin d, to keep covid-19 infections from becoming more serious. researchers did an online search for scientific articles published from 2010 to 2020 on zinc, selenium, and vitamin d, in addition to corona and similar virus infections. there are a few studies that show direct evidence on associations between zinc, selenium, and vitamin d, and covid-19. getting enough zinc, selenium, and vitamin d is important for the body to resist other viral infections, as well as for immune function and to reduce inflammation, which is the body's response to infections. therefore, it is suggested that changing nutrition to get enough of these vitamins and minerals might provide protection against the coronavirus and keep covid-19 infection from becoming serious. researchers of this paper recommend giving supplements to high-risk areas and/or soon after suspected infection with coronavirus. people in high-risk groups should have a high priority to receive nutrition supplements and therapies, which should be started before specific and supportive medical measures.",0
"pallister-hall syndrome (phs) is a rare disorder caused by changes in the gene called gli3. patients with phs have a variety of problems with reproduction and urinary organs, including poor development of the kidneys, backup of urine in the duct between the kidney and the bladder, swelling of the kidneys, or a shared opening for the birth canal and the urinary tract. it is not known how the specific problems arise we show that variations in the gli3 gene cause poor development of the kidneys, and a closed end in the duct that runs between the kidney and the bladder, which causes swelling of the kidneys and the duct. mice with the same change in the gli3 gene also had two ducts that connected a kidney to the bladder the abnormal development is caused by the lack of information the embryonic cells (cells that forms when eggs are fertilized) need for proper development. using mutant mice, we show that the development of the reproduction and urinary organs is controlled by the variants in the gli3 gene. different problems in phs are caused by the different mistakes in the development of the urinary organs due to the information provided by the variants of the gli3 gene.",0
"background: aromatase inhibitors (ais) are standard hormone therapy (ht) for the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal endocrine-sensitive early breast cancer. treatment discontinuation due to toxicity is an important issue that may help clinicians identify effective clinical interventions to allow adequate treatment duration. we reviewed the main reasons for interruption of ais at our institution from 2006 to 2009. methods: 236 patients treated with adjuvant ais were eligible for analysis. median age was 64 years (35-89), median follow-up 53 months (6-60). prior adjuvant chemotherapy was taxane based in 47 patients and anthracycline based in 43 patients. 118 patients had received letrozole, 101 anastrozole, and 17 exemestane. results: twenty-four patients (10%) needed discontinuation of the first ai assigned as a result of toxicity. grade 2/3 arthralgia was the main reason for discontinuation in 13/24 patients. no differences in the incidence of arthralgia were noted in patients who had received taxanes or anthracyclines. headache, alopecia, itching, diffuse skin reaction, allergic reaction with hypertensive crisis, xerostomia and xerophthalmia, insomnia and somnolence were the other reasons for discontinuation. in multivariate logistic regression analysis, age (65 years) and ht were independent factors associated with the onset of arthralgia (p = 0.006 and p = 0.008, respectively; or 2.65, 95% ci 1.32-5.31). alternative ht (ai or tamoxifen) was offered to patients who wanted or needed to permanently interrupt the ongoing drug. conclusions: in our analysis, 10% of patients discontinued the first ai assigned because of toxicity. median time course of all adverse events leading to ht discontinuation was 155 days and 135 days for arthralgia. a switch to alternative ht with toxicity monitoring is a recommended option for avoiding premature and permanent interruption of an effective treatment.",1
"background: there is no agreeing if rescue therapy can avoid short-term colectomy in patients treated for severe steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis. aims: the aim of our study was to identify predictors of response to infliximab and cyclosporine a. methods: in this cross-sectional study, 49 patients with severe ulcerative colitis were included. response to therapy was defined as three or more point reductions in mayo score after 6 months of treatment and avoidance of colectomy after 1 year. the predictors analysed were gender, age, time from ulcerative colitis diagnosis, months of steroid or/and azathioprine therapy before onset of the severe phase, smoking habits, extension of the disease, laboratory analyses and mayo score. results: patients treated with infliximab showed a statistically significant higher response rate in case of moderate mayo score (p = 0.04). ex-smokers had very low chance of response to infliximab (p = 0.03). in the group treated with cyclosporine a, patients with c-reactive protein >3 mg/l had a response rate significantly higher than those with c-reactive protein <3 mg/l (p = 0.03); those with negative c-reactive protein and moderate mayo score did not responded to therapy, while in the ones with elevated c-reactive protein and/or severe mayo score, 15 versus 4 responded (p = 0.008). conclusions: our data suggest that cyclosporine a is advisable in ex-smokers. in never smokers or active smokers, infliximab can be prescribed in case of mayo score ≤10 and/or negative crp, while cyclosporine a is indicated in case of mayo score >10 and positive crp.",1
"histone deacetylase (hdac) are enzymes that control transcription (the process of copying a segment of dna into messenger rna, or mrna, for protein creation), but their specific functions in the kidney are unknown. researchers discovered that the human kidney uses class i hdacs to activate or build molecules or proteins. the slowing or stopping of class i hdacs from the kidney medulla region in rats during high-salt feedings results in diseases such as hypertension (high blood pressure) and hypokalemia (low levels of potassium in the blood). three new animal studies are used to determine that hdac1 and hdac2 in the kidney epithelium (cells that cover the inner surface of organs) are necessary for maintaining electrolyte (minerals in the body) balance when the body takes in increased sodium. additionally, epithelial hdac1 and hdac2 are necessary for activating many sodium or water transporters and channels across cells. in reviewing all relevant studies of serious side effects connected with clinical hdac inhibitor use, researchers found that hdac inhibitors (molecules or enzymes that block actions of an enzyme protein) increased the chance of experiencing fluid-electrolyte disorders (a group of conditions caused by a temporary disturbance in the body's levels of fluids and electrolytes), such as hypokalemia. this study provides a greater understanding of potential serious side effects with hdac inhibitors, which may be fatal to very ill patients. in conclusion, hdacs from the kidney provide a link between the environment, such as consuming high-salt diets, and regulating processes to stay in fluid-electrolyte balance.",0
"endometrial cancer (ec), cancer of the lining of the uterus, is one of the most common and deadly cancers of the female reproductive system worldwide, but there is no working treatment for ec patients who do not respond to progesterone, a hormone. trying drugs used for other things is a good way to find new ways to treat conditions. perphenazine, used to treat psychotic disorders, might treat people with endometrial cancer who are both sensitive to and resistant to progesterone. perphenazine reduced growth of certain cancer-causing endometrial cells based on common lab tests. tests showed perphenazine also reduced movement of certain cancer-causing endometrial cells. tests suggest that perphenazine could kill certain cancer-causing endometrial cells. perphenazine also could reduce tumor growth in mice without affecting body weight.",0
"thyroiditis is a general term that encompasses several clinical disorders characterized by inflammation of the thyroid gland. the most common is hashimoto thyroiditis; patients typically present with a nontender goiter, hypothyroidism, and an elevated thyroid peroxidase antibody level. treatment with levothyroxine ameliorates the hypothyroidism and may reduce goiter size. postpartum thyroiditis (occurring within one year of childbirth, miscarriage, or medical abortion) can be short-lived or long-lasting. release of preformed thyroid hormone into the bloodstream may result in hyperthyroidism. this may be followed by transient or permanent hypothyroidism as a result of depletion of thyroid hormone stores and destruction of thyroid hormone-producing cells. patients should be monitored for changes in thyroid function. beta blockers can treat symptoms in the initial hyperthyroid phase; in the subsequent hypothyroid phase, levothyroxine should be considered in women with a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level greater than 10 miu per l, or in women with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 4 to 10 miu per l who are symptomatic or desire fertility. subacute thyroiditis is a transient thyrotoxic state characterized by anterior neck pain, suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone, and low radioactive iodine uptake on thyroid scanning. many cases of subacute thyroiditis follow an upper respiratory viral illness, which is thought to trigger an inflammatory destruction of thyroid follicles. in most cases, the thyroid gland spontaneously resumes normal thyroid hormone production after several months. treatment with high-dose acetylsalicylic acid or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is directed toward relief of thyroid pain.",1
"postpartum depression (ppd) is a common and serious mental health problem that is associated with maternal suffering and numerous negative consequences for offspring. the first six months after delivery may represent a high-risk time for depression. estimates of prevalence range from 13% to 19%. risk factors mirror those typically found with major depression, with the exception of postpartum-specific factors such as sensitivity to hormone changes. controlled trials of psychological interventions have validated a variety of individual and group interventions. medication often leads to depression improvement, but in controlled trials there are often no significant differences in outcomes between patients in the medication condition and those in placebo or active control conditions. reviews converge on recommendations for particular antidepressant medications for use while breastfeeding. prevention of ppd appears to be feasible and effective. finally, there is a growing movement to integrate mental health screening into routine primary care for pregnant and postpartum women and to follow up this screening with treatment or referral and with follow-up care. research and clinical recommendations are made throughout this review.",1
"it is important to have flexibility in using different covid-19 vaccines for additional doses. we studied mixing astrazeneca, pfizer, moderna and novavax, which work differently. in this clinical trial, adults aged 50 years and older who received the first dose of astrazeneca or pfizer vaccine got a second dose of the same vaccine or moderna or novavax 8-12 weeks after the first dose. 28 days after the second dose, chemicals the body produces to protect itself against covid-19 were measured in the blood. these people did not have these chemicals before the study. we also studied safety of the vaccines. 1072 people participated in the study 9.4 weeks after getting the first vaccine. 540 people got the first dose of astrazeneca and 532 got pfizer. there were somewhat more men than women in both groups. 28 days after the boosters, all people who had the first astrazeneca vaccine had an increased number of chemicals against covid-19 in their blood for all boosters. in people who had the pfizer vaccine first, getting a pfizer or moderna booster increased the chemicals the most. novavax also increased the amount of anti-covid-19 chemicals, but not as much as the other boosters. 15 people had serious problems, but the problems were not caused by the vaccine. getting a moderna dose after astrazeneca or pfizer first vaccines temporarily increased protection against covid-19 more than getting the same second vaccine. novavax did not work the same way. many vaccines can be used as the second dose after getting the first dose of astrazeneca or pfizer. this should help distributing vaccines around the world.",0
"background: antiepileptic drugs (aeds) can be associated with neurotoxic side effects including cognitive dysfunction, a problem of considerable importance given the usual long-term course of treatment. pregabalin is a relatively new aed widely used for the treatment of seizures and some types of chronic pain including fibromyalgia. we measured the cognitive effects of 12 weeks of pregabalin in healthy volunteers. methods: thirty-two healthy volunteers were randomized in a double-blind parallel study to receive pregabalin or placebo (1:1). pregabalin was titrated over 8 weeks to 600 mg/d. at baseline, and after 12 weeks of treatment, all subjects underwent cognitive testing. test-retest changes in all cognitive and subjective measures were z scored against test-retest regressions previously developed from 90 healthy volunteers. z scores from the placebo and pregabalin groups were compared using wilcoxon tests. results: thirty subjects completed the study (94%). three of 6 target cognitive measures (digit symbol, stroop, controlled oral word association) revealed significant test-retest differences between the pregabalin and placebo groups, all showing negative effects with pregabalin (p < 0.05). these cognitive effects were paralleled by complaints on the portland neurotoxicity scale, a subjective measure of neurotoxicity (p < 0.01). conclusion: at conventional doses and titration, pregabalin induced mild negative cognitive effects and neurotoxicity complaints in healthy volunteers. these effects are one factor to be considered in the selection and monitoring of chronic aed therapy. class of evidence: this study provides class i evidence that pregabalin 300 mg bid negatively impacts cognition on some tasks in healthy volunteers.",1
getting a pfizer or moderna booster after the astrazeneca vaccine protects against covid-19 better than getting the same astrazeneca booster. we studied how a booster with the same astrazeneca or a different pfizer or moderna vaccine protects against covid-19 over time. we analyzed chemicals that protect against covid-19 in the blood of 57 people on the day of the second vaccination and the following seven days. all boosters increased the protective chemicals in the blood. different boosters had earlier and stronger protection than boosting with the same astrazeneca vaccine. people who had moderna booster after the first astrazeneca vaccine had more protective chemicals than those who got pfizer. the body produced different protective chemicals at the same time. the different boosters were more protective than the same astrazeneca booster.,0
"we enrolled 107 patients with generalized anxiety disorder who had been long-term benzodiazepine users (average length of use=8.5 years) in a program to discontinue benzodiazepines to measure how well other anxiety-reducing drugs like imipramine (180 mg/day) and buspirone (38 mg/day) helped patients wean or discontinue benzodiazepines compared to sugar pills. after a period to stabilize benzodiazepine levels taking either diazepam, lorazepam, or alprazolam, patients took imipramine, buspirone, or sugar pills for 4 weeks while the amount of benzodiazepines taken were kept the same (treatment phase). patients then slowly decreased the amount of benzodiazepines taken for 4-6 weeks, took imipramine, buspirone, and sugar pills for the next 3 weeks, and then took sugar pills for 2 weeks. blood benzodiazepine levels were measured weekly using a common lab test. we measured how many patients no longer had benzodiazepine in their blood 3 and 12 months after the last sugar pill. study participants had used benzodiazepines for a long time and had tried an average of three times to decrease the amount of benzodiazepines taken. patients who took imipramine were significantly more successful in decreasing the amount of benzodiazepines taken (82.6%), nonsignificantly more successful regarding patients who took buspirone (67.9%), than for patients who took sugar pills (37.5%). imipramine helped even after factoring in other factors to weaning success: amount of benzodiazepines taken, level of anxious feelings prior to weaning, and how long benzodiazepines have been taken. we concluded that discontinuing benzodiazepines can be done more easily by giving patients imipramine before and during the process of slowly decreasing the amount of benzodiazepines taken over time. amount of benzodiazepines taken daily, level of anxiety and depression prior to weaning, and how long benzodiazepines have been taken also predicted success of slowly decreasing the amount of benzodiazepines taken.",0
"postnatal depression (depression after childbirth) is a major public health problem. it affects about one in seven women after childbirth. depression is also common during pregnancy and throughout the perinatal period (time of pregnancy and after childbirth ). it is associated with symptoms of anxiety. there are harmful effects for women themselves to become depressed when they are going through demanding physical and social changes. but there are also other concerns. maternal depression can cause problems with the relationship between mother and child. there can also be problems with the child's emotional, behavioral and cognitive (thinking) development. prevention and early interventions may be important in view of the frequent contact pregnant women, new mothers and infants have with health services. the effectiveness of these interventions needs to be tested. in the past year there have been five new studies of antenatal (during pregnancy) screening for postnatal depression. these studies agree with nine earlier studies showing that there is no evidence to support routine antenatal screening for postnatal depression. seven new prevention and early intervention studies add evidence on a wide range of treatments ranging from practical support to individual interpersonal therapy. these studies have not found significant differences in the outcome of depression. two new studies on the prevention of the recurrence of depression show promise of success. one invention study involves interpersonal therapy and the other includes partners in psychoeducational visits. neither study is large enough to form a basis for practice change. new interventions, or promising findings, with a strong basis in theory need to be tested in trials (human studies) which are large enough and which meet internationally accepted standards and guidelines.",0
"endometrial (outer womb) cancer (ec) is a common, fatal female-related cancer worldwide, but there is no treatment for ec patients of progesterone (specific female hormone) resistance. adapting current drugs is useful to discover new candidate drugs. in this text, perphenazine (ppz), used for psychosis, may treat patients with both progesterone sensitive and resistant outer womb cancer. perphenazine (an anti-psychotic) blocked cell growth in two, outer womb cancer cell groups. perphenazine could effectively cause controlled cell death in two, outer womb cancer cell groups. also, perphenazine could block phosphorylation of akt, which activates the akt enzyme which monitors cell growth. delightedly, perphenazine could weaken cancer growth from a different-species organ transplant in mice at various doses without affecting body weight.",0
"background/aim: to investigate the clinical features and underlying etiologies of chronic cough (cc). materials and methods: five hundred and ten cc patients were enrolled. the phases, characteristics and associated clinical manifestations of cc among the gastroesophageal reflux cough (gerc), cough-variant asthma (cva), and upper airway cough syndrome (uacs) groups were compared, and the diagnostic values of each group were evaluated by multiple regression analysis. results: in the 510 patients, 404 had cc with single etiology-gerc (n = 175), cva (n = 134), and uacs (n = 95). the characteristic features of gerc included gastric acid backflow symptoms such as sour-tasting regurgitation, heartburn, endoscopic esophagitis, poststimulation cough, frequent throat clearing, daytime mono-cough, and feelings of heaviness and pain in the chest. patients with cva typically exhibited sensitivity to smog and other irritants; the cough occurred mostly at night, and was associated with positive bronchodilator and provocation test results. the typical features of uacs included a history and/or symptoms of rhinitis, retropharyngeal postnasal drip, and wet cough occurring mostly during the daytime. the diagnostic specificities of above factors were >70%. conclusion: the most common causes of cc include gerc, cva, and uacs, and their diagnosis is based on the characteristics of the underlying disease.",1
"polycystic kidney disease (pkd) is an inherited disorder of abnormal kidney cell growth and development of many fluid-filled cysts or swellings in the kidneys. before, we showed there is increased signaling of a specific cell pathway (notch) compared to normal kidney cells. this notch signaling contributes to cystic cell growth. quinomycin a, a specific protein segment, has been shown to target the notch cell signaling pathway and block tumor growth in cancer. here, we show that quinomycin a decreased cell and cyst growth of human, diseased cyst cells created in an isolated environment. treatment with quinomycin a reduced kidney weight to body weight ratio and reduced kidney cystic area and scarred tissue in mice with pkd. reduced amounts of proteins of the notch cell signaling patway, rbpjk and heyl, and reduced cell growth in kidneys of pkd mice also occured with the other effects. quinomycin a also controlled hairlike structions on cyst cells from kidney tubes. this is the first study to show that quinomycin a blocks pdk progression and suggests that quinomycin a has beneficial value for pkd patients.",0
"introduction: long-term treatment of parkinson's disease (pd) with levodopa is hampered by motor complications related to the inability of residual nigrostriatal neurons to convert levodopa to dopamine (da) and use it appropriately. this generated a tendency to postpone levodopa, favoring the initial use of da agonists, which directly stimulate striatal dopaminergic receptors. use of da agonists, however, is associated with multiple side effects and their efficacy is limited by suboptimal bioavailability. areas covered: this paper reviewed the latest preclinical and clinical findings on the efficacy and adverse effects of non-ergot da agonists, discussing the present and future of this class of compounds in pd therapy. expert opinion: the latest findings confirm the effectiveness of da agonists as initial treatment or adjunctive therapy to levodopa in advanced pd, but a more conservative approach to their use is emerging, due to the complexity and repercussions of their side effects. as various factors may increase the individual risk to side effects, assessing such risk and calibrating the use of da agonists accordingly may become extremely important in the clinical management of pd, as well as the availability of new da agonists with better profiles of safety and efficacy.",1
"we found pancreatic islet-cell antibodies (i.c.ab; proteins made against insulin-producing cells in the pancreas) in 31 patients with disorders where the body's defense system attacks certain organs; 4 parents, siblings, or children of people with i.c.ab-positive diabetes, and 1 apparently normal person, none of whom had symptoms of diabetes. of these 36 people, glucose (sugar molecule)-tolerance tests (g.t.t.s) showed 10 had diabetes, 4 had lag storage (normal glucose levels spike and return to normal), and 22 had normal results. two people had latent diabetes (slow progressing with features of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes) while pregnant and thyrotoxicosis (too much metabolism-regulating thyroid hormone in the body) and another 2 later developed type 1 diabetes. blood from 26 people had been stored for 1-11 years before we did the oral (by mouth) tests that measures the body's response to sugar (glucose). i.c.ab measurements rose and fell in some patients and stayed constant in other patients. no relationship existed between the measurement, change in measurement, or the length of i.c.ab or the presence of antigens (substances that causes the body to defend itself) and the g.t.t. result. i.c.ab in the blood can indicate diabetes without symptoms and slow-progressing diabetes and prediabetes and may signal a new group of possible diabetics with normal g.t.t.s. many possible diabetics with normal g.t.t.s. have at least one disorder where the body's defense system attacks certain organs (regardless of family history of diabetes), but some are parents, siblings, or children of people with i.c.ab (mainly type 1 diabetes). about 0-5% of the general population also have i.c.ab in their blood.",0
"1. the purpose of this study was to compare the effects and abrupt discontinuation of buspirone 15 or 20 mg tid and lorazepam 3 or 4 mg tid following 8 weeks of treatment. a total of 43 outpatients with generalized anxiety disorder were included in the study and 39 entered the withdrawal phase. 2. clinical assessments were performed at baseline, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks (active phase) and after 9 and 10 weeks (withdrawal phase). these included the hamilton anxiety scale, the visual analogue scale, the chess 84 (a check list for the evaluation of somatic symptoms) and the lader tranquilizer withdrawal scale (translated in french). 3. results show similar efficacy for lorazepam and buspirone during the active phase with a higher significant difference for buspirone on the chess 84 in relation with neurovegetatives symptoms: lorazepam d0 :16.30 +/- 3.14 d56: 5.10 +/- 0.93 (p < or = 0.01) buspirone d0 :18.82 +/- 3.4 d56: 4.73 +/- 1.18 (p < or = 0.001). no withdrawal phenomena was observed for both drugs using ham-a lorazepam d63 :12.59 +/- 2.26 d70: 12.0 +/- 1.75 (p = ns) buspirone d63 :10.05 +/- 1.28 d70: 10.32 +/- 1.82 (p = ns) and the same significant difference using lader scale: lorazepam d63 :4.44 +/- 0.89 d70: 6.96 +/- 1.28 (p < or = 0.05) buspirone d63 :2.95 +/- 0.66 d70: 4.15 +/- 0.92 (p < or = 0.05) 4. this study confirmed that buspirone was as effective as lorazepam at d56 in monitored outpatients with generalized anxiety disorder. there are some evidences that these two drugs differed in efficacy against the various somatic symptoms encountered in generalized anxiety disorder.",1
"hyperkalemia is a frequent clinical abnormality in patients with chronic kidney disease, and it is associated with higher risk of mortality and malignant arrhythmias. severe hyperkalemia is a medical emergency, which requires immediate therapies, followed by interventions aimed at preventing its recurrence. current treatment paradigms for chronic hyperkalemia management are focused on eliminating predisposing factors, such as high potassium intake in diets or supplements, and the use of medications known to raise potassium level. among the latter, inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system are some of the most commonly involved medications, and their discontinuation is often the first step taken by clinicians to prevent the recurrence of hyperkalemia. while this strategy is usually successful, it also deprives patients of the recognized benefits of this class, such as their renoprotective effects. the development of novel potassium binders has ushered in a new era of hyperkalemia management, with a focus on chronic therapy while magentomaintaining the use of beneficial, but hyperkalemia-inducing medications such as renin-angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitors. this review article examines the incidence and clinical consequences of hyperkalemia, and its various treatment options, with special emphasis on novel therapeutic agents and the potential benefits of their application.",1
"this study looked at using tele-rehab (where providers interact with patients remotely using the internet) after complete or partial knee replacement surgery. specifically, the study looked at: (1) how well patients kept up with the program, (2) time spent performing physical therapy exercises, (3) how easy it was to use the virtual rehab software, and (4) outcomes for a certain group of patients that had knee replacement surgery. a total of 157 patients in a row had complete (18) or partial (139) knee replacement. these patients used a tele-rehab system with an instructional avatar, three-dimensional motion measurement and analysis software, and real-time tele-visit capability designed for joint surgery patients. we measured how well patients kept up with the program by how many times the patients followed the recommended repetitions of exercises. we collected the total each patient time spent performing exercises. we evaluated how easy it was for patients to use the virtual rehab software using a questionnaire. we also recorded the number of in-person and virtual visits for each patient. we collected patient-reported outcomes through patient/doctor portals. measurements included were the knee society score (kss) for pain and functions, the western ontario and mcmaster universities osteoarthritis index (womac) score, and boston university activity measure for post-acute care (am-pac) score. patients spent an average of about 30 days participating in the therapy. complete knee replacement patients, on average, had 3.5 outpatient follow-up visits each for in-office therapy with a physical therapist. partial knee replacement patients had, on average, 3.2 of these visits. for complete knee replacement patients, this was on average 0.8 more visits than for real-time virtual patient-clinician. for partial hip replacement patients, it was 1 more visit. patients spent, on average, 26.5 minutes per day doing an average of 13.5 exercises. by the end of rehab, patients had spent an average of 10.8 hours doing exercises, and of all the exercises performed, around 21 were uniquely designed. after therapy, kss pain and function scores improved notably. the scores for pain improved by 368% for complete knee replacement and 350% for partial. the scores for function improved by 33% for complete knee replacement 27% for partial. additionally, womac scores improved by 57% for partial knee replacement and 66% for compete knee replacement. the improvement in am-pac scores was at 22% for partial and 24% for complete. this tele-rehab platform encouraged interaction between doctors and patients beyond the hospital setting. it offers the advantage of cost savings, convenience, at-home monitoring, and coordination of care. all of these are geared to improve how well patients keep up and overall patient satisfaction. additionally, the data from the platform can be used to make custom physical therapy regimens to assure proper rehabilitation. this is lacking in other tele-rehab applications that use non-interactive videos that can be watched on mobile devices and tablets.",0
"we aimed to make an osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become weak and brittle) self-assessment tool for taiwan (ostai) and compare this with existing 2013 guidelines for bone mineral density (bmd) testing among taiwan women who had gone through menopause (a point in time 12 months after the last period). we tested women nationwide using a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (dxa; a common text to measure bone density) between 2008 and 2011. all women filled out a questionnaire, which included individual information and risk factors of bone breaks caused by osteoporosis. we used this information to look at possible risk factors for osteoporosis. we set up ostai to find those who needed bmd measurement. we compared accuracy for disease detection and no detection between ostai and the 2013 guidelines. we studied 12,175 taiwan women who had gone through menopause. there are 6393 (52.5%) participants whose risk of osteoporosis was 57.5% (3674/6393). ostai showed slightly lower accuracy for disease detection and higher accuracy for no detection than 2013 guidelines. ostai is useful to find taiwan women who have gone through menopause with osteoporosis. compared to current guidelines, ostai may be an easier and better tool to determine who should have dxa in taiwan.",0
"chronic wounds unresponsive to existing treatments constitute a serious disease burden. factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic ulcers include oxidative stress, comorbid microbial infections, and the type of immune system response. preclinically, and in a case study, a formulation containing a ceratothoa oestroides olive oil extract promoted wound healing. patients with chronic venous and pressure ulcers, clinically assessed as being unresponsive to healing agents, were treated for 3 months with an ointment containing the c oestroides extract combined with antibiotic and/or antiseptic agents chosen according to the type of bacterial infection. treatment evaluation was performed using the bates-jensen criteria with +wounddesk and mowa cell phone applications. after 3 months of treatment, c oestroides resulted in an average decrease of 36% in the bates-jensen score of ulcers (p < .000), with the decrease being significant from the first month (p < .007). the combined use of topically applied antibiotics and antiseptics efficiently controlled microbial ulcer infection and facilitated wound healing. in relation to other factors such as initial wound size, chronicity appeared to be an important prognostic factor regarding the extent of wound healing. future clinical investigations assessing the wound healing efficacy of the c oestroides olive oil extract are warranted.",1
"we evaluated the impact of tumor shrinkage (ts) induced by molecular targeted therapy as the first-line systemic therapy on the survival of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mrcc). a total of 67 patients with mrcc who received first-line molecular targeted therapy were included in this study. sixty patients were evaluable by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors. patients underwent the first evaluation at 8-12 weeks after the start of the therapy. twenty patients had ts ≧30%, 32 from 30% to -20%, and 8 ≦-20%. the median overall survival periods of patients who achieved ts ≧30%, from 30% to -20%, and ≦-20% at first evaluation were 41.0, 35.0, and 11.5 months, respectively. univariate and multivariate analyses showed that ts of≧0%, in addition to negative c-reactive protein and the absence of bone metastasis were good predictors of overall survival. the patients who achieved 0% or more at the initial evaluation had longer survival than those who had no tumor reduction (40.0 months vs 12.0 months, p<0. 001). these findings suggest that early ts affects overall survival in real practice. we should consider alternative therapies for patients who have not achieved tumor reduction at the initial evaluation.",1
"aim: to measure ketonemia in a control population of pregnant women and in a population of women with gestational diabetes (gdm). to define a normal ketonemia threshold for the controls and to determine whether or not this value could play a role in the clinical management of women with gdm. method: fifty-six women with a normal ogtt and 49 women with gdm were included and monitored from the 25th to the 37th week of pregnancy. control subjects agreed to perform glycaemia and ketonemia self-monitoring 3 times a day. in addition, women with gdm were asked to measure their postprandial glycaemia. glycaemia and ketonemia measurements were performed using optium meters. subjects kept a 24-hour food record twice a week. results: the mean ketonemia was lower in the control group than in the gdm group (0.01+/-0.10 vs. 0.04+/-0.009 mmol/l; p<0.001). ketonemia values measured before the midday meal and prior to the evening meal were lower for control subjects than for gdm patients (p=0.002 and p=0.005). fasting ketonemia was unrelated to ketonuria in the gdm group, whereas there was a correlation in the control group (p=0.006). at least one chronic increase in ketonemia levels was observed in 47% of the women with gdm, compared with only 12% of controls. the lowest levels of evening glycaemia correlated with the highest levels of ketonemia; women with gdm reported lower food and carbohydrate intakes than controls (p<0.001). conclusion: this work has enabled the establishment of ketonemia reference standards in non-diabetic pregnant women. if ketonemia does indeed indicate overly restrictive dietary behavior, this parameter could be employed for monitoring adherence to the nutritional recommendations for gdm.",1
"benzodiazepines (bdz) are drugs that are often used to treat anxiety, muscle spasms, and seixures. long-term bdz use and dependence negatively affect cognitive functioning (thinking ability). these effects can be partially irreversible. new evidence suggests that pregabalin (pgb) might be a safe and effective treatment of long-term bdz use. the goal of the study was investigate the changes in cognitive function after successful treatment of long-term bdz use and dependence with pgb. fourteen patients with long-term bdz use underwent several neurological (brain-related) and cognititive function tests. these evaluations were conducted before the initiation of pgb treatment and at a two months follow-up after the cessation (stopping) of bdzs. patients' scores from the tests were compared with control data. patients improved on several cognitive measures with strong effect sizes. by contrast, they failed to improve on measures of attentional flexibility (the ability to shift focus). despite their significant improvement, patients' scores on most tests were low when compared to control scores. the study findings suggest that successful treatment of long-term bdz use with pgb is associated (linked) with a substantial, though only partial, recovery of bdz-compromised brain function, at least at a 2-month follow-up.",0
"kidneys play a major role in the maintenance and control of acid-base homeostasis (having the right amount of acid and base in the blood and other body fluids) and electrolyte homeostasis (the correct concentration of different ions in the body, such as sodium and potassium), which is required for metabolism and other organ functions. chronic (long-lasting or recurring) kidney diseases weakens the regulatory functions and leads to changes in electrolyte and acid-base balance, which can be life-threatening. in this review, researchers discuss renal (kidney-related) control functions of electrolyte and acid-base balance and several common disorders, such as disorders with too much acid or base in body fluids, or low potassium levels. common disorders in chronic kidney disease are also discussed. the most recent and important advances on pathophysiology (functional changes that come with a particular syndrome or disease), clinical characteristics (symptoms and results from lab tests), diagnosis, and management of these conditions have been incorporated.",0
"for the study's purpose, the vast majority of mutations for epilepsy (a brain disease causing seizures) syndromes such as genetic epilepsy with fever-related seizures plus (gefs+) and dravet syndrome (ds) (lifelong epilepsy) occur in the specific gene scn1a. for the study's methods, 63 individuals with either ds or gefs + syndrome were tested for scn1a gene mutation using gene labeling techniques. our research study found 15 new disease-cuasing mutations in the scn1a gene, of which 12 appeared to be mutations with three deletions, two of which shifted the entire gene. the distribution of clinical physical effects in patients carrying scn1a mutations was as follows: twelve patients had classical ds, three patients had gefs + syndrome and two relatives of ds patients were suffering from fever-related seizures. in conclusion, our study highlights the physical effects and gene-related differences of ds and gefs + with the important aim of gaining a deeper understanding of scn1a-related disorders. this study also represents the first genetic analysis of the scn1a gene in a hungarian group with the ds and gefs + syndrome physical make-up.",0
"pregabalin (pgb) is an analog of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid. the currently available evidence favors the misuse and abuse potential of pgb. however, its neurotoxicity remains unclear. therefore, this study assessed the toxic effects of chronic pregabalin dependence as well as withdrawal on the cortical neurons of the frontal lobe. this study included eighty adult male albino rats which were divided into three groups. group i (control) included 40 rats and was further subdivided into two equal subgroups (ia and ib) as negative and positive controls. group ii (pgb-dependent) included 20 rats which received pgb starting with the therapeutic dose (300 mg/day), then the doses were gradually increased until they reached the dependent dose (3400 mg/day) by the end of the first month. further, the dependent dose was given daily for another 2 months. group iii (pgb withdrawal) included 20 rats which received pgb as described in group ii. after that, administration of pgb was stopped and the rats were kept for another one month. by the end of the experiment, all animals were sacrificed by cervical decapitation. the specimens were taken from the frontal cortex for histologic and immunohistochemical staining as well as morphometric analysis. sections of the frontal cortex of group ii showed changes in the form of disturbed architectural pattern of cortical layers, apoptotic cells, weak immunoexpression of bcl-2 and vegf as well as moderate-strong immunoexpression of inos and nestin. these expressions were significantly different from the control groups, but they were non-significant in comparison with group iii. these findings indicate that chronic pgb dependence induces neurotoxic effects mainly in the form of neuronal apoptosis, gliosis, and oxidative stress injury of the frontal cortex. the pgb- induced neurotoxic effects persisted after withdrawal. the influence of these neurotoxic effects and their relevance to the cognitive or neurologic disorders in pgb-dependent individuals warrants further research. furthermore, it is recommended to quantify the behavioral changes related to pgb dependence as well as withdrawal in future studies.",1
"purpose: emerging treatment options for the management of chronic hyperkalemia in the outpatient setting are reviewed. summary: current treatment options for the management of hyperkalemia are limited and often accompanied by serious adverse effects. two investigational drugs for the treatment of hyperkalemia are being evaluated in phase iii trials: sodium zirconium cyclosilicate and patiromer. both of these drugs are administered orally and act by enhancing potassium's removal, predominantly through the gastrointestinal tract. the safety and efficacy of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate and patiromer were evaluated in phase ii and iii trials. both agents were studied in patients with chronic mild-to-severe hyperkalemia, chronic kidney disease (ckd), or heart failure as well as those taking a renin-angiotensin system (ras) inhibitor, an aldosterone antagonist, or both therapies. these clinical trials found that sodium zirconium cyclosilicate and patiromer normalized serum potassium levels quickly and maintained normalized serum potassium levels over several weeks. both medications caused a rapid decrease in serum potassium, with two studies examining efficacy endpoints for 12 weeks or longer. the overall frequency of adverse effects in these clinical trials was low, with gastrointestinal adverse events being the most commonly observed. conclusion: options for the management of hyperkalemia, particularly chronic hyperkalemia in the outpatient setting, are limited. both sodium zirconium cyclosilicate and patiromer are emerging therapies that may provide long-term management of hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with underlying heart failure or ckd as well as those taking an ras inhibitor, an aldosterone antagonist, or both.",1
"we studied 44 patients with generalized anxiety disorder based on the third edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders. patients were taking a benzodiazepine before the study and were stabilized on 3 to 5 mg/day lorazepam for 5 weeks (weeks 0-5), both anxiety-reducing drugs. we randomly assigned patients to take 15 mg/day buspirone - a possible anxiety-reducing drug - or sugar pills for the next 6 weeks (weeks 6-11). during weeks 6 to 7, patients gradually stopped taking lorazepam. during weeks 12 to 13, all patients took sugar pills. at the beginning of the study and weeks 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 13, we measured severity of anxiety symptoms using common questionnaires. at the same times, we measured side effects using another questionnaire. at the beginning of the study and weeks 5, 6, 7, 11, and 13, we measured withdrawal symptoms using a common checklist. the results favored buspirone over sugar pills and were similar to lorazepam. patients taking buspirone showed no signs of anxiety symptoms returning or withdrawal symptoms compared to sugar pills. buspirone, similar to sugar pills, caused fewer side effects than lorazepam. finally the anti-anxiety effects of buspirone lasted at least 2 weeks after patients stopped taking the studied drugs.",0
"laryngopharyngeal reflux (lpr) is a complex of symptoms caused by the backflow of gastric contents into the larynx, pharynx, nasopharynx, sinuses and even to the middle ear space. the symptomatology of lpr includes: chronic cough, hoarseness, throat clearing, laryngitis,""globus pharyngeus"", swallowing disturbances, postnasal drip, ""fetor ex ore"". in the article, the authors present two boys with chronic cough, in one of them the asthma was suspected and antiasthmatic treatment was administrated; in our patients according to the 24-hour pharyngeal ph-metry lpr was diagnosed. the aim of this study was to emphasise that pediatricians should be able to recognise symptoms of lpr. the appropriate diagnosis and treatment leads the symptoms to subside.",1
"fever after cardiac surgery in children may be due to bacterial infection or noninfectious origin like systemic inflammatory response syndrome (sirs) secondary to bypass procedure. a marker to distinguish bacterial from nonbacterial fever in these conditions is clinically important. the purpose of our study was to evaluate, in the early postcardiac surgery period, whether serial measurement of c-reactive protein (crp) and its change over time (crp velocity) can assist in detecting bacterial infection. a series of consecutive children who underwent cardiac surgery with bypass were tested for serum levels of crp at several points up to 5 days postoperatively and during febrile episodes (>38.0°c). findings were compared among febrile patients with proven bacterial infection (fwi group; sepsis, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, deep wound infection), febrile patients without bacterial infection (fni group), and patients without fever (nf group). in all, 121 children were enrolled in the study, 31 in the fwi group, 42 in the fni group, and 48 patients in the nf group. ages ranged from 4 days to 17.8 years (median 19.0, mean 46 ± 56 months). there was no significant difference among the groups in mean crp level before surgery, 1 hour, and 18 hours after. a highly significant interaction was found in the change in crp over time by fwi group compared with fni group (p < .001). mean crp velocity ([fcrp - 18hcrp]/[fever time (days) - 0.75 day]) was significantly higher in the infectious group (4.0 ± 4.2 mg/dl per d) than in the fever-only group (0.60 ± 1.6 mg/dl per d; p < .001). a crp velocity of 4 mg/dl per d had a positive predictive value (ppv) of 85.7% for bacterial infection with 95.2% specificity. serial measurements of crp/crp velocity after cardiac surgery in children may assist clinicians in differentiating postoperative fever due to bacterial infection from fever due to noninfectious origin.",1
"this study reports on how often and how severe symptoms of the throat and voice box occur in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) compared to those without copd (controls). a total of 27 patients with copd and 13 controls were included, comparing their age and gender. facts about the patients and controls include age, gender, history of smoking, and history of allergic rhinitis (irritation of the nose due to allergies). the severity of reflux symptoms was given a score (reflux symptom index). the reflux symptom index and how often each of the throat and voice box (laryngopharyngeal) symptoms occurred was scored. the average age of patients was 61 years. ninety-two percent of the patients were smokers . about 11% had allergic rhinitis. the average of total reflux symptom index in patients was significantly higher compared to controls. in the copd group, 18 patients had a positive reflux symptom index compared to one in the control group. there was also a significant difference between the average of 6 laryngopharyngeal symptoms in patients compared to controls. copd patients had higher amounts of hoarseness, throat-clearing, excesss throat mucus, cough and sticking sensation in the throat. laryngopharygeal reflux (lpr) is a disorder caused by the backflow of stomach contents into the throat. it is more common in patients compared to controls. lpr occurs a lot more often and it is more severe in copd patients.",0
"measurement of cells that make insulin is an important indicator of diabetes development in people at risk for diabetes. although the disease most often happens before 17 years of age, normal values for insulin release were not available for this age group. we did an i.v. (injected) glucose tolerance test in 167 normal children, and in 98 islet cell antibody (ica; proteins made against insulin-producing cells)-negative (without ica) and 12 ica-positive (with ica) siblings of diabetic patients. the children ranged from 1-16 years of age. the first part of insulin release, measured as the total blood insulin levels at 1 and 3 minutes, increased with age and was significantly lower in ica-negative siblings than in normal children. we did not see a difference in the first part of insulin release before 8 years of age. none of the ica-negative siblings developed diabetes after an average of 4.5 years. the first part of insulin response was similar in ica-positive and ica-negative siblings, but significantly lower than in normal children. we do not know the reason icf-negative siblings had lower insulin release, but it could have to do with insulin-producing cells growing incorrectly or insulin release that could be part of the complicated development of type 1 diabetes.",0
"background: rheumatoid arthritis (ra) is characterized by pain, functional disability, poor quality of life (qol), high socioeconomic impact, and annual costs of over $56 billion in the united states. acupuncture (ac) is widely in use; however, studies show severe methodological shortcomings, did not consider the functional diagnosis for the allocation of acupoints and their results showed no differences between verum and control groups. objective: the authors aimed to objectively assess the safety and efficacy of ac treatments for ra. methods: 105 ra patients with a functional diagnosis of a ""pivot syndrome"" or ""turning point syndrome"" were randomly assigned to (1) verum-ac (verum acupoints), (2) control-ac (sham acupoints-points outside of the conduits/meridians and of the extra-conduits), or (3) waiting list (each group n = 35). ac groups experienced the exact same number, depth, and stimulation of needles. assessments took place before and 5 min after ac with follow-ups over 4 weeks. results: (1) verum-ac significantly improved self-reported pain (z = -5.099, p < 0.001) and pressure algometry (z = -5.086, p < 0.001); hand grip strength (z = -5.086, p < 0.001) and arm strength (z = -5.086, p < 0.001); health status improved significantly (p < 0.001, z = -4.895); qol improved significantly in 7/8 survey domains; and number of swollen joints (z = -2.862, p = 0.004) and tender joints (z = -3.986, p < 0.001) significantly decreased. (2) control-ac showed no significant changes, except in self-reported pain improvement. (3) waiting list group showed an overall worsening. conclusion: this is the first double-blind controlled study on ac in ra of the hand that objectively and specifically assesses positive effects supporting its integration in rheumatology. acupoint allocation according to chinese medicine functional diagnoses is extremely relevant to assess ac effectiveness in a patient group primarily defined by a ""western"" medicine diagnosis. based on clear allocation criteria for acupoints, the authors minimized the possible bias of unspecific and suggestive effects on the control group, showed the specific effects of the points chosen, improved efficacy, and identified an evidence base for ac.",1
"sickle cell disease (scd) was the first human monogenic disorder to be characterized at the molecular level. it results from the substitution of glutamic acid by valine at position 6 of the β-chain of hemoglobin. the clinical manifestations of scd arise from the tendency of sickle hemoglobin (known as hbs or α2βs2) to polymerize at reduced oxygen tensions and deform red cells into the characteristic rigid sickle cell shape. such inflexible red cells cannot pass through the microcirculation efficiently, and this results in anemia (due to destruction of the red cells) and intermittent vasoocclusion causing tissue damage and pain. although all patients with homozygous scd have exactly the same molecular defect, there is considerable clinical variation, ranging from death in early childhood to a normal life span with few complications. genetic modifiers of scd include α-thalassemia, and it has been known for many years that patients with increased levels of fetal hb (hbf or α2γ2) often tend to have a relatively mild clinical course because hbf reduces the tendency of hbs to polymerise within the red cell. increased hbf may result from rare deletions within the β-globin gene cluster or from point mutations in the promoters of the fetal γ-globin genes (hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin, hpfh), but additional loci are known to increase hbf levels in adult life. identifying such loci has been a painstaking task, but a combination of genome-wide analysis within a large kindred and within twin pairs has identified two quantitative trait loci (qtl) with major influences on fetal hemoglobin levels in adults. a significant proportion of the variation in hbf levels and the frequency of painful crises in patients with scd is accounted for by five common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) at these loci.",1
"this article reviews clinical pharmacokinetic data on the h1-receptor antagonists, commonly referred to as the antihistamines. despite their widespread use over an extended period, relatively little pharmacokinetic data are available for many of these drugs. a number of h1-receptor antagonists have been assayed mainly using radioimmunoassay methods. these have also generally measured metabolites to greater or lesser extents. thus, the interpretation of such data is complex. after oral administration of h1-receptor antagonists as syrup or tablet formulations, peak plasma concentrations are usually observed after 2 to 3 hours. bioavailability has not been extensively studied, but is about 0.34 for chlorpheniramine, 0.40 to 0.60 for diphenhydramine, and about 0.25 for promethazine. most of these drugs are metabolised in the liver, this being very extensive in some instances (e.g. cyproheptadine and terfenadine). total body clearance in adults is generally in the range of 5 to 12 ml/min/kg (for astemizole, brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, promethazine and triprolidine), while their elimination half-lives range from about 3 hours to about 18 days [cinnarizine about 3 hours; diphenhydramine about 4 hours; promethazine 10 to 14 hours; chlorpheniramine 14 to 25 hours; hydroxyzine about 20 hours; brompheniramine about 25 hours; astemizole and its active metabolites about 7 to 20 days (after long term administration); flunarizine about 18 to 20 days]. they also have relatively large apparent volumes of distribution in excess of 4 l/kg. in children, the elimination half-lives of chlorpheniramine and hydroxyzine are shorter than in adults. in patients with alcohol-related liver disease, the elimination half-life of diphenhydramine was increased from 9 to 15 hours, while in patients with chronic renal disease that of chlorpheniramine was very greatly prolonged. little, if any, published information is available on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs in neonates, pregnancy or during lactation. the relatively long half-lives of a number of the older h1-receptor antagonists such as brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine and hydroxyzine suggest that they can be administered to adults once daily.",1
"bedsores are a worldwide problem that is hard to heal because it causes long-lasting inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) and harms the extracellular matrix (ecm; secreted by cells and surrounds cells in tissues) from not enough oxygen and blood flow. the study we did before found that non-fouling zwitterionic (inner salts to which proteins and bacteria cannot stick) sulfated poly (sulfobetaine methacrylate) (sbma) hydrogel can improve bedsore healing and quickly rebuild ecm. however, scientists are unsure how sbma hydrogel rebuilds ecm. in this study, we look at how sbma hydrogel rebuilds ecm using a rat bedsore model. smba hydrogel helps remodel ecm better than peg hydrogel, another bedsore treatment. the relationship between autophagy (cleaning out of damaged cells) with ecm remodeling may influence the design of wound dressings with substances that interact with biological systems for long-term wound repair.",0
"cystic echinococcosis or hyadtid disease is caused by infection from baby echinococcus granulosus, long tapeworms, and leads to cysts or swellings. this disease often shows no symptoms for years before the swelling grows large enough to cause symptoms in affected organs. most common organs affected are the liver and lungs although the heart, brain, bone, spinal cord, and kidney may also be involved. this case is a young woman with pain on the left side of the waist and infection in the urine-collecting tube due to a left kidney cyst from hyadtid disease. the cyst was around 7.8×6.6×8cm with many internal divisions at the lower part of the left kidney. cyst removal surgery by small incisions and a camera was performed with no issues post-operation. she was released with albendazole, anti-parasite medication, and other helpful medication. with proper use of multiple treatments, hyadtid disease is curable and the patient can live a healthy life with normal kidney function.",0
"pallister-hall syndrome (phs) was first described in 1980 in six newborns. it is caused by a single gene that is involved in development of multiple body parts. the problems include a non-cancer mass in the lower part of the brain and extra fingers and toes, among others. this disorder is passed down by either parent, and the involved gene is located on chromosome 7, associating phs with the gene called gli3. variants of the the gli3 gene in which some genetic information is missing or misplaced are associated with greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (gcps) that affects development of the hands, feet, head, and face. patients with both phs and gcps have extra or merged fingers and toes, and abnormal heads and faces. both phs and gcps are passed down from either parent, but the clinical signs of these diseases are different. the additional finger in gcps is usually located next to the thumb. in phs, the extra finger is in the center or next to the little finger (pinky). the extra toes follow the same pattern: in gcps the sixth toe is next to the big toe. no reported cases of gcps have non-cancer growth in the lower part of the brain, and phs does not cause increased distance between the eyes or broadening of the nose or forehead. because the generic changes for phs and gcps share the location on the chromosome, we study gli3 as a gene potentially responsible for phs. we describe two phs families with large changes in the gli3 gene. in one family the change is new and there is no family history of phs. the data show that changes in the gli3 gene, which are passed down in the family or happen for the first time, cause phs. large-scale changes in the gli3 gene can change the development of many tissues and organs.",0
"postnatal depression is a major public health problem affecting about one in seven women after childbirth. depression is also common during pregnancy and throughout the perinatal period it is associated with symptoms of anxiety. apart from the adverse consequences for women themselves becoming depressed when they are going through demanding physical and social changes, there are additional concerns. there is the possible negative impact of maternal depression on the relationship between mother and child and on the child's emotional, behavioural and cognitive development. primary prevention and early intervention/secondary prevention strategies are potentially important in view of the frequent contact pregnant women, new mothers and infants have with health services, but the effectiveness of these strategies needs to be tested. in the past year there have been five new studies of antenatal screening for postnatal depression. these studies are consistent with nine earlier studies in showing that there is no evidence to support routine antenatal screening for postnatal depression. seven new primary prevention/early intervention trials add evidence on a wide range of interventions ranging from practical support to individual interpersonal therapy, but without identifying significant differences in depression as an outcome. two new trials of secondary prevention, one involving interpersonal therapy and the other including partners in a series of psychoeducational visits, show promise but neither is large enough to form a basis for practice change. novel interventions, or promising findings, with a strong basis in theory need to be tested in trials which are appropriately sized and which comply with internationally accepted design and reporting guidelines.",1
"the international expert committee recommends that the diagnosis of diabetes be made if hemo globin a1c (hba1c) level is greater, similar 6.5% and confirmed with a repeat hba1c test. the committee recommends against ""mixing different methods to diagnose diabetes"" because ""the tests are not completely concordant: using different tests could easily lead to confusion"". fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour postglucose-load plasma glucose, and oral glucose tolerance tests are recommended for the diagnosis of diabetes only if hba1c testing is not possible due to unavailability of the assay, patient factors that preclude its inter pretation, and during pregnancy. hba1c testing has the advantages of greater clinical convenience, preanalytic stability, and assay standardization, but when used as the sole diagnostic criterion for diabetes, it has the potential for systematic error. factors that may not be clinically evident impact hba1c test results and may systematically raise or lower the value relative to the true level of glycemia. for this reason, hba1c should be used in combination with plasma glucose determinations for the diagnosis of diabetes. if an hba1c test result is discordant with the clinical picture or equivocal, plasma glucose testing should be performed. a diagnostic cut-off point of hba1c greater, similar 6.5% misses a substantial number of people with type 2 diabetes, including some with fasting hyperglycemia, and misses most people with impaired glucose tolerance. combining the use of hba1c and plasma glucose measurements for the diagnosis of diabetes offers the benefits of each test and reduces the risk of systematic bias inherent in hba1c testing alone.",1
"a 74-year-old man showed nerve damage due to diabetes (a disease involving high blood sugar). the patient had ingested 450 mg of pregabalin (pbg - a nerve pain medication) over a period of 8 hours which was followed by altered mental status. a bedside test for brain activity was performed to rule out nonconvulsive status epilepticus, or a prolonged seizure. the test showed continuous triphasic waves (tws), which is abnormal body activity, with slow background activity. the patient recovered after 48 hours of stopping pbg. a repeated brain acitivty test after 72 hours did not show any tws. this study presents a rare case of pbg-induced tws. this paper highlighting the extent of the etiologic spectrum of tws, or how tws promote disease. additionally, the paper discusses the literature related to this association (or link).",0
"achondroplasia, the most common form of human dwarfism is a sporadic autosomal dominant condition that occurs in approximately 1:20,000 births. the major health impact of achondroplasia is reduced growth, shortening of the long bones and abnormalitiesin the bones of the head and face. as of today there is no drug treatment for achondroplasia. some improvement in the patients well being and daily function can be achieved by a surgical limb lengthening procedure. growth hormone treatment seems to have only modest short term success and to lack long term benefits. achondroplasia results from a mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3). in 97% of the patients, the mutation leads to overactivation of the protein coded for by the fgfr3 gene. this protein is found in cells in the growth area of developing long bones and plays a crucial role in bone growth. disruption of the fgfr-3 gene in mice leads to a remarkable increase in the length of the vertebral column and long bones. this suggests that overaction of fgfr3 impairs cell function in the growth regions of the bone and causes achondroplasia. normal bone growth may therefore be achieved by reducing fgfr3 activity in the appropriate cells within the growth region of the bones. it is highly conceivable that drug development strategies aimed either towards blocking overaction of the fgfr3 and related activities may prove successful in the treatment of achondroplasia. this review focuses on the possible approaches for developing a drug for achondroplasia and related bone diseases.",0
"the world health organization called the new coronavirus (which causes covid-19 - a viral lung infection) a pandemic in early 2020 after the disease spread to over 180 countries. this paper aims to summarize the evidence for the relationships between nutrition and boosting the immune system in the fight against covid-19 caused by the coronavirus. this review discusses the impact of vitamin and mineral supplements (an additional amount of vitamins or minerals often in the form of a pill) on the body's defense system against coronavirus. the results show that there is a strong connection between taking ingredients like vitamin c-e and minerals such as zinc, and a reduction in the effects of coronavirus infection. these can be received from either foods that have a lot of healthy nutrients or from vitamin supplements. also, these tiny molecules might have roles to play in boosting the immune response as well as the healing process and recovery time. researchers of this study recommend that eating healthy foods with a lot of vitamins c-e with zinc and other vitamins from plants called flavonoids found in many fruits and vegetables could boost the immune system and help protect the body from serious infections.",0
"phenylketonuria (pku) is considered to be a paradigm for a monogenic metabolic disorder but was never thought to be a primary application for human gene therapy due to established alternative treatment. however, somewhat unanticipated improvement in neuropsychiatric outcome upon long-term treatment of adults with pku with enzyme substitution therapy might slowly change this assumption. in parallel, pku was for a long time considered to be an excellent test system for experimental gene therapy of a mendelian autosomal recessive defect of the liver due to an outstanding mouse model and the easy to analyze and well-defined therapeutic end point, that is, blood l-phenylalanine concentration. lifelong treatment by targeting the mouse liver (or skeletal muscle) was achieved using different approaches, including (1) recombinant adeno-associated viral (raav) or nonviral naked dna vector-based gene addition, (2) genome editing using base editors delivered by raav vectors, and (3) by delivering raavs for promoter-less insertion of the pah-cdna into the pah locus. in this article we summarize the gene therapeutic attempts of correcting a mouse model for pku and discuss the future implications for human gene therapy.",1
"objective: the objective of this health technology policy analysis was to determine, where, how, and when physiotherapy services are best delivered to optimize functional outcomes for patients after they undergo primary (first-time) total hip replacement or total knee replacement, and to determine the ontario-specific economic impact of the best delivery strategy. the objectives of the systematic review were as follows: to determine the effectiveness of inpatient physiotherapy after discharge from an acute care hospital compared with outpatient physiotherapy delivered in either a clinic-based or home-based setting for primary total joint replacement patients. to determine the effectiveness of outpatient physiotherapy delivered by a physiotherapist in either a clinic-based or home-based setting in addition to a home exercise program compared with a home exercise program alone for primary total joint replacement patients. to determine the effectiveness of preoperative exercise for people who are scheduled to receive primary total knee or hip replacement surgery. conclusions: based on the evidence, the medical advisory secretariat reached the following conclusions with respect to physiotherapy rehabilitation and physical functioning 1 year after primary tkr or thr surgery: there is high-quality evidence from 1 large rct to support the use of home-based physiotherapy instead of inpatient physiotherapy after primary thr or tkr surgery. there is low-to-moderate quality evidence from 1 large rct to support the conclusion that receiving a monitoring phone call from a physiotherapist and practicing home exercises is comparable to receiving clinic-based physiotherapy and practicing home exercises for people who have had primary tkr surgery. however, results may not be generalizable to those who have had thr surgery. there is moderate evidence to suggest that an exercise program beginning 4 to 6 weeks before primary tkr surgery is not effective.",1
"pallister-hall syndrome was initially recognized under fairly unique circumstances involving exhumation of the very first case. the first two cases had dramatic and unusual features including a hypothalamic hamartoblastoma, imperforate anus, an unusual type of polydactyly with the extra digit being central, hypopituitarism with secondary hypoadrenalism, and lethality after birth (probably due to hypoadrenalism). within a short time frame, four additional cases were identified. as the full spectrum and variability of anomalies was recognized, it became clear that it was not such a rare disorder. shortly after familial cases were recognized, the responsible gene was identified at gli3. however, since other different conditions also involved gli3, elaborating the domains of the gene and the types of mutations needed to be defined in order to have a clear correlation of the genotype-phenotype relations.",1
"a drug interaction is when other things change the usual effects of a drug, most often other drugs. when two drugs are taken at the same time, or within a short time of each other, an interaction can happen that may change the size or length of the effect of one or both drugs. drugs may interact based on what the drugs do to each other (pharmaceutical), what the body does to the drugs (pharmacokinetic), and what the drugs do to the body (pharmacodynamic). pharmacodynamic interactions occur when the change in effect happens at the site the drug works at in the body. phamacodynamics is a wide field. pharmacodynamic interactions can cause drugs to work together or against each other and can happen at different levels of the body. drugs that affect the mind, emotions, and behavior measured through a well known tool for finding and characterizing drug effects on the central nervous system (quantitative pharmaco-eeg) can be used based on the aim of the study: safety (ketoprofen/theophylline, lorazepam/diphenhydramine, granisetron/haloperidol), drug properties (benzodiazepine receptors), or brain function (diazepam/buspirone). we focus on methods, especially drug blood levels, response as a function of dosage, and varying activity of the drug over time (fluoxetine/buspirone) and talk about unsolved questions.",0
"dysphagia is common but may be underreported. specific symptoms, rather than their perceived location, should guide the initial evaluation and imaging. obstructive symptoms that seem to originate in the throat or neck may actually be caused by distal esophageal lesions. oropharyngeal dysphagia manifests as difficulty initiating swallowing, coughing, choking, or aspiration, and it is most commonly caused by chronic neurologic conditions such as stroke, parkinson disease, or dementia. symptoms should be thoroughly evaluated because of the risk of aspiration. patients with esophageal dysphagia may report a sensation of food getting stuck after swallowing. this condition is most commonly caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease and functional esophageal disorders. eosinophilic esophagitis is triggered by food allergens and is increasingly prevalent; esophageal biopsies should be performed to make the diagnosis. esophageal motility disorders such as achalasia are relatively rare and may be overdiagnosed. opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction is becoming more common. esophagogastroduodenoscopy is recommended for the initial evaluation of esophageal dysphagia, with barium esophagography as an adjunct. esophageal cancer and other serious conditions have a low prevalence, and testing in low-risk patients may be deferred while a four-week trial of acid-suppressing therapy is undertaken. many frail older adults with progressive neurologic disease have significant but unrecognized dysphagia, which significantly increases their risk of aspiration pneumonia and malnourishment. in these patients, the diagnosis of dysphagia should prompt a discussion about goals of care before potentially harmful interventions are considered. speech-language pathologists and other specialists, in collaboration with family physicians, can provide structured assessments and make appropriate recommendations for safe swallowing, palliative care, or rehabilitation.",1
"at the start of the covid-19 pandemic, the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) designed, manufactured, and distributed the cdc 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) real-time rt-pcr diagnostic panel for sars-cov-2 detection. the diagnostic panel targeted three viral nucleocapsid gene loci (n1, n2, and n3 primers and probes) to maximize sensitivity and to provide redundancy for virus detection if mutations occurred. after the first distribution of the diagnostic panel, state public health laboratories reported fluorescent signal in the absence of viral template (false-positive reactivity) for the n3 component and to a lesser extent for n1. this report describes the findings of an internal investigation conducted by the cdc to identify the cause(s) of the n1 and n3 false-positive reactivity. for n1, results demonstrate that contamination with a synthetic template, that occurred while the ""bulk"" manufactured materials were located in a research lab for quality assessment, was the cause of false reactivity in the first lot. base pairing between the 3' end of the n3 probe and the 3' end of the n3 reverse primer led to amplification of duplex and larger molecules resulting in false reactivity in the n3 assay component. we conclude that flaws in both assay design and handling of the ""bulk"" material, caused the problems with the first lot of the 2019-ncov real-time rt-pcr diagnostic panel. in addition, within this study, we found that the age of the examined diagnostic panel reagents increases the frequency of false positive results for n3. we discuss these findings in the context of improvements to quality control, quality assurance, and assay validation practices that have since been improved at the cdc.",1
"this study is a literature review of chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs - long-lasting tiredness). this study provides a description of the background, cause, development, diagnosis, and management regarding cfs. cfs is a multifaceted illness that has many symptoms and a wide array of clinical presentations. as of recent, cfs has been merged with myalgic encephalomyelitis (me). me is a disease characterized with profound fatigue, abnormal sleep, and pain. much of the difficulty in its management has stemmed from a lack of a concrete understanding of its cause and development. there is a potential association between dysfunction of the autoimmune (immune cells attacking healthy cells), neuroendocrine (brain- and hormonal-related system), or autonomic nervous systems and cfs development. possible triggering events, such as infections followed by an immune dysregulation, have been proposed as potential causes. me/cfs was first described following epstein barr virus (ebv - herpes virus) infections. it was later determined that it was not always preceded by ebv infection. patient diagnosed with cfs have shown a noticeably earlier activation of anaerobic metabolism (no-oxygen energy production on the cellular level) as a source of energy. this suggests impaired oxygen consumption. the differential (different) diagnoses range from tick-borne illnesses to psychiatric disorders to metabolism-regulating thyroid gland dysfunction. the many overlapping symptoms of cfs with other illnesses makes diagnosis very hard. the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) considers it a diagnosing of exclusion, meaning other illnesses have to first be excluded before cfs diagnosis can be offered. the cdc states that self-reported fatigue for a minimum of six months and four additional symptoms are necessary for diagnosis. these symptoms include: memory problems, sore throat, post-exertion illness, tender cervical (neck) or axillary (armpit) lymph nodes, muscle pain, multi-joint pain, headaches, and troubled sleep. management of cfs is just as difficult. treatment ranges from conservative (e.g. antidepressants) to minimally invasive (surgical) management. minimally invasive management can involve transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (non-surgical electrical pain relief) of target points. this treatment was shown to improve fatigue and associated symptoms in a 2017 study. the understanding of cfs is continuously evolving as the medical community tries to learn more about it. further reliable studies will be conducted, providing a better grasp of what the syndrome encompasses. from this, researchers will be able to improve diagnosis and management of the disease.",0
"recent studies have shown that antihypertensive drugs (that treat high blood pressure), like diuretics, increase plasma or blood homocysteine (hcy) levels. hcy is am amino acid that creates other chemicals your body needs. however, the effect of other antihypertensive drugs on plasma hcy levels has not been tested extensively. the goal of this study was to investigate the effect of antihypertensive therapy (aht) on hcy levels in essential hypertensive subjects. essential hypertensive patients have high blood pressure that is not the result of a medical condition. a study of 273 patients with essential hypertension (eh) and 103 patients with normal blood pressure was begun. plasma hcy levels were measured before and after 6 weeks of aht. patients were genotyped to analyze a specific genetic variation or gene material. angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors are drugs that lower blood pressure by relaxing veins and arteries. beta-blockers are drugs that lower blood pressure by blocking the effects of adrenaline. ace inhibitors and beta-blockers significantly decrease plasms hcy levels in hypertensive patients. hydrochlorothiazides, or ""water pills"", significantly increase plasms hcy levels in hypertensive patients. there was no association between the identified genetic variation and changes in hcy levels in response to antihypertensive within eh patients. the observed decrease in hcy caused by ace inhibitors and beta-blockers may be due to the improvement of endothelial (tissue lining various organs and cavities in the body) and kidney function. therefore, this study suggests that ace inhibitors and beta-blockers may provide additional, beneficial or therapeutic effects to the eh patients by decreasing hcy levels.",0
"opioid addiction is commonplace in the united states. we created a standard for prescribing opioids to treat pain after hip and knee replacement. we also studied opioid usage alongside a system of measuring pain as reported by patients. we assumed that people would use opioids less than prescribed. we also assumed that reducing prescriptions of opioids would reduce the amount taken without increasing the amount of pain reported. this study followed patients over time, without intervening. it was done on all patients that had hip and knee replacement from april 7, 2018, to august 10, 2019. we determined the amount of opioids used and how pain interfered with patients’ lives 2 weeks after discharge using telephone and email surveys. standards for prescribing opioids were used during the study. outcomes were compared in patients before and after following these standards. a total of 715 patients were able to be in the study. of those, 201 patients completed surveys. before the standards were followed, the average opioid prescription was about 81 tablets for hip replacement and about 83 tablets for knee replacement. the average number of tablets used for both hip replacement and knee replacement was 35. after the standards were followed, the average number of tables taken dropped to about 19 for hip replacement and about 32 for knee replacement. after following a second standard for hip replacement, the average number of tablets taken was about 22. there was not a significant changed in pain reported by patients that had hip replacement. for knee replacement, there was an increase in patient-reported interference with recreational activities and tasks away from home, but otherwise there was no significant impact. we conclude that following our standards for prescribing opioids reduced the amount of opioids both prescribed and taken, without significantly impacting the reported pain interference. this supports the need to decrease opioid prescription after hip and knee replacement surgery.",0
"maternal obesity is associated with adverse offspring outcomes. inflammation and deficiency of anti-inflammatory nutrients like omega(n)-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa) may contribute to these associations. fetal supply of n-3 pufa is dependent on maternal levels and studies have suggested that improved offspring outcomes are associated with higher maternal intake. however, little is known about how maternal obesity affects the response to n-3 supplementation during pregnancy. we sought to determine (1) the associations of obesity with pufa concentrations and (2) if the systemic response to n-3 supplementation differs by body mass index (bmi). this was a secondary analysis of 556 participants (46% lean, 28% obese) in the maternal-fetal medicine units network trial of n-3 (docosahexaenoic acid (dha) + eicosapentaenoic acid (epa)) supplementation, in which participants had 2g/day of n-3 (n = 278) or placebo (n = 278) from 19 to 22 weeks until delivery. at baseline, obese women had higher plasma n-6 arachidonic acid concentrations (β: 0.96% total fatty acids; 95% confidence interval (ci): 0.13, 1.79) and n-6/n-3 ratio (β: 0.26 unit; 95% ci: 0.05, 0.48) compared to lean women. in the adjusted analysis, women in all bmi groups had higher n-3 concentrations following supplementation, although obese women had attenuated changes (β = -2.04%, ci: -3.19, -0.90, interaction p = 0.000) compared to lean women, resulting in a 50% difference in the effect size. similarly, obese women also had an attenuated reduction (β = 0.94 units, ci: 0.40, 1.47, interaction p = 0.046) in the n-6/n-3 ratio (marker of inflammatory status), which was 65% lower compared to lean women. obesity is associated with higher inflammation and with an attenuated response to n-3 supplementation in pregnancy.",1
"long-lasting wounds that do not respond to available treatments have serious impacts. things that determine how bedsores progress include low antioxidant levels, other infections caused by microbes (microorganisms), and the type of immune system response. before symptoms, and in a detailed study, a mixture containing a ceratothoa oestroides (fish parasite) olive oil extract increased wound healing. patients with long-lasting leg ulcers (sores) due to blood flow problems and bedsores, determined by doctors as not responding to healing treatments, were treated for 3 months with an ointment with c oestroides extract combined with antibiotics (kill bacteria) and/or antiseptics (slow bacteria growth) based on type of bacterial infection. we evaluated treatment using a common tool used to track wound healing with two cell phone apps. after 3 months of treatment, c oestroides caused an average score decrease of 36% on a common tool used to track wound healing. applying both antibiotics and antiseptics controlled ulcer infection by microorganisms and helped wound healing. compared to things like initial wound size, how long lasting the wound was seemed to be an important factor in predicting how much the wound healed. future studies looking at how well c oestroides olive oil extract works to heal wounds are needed.",0
"internal hernias are rare, and a delayed diagnosis can lead to dangerous complications. a 75-year-old male with no previous surgical history presented with right upper abdominal pain and vomiting. on examination, he had guarding in the right hypochondrium with a positive murphy's sign. however, ultrasonography of the gall bladder was normal with dilated bowel loops. contrast-enhanced ct (cect) revealed a falciform hernia with evidence of obstruction. segmental resection of the gangrenous ileum was done with a double-barrel stoma. later on, stoma reversal was also done with no complications.",1
"background: phosphatidylserine (ps) may have beneficial effects on cognitive functions. we evaluated the efficacy of a novel preparation of ps containing omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids attached to its backbone (ps-dha) in non-demented elderly with memory complaints. methods: 157 participants were randomized to receive either ps-dha or placebo for 15 weeks. efficacy measures, assessed at baseline and endpoint, included the rey auditory verbal learning test, rey complex figure test, and a computerized cognitive battery. clinicians' global impression of change was assessed following 7 and 15 weeks of treatment. results: 131 participants completed the study although 9 were excluded from the efficacy analysis due to protocol violation. at endpoint, verbal immediate recall was significantly improved in the ps-dha group compared to the placebo group. post-hoc analysis revealed that a subset of participants with relatively good cognitive performance at baseline had significant treatment-associated improvements in immediate and delayed verbal recall, learning abilities, and time to copy complex figure. these favorable results were further supported by responder analysis. conclusions: the results indicate that ps-dha may improve cognitive performance in non-demented elderly with memory complaints. post-hoc analysis of subgroups suggests that participants with higher baseline cognitive status were most likely to respond to ps-dha. the results of this exploratory study should be followed up by additional studies aimed at confirming the present tentative conclusions.",1
"suggested food, vaccination, drugs, and supplementary for the immune system for covid-19. according to the world health organization, healthy foods and hydration are vital. individuals consuming a well-balanced diet are healthier with a strong immune system and have a reduced risk of chronic illness, infectious diseases. vitamins and minerals are vital. vitamin b, insoluble in water, protects from infection. vitamin c protects from flu-like symptoms. insufficient vitamin d and vitamin e can lead to coronavirus infection. vitamin d can be found in sunlight, and vitamin e can be found in, for example, oil, seeds, and fruits. insufficient iron and excess iron can lead to risk. zinc is necessary for maintaining the immune system. food rich in protein should be the top priority because it has immune properties (immunoglobulin production) and potential antiviral activity. therefore, in a regular meal, individuals should eat fruit, vegetables, legumes, nuts, whole grains, and foods from animal sources. food from plants containing vitamin a should be consumed, and 8–10 cups of water should be drunk daily. malnutrition is dangerous for patients with covid-19 and thus proper nutrition should be provided. fruit juice, tea, and coffee can also be consumed. too much caffeine, sweetened fruit juices, fruit juice concentrates, syrups, fizzy drinks, and still drinks must be avoided. unsaturated fats, white meats, and fish should be consumed. saturated fat, red meat, more than 5 g salt per day, and industry processed food should be avoided. along with diet, physical activity is another factor. individuals should be active and perform physical exercise regularly to boost the immune system and should have proper sleep.",1
"the objective of this study is to determine the effect of morning exercise after fasting (no food or drink except water for 8 to 10 hours) vs afternoon exercise on blood sugar responses to resistance exercise, also known as strength or weight training to build muscle. in this study, 12 participants with type 1 diabetes perform about 40 minutes of resistance exercise (three sets of eight repetitions, seven exercises) at either 7 am (fasting) or 5 pm. sessions are performed at least 48 hours apart. blood samples are collected immediately before exercise, immediately after exercise, and 60 minutes after exercise. interstitial sugar is taken from the fluid surrounding the cells of tissues rather the blood. interstitial sugar is monitored overnight after exercise by using continuous sugar monitoring device. blood sugar rises during fasting morning exercise, whereas it declined with afternoon exercise. sixty minutes after exercise, blood sugar is significantly higher after fasting morning exercise than after afternoon exercise. data from the continuous sugar monitoring device indicated more changes in sugar levels and more frequent hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) after morning resistance exercise than after afternoon resistance exercise. compared with afternoon resistance exercise, morning (fasting) resistance exercise is associated with distinctly different blood sugar responses and post-exercise responses.",0
"lower carb diets may improve blood sugar but may increase blood ketone bodies (particles made from fat breakdown) in women with gestational diabetes (gdm) (high blood sugar affecting pregnant women). we presume that fairly lower carbohydrate intake would not increase blood ketone bodies. to compare levels of blood ketone made from fat breakdown, risk of high blood ketone bodies, and pregnancy outcomes in women with gestational diabetes randomly given a lower carb diet or regular care. forty-six women around 33 years of age were randomly split at 28.5 weeks to either a modestly lower carb diet (mlc) or standard, routine care (rc) for 6 weeks. there was no difference in blood ketones between those in the mlc diet group relative to the rc group, even though carb and total energy intake was lower in the diet group. only 20% in the mlc diet group met the goal intake versus the 65% in the rc group. no differences in birth weight, rate of large-for-prenatal-age infants, percent fat mass, or fat-free mass between groups existed. reducing carb intake in those with gestational diabetes did not raise ketones made from fat breakdown, possibly because the carb target was difficult to achieve in pregnancy. feeding studies providing food may have to assess the effects of low-carb diets.",0
"we aimed to rate how well pentoxifylline (ptx) applied to the skin worked to heal bedsores in critically ill patients. this was a medical study involving human participants in which neither side knew who was getting what treatment, and either ptx 5% or ointment with no medicine was applied to the skin twice a day for 14 days. we measured changes in bedsore category and size. we used a common scoring system to measure the severity of bedsores and bedsore stage at the beginning of the study and on study days 7 and 14. we measured bedsore length and width with a disposable ruler. we studied a total of 112 adult patients. median (average) bedsore size and score at the beginning of the study were 32cm2 and 1, respectively. the average differences of bedsore scores and sizes decreased significantly between measurement days (day seven versus day zero, day 14 versus day zero, and day 14 versus day seven) compared to the ointment with no medicine. we conclude that the seriousness and size of bedsores improved significantly in patients who received ptx 5% ointment applied to the skin twice a day for 14 days compared to those who received ointment with no medicine. ptx applied to the skin may be a potential treatment option for stage i or ii bedsores in critically ill patients.",0
"successfully treating an overactive thyroid depends on identifying the signs and symptoms of the disease and determining the cause. graves' disease, a disease in which infection-preventing cells attack healthy cells, is the most common cause of an overactive thyroid. other common causes of an overactive thyroid include thyroid inflammation, one or more glandular growths making extra thyroid hormone, and side effects of some medications. a common test that measures blood levels of hormones that acts as messengers to the thyroid is the first step in a medical exam. when results of this test are uncertain, a test to measure thyroid function can be used. when the cause is inflammation of the thyroid, treating the symptoms is enough because the overactive thyroid is short-lived. graves' disease and when one or more growths make extra thyroid hormone can be treated with radiation therapy, drugs that block the formation of thyroid hormone, or surgery. in the united states, radiation therapy to shrink the thyroid is preferred unless there is a reason not to do so. thyroid removal is an option when other treatments do not work or should not be used, or when an enlarged thyroid is causing pressure or squeezing. new treatments are being studied. people who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and people with thyroid eye disease or overactive thyroids caused by amiodarone, a heart medication, must be given special treatment consideration. we must factor in what patients want when deciding on treatment. maintaining a safe and effective dose is very important.",0
"newborn screening (nbs) of inborn errors of metabolism (iem) is a coordinated comprehensive system consisting of education, screening, follow-up of abnormal test results, confirmatory testing, diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation of periodic outcome and efficiency. the ultimate goal of nbs and follow-up programs is to reduce morbidity and mortality from the disorders. over the past decade, tandem mass spectrometry (ms/ms) has become a key technology in the field of nbs. it has replaced classic screening techniques of one-analysis, one-metabolite, one-disease with one analysis, many-metabolites, and many-diseases. the development of electrospray ionization (esi), automation of sample handling and data manipulation have allowed the introduction of expanded nbs for the identification of numerous conditions on a single sample and new conditions to be added to the list of disorders being screened for using ms/ms. in the case of a screened positive result, a follow-up analytical test should be performed for confirmation of the primary result. the most common confirmatory follow-up tests are amino acids and acylcarnitine analysis in plasma and organic acid analysis in urine. nbs should be integrated with follow-up and clinical management. recent improvements in therapy have caused some disorders to be considered as potential candidates for nbs. this review covers some of the basic theory of expanded ms/ms and follow-up confirmatory tests applied for nbs of iem.",1
"in spain, 1.5 million essential workers under 60 years of age got a first astrazeneca vaccine dose. although this vaccine was associated with blood clots and reduction in blood cells, the european medicines agency recommended two doses of astrazeneca for all ages. spain decided not to give the second dose of this vaccine to people under 60 years old. the government sponsored a clinical trial to evaluate if a dose of pfizer vaccine works in adults who first got the astrazeneca vaccine. the positive results supported giving the pfizer vaccine as the booster. some local authorities decided to follow the recommendation that an astrazeneca booster should be given. because of these contradictions, the spanish health ministry requested those who decide to get the astrazeneca booster and decline pfizer should sign an informed consent form. later these essential workers could choose the vaccine but still sign an informed consent form. relevant information was posted on the web and given to people at vaccination sites. three quarters of people getting the vaccine chose astrazeneca; maybe because they trusted the european medicines agency more. giving people a choice may make future covid-19 boosters more successful.",0
"hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening metabolic problem caused by inability of the kidneys to excrete potassium, impairment of the mechanisms that move potassium from the circulation into the cells, or a combination of these factors. acute episodes of hyperkalemia commonly are triggered by the introduction of a medication affecting potassium homeostasis; illness or dehydration also can be triggers. in patients with diabetic nephropathy, hyperkalemia may be caused by the syndrome of hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism. the presence of typical electrocardiographic changes or a rapid rise in serum potassium indicates that hyperkalemia is potentially life threatening. urine potassium, creatinine, and osmolarity should be obtained as a first step in determining the cause of hyperkalemia, which directs long-term treatment. intravenous calcium is effective in reversing electrocardiographic changes and reducing the risk of arrhythmias but does not lower serum potassium. serum potassium levels can be lowered acutely by using intravenous insulin and glucose, nebulized beta2 agonists, or both. sodium polystyrene therapy, sometimes with intravenous furosemide and saline, is then initiated to lower total body potassium levels.",1
"in the 1990s, selenium was identified as a component of an enzyme that activates thyroid hormone; since this discovery, the relevance of selenium to thyroid health has been widely studied. selenium, known primarily for the antioxidant properties of selenoenzymes, is obtained mainly from meat, seafood and grains. intake levels vary across the world owing largely to differences in soil content and factors affecting its bioavailability to plants. adverse health effects have been observed at both extremes of intake, with a narrow optimum range. epidemiological studies have linked an increased risk of autoimmune thyroiditis, graves disease and goitre to low selenium status. trials of selenium supplementation in patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis have generally resulted in reduced thyroid autoantibody titre without apparent improvements in the clinical course of the disease. in graves disease, selenium supplementation might lead to faster remission of hyperthyroidism and improved quality of life and eye involvement in patients with mild thyroid eye disease. despite recommendations only extending to patients with graves ophthalmopathy, selenium supplementation is widely used by clinicians for other thyroid phenotypes. ongoing and future trials might help identify individuals who can benefit from selenium supplementation, based, for instance, on individual selenium status or genetic profile.",1
"we checked the interaction of blood folate, a b-vitamin, and vitamin b12 with methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) c6677t genotypes, or specific dna sequences in humans encoding the same protein. this was done to measure the risk of first ischemic stroke, or blood clotting that would block brain blood flow, and success of folic acid treatment to prevent this stroke. 20,702 adults with high blood pressure randomly received either 10 mg of daily blood pressure medication and 0.8 mg of folic acid or 10 mg of blood pressure alone. participants were checked every 3 months. average folate and b12 levels at start were 8.1 ng/ml and 280.2 pmol/l, respectively. over around 4.5 years, among those not receiving folid acid, participants with starting blood b12 or blood folate above the average had much lower risk of first ischemic stroke, especially those with the standard mthfr c6677t genotype. folic acid treatment reduced the risk of first ischemic stroke in participants with both folate and b12 below the average, especially in those with the altered mthfr genotype. however, those with certain mthfr genotypes responded with both folate and b12 levels above the average. the risk of first ischemic stroke was higher in patients with high blood pressure and low levels of folate and b12. folic acid treatment had the most effect in patients with low folate and b12 with a certain mthfr genotype, and with high folate and b12 with another genotype.",0
"multiple sclerosis (ms) is a complex disease of the central nervous system (cns). ms involves an intricate and abnormal interaction of immune cells that leads to inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection), demyelination (destruction of nerve tissue), and neurodegeneration. neurodegeneration is the loss of structure and/or function of neurons, cells in the brain. due to the diversity of the types of ms, their diagnosis becomes challenging, and the best treatment cannot be easily provided to patients. biomarkers, or measurable biological substances that can indicate disease, have been used to simplify the diagnosis and treatment of ms. biomarkers have also been used to evaluate the results of clinical treatments. in recent years, biomarker research has advanced rapidly due to their ability to be easily and promptly measured, their specificity, and their reproducibility. biomarkers are classified into several categories. these categories depend on whether the biomarkers address personal or predictive susceptibility (or risk), diagnosis, disease forecast (or progression), disease activity, or response to treatment in different clinical courses of ms. the identified members indicate a variety of causative pathways of ms. these pathways include neuroaxonal damage (nerve degeneration), gliosis (scarring in the cns), demyelination (nerve tissue destruction), progression of disability, and many others. the present review analyzes biomarkers in cerebrospinal (brain) fluid (csf) and blood serum. these are the most promising imaging biomarkers used in clinical practice. furthermore, this paper aims to shed light on the criteria and challenges that a biomarker faces to be routinely used daily clinical practice.",0
"fetal hemoglobin (hbf) ameliorates clinical severity of sickle cell anemia (sca). the major loci regulating hbf levels are hbb cluster, bcl11a, and hmip-2 (hbs1l-myb). however, the impact of noncoding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in these loci on clinical outcomes and their functional role on regulating hbf levels should be better elucidated. therefore, we performed comprehensive association analyses of 14 noncoding snps in five loci with hbf levels and with clinical outcomes in a cohort of 250 children with sca from southeastern brazil, and further performed functional annotation of these snps. we found snps independently associated with hbf levels: rs4671393 in bcl11a (β-coefficient = 0.28), rs9399137 in hmip-2a (β-coefficient = 0.16), and rs4895441 in hmip-2b (β-coefficient = 0.15). patients carrying minor (hbf-boosting) alleles for rs1427407, rs93979137, rs4895441, rs9402686, and rs9494145 showed reduced count of reticulocytes (p < 0.01), while those carrying the t allele of rs9494145 showed lower white blood cell count (p = 0.002). carriers of the minor allele for rs9402686 showed higher peripheral saturation of oxygen (p = 0.002). patients carrying minor alleles in bcl11a showed lower risk of transfusion incidence rate ratio (irr ≥ 1.3; p < 0.0001). this effect was independent of hbf effect (p = 0.005). carriers of minor alleles for rs9399137 and rs9402686 showed lower risk of acute chest syndrome (irr > 1.3; p ≤ 0.01). carriers of the reference allele for rs4671393 showed lower risk of infections (irr = 1.16; p = 0.01). in conclusion, patients carrying hbf-boosting alleles of bcl11a and hmip-2 were associated with milder clinical phenotypes. higher hbf concentration may underlie this effect.",1
"researchers studied whether the signs and symptoms associated with chronic cough were helpful in finding out the disease that caused it. patients with chronic cough were studied by a specific set of rules in order to make a diagnosis. the signs and symptoms of chronic cough caused by a single disease were compared. these patients were divided into 4 groups: cough-variant asthma (cva), upper airway cough syndrome (uacs), post-nasal drip syndrome (pnds), eosinophilic bronchitis (eb), and gastroesophageal reflux related cough (gerc). a total 196 patients met the rules: 55 had eb, 45 had uacs, 50 had cva, and 46 had gerc. no important difference was found in age, gender, and course of disease among eb, uacs, cva, and gerc. nighttime cough (nocturnal cough) occurred much more often in cva than in eb, uacs, and gerc. nocturnal cough was very highly associated with cva. cough associated with meals and backflow of stomach contents was more highly associated with gerc than the other groups. uacs was more associated with postnasal drip, symptoms of nose inflammation , and history of nose diseases. the signs and symptoms of chronic cough are useful in the diagnosis of a single underlying cause.",0
"current monitoring technologies are unable to detect early, compensatory changes that are associated with significant blood loss. we previously introduced a novel algorithm to calculate the compensatory reserve index (cri) based on the analysis of arterial waveform features obtained from photoplethysmogram recordings. in the present study, we hypothesized that the cri would provide greater sensitivity and specificity to detect blood loss compared with traditional vital signs and other hemodynamic measures. continuous noninvasive vital sign waveform data, including cri, photoplethysmogram, heart rate, blood pressures, spo2, cardiac output, and stroke volume, were analyzed from 20 subjects before, during, and after an average controlled voluntary hemorrhage of ∼1.2 l of blood. compensatory reserve index decreased by 33% in a linear fashion across progressive blood volume loss, with no clinically significant alterations in vital signs. the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve for the cri was 0.90, with a sensitivity of 0.80 and specificity of 0.76. in comparison, blood pressures, heart rate, spo2, cardiac output, and stroke volume had significantly lower receiver operating characteristic area under the curve values and specificities for detecting the same volume of blood loss. consistent with our hypothesis, cri detected blood loss and restoration with significantly greater specificity than did other traditional physiologic measures. single measurement of cri may enable more accurate triage, whereas cri monitoring may allow for earlier detection of casualty deterioration.",1
"objective: to compare the accuracy of procalcitonin and c-reactive protein as diagnostic markers of bacterial infection in critically ill children at the onset of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (sirs). design: prospective cohort study. setting: tertiary care, university-affiliated pediatric intensive care unit (picu). patients: consecutive patients with sirs. interventions: from june to december 2002, all picu patients were screened daily to include cases of sirs. at inclusion (onset of sirs), procalcitonin and c-reactive protein levels as well as an array of cultures were obtained. diagnosis of bacterial infection was made a posteriori by an adjudicating process (consensus of experts unaware of the results of procalcitonin and c-reactive protein). baseline and daily data on severity of illness, organ dysfunction, and outcome were collected. measurements and main results: sixty-four patients were included in the study and were a posteriori divided into the following groups: bacterial sirs (n = 25) and nonbacterial sirs (n = 39). procalcitonin levels were significantly higher in patients with bacterial infection compared with patients without bacterial infection (p = .01). the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for procalcitonin was greater than that for c-reactive protein (0.71 vs. 0.65, respectively). a positive procalcitonin level (>or=2.5 ng/ml), when added to bedside clinical judgment, increased the likelihood of bacterial infection from 39% to 92%, while a negative c-reactive protein level (<40 mg/l) decreased the probability of bacterial infection from 39% to 2%. conclusions: procalcitonin is better than c-reactive protein for differentiating bacterial from nonbacterial sirs in critically ill children, although the accuracy of both tests is moderate. diagnostic accuracy could be enhanced by combining these tests with bedside clinical judgment.",1
"the study's objective is to evaulate the success of topical pentoxifylline (ptx) (a blood flow medication) on pressure ulcer (pu), or bedsore, healing in very ill patients. in this study, patients with mild or moderate pus were randomly assigned to receive either skin-level ptx 5% or a sham treatment twice daily for 14 days. changes in pu (severity and size) were measured. the severity of pu was determined with a special scale at starting (day zero), day seven, and day 14 of the treatment. pu length and width was measured with a ruler in cm2. 112 adult patients enrolled in the study. average pu size and score at day 0 were 32 cm2 and 1 respectively. in the ptx group, the average differences of all pu scores and sizes decreased greatly across the intervals (day seven vs day zero, day 14 vs day zero, and day 14 vs day seven), compared with the sham treatment group. the severity and size of pus improved greatly in patients who received skin-level ptx 5% ointment twice a day for 14 days compared to those in the dummy treatment group. skin-level ptx may be a possible option to treat mild and moderate pus in very ill patients.",0
"for this study's background, breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women around the world and the leading cause of cancer-related death among women. the knowledge about changeable risk factors, such as diet, can be an acceptable, cheap and non-drug prevention tool. the aim of this study was to check the link between dietary fat, dietary fatty acids, fish intake, and breast cancer in women. a patient study was designed. a total of 201 newly diagnosed, polish female cancer patients (average age: 58 years) and 201 age-matched patients without cancer were included. a standard questionnaire measuring various socio-demographic, clinical, lifestyle, and dietary characteristics was applied via face-to-face interviews. detailed dietary intake information was measured using a verified diet questionnaire. results were obtained using statistical models controlling for non-dietary and dietary potential confounders. consumption of polyunsaturated fats (pufa) over 10% of total energy intake was linked with a significantly lower risk of breast cancer compared to low intake of pufa. low (<0.2) omega-3/ omega-6 ratio, fish consumption less than once every six months and being overweight were linked with increased risk of breast cancer. residents of rural areas had a much higher risk compared to women from urban areas. in conclusion, high intake of pufa can decrease the risk of breast cancer, while the low omega-3/omega-6 ratio increases the risk. in addition, being overweight, eliminating fish from the diet and living in rural areas can also increase the risk of breast cancer.",0
"some patients suffer complications from anti-viral immune responses, or the response their body creates when infected with a virus. these complications can lead to both a dangerous cytokine storm (proteins that control activity of immune and blood cells that flood the body) and development of blood-borne factors that increase the likelihood of blood clots or scabs. each person's unique immune response will likely determine and predict how a patient will react to infection. therefore, each person's immune system represents a target for intervention to prevent harmful side effects. in the early stages of infection, exhausted or overworked t cells (an immune system cell) can lead to disease progression. alteration of t cell functions often comes before a cytokine storm and neutrophil expansion, or the suppression of immune system. when these events occur in lung tissues, diseases are often even more damaging. t cell function, cytokine production, and events that attract neutrophils (cells that sweep humans for signs of infection) to the lung can be changed by specifically targeting molecules that trigger t cell responses. manipulating t cell responses could provide the means to control the immune response in patients with covid-19 (a viral, breathing-related disorder). during the initial anti-viral response, t cell function can be enhanced by delaying anti-viral exhaustion by suppressing certain biological pathways. additionally, immune dysregulation or errors can be addressed by enhancing immune suppressor functions by targeting molecules that control cell metabolism. targeting cell metabolism pathways may also prevent formation of blood clots. furthermore, the cell metabolism pathway is needed for covid-19 replication in host cells. suppressing the pathway could potentially decrease the amount of virus within the host. the overall goal is to identify biological targets than can control the immune response in covid-19 patients to improve patient well-being. targeting specific pathways in the body could achieve this goal during each stage of the disease.",0
"although bone mineral density (bmd) testing to measure how much calcium and other minerals are in bones to look for osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become weak and brittle) is suggested for women 65 years old or older, few studies look at how long to wait between tests. we studied 4957 women, 67 years old and older, with normal bmd or weaker than normal bones who had never broken a hip or spine or received treatment for osteoporosis, followed for up to 15 years. the time between bmd testing was the estimated time for 10% of women to develop osteoporosis before breaking a hip or spine, considering estrogen (female-specific hormone) use and risk factors. we used mathematical models to look at changes from normal bmd and from mild, moderate, and advanced osteopenia. we considered hip and spine breaks and people taking drugs to strengthen bones. we found the estimated time between bmd testing was 16.8 years for women with normal bmd and 17.3, 4.7. and 1.1 years for women with mild, moderate, and advanced osteopenia, respectively. our results suggest that less than 10% of older women who had gone through menopause (a point in time 12 months after the last period) would develop osteoporosis if tested about every 15 years for women with normal bmd or mild osteopenia, 5 years for women with moderate osteopenia, and 1 year for women with advanced osteopenia.",0
"the term ""shock"" refers to a life-threatening circulatory failure caused by an imbalance between the supply and demand of cellular oxygen. hypovolemic shock is characterized by a reduction of intravascular volume and a subsequent reduction in preload. the body compensates the loss of volume by increasing the stroke volume, heart frequency, oxygen extraction rate, and later by an increased concentration of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate with a rightward shift of the oxygen dissociation curve. hypovolemic hemorrhagic shock impairs the macrocirculation and microcirculation and therefore affects many organ systems (e.g. kidneys, endocrine system and endothelium). for further identification of a state of shock caused by bleeding, vital functions, coagulation tests and hematopoietic procedures are implemented. every hospital should be in possession of a specific protocol for massive transfusions. the differentiated systemic treatment of bleeding consists of maintenance of an adequate homeostasis and the administration of blood products and coagulation factors.",1
"a majority of adults with persistently low serum alkaline phosphatase values carry a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in the alpl gene and also have elevated alkaline phosphatase substrate values in serum and urine. these adults may fall within the spectrum of the adult form of hypophosphatasia. introduction: the primary objective of this study was to determine what proportion of adults with persistently low serum alkaline phosphatase values (hypophosphatasemia) harbor mutations in the alpl gene or have elevated alkaline phosphatase (alp) substrates. some adults with persistent hypophosphatasemia share clinical and radiographic features with the adult form of hypophosphatasia (hpp). in hpp, alpl mutations result in persistent hypophosphatasemia and alp substrate accumulation in plasma (pyridoxal-5-phosphate (plp)) and urine (phosphoethanolamine (pea)). methods: biochemical analyses, including serum alp activity, bone-specific alp, plasma plp, and urine pea, were performed in adults with persistent hypophosphatasemia. mutational analyses were performed using pcr and sanger sequencing methods. gene variants were classified as pathogenic (p), likely pathogenic (lp), variants of uncertain significance (vus), likely benign (lb), and benign (b). p and lp variants were further grouped as ""positive alpl variants"" and lb and b grouped as ""negative alpl variants."" results: fifty subjects completed all mutational and biochemical analyses. sixteen percent carried only negative alpl variants. of the remaining 42 subjects, 67% were heterozygous for a p variant, 19% for an lp variant, and 14% for a vus. biochemical results were highly inter-correlated and consistent with the expected inverse relationship between alp and its substrates. subjects harboring positive alpl variants showed lower alp and bsap and higher plp and pea values compared with subjects harboring only negative alpl variants. approximately half of all subjects harboring positive alpl variants or alpl vus showed elevations in plasma plp, and three quarters showed elevations in urine pea. conclusion: adults with persistent hypophosphatasemia frequently harbor alpl mutations and have elevated alp substrates. these adults may fall within the spectrum of the adult form of hypophosphatasia. clinicians should take note of persistent hypophosphatasemia in their patients and be cautious in prescribing bisphosphonates when present. clinicians should take note of persistent hypophosphatasemia in their patients and be cautious in prescribing bisphosphonates when present.",1
"vitamin d plays a key role in controlling blood pressure and fluid in the body and is used by sars-cov-2, the virus leading to the respiratory disease of covid-19, for entry into cells. vitamin d controls several processes of the immune system to minimize the virus. examples include preventing entry and replication of sars-cov-2 (the novel coronavirus that can lead to covid-19), reducing inflammation (the body's response to infection causing swelling, pain, or redness), and increasing the production of natural defensive cells in the body that could destroy sars-cov-2.",0
"for the study's purpose, increased skin-related or epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) expression may promote breast cancer resistance to hormonal therapy. we have studied if giving gefitinib, an egfr blocker, first might overcome biologic and medical resistance to pre-treatment anastrozole (a drug commonly used for breast cancer) in a medical trial. the study included postmenopausal women (women who had their last period) with hormone receptor-specific, early breast cancer received anastrozole 1 mg daily for 16 weeks. then, they were randomly assigned at a ratio of 2:5:5 to also receive (1) gefitinib 250 mg/d by mouth for 16 weeks, (2) dummy treatment 1 tablet/d by mouth for 2 weeks and then gefitinib for 14 weeks, or (3) dummy treatment for 16 weeks. the main measure was biologic change in cancer cell growth at 2 and 16 weeks. the main secondary measure was overall health improvement or objective response (or). for the study's results, two hundred six women were randomly assigned. average changes in cancer cell growth with anastrozole and gefitinib versus anastrozole alone were -77.4% and -83.6%, respectively, between start and 16 weeks, -80.1% and -71.3% between start and 2 weeks, and -19.3% and -43% between 2 and 16 weeks. ors in the 2-drug-group and anastrozole alone group were 48% and 61%, respectively, and 48% versus 72% in the female-sex-hormone-specific subgroup, which was consistent with cancer cell growth changes. common treatment-related side effects included diarrhea, rash, alopecia (hair loss or thinning), dry skin, and nausea. there was no evidence of a drug interaction. in conclusion, adding gefitinib to pre-treatment anastrozole had no additional clinical or biologic effect, failing to support our original theory.",0
"long-term treatment of parkinson's disease with levodopa (a drug that enters the brain and helps replace missing dopamine, a chemical that carries signals between brain cells) is slowed down by motor (movement) complications related to the inability of neurons to convert levodopa to dopamine (a chemical messenger that carries signals between brain cells and affects mood, motivation, and movement) and use it appropriately. this problem often leads to delaying the use of levodopa and using dopamine agonists (a medication that imitates the actions of dopamine in the body to relieve symptoms related to low levels of dopamine), which directly stimulates dopamine receptors or target sites in the brain. using dopamine agonists, however, is connected with multiple side effects. their performance is limited by the drug not being completely available to the intended part of the body. this paper reviews the latest findings from animal and human studies on the performance and negative effects of non-ergot dopamine agonists (newer types of drugs that imitate the effects of dopamine), discussing the present and future of this type of drug in parkinson's disease. the latest findings confirm the effectiveness of dopamine agonists as the first treatment and as an additional drug to use with levodopa in advanced parkinson's disease, but a more moderate approach to their use is emerging due to their side effects. as different factors may increase the risk to side effects, evaluating such risk and adjusting the use of dopamine agonists may become extremely important in the care of parkinson's disease, as well as the availability of new dopamine agonists drugs with better safety and performance documented.",0
"we analyzed the short- and long-term outcome of 42 patients with distal type aortic dissection (a tear in the major blood vessel near the heart). twenty-eight patients underwent intense treatment within two weeks after the start of pain (acute dissection or immediate rupture). the remaining 14 patients had long-lasting dissection or gradual breakdown of the major blood vessel near the heart. the goals of treatment were to control blood pressure and detect no c-reactive protein (a measure of inflammation). hospital survival rate in patients with acute dissection was 96% (27/28). in-hospital issues included changes in mental status, kidney dysfunction, slowed heart beat, low blood pressure from standing, and liver dysfunction, all of which were managed medically. three of these patients had surgery in the long-lasting phase and were released without issue. fifteen (62.5%) of the 24 medically treated patients were released with no c-reactive protein detected. random solving of a dissection (tear) was demonstrated by medical imaging in 8 cases. five-year survival rates in 24 medically treated patients was 93%. hospital survival rate in patients with long-lasting dissection was 100% (14/14). the rigorous control of blood pressure in the immediate phase, and subsequent monitoring of the dissection or tear by imaging and c-reactive protein tests provide good short- and long-term outcomes of patients with immediate distal dissection without emergency surgery.",0
"cardiac implantable electronic devices (cieds) provide lifesaving therapy for the treatment of slow heart rates (bradyarrhythmias), abnormal heart rhythm in the lower part of the heart (ventricular tachyarrhythmias), and when the heart does not pump enough (advanced systolic heart failure). all pacemakers have 2 basic functions: (1) to pace or get the heart beat back to normal and (2) to sense internal electrical activity of the heart. most pacemakers are programmed to slow or stop pacing when they sense natural electrical activity and only pace (send pulses) in the absence of this internal electrical activity. more specifically, pacemakers can be programmed to set which part or parts (chambers) will pace, which chamber or chambers will sense internal electrical activity, how the pacemaker will respond to sensed electrical activity (slow or stop pacing), and if rate adjusted pacing will be used.",0
"wound pressure injuries (skin sores) have been given various names over the last several years. in the past, they were referred to as pressure ulcers, decubitus ulcers, or bed sores. now, they are most commonly referred to as ""pressure injuries."" pressure injuries are the breakdown of skin integrity due to some types of unrelieved pressure. pressure injuries can come from a bony area on the body coming into contact with an external surface. pressure injuries represent the breakdown of normal structure and function of the skin and soft tissue. soft tissue includes muscles, fat, blood vessels, nerves, tendons, and tissues surrounding bones and joints. pressure injuries are formed through several different mechanisms and causes. the wound healing process is affected by various factors. these factors include infection, the presence of chronic diseases like diabetes, aging, nutritional deficiency like vitamin c, medications like steroids. additionally, the would healing process can be affected by low rates of oxygen and blood flow to the wound in cases of hypoxia (low oxygen in tissues) and cold temperature. pressure ulcers result from long periods of repeated pressure applied to the skin, soft tissue, muscle, and bone. in pressure ulcers, the external pressure exceeds capillary closing pressure. capillary closing pressure is the minimal amount of pressure needed to collapse a blood vessel. when external pressure is greater than the capillary closing pressure, blood flow is impaired for an extended period of time.",0
"background: in diabetic patients, postprandial glucose levels, which have a major impact on metabolic control, are determined by the rate of nutrient delivery into the intestine, absorption of nutrients from the small intestine, and the metabolism of the absorbed nutrients by the liver. the present study addresses whether type 1 diabetic patients have increased intestinal permeability and intestinal permeability predicts postprandial glucose variability. material and methods: thirty type 1 diabetic patients together with 15 sex- and age-matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study. after an overnight fasting all patients and controls received 100 micro ci 51 cr of edta as a radioactive tracer and the percentage of the isotope excreted in a 24-h urinary specimen was the permeability measure. instant blood glucose was measured just before the test, and the patients performed and recorded self-monitoring of fasting and 2nd-hour postprandial blood glucose levels during the following week. results: we found that intestinal permeability is increased in type 1 diabetic patients compared with age- and sex-matched healthy controls. increased intestinal permeability is related at least in part to the instant blood glucose level and the presence of diabetic autonomic neuropathy. conclusion: increased intestinal permeability leads to higher variation in postprandial blood glucose levels, thereby worsening metabolic control.",1
"this review paper addresses the mechanisms and treatment of hemorrhagic shock. hemorrhagic shock is a condition produced by rapid and significant loss of blood. it can lead to abnormal blood pressure, decreases in oxygen delivery, decreased tissue fluid volume, reduced oxygen in cells, organ damage, and death. hemorrhagic shock can quickly cause death. the primary goals are to stop the bleeding and restore circulating blood volume. resuscitation (revival) depends on the estimated severity of hemorrhage. patients with moderate hypotension (decreased blood pressure) from bleeding may benefit by delaying fluid replacement until they reach a definitive care facility. however, the use of restorative fluids and blood products can be life saving in those patients who are in severe hemorrhagic shock. the best method of resuscitation has not been clearly established. a hemoglobin level of 7-8 g/dl is an appropriate threshold for transfusion (transfer) in critically ill patients with no evidence of oxygen depravation in tissues. hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells. however, it is the goal to maintain a hemoglobin level of 10 g/dl in actively bleeding patients, the elderly, or individuals who are at risk of having a heart attack. hemoglobin concentration should not be the only therapeutic guide in actively bleeding patients. instead, therapy should be aimed at restoring blood volume, blood pressure, and heart rate.",0
"the objective is to determine how carb restriction affects births in diet-controlled gestational diabetics, in which high blood sugar affects pregnant women. diet-controlled, pregnant gestational diabetics with high blood sugar were divided non-randomly based on dietary carb intake: a low-carb intake group (below 42%) or high-carb intake group (over 45%). subjects kept diet records and were followed with daily blood sugar measurements. subjects also were tested daily for ketones in urine. certain blood sugar and birth-related measurements were compared between groups. the two groups had identical socioeconomic traits. the low-carb group had reduced after-meal glucose levels. less patients in the low-carb group needed insulin for glucose control. the frequency of large-for-prebirth-age infants was lower in the low-carb group. the low-carb group also had less cesarean deliveries for large-head babies and large-body babies. carb restriction in diet-controlled, pregnant gestational diabetics with high blood sugar improves blood sugar control, reduces need for insulin, reduces frequency of large-for-prebirth-age infants, and reduces cesarean deliveries for large-head and large-body babies.",0
"checks for conditions that affect newborns make finding individuals with phenylketonuria (pku), a disorder inherited from both parents in which the body cannot properly turn a substance (phenylalanine) into energy, easy and effective. a recent drug treatment option brought fast development of a lab method that checks for certain genes, proteins, or other molecules that may be a sign of a disease. however, genetic alternations that cause pku do not equally reduce protein activity. a range of over 850 genetic alterations causes elevated phenylalanine blood levels from very mild with no treatment to severe pku, which needs immediate treatment. databases of physical gene locations and alterations carried in a gene allow effective classification and treatment of patients. the lab method that checks for certain genes, proteins, or other molecules determines a patient's genetic alterations in a few days, especially if each lab comes up with a test to look for alterations in more than one gene for the most common alterations in a group of people.",0
"previously, we reported that immunomodulatory lactobacilli, nasally administered, beneficially regulated the lung antiviral innate immune response induced by toll-like receptor 3 (tlr3) activation and improved protection against the respiratory pathogens, influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus in mice. here, we assessed the immunomodulatory effects of viable and non-viable lactiplantibacillus plantarum strains in human respiratory epithelial cells (calu-3 cells) and the capacity of these immunobiotic lactobacilli to reduce their susceptibility to the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) infection. immunobiotic l. plantarum mpl16 and crl1506 differentially modulated ifn-β, il-6, cxcl8, ccl5 and cxcl10 production and ifnar2, ddx58, mx1 and oas1 expression in calu-3 cells stimulated with the tlr3 agonist poly(i:c). furthermore, the mpl16 and crl1506 strains increased the resistance of calu-3 cells to the challenge with sars-cov-2. l. plantarum mpl16 induced these beneficial effects more efficiently than the crl1506 strain. of note, neither non-viable mpl16 and crl1506 strains nor the non-immunomodulatory strains l. plantarum crl1905 and mpl18 could modify the resistance of calu-3 cells to sars-cov-2 infection or the immune response to poly(i:c) challenge. to date, the potential beneficial effects of immunomodulatory probiotics on sars-cov-2 infection and covid-19 outcome have been extrapolated from studies carried out in the context of other viral pathogens. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the ability of immunomodulatory lactobacilli to positively influence the replication of the new coronavirus. further mechanistic studies and in vivo experiments in animal models of sars-cov-2 infection are necessary to identify specific strains of beneficial immunobiotic lactobacilli like l. plantarum mpl16 or crl1506 for the prevention or treatment of the covid-19.",1
"we studied the effect of severe reduction of beta-cell mass by 90% pancreatectomy on the immune tolerance to the endocrine pancreas. four months after subtotal pancreatectomy all lew.han rats had developed mononuclear infiltration of islets and 9 of 14 rats were positive for islet-cell antibodies. electron microscopy revealed lymphocytic invasion of endocrine tissue, lysis of beta cells and phagocytotic macrophages. none of these changes were seen 2 weeks after 90% pancreatectomy or 4 months after 10% pancreatectomy. weekly substitution of islet antigens in the form of a homogenate of 100 islets into 90% pancreatectomized lew.han rats almost completely prevented the development of insulitis and autoantibodies. the dependence of insulitis on t cells was shown when 90% pancreatectomy in lew.rnu rats (i.e., the congenic athymic nude strain), did not result in islet infiltration. the exocrine tissue remained normal in all experimental groups. during the observation period insulitis was not associated with overt diabetes but was accompanied by substantial enlargement of islets and of beta-cell mass, as shown by morphometry. suppression of islet inflammation by injection of islet antigens abolished beta-cell regeneration, despite continuing metabolic stress in rats with 90% pancreatectomy. the findings indicate induction of islet autoimmunity in response to 90% but not to 10% pancreatectomy. we conclude that severe reduction of the islet-antigen mass allows the development of t-cell-dependent islet autoimmunity which indicates a loss of immune tolerance. in addition, the data suggest the existence of islet-antigen autoreactive immune cells in rats not genetically predisposed to autoimmune diabetes. finally, we conclude that selective beta-cell regeneration occurs in association with insulitis.",1
"patients with major depressive disorder (a mental health disorder where a person is in a constant depressed mood or has a loss of interest in activities) remain at risk for relapse (the worsening of a medical condition that had previously improved) following remission (a period of improvement where the patient is mostly asymptomatic) and often continue to experience subthreshold symptoms in which a person has symptoms but the symptoms do not meet the full criteria for a medical diagnosis. this study examines whether depressed patients who had recovered and then relapsed while on fluoxetine (a type of antidepressant also called prozac) at 20 mg/day would benefit from an increase in fluoxetine dose. a total of 132 patients with major depressive disorder who achieved remission with 8 weeks of treatment with fluoxetine at 20 mg had the dose increased to 40mg. they are randomly put in groups to receive cognitive therapy (a type of behavior therapy that focuses on challenging negative thoughts that can worsen emotional difficulties) or to receive medication only. patients are followed for up to 28 weeks to check for depressive relapse and changes in depressive symptoms. a total of 47 out of 132 patients did not complete the 28 weeks phase of the study. rates of stopping the drug or relapsing did not differ significantly between the group receiving cognitive therapy and the group only receiving medication. changes in subthreshold symptoms or wellbeing did not differ between groups. in this sample of patients being treated for major depressive disorder, the combination of cognitive therapy and fluoxetine at 40 mg failed to lead to any significant benefit in symptoms or in relapse rates over fluoxetine 40 mg alone during the 28 week follow-up period.",0
"dna damage and alterations in dna damage response (ddr) signaling could be one of the molecular mechanisms mediating focal kidney cyst formation in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (adpkd). the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that markers of dna damage and ddr signaling are increased in human and experimental adpkd. in the human adpkd transcriptome, the number of up-regulated ddr-related genes was increased by 16.6-fold compared with that in normal kidney, and by 2.5-fold in cystic compared with that in minimally cystic tissue (p < 0.0001). in end-stage human adpkd tissue, γ-h2a histone family member x (h2ax), phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia and radiation-sensitive mutant 3 (rad3)-related (patr), and phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (patm) localized to cystic kidney epithelial cells. in vitro, patr and patm were also constitutively increased in human adpkd tubular cells (wt 9-7 and 9-12) compared with control (hk-2). in addition, extrinsic oxidative dna damage by hydrogen peroxide augmented γ-h2ax and cell survival in human adpkd cells, and exacerbated cyst growth in the three-dimensional madin-darby canine kidney cyst model. in contrast, ddr-related gene expression was only transiently increased on postnatal day 0 in pkd1rc/rc mice, and not altered at later time points up to 12 months of age. in conclusion, ddr signaling is dysregulated in human adpkd and during the early phases of murine adpkd. the constitutive expression of the ddr pathway in adpkd may promote survival of pkd1-mutated cells and contribute to kidney cyst growth.",1
"a ketogenic diet is a low carb, high-fat diet that can help create fuel for the body when glucose levels are low. the aim of this study is to find the short- and long-term effects of a ketogenic diet on disease progression and disease-related outcomes (changes in health) in patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency, a rare disease that impacts the nervous system. the effects of a ketogenic diet on the body's chemical process to turn food into energy and potential safety issues are also studied. child patients diagnosed with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency in sweden and treated with a ketogenic diet are evaluated in this study. the study includes different tests on development and brain function, recording assessments in patient log books, and a series of questions for both researchers and parents to answer. a review of all relevant research on this topic is also performed. nineteen patients were included in the study. for most of the patients, the disease developed during pregnancy. patients were treated with ketogenic diet for about 2.9 years, but this time varied. all patients alive at the time of data registration were about 6 years old, but the age did vary. the treatment has a positive effect mainly in the areas of epilepsy (a disorder that causes seizures), ataxia (loss of control of movement), sleep disturbance, speech/language development, social functioning (the ability to engage with others), and the number of hospitalizations. it is also safe-except in one patient who had to stop because of acute pancreatitis, where the pancreas becomes swollen over a short period of time. not staying on the diet regularly is connected with returning ataxia (loss of control of movement) and slowing or stopping of the strengthening of bones and muscles and brain development. ketogenic diet is an effective and safe treatment for the majority of patients. how effective treatment is was mostly determined by physical traits or characteristics of patients and by if the body reaches and maintains ketosis, a process where the body burns stored fat for energy instead of glucose.",0
"first-generation histamine h1-receptor antagonists, such as diphenhydramine, triprolidine, hydroxyzine or chlorpheniramine (chlorphenamine), frequently cause somnolence or other cns adverse effects. second-generation h1-antagonists, such as terfenadine, astemizole, loratadine and cetirizine, represent a true advance in therapeutics. in manufacturers' recommended doses, they have a more favourable benefit/risk ratio than their predecessors with regard to lack of cns effects, and do not exacerbate the adverse cns effects of alcohol or other cns-active chemicals. rarely, some of the newer h1-antagonists may cause cardiac dysrhythmias after overdose or under other specific conditions. the concept of a risk-free h1-antagonist is proving to be an oversimplification. an h1-antagonist absolutely free from adverse effects under all circumstances is not yet available for use. the magnitude of the beneficial effects of each h1-antagonist should be related to the magnitude of the unwanted effects, especially in the cns and cardiovascular system, and a benefit-risk ratio or therapeutic index should be developed for each medication in this class.",1
"depression is the single largest contributor to non-fatal health loss worldwide. new antidepressants, also called second-generation antidepressants, (medications used to treat depression and other disorders and can improve mood, sleep quality, and concentration) are the first-line option for managing depression using medication. their use is important to reduce the burden of depression; however, there is ongoing debate about their dose dependency (when the effects of a drug change when the dose of the drug is changed) and the best target dose (the dose that achieves a target effect). we have aimed to summarize the best available evidence to inform this clinical question. researchers found 28,554 records by searching published and unpublished records. among those records, 561 published and 121 unpublished records that have complete text are reviewed, and 77 are included in the final analysis. for ssris or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (a type of antidepressant that can increase the amount of serotonin, a mood stabilizer), the dose-efficacy curve (relationship between an effect of a drug and the amount of drug given) showed a gradual increase up to doses between 20mg and 40mg fluoxetine (a type of ssri also called prozac), and a flat to decreasing trend through the higher doses up to 80 mg fluoxetine equivalents. some patients dropped out due to side effects. the relationship between the dose of the drug and dropouts for any reason suggests the best acceptability for using ssris is in the lower licensed range between 20 mg and 40 mg fluoxetine equivalents. venlafaxine (a type of antidepressant) has an initially increasing relationship between dose amount and drug performance up to 75-150mg, followed by a more modest increase, whereas for another antidepressant called mirtazapine, performance increased up to a dose of about 30 mg and then decreased. both venlafaxine and mirtazapine worked well in the lower range of their licensed dose. these results performed well in several sensitivity analyses to assess strength and uncertainty in a study. for the most common newer antidepressants, the lower range of the dose achieves the best balance between performance, tolerability (the degree to which drugs' negative effects can be handled by patients), and acceptability in the treatment of major depression.",0
"sickle cell disease (scd) is a genetic disorder due to a single mutation in the beta-globin gene. this mutation causes a change in an amino acid in the beta-hemoglobin protein that decreases the ability of oxygen to be carried out to the body. patients with sickle cell disease (scd) may experience a variety of signs, symptoms and disease outcomes from this disorder. understanding the causes, progression, and functional problems that result in patients with scd are very important in finding and choosing treatments. in this special paper, doctors discuss the importance of screening newborns for scd. they also describe the genes, the pathology, and the signs and symptoms of sickle cell disease. this paper is the result of a very thorough research of the literature on scd. the paper focuses on the pain scd can cause after the decrease in fetal hemoglobin which occurs in infants as young as five to six months after birth. the features seen in sickle cell disease is probably due to a combination of the red blood cells being destroyed and the small blood vessels being blocked. this paper also discusses new therapies for sickle cell disease.",0
"first generation antihistamines, drugs that stop allergies due to the body chemical histamine, may cause drowsiness. they are often given to children, but it is not known how they effect the children's brains we believe that first generation antihistamines diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine may disturb children's brain function. we evaluated how these drugs effect body cells in children. fifteen children with seasonal allergy (hay fever) had tests before and after they took diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, or placebo (a pill that contains no drugs.) their brain functions were evaluated by measuring the delays in response to events. they were also asked to evaluate how sleepy they felt. diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine significantly increased the time it took to respond to the events. hydroxyzine and diphenhydramine also increased sleepiness. both antihistamines also reduced the allergies. in children, diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine help against allergies, but interfere with brain functions. these drugs cause longer response times, increase sleepiness and disturb mental processes.",0
"current controversies for medical nutrition therapy in pregnancies complicated by diabetes include the composition and amount of carbohydrates and fats as well as optimal gestational weight gain and energy restriction. although carbohydrate is the macronutrient with the greatest effect on glycemic control, there is little evidence for a recommended amount and type of carbohydrate or its distribution. this lack of evidence prompts an issue of debate among practitioners over the type of carbohydrate and its percent distribution throughout the day. the best indicators at this time are the results of self-monitoring of blood glucose, ketone testing, food records, and weight gain. a review of the literature provides the most current information available for medical nutrition therapy during a pregnancy complicated by diabetes and reinforces the need for further research in the form of randomized controlled trials to answer questions regarding carbohydrate modification and distribution, energy needs, and weight gain.",1
"novel coronavirus (covid-19) is causing global mortality and lockdown burdens. a compromised immune system is a known risk factor for all viral influenza infections. functional foods optimize the immune system capacity to prevent and control pathogenic viral infections, while physical activity augments such protective benefits. exercise enhances innate and adaptive immune systems through acute, transient, and long-term adaptations to physical activity in a dose-response relationship. functional foods prevention of non-communicable disease can be translated into protecting against respiratory viral infections and covid-19. functional foods and nutraceuticals within popular diets contain immune-boosting nutraceuticals, polyphenols, terpenoids, flavonoids, alkaloids, sterols, pigments, unsaturated fatty-acids, micronutrient vitamins and minerals, including vitamin a, b6, b12, c, d, e, and folate, and trace elements, including zinc, iron, selenium, magnesium, and copper. foods with antiviral properties include fruits, vegetables, fermented foods and probiotics, olive oil, fish, nuts and seeds, herbs, roots, fungi, amino acids, peptides, and cyclotides. regular moderate exercise may contribute to reduce viral risk and enhance sleep quality during quarantine, in combination with appropriate dietary habits and functional foods. lifestyle and appropriate nutrition with functional compounds may offer further antiviral approaches for public health.",1
"tardive dyskinesia (td), characterized by possibly irreversible, abnormal, uncontrolled movements related to the use of antipsychotics, negatively affects functioning and quality of life for patients. although many believed it would be different, td has not gone away even with the use of second-generation antipsychotics (sgas), which are less likely to cause movement side effects. instead, changes in how antipsychotics are prescribed and antipsychotics prescribed for unapproved use have increased the patients at risk of td. we describe treatment options for td as part of an individual-specific plan, including changing antipsychotic dosing and treating dyskinesia.",0
"in the effort to improve treatment effectiveness in glioblastoma, this short note reviewed collected data on the pathophysiology of glioblastoma with particular reference to intersections with the pharmacology of perphenazine. that study identified five areas of potentially beneficial intersection. data showed seemingly 5 independent perphenazine attributes of benefit to glioblastoma treatment - i) blocking dopamine receptor 2, ii) reducing centrifugal migration of subventricular zone cells by blocking dopamine receptor 3, iii) blocking serotonin receptor 7, iv) activation of protein phosphatase 2, and v) nausea reduction. perphenazine is fully compatible with current chemoirradiation protocols and with the commonly used ancillary medicines used in clinical practice during the course of glioblastoma. all these attributes argue for a trial of perphenazine's addition to current standard treatment with temozolomide and irradiation. the subventricular zone seeds the brain with mutated cells that become recurrent glioblastoma after centrifugal migration. the current paper shows how perphenazine might reduce that contribution. perphenazine is an old, generic, cheap, phenothiazine antipsychotic drug that has been in continuous clinical use worldwide since the 1950's. clinical experience and research data over these decades have shown perphenazine to be well-tolerated in psychiatric populations, in normals, and in non-psychiatric, medically ill populations for whom perphenazine is used to reduce nausea. for now (summer, 2020) the nature of glioblastoma requires a polypharmacy approach until/unless a core feature and means to address it can be identified in the future. conclusions: perphenazine possesses a remarkable constellation of attributes that recommend its use in gb treatment.",1
"the aim of this study was to evaluate the interaction of serumor blood folate (a specific vitamin) and vitamin b12 with methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr- a gene) c677t genotypes, or inherited gene types for a protein involved in blood pressure, on the risk of first ischemic or brain-related stroke. genotypes are variations of a gene. these variations are often referred to as tt, cc, or ct. additionally, the study aimed to review the efficacy or success of folic acid treatment in prevention of first ischemic stroke. a total of 20,702 hypertensive (high blood pressure) adults were randomly placed into one of two treatment groups: daily enalapril (common blood pressure medication) 10 mg and folic acid 0.8 mg or enalapril 10 mg alone. participants were followed up every 3 months. average values of folate and b12 concentrations before treatment were 8.1 ng/ml and 280.2 pmol/l, respectively. over an average of 4.5 years, participants not receiving folic acid with baseline (starting) serum or blood b12 or serum folate above the median (average) had a significantly lower risk of first ischemic stroke. this decreased risk was found especially in those with mthfr 677 cc genotype (wild-type or normal). folic acid treatment significantly reduced the risk of first ischemic stroke in participants with both folate and b12 below the median, particularly in patients with cc genotype. however, participants with tt genotype responded better with both folate and b12 levels above the median of participants. the study concluded the risk of first ischemic stroke was significantly higher in hypertensive patients with low levels of both folate and b12. folic acid treatment helped the most in patients with low folate and b12 with the cc genotype, and with high folate and b12 with the tt genotype.",0
"objectives: afternoon napping is a common habit in china. we used data obtained from the dongfeng-tongji cohort to examine if duration of habitual afternoon napping was associated with risks for impaired fasting plasma glucose (ifg) and diabetes mellitus (dm) in a chinese elderly population. methods: a total of 27,009 participants underwent a physical examination, laboratory tests, and face-to-face interview. they were categorized into four groups according to nap duration (no napping, <30, 30 to <60, 60 to <90, and > or =90 min). logistic regression models were used to examine the odds ratios (ors) of napping duration with ifg and dm. results: of the participants, 18,515 (68.6%) reported regularly taking afternoon naps. those with longer nap duration had considerably higher prevalence of ifg and dm. napping duration was associated in a dose-dependent manner with ifg and dm (p<.001). after adjusting for possible confounders, longer nap duration (>60 min; all p<.05) was still significantly associated with increased risk for ifg, and longer nap duration (>30 min) was associated with increased risk for dm; however, this finding was not significant in the group with a nap duration of 60-90 min. conclusions: longer habitual afternoon napping was associated with a moderate increase for dm risk, independent of several covariates. this finding suggests that longer nap duration may represent a novel risk factor for dm and higher blood glucose levels.",1
"introduction: nutrition therapy is an integral part of the management of gestational diabetes mellitus (gdm). most women with gdm are treated by nutritional management alone. the goal of our study was to compare low and high carbohydrate diets in their effectiveness, safety and tolerability in women with gdm. material and methods: the study group consisted of 30 caucasian women newly diagnosed with gdm, with a mean age of 28.7 +/- 3.7 years and pregnancy duration of 29.2 +/- 5.4 weeks. the patients were randomised into two groups: those on a low and those on a high carbohydrate diet (45% vs. 65% respectively of energy supply coming from carbohydrates). the presence of urine ketones was controlled every day. after two weeks daily glucose profiles and compliance with the recommended diets were analysed. results: glucose concentration before implementation of the diet regimen did not differ between groups. no changes in fasting blood glucose were noticed in the group that had followed a low carbohydrate diet, although a significant decrease in glucose concentration was observed after breakfast (102 +/- 16 vs. 94 +/- 11 mg/dl), lunch (105 +/- 12 vs. 99 +/- 9 mg/dl) and dinner (112 +/- 16 vs. 103 +/- 13 mg/dl) (p < 0.05). in the high carbohydrate diet group fasting and after-breakfast glucose concentration did not change. a significant decrease in glycaemia was noticed after lunch (106 +/- 15 vs. 96 +/- 7 mg/dl) and dinner (107 +/- 12 vs. 97 +/- 7 mg/dl) (p < 0.05). ketonuria was not observed in either group. obstetrical outcomes did not differ between groups. conclusions: both high and low carbohydrate diets are effective and safe. a diet with carbohydrate limitation should be recommended to women who experience the highest glycaemia levels after breakfast.",1
"the most frequent type of rhizomelic dwarfism, achondroplasia (ach), is caused by mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3) gene. mutations in fgfr3 result in skeletal dysplasias of variable severity, including mild phenotypic effects in hypochondroplasia (hch), severe phenotypic effects in thanatophoric dysplasia types i (tdi) and ii (tdii), and severe but survivable phenotypic effects in severe achondroplasia with developmental delay and acanthosis nigricans (saddan). to explore the molecular mechanisms that result in the different phenotypes, we investigated the kinetics of mutated versions of fgfr3. first, we assayed the phosphorylation states of the mutated fgfr3s and found that the level of phosphorylation in tdi-fgfr3 was lower than in ach-fgfr3, although the other mutants were phosphorylated according to phenotypic severity. second, we analyzed the duration of the phosphorylation. tdi-fgfr3 was not highly phosphorylated under ligand-free conditions, but the peak phosphorylation levels of tdi-fgfr3 and ach-fgfr3 were maintained for 30 min after stimulation with fgf-1. moreover, ligand-dependent phosphorylation of tdi-fgfr3, but not ach-fgfr3, lasted for more than 8 h after fgf-1 administration. the other mutant proteins showed sustained phosphorylation independent of ligand presence. third, we investigated the intracellular localization of the mutant proteins. immunofluorescence analysis showed accumulations of tdii-fgfr3, saddan-fgfr3, and a portion of tdi-fgfr3 in the endoplasmic reticulum (er). based on these data, we concluded that sustained phosphorylation of fgfr3 causes chondrodysplasia, and the phenotypic severity depends on the proportion of er-localized mutant fgfr3. in fgfr3 signaling, the transcription factor, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (stat1) inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of chondrocytes. here we reveal that phospholipase c gamma (plcgamma) mediates fgfr3-induced stat1 activation. both plcgamma and stat1 were activated by fgfr3 signaling, but a dominant-negative form of plcgamma (dn-plcgamma) remarkably reduced stat1 phosphorylation. apoptosis assays revealed that the constitutively active forms of fgfr3 (tdii-fgfr3) and stat1 (stat1-c) induce apoptosis of chondrogenic atdc5 cells via caspase activity. dn-plcgamma reduced the apoptosis of atdc5 cells expressing tdii-fgfr3, but over-expression of both dn-plcgamma and stat1-c induced apoptosis. therefore, we conclude that a plcgamma-stat1 pathway mediates apoptotic signaling by fgfr3.",1
"objectives: we identify management strategies for the treatment of upper respiratory tract symptoms stemming from dysfunction of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. methods: we present a retrospective case series of patients who had symptoms of sensory neuropathy, including persistent dysphonia, laryngospasm, and chronic cough. the patients were followed for symptomatic improvement after initiation of treatment with a neuromodulator. treatment outcome was defined by improvement or resolution of symptoms on a self-reported outcome scale. results: of 12 patients identified, 75% exhibited evidence of motor neuropathy on laryngoscopy and 83% had symptoms related to chronic cough treated with neuromodulator therapy over a mean follow-up of 20.4 months. the median dose of amitriptyline hydrochloride was 25 mg daily, and that of gabapentin was 300 mg 3 times daily. the mean time from the initiation of therapy to a complete response was 2 months. conclusions: patients with suspected neuropathy of the recurrent laryngeal nerve frequently respond to neuromodulator therapy. the addition of reflux precautions and acid suppression therapy is helpful in cases of chronic and recurrent laryngospasm. patients with evidence of motor neuropathy appear to have better outcomes with neuromodulator therapy.",1
"this article provides an overview of current heart device management, complications, and future areas for development. the last 70 years have seen huge advances in the field of implantable cardiac devices, from tools to diagnose conditions to electrical therapies to address slower heart rates, ventricular arrhythmia that causes irregular heart beats that don't send enough blood to the body, and cardiac resynchronisation to help the heart beat at the right rhythm. while out-of-hours specialist cardiology cover and regional (localized) arrhythmia pathways are increasingly established, they are not universal, and the management of arrhythmia remains an important part of clinical medicine for the general physician. this article discusses recommendations on diagnosing heart rhythms, pacing for bradycardia (slower than normal heart beat), cardiac resynchronization and implantable cardioverter defibrillator devices to treat fast heart beats, along with common complications. finally, future developments such as the potential of portable devices to help with diagnosing problems, enclosing cardiac devices in a mesh covering that has antibiotic (bacteria-fighting) medicines, and the increasing use of pacemakers that do not include any wires are described.",0
"hypophosphatasia (hpp) is a rare and under-recognized genetic defect in bone mineralization. bone mineralization is when bone become calcified. patients presenting with fragility fractures may be mistakenly diagnosed as having osteoporosis (brittle bones). these patients may be prescribed antiresorptive therapy, or drugs that block the breakdown of bone. these drugs may increase fracture risk. adult-onset hpp was identified in a 40-year-old woman. she had with femur fractures after 4 years of using denosumba, a drug to treat osteoporosis. a low serum (blood) alkaline phosphatase (alp) and increased serum vitamin b6 level signaled the diagnosis. her diagnosis of hpp was later confirmed by identification of two recessive gene mutations of the alpl gene. alp is an enzyme that helps bone strength. alpl is the gene that encodes alp. the patient was treated with teriparatide (an osteoporosis drug) due to the unavailability of alp enzyme-replacement therapy. the fractures healed. however, her mobility was impaired. hpp makes someone more likely to experience femur fractures during antiresorptive therapy. because of this, bisphosphonates (drugs that limit bone density) and denosumab should not be given to people with this condition. healthcare workings should screen patients with fracture or 'osteoporosis' to identify a low alp level. hpp is a rare and under-recognized cause of bone fragility. hpp is caused by impaired mineralization that can be misdiagnosed as a fragility fracture due to age-related bone loss. antiresorptive therapy is not recommended in hpp treatment. low serum alkaline phosphatase (alp) can aid in diagnosis. elevated serum vitamin b6 (a chemical that works with alp) is suggestive of hpp. identifying mutations within the alpl gene can confirm hpp status. therapy with a chemical alp reacts with, known as asfotase alfa, is currently unmanageably expensive. treatment with anabolic (repairing) bone agents has been reported. however, if this treatment helps normally mineralized bone form needs further study.",0
"leg swelling in both legs over time is common, and in most cases unharmful, and is mostly found in the older population, especially in women. veins in the lower limbs that do not allow enough blood to flow to the heart, called venous insufficiency, is the most common cause of swelling in legs among those over the age of 50. diseases of the important organs such as the heart, the liver and the kidneys are excluded during the first stage. pitting edema, a condition where excess fluid builds up in one part of the body and pressing into the swollen area leaves a pit or indentation, occurs both in venous insufficiency and in right-sided heart failure. basic tests and drug history are usually enough to exclude a number of general causes of the edema.",0
"autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is an important cause of end-stage renal disease, for which there is no proven therapy. mutations in pkd1 (the gene encoding polycystin-1) are the principal cause of this disease. the disease begins in utero and is slowly progressive, but it is not known whether cystogenesis is an ongoing process during adult life. we now show that inactivation of pkd1 in mice before postnatal day 13 results in severely cystic kidneys within 3 weeks, whereas inactivation at day 14 and later results in cysts only after 5 months. we found that cellular proliferation was not appreciably higher in cystic specimens than in age-matched controls, but the abrupt change in response to pkd1 inactivation corresponded to a previously unrecognized brake point during renal growth and significant changes in gene expression. these findings suggest that the effects of pkd1 inactivation are defined by a developmental switch that signals the end of the terminal renal maturation process. our studies show that pkd1 regulates tubular morphology in both developing and adult kidney, but the pathologic consequences of inactivation are defined by the organ's developmental status. these results have important implications for clinical understanding of the disease and therapeutic approaches.",1
"purpose: hiatal hernias are a common finding on radiographic or endoscopic studies. hiatal hernias may become symptomatic or, less frequently, can incarcerate or become a volvulus leading to organ ischemia. this review examines latest evidence on the diagnostic workup and management of hiatal hernias. methods: a literature review of contemporary and latest studies with highest quality of evidence was completed. this information was examined and compiled in review format. results: asymptomatic hiatal and paraesophageal hernias become symptomatic and necessitate repair at a rate of 1% per year. watchful waiting is appropriate for asymptomatic hernias. symptomatic hiatal hernias and those with confirmed reflux disease require operative repair with an anti-reflux procedure. key operative steps include the following: reduction and excision of hernia sac, 3 cm of intraabdominal esophageal length, crural closure with mesh reinforcement, and an anti-reflux procedure. repairs not amenable to key steps may undergo gastropexy and gastrostomy placement as an alternative procedure. conclusions: hiatal hernias are commonly incidental findings. when hernias become symptomatic or have reflux disease, an operative repair is required. a minimally invasive approach is safe and has improved outcomes.",1
"for the study's background, in childhood epilepsy, genetic causes are increasingly recognized in recent years with the use of gene labeling or sequencing. this has increased the scope of individualized medicine in unmanageable epileptic seizures or epilepsy, particularly epileptic encephalopathy (ee) (epilepsy that damages the brain). developmental disorder (dd) (impairments in a child's growth) is an important part of childhood uncontrolled epilepsy. this study was performed to measure the genetic causes of childhood epilepsy and dd. in this study, 40 children with epilepsy and dd with genetic mutations were included via prior records. it was done in a specialized care hospital of bangladesh from january 2019 to december 2020. genetic study was done by state-of-the-art gene labeling or sequencing. in all cases electroencephalography (measuring electrical acitvity of the brain) and neuroimaging (imaging the brain) was done and reviewed. in total, 40 children were enrolled. the average age was 41.4â±35.850 months with a male majority (67.5%). generalized seizure was the main type of seizure. regarding the links, reduced intelligence and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or adhd was common. seventeen cases had genetically identified ee developed during infancy. common gene mutations observed were scn1a (3), scn8a (2), slc1a2 (2), kcnt1 (2), and etc (genes linked with epilepsy). five patients of worsening, muscle-jerk-related epilepsy were identified. the mutations identified were in kctd7, mfsd8, and cln6 genes. three cases had mitochondrial gene mutation (mt-nd5, mt-cyb) (genes that affect the mitochondria or the powerhouse of the cell). some rare diseases like gibbs syndrome (brain disorder with weak muscle tone), kohlschã¼tter-tã¶nz syndrome (genetic disorder with seizures), cockayne syndrome (delayed development disorder), pitt-hopkins syndrome (child development disorder) and cerebral creatine deficiency (creatine-metabolizing disorder) were identified. in conclusion, this is the first study from bangladesh on genetics of epilepsy and dd. this will help to improve the understanding of genetics epilepsy of this region and contribute in giving individualized medicine in these patients.",0
"the objective of this study is to determine whether time of day, the interval after a standard meal, and maternal body mass (body fat based on height and weight) influence the amount of blood sugar in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (a type of diabetes first seen during pregnancy in a woman who did not have diabetes before pregnancy). identical mixed meals are given on 2 separate occasions 1 week apart to 30 women with gestational diabetes being treated by diet and who are pregnant. one meal is given at 7 am (morning meal) and the second meal is given at 9 pm (evening meal), each after a fast (no food) of 5 or more hours. the order of the meals (morning first versus evening first) is assigned randomly. based on body mass index, 16 of the women are considered overweight, and 14 women are lean. blood sugar from the vein, insulin (a hormone in the body that allows cells in the muscles, fat, and liver to absorb sugar that is in the blood), free fatty acids (lipids from fats and oils that are a source of energy for the body), beta-hydroxybutyrate (a chemical in the body that provides energy when not enough carbohydrates or sugars have been eaten), and bound and free cortisol (a stress hormone that is bound to proteins or free in the blood) are measured hourly for 9 hours after each of the test meals. when all women are measured together, blood sugar after the morning meal is much greater at 1 hour, are not different at 2 hours, and are much lower 3 through 9 hours after the meal than measurements taken at the same times after the evening meal. the chemical beta-hydroxybutyrate and free fatty acid levels are higher between 5 and 9 hours after the morning meal than at the same times after the evening meal. levels of the stress hormone cortisol are higher for the first 7 hours after the morning meal, reflecting known daily variation in cortisol concentrations. overweight patients' blood sugar levels are much greater than those of lean patients during the last 4 hours of the overnight fast. in conclusion, among women with gestational diabetes, the blood sugar levels are much higher from 3 to 9 hours after an evening meal, whereas slowing or stopping free fatty acid and beta-hydroxybutyrate use is less stable after a morning meal. the process causing these differences remain to be found but may involve daily influences of hormones that increase blood sugar. the relationships between measurements of blood sugar in pregnant women and maternal and perinatal (before and after birth) outcomes in pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes may be cleared up by creating a standard time to fast and by developing meal-specific maternal blood sugar levels to aim to reach before and after meals for these patients.",0
"to treat patients with chronic shoulder and low back pain, previous studies have successfully used a treatment called low level laser therapy (lllt), a laser light used at a low level and applied to the skin of the body to reduce pain or inflammation and help heal wounds, tissues, and nerves. the purpose of this current study is to find out if lllt also helps patients with chronic joint pain of the elbow, wrist, and fingers. this study included 9 male and 15 female patients with chronic joint pain in the elbow, wrist, or fingers. the tender point (specific area of pain) and three points surrounding the pain were exposed to the lllt therapy light. each area was exposed two times for 20 seconds per treatment, giving a total of three minutes for all 4 points. patients visited the clinic twice a week, and were evaluated after 4 weeks of treatment with lllt (laser therapy). a tool called the visual analogue scale (vas) was used to measure pain by asking patients to report how intense their pain is on a scale. the study analyzed vas scores (how patients described their pain) after they received the lllt laser treatment. all vas scores that document pain intensity were totaled and analyzed. there was significant improvement in how much pain patients felt after they received the treatment. the effect of the laser treatment lasted for about one and half days for patients with wrist pain, tennis elbow, and carpal tunnel syndrome (pinched nerve in the wrist). in patients with other types of pain, the effect lasted for about 3-15 hours. there was no change in how far patients could move or stretch the injured part of the body after the treatment. this study found that low level laser therapy was helpful for chronic pain of the elbow, wrist, and fingers.",0
"the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), a viral respiratory disease, highlights harmful effects of antibodies, body molecules that combat foreign organisms. antibody-dependent enhancement (ade) of infection is a big concern because of the antibody reaction to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov-2), which causes covid-19, upon reinfection and the reaction to covid-19 vaccines. we found that certain cell molecules affect mild ade of infection against sars-cov-2. although certain immune cells infected with sars-cov-2 and its variants had infection enhancement, proinflammatory molecules were not increased in these cells. sars-cov-2 infection thus creates antibodies that cause ade of infection, but these antibodies do not lead to increased inflammatory molecule production by certain cells. viruses infect cells via certain cell parts. ade of infection or improvement of infection is another method of infection for viruses to infect immune cells influenced by antibodies and certain cellular molecules. because ade of infection leads to disease symptoms of some viruses, understanding how ade works and leads to these symptoms of sars-cov-2 is important. using blood from covid-19 patients, we found two cellular molecules that influence ade of sars-cov-2 infection. while ade of infection was seen for sars-cov-2 and its variants, proinflammatory molecule production in certain immune cells was not increased. thus, sars-cov-2 infection may create antibodies that cause ade of infection, but these antibodies may not lead to increased inflammatory production by certain cells during infection.",0
"buspirone hydrochloride (hcl)1 is a new anti-anxiety drug with a unique molecular makeup. how it works is not yet fully understood. unlike benzodiazepines, another type of drug to treat anxiety, buspirone is “anxioselective”; that is, it relieves anxiety without the side effects of benzodiazepines (sedation and muscle relaxation). as shown by a few clinical trials, buspirone 15 to 30 mg/day improves symptoms of anxiety using a standard questionnaire similarly to diazepam, clorazepate, alprazolam and lorazepam - other drugs that treat anxiety. like diazepam, buspirone works in patients with anxiety and depression, although the number of patients studied is small. in many studies, it takes 1 to 2 weeks for anxiety relief after starting buspirone, so doctors may need to encourage patients to keep taking buspirone. sedation happens much less often with buspirone than benzodiazepines, and other side effects are mild and uncommon. in healthy people, buspirone does not decrease mental processes and physical movement, and seems to not change with drinking alcohol. early studies suggest buspirone is not likely to be abused or cause dependence. although only more people taking buspirone for longer will show exactly how it works, it is another option to treat generalized anxiety because it rarely causes sedation. it could become the top treatment in patients who must be alert during the day.",0
"gabapentin is a new antiseizure or antiepileptic drug (aed) with attractive drug activity. gabapentin is absorbed by an active transport system. the drug has a large distribution. gabapentin is not bound to blood proteins, does not activate liver enzymes and is not broken down. normally, half of the drug is eliminated in 6-8 hours. it is cleared unchanged by the kidney with a blood clearance similar to standard kidney substance clearance. the drug does not have major drug-drug interactions when used with other aeds or swallowed birth control drugs. gabapentin used as an add-on aed greatly reduces the amount of partial seizures and partial seizures developing into standard serizures in three clinical trials. the drug is well tolerated, with temporary drowsiness and dizziness as the most common side effects. although how gabapentin works is unknown, there is evidence for a new mechanism of its biological action. gabapentin is a unique and promising drug that could improve life for patients with epilepsy (a brain disorder causing seizures). the drug is a welcome addition to current aeds for treating patients with seizures of partial onset.",0
"hypophosphatasia (hpp) is the heritable, tooth and bone disease. hpp is caused by mutations of the gene alpl. alpl encodes the tissue-nonspecific isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase (tnsalp). tnsalp is an enzyme that assists in breaking down phosphate groups. phosphate groups are important in activating proteins. tnsalp is expressed in healthy people, especially in the skeleton, liver, kidneys, and developing teeth. in hpp, decreased tnsalp activity leads to extracellular accumulation of its natural substrates, including pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (plp). plp is the principal circulating form of vitamin b6 (b6). different mutations of alpl largely explains the remarkably broad-ranging severity of this genetic inborn-error-of-metabolism. in 1985, elevated (blood) plasma plp was identified as hallmark of hpp. in the study, all 14 investigated affected children and adults had increased plp levels. however, pyridoxal (pl), an alternate form of plp that enters cells to cofactor (help) many enzymatic reactions, was often unexplainably elevated. levels of pyridoxic acid (pa), a compound used to determine b6 levels in the body, were unremarkable. signs or symptoms of b6 deficiency or toxicity were absent. b6-dependent seizures in infants with life-threatening hpp were later explained by their low tnsalp activity. lack of tnsalp activity was blocking plp dephosphorylation, removal of phosphate groups, to pl. this diminished formation of gamma-aminobutyric acid, a neurotransmitter, in the brain. it is theorized that abnormal b6 metabolism causes further health complications in hpp. this study assessed (measured) the blood pl and pa levels in patients with previously reported elevated plasma plp concentrations. the evaluated patient pool consisted of 150 children and adolescents with hpp. their average plasma pl level was nearly double the average of healthy pediatric controls. their pa levels were broader than our pediatric (child) control range with a normal average value. in contrast, adults with hpp often had plasma pl and pa levels that suggest a dietary b6 insufficiency. this paper discusses why b6 levels of children with hpp would not cause b6 toxicity or deficiency, whereas in affected adults dietary b6 insufficiency can develop.",0
"this review focuses on the muscle and bone-related features of achondroplasia, which is the most common bone growth impairment and the most frequent cause of short-limbed dwarfism. the gene that causes achondroplasia affects many members of a family but in the majority of cases is due to a new mutation. the diseases is related to a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 (fgfr3) gene and results in a continuously active receptor. experiments show that fgfr3 prevents bone growth by preventing cartilage cells in the bone growth region from growing and maturing. the mutation responsible for achondroplasia prevents growth of long bones. the diagnosis of achondroplasia is based on physical and x-ray features including short stature, large head with a prominent forehead, underdevelopment of the middle part of the face and shortening of the limbs. the most common bone-related complications of achondroplasia are shortening of the spine and deformities of the lower limbs. current treatment and future therapies are discussed.",0
"potassium is mainly an intracellular ion. the sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase pump has the primary responsibility for regulating the homeostasis between sodium and potassium, which pumps out sodium in exchange for potassium, which moves into the cells. in the kidneys, the filtration of potassium takes place at the glomerulus. the reabsorption of potassium takes place at the proximal convoluted tubule and thick ascending loop of henle. potassium secretion occurs at the distal convoluted tubule. aldosterone increases potassium secretion. potassium channels and potassium-chloride cotransporters at the apical membrane also secrete potassium. potassium disorders are related to cardiac arrhythmias. hypokalemia occurs when serum potassium levels under 3.6 mmol/l—weakness, fatigue, and muscle twitching present in hypokalemia.",1
"low blood levels of alkaline phosphatase (alp), a protein that influences the high-energy molecule phosphate, indicates low blood phosphate levels. however, the importance and genetics of low alp in random groups is unknown. to clarify this issue, we performed a clinical, biochemical and genetic study of 42 individuals with unexplained low alp levels. nine had mildly high blood phosphate levels. three had mildly high blood calcium levels. alp levels trended oppositely with blood calcium, pyridoxal phosphate (plp) or active vitamin b6, and urine phosphoethanolamine (pea), a key molecule to build cell boundaries. although many had minor complains, like mild musculoskeletal pain, none had major health problems. gene sequence changes in alpl, the gene encoding alp, were found in 21 subjects (50%), including six new changes. mutations that change a protein segment were the most common (present in 18 subjects; 86%). the majority were predicted to have a harmful effect on protein activity. having a mutated gene was linked with tooth loss, slightly lower levels of blood alp, higher levels of plp and pea, and mildly higher blood phosphate. ten people had above-average plp levels. all had a mutated gene. half of the adults with unexplained low blood alp had an alpl mutation. although the associated physical symptoms are usually mild, in around 50% of the cases, protein enzyme activity is low enough to cause phosphate accumulation and may predispose to defects in high-calcium body parts.",0
"sickle cell disease (scd) is a disabling genetic blood disorder caused by a single mutation. scd can have various outcomes,but it can result in severe pain crises, acute symptoms, and early death. the severity of the problems that occur in scd can vary depending on the amount of fetal hemoglobin (hbf) in the blood. high hbf levels are associated with decreased problems and death in patients with scd. common single mutations in two genes, bcl11a and hbs1l-myb, are thought to cause the changes in hbf levels seen in european populations without anemia. research has shown a connection between a single bcl11a gene mutation and hbf levels in some scd patients. in this paper, researchers found more single mutations in the bcl11a, hbs1l-myb, and hbc2 genes in two other groups of patients (a study in african americans scd patients and a study of scd patients from brazil). we studied the effect of these single gene mutations on hbf levels and the number of pain crises in scd. we showed a strong connection between the single mutations in these genes and different hbf levels. common single mutations in the bcl11a, hbs1l-myb, beta-globin (hbb) genes explain >20% of the different hbf levels in scd patients. these mutations, associated with hbf levels, are also associated with the number of pain crises in scd patients. this shows a clear example that inherited common gene mutations can change the severity of a genetic disease.",0
"importance: endocrine therapy-induced alopecia (eia) has been anecdotally reported but not systematically described. objective: to characterize eia in patients with breast cancer. design, setting, and participants: retrospective cohort study of 112 patients with breast cancer, diagnosed with eia from january 1, 2009, to december 31, 2016, the patients were examined at the dermatology service in a large tertiary care hospital and comprehensive cancer center. main outcomes and measures: the clinical features, alopecia-related quality of life (qol), and response to minoxidil of eia in patients with breast cancer were assessed. data from the hairdex questionnaire was used to assess the impact of the alopecia on patients qol. higher score indicates lower qol (0-100 score). efficacy of minoxidil was measured at 3 or 6 months by a single-blinded investigator through standardized clinical photographs of the scalp. results: a total of 112 female patients with breast cancer were included (median [range] age, 60 [34-90] years). a total of 104 patients (93%) had standardized clinical photographs; of these, 59 patients (53%) had trichoscopy images available at baseline, and 46 patients (41%) were assessed for response to minoxidil. alopecia was attributed to aromatase inhibitors in 75 patients (67%) and tamoxifen in 37 (33%). severity was grade 1 in 96 of 104 patients (92%), and the pattern was similar to androgenetic alopecia. the predominant trichoscopic feature at baseline was the presence of vellus hairs and intermediate- and thick-diameter terminal hair shafts. a negative impact on qol was reported, with a higher effect in the emotion domain according to the hairdex score (mean [sd], 41.8 [21.3]; p < .001). after treatment with topical minoxidil, moderate or significant improvement in alopecia was observed in 37 of 46 patients (80%). conclusions and relevance: endocrine therapies are associated with a pattern alopecia similar to androgenetic-type, consistent with the mechanism of action of causal agents. a significant negative impact on qol was reported by patients, despite mostly mild alopecia severity.",1
"measurement of beta-cell function is an important marker of progression to diabetes in individuals at risk for the disease. although the peak incidence for the disease occurs before 17 years of age, normal values for insulin secretion were not available in this age group. we performed a simplified intravenous glucose tolerance test in 167 normal children, and in 98 islet cell antibody (ica)-negative and 12 ica-positive siblings of diabetic patients. their age range was 1-16 yr. the first phase of insulin secretion, evaluated as the sum of plasma insulin concentrations at 1 and 3 min, increased with age and was significantly lower in ica-negative siblings (86 +/- 6 microu/ml, p < 0.002) than in normal controls (115 +/- 6 microu/ml). this difference was not apparent before 8 yr of age. none of the ica-negative siblings developed diabetes after an average of 4.5 yr. ica-positive siblings at first study had a first phase insulin response similar to that of ica negative siblings, but significantly lower than that of the normal controls (74 +/- 13 microu/ml, p < 0.02). the reason for the decreased insulin secretion in ica-negative siblings is unknown, but could involve a defect in the growth of beta-cell mass or insulin secretion that could be part of the multifactorial pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes.",1
"bedsores often seriously affect the quality of life of patients. bedsores can be treated with moist exposed burn ointment (mebo). our study aimed to rate how well mebo works and how safe mebo is in the treatment of bedsores in chinese patients. we randomly put 72 bedsore patients in two groups and gave them mebo or ointment with no medicine for 2 months. the most important outcomes were wound surface area and a common bedsore scoring tool. we also looked at a common scoring tool for pain, questionnaire of ulcer (sore) status, and side effects. sixty-seven patients did the study. after 2 months of treatment, mebo resulted in a greater average change from the beginning of the study compared to ointment with no medicine for wound surface area and both scoring tools. the questionnaire indicated mebo ""completely healed"" bedsores in patients after 2 months of treatment versus ointment with no medicine. we found no major side effects in the 2 groups. we showed that mebo works with no major side effects for improving would healing in chinese patients with bedsores.",0
"hyperkalemia is a condition where the potassium level in the blood is higher than normal. potassium is a very important mineral in the body. hyperkalemia can be caused by too much potassium coming out of the cells into the blood. it can also be caused when the kidneys are not getting rid of enough potassium from the body through the urine. hyperkalemia is temporary when too much comes out of the cells into the bloodstream. but, when the kidneys cannot get rid of enough potassium from the body, the hyperkalemia can last a longer time. there can be a few different reasons why the kidneys don't function correctly to get rid of potassium. in some people, all the reasons are present at the same time. taking in too much potassium through food or drink can cause hyperkalemia, especially if a person has a kidney problem. in this paper, we talk about how hyperkalemia can effect you. we also talk about how doctors can diagnose and treat it",0
"in spain, 1.5 million essential < 60-year-old workers were vaccinated with a first astrazeneca vaccine dose. after assessing the cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia associated to this vaccine, the european medicines agency (ema) supported the administration of 2 doses of the astrazeneca vaccine with no age restrictions. nevertheless, spain decided not to administer the second dose of this vaccine to < 60-year-olds. the government sponsored a clinical trial (combivacs) to assess the immunogenicity response to a pfizer/biontech vaccine dose in adults primed with the astrazeneca vaccine. the positive results backed the public health commission and the spanish ministry of health to offer the pfizer/biontech vaccine as the booster. nevertheless, regional public health authorities-responsible for administering vaccines-believed that, following the ema's decision, an astrazeneca booster dose should be given. the public confrontation of these 2 positions forced the spanish health ministry to request the signature of an informed consent form to those individuals willing to receive the astrazeneca vaccine booster and rejecting the pfizer/biontech vaccine dose. eventually, it was decided that these essential workers could choose the vaccine but signing an informed consent form. all relevant information was posted on the ministry of health and regional health authorities' websites and provided to potential vaccine recipients at vaccination sites. most individuals (≥ 75%) chose the astrazeneca vaccine: perhaps because they likely trusted the ema more than the combivacs results. this unprecedented and massive exercise of individual autonomy about the choice of covid-19 vaccines from 2 different platforms has shown that adequately informed persons can autonomously weigh their options, regardless of government decisions. exercising individual autonomy may contribute to the success of future covid-19 booster vaccination campaigns.",1
"postpartum (after giving birth) mood disorders represent a serious problem affecting 10-20% of women. support groups offer a promising treatment. this research studied women's satisfaction with and the success of a postpartum support group. this support group was guided by peers (others who had similar experiences). the program consists of a free, peer-support group, developed to increase social support and take away the shame of postpartum mood symptoms. the weekly group is assisted by former group participants and maternal health professionals. the peer-support program is offered in an urban city in the southeastern united states. the research study was done with community participation. the satisfaction of the participants was analyzed differences in depression measured at follow-up between program participants and a sample of community members that did not take part in the program were analyzed. changes in depression measured for the participant group (program attendees) was also analyzed. facts (data) about the participants at the beginning of the program were provided by the organisation backing the support group. the follow-up data was given by the participants through an online questionnaire. a community sample of women who did not participate in the program was enrolled to compare with the participants. participant satisfaction was high with overwhelmingly positive perceptions of the program. after participation in the program, depression scores were similar to those of the community sample at follow-up. analyses comparing data of participants both before and after the program showed decreases in depression symptoms. this decrease in depression was significantly associated with time, complications, and delivery method. the research found that this peer-support program is acceptable to program attendees and it provides a possible way to improve mental health outcomes. more research is needed. the research also stress the importance of combining analysis procedures into community-based mental health programs in order to support successful outcomes. peer-support groups are an acceptable form of treatment for women experiencing postpartum depression.",0
"antiepileptic - or antiseizure - drugs (aeds) can be associated with neurotoxic (brain damaging) side effects including cognitive dysfunction. cognitive dysfunction or inability to think properly is a problem of considerable importance given the usual long-term course of treatment. pregabalin is a relatively new aed widely used for the treatment of seizures and some types of chronic pain, including fibromyalgia - full-body pain. we measured the cognitive effects of 12 weeks of pregabalin administration (use) in healthy volunteers. thirty-two healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to one of two groups: pregabalin or sham treatment/placebo (1:1). pregabalin dose was continuously increased over 8 weeks to 600 mg/d. before treatment and after 12 weeks of treatment, all subjects underwent cognitive testing. test-retest changes in all cognitive and subjective measures were z scored against test-retest scores taken from 90 healthy volunteers. z scores determine how far a data point is away from a dataset average. z scores from the placebo and pregabalin groups were compared. thirty subjects completed the study (94%). three of 6 cognitive measures revealed significant test-retest differences between the pregabalin and placebo groups, all showing negative effects with pregabalin. these cognitive effects were paralleled by complaints on the portland neurotoxicity scale, a subjective measure of neurotoxicity. at standard doses and titration, pregabalin led to mild negative cognitive effects and neurotoxicity complaints in healthy volunteers. these effects are one factor to be considered in the selection and monitoring of chronic aed therapy. this study provides evidence that pregabalin 300 mg negatively impacts cognition on some tasks in healthy volunteers.",0
"we report five cases of pattern alopecia in female patients who are undergoing hormonal anticancer therapy for the prevention of recurrence of breast cancer after surgery. three patients demonstrated male pattern alopecia with receding frontal hairlines, and two patients demonstrated female pattern alopecia without receding hairlines. the detailed clinical history showed that the pattern alopecia of the patients developed after the full recovery of global hair loss of the entire scalp due to previous cytotoxic chemotherapy. all of the adjuvant hormonal anticancer drugs that were used in the patients are antiestrogenic agents, either aromatase inhibitors or selective estrogen receptor modulators. considering androgen effect on the hair follicles of the fronto-parietal scalp, the androgen-estrogen imbalance caused by the drugs was thought to be the reason for the onset of pattern alopecia in the patients. in general, alopecia that develops during cytotoxic chemotherapy is well known to both physicians and patients; however, the diagnosis of pattern alopecia during hormonal anticancer therapy in breast cancer patients seems to be overlooked.",1
"muscle cramps are common in healthy people, especially in the elderly and young people after intense exercise. cramps are in many harmless brain-related disorders. cramps are common in long-lasting, brain-related disorders like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis which weakens muscles. we reviewed the basis and biological mechanisms of cramps. future studies are needed to understand cramps. current treatment is limited.",0
"highly sensitive and specific radioimmunoassays have been validated for autoantibodies reacting with the four major autoantigens identified so far in autoimmune diabetes. however, the analysis of this large number of autoantigens has increased the costs and time necessary for complete autoantibody screenings. our aim was to demonstrate that it is possible to detect the immunoreactivity against a combination of four different autoantigens by a single assay, this representing a rapid, low-cost first approach to evaluate humoral autoimmunity in diabetes. by using this novel multi-autoantigen radioimmunoassay (maa), in subsequent steps we analysed 830 sera, 476 of known and 354 of unknown diabetes-specific immunoreactivity, collected from various groups of individuals including type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients, autoantibody-positive patients with a clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (lada), prediabetic subjects, individuals at risk to develop autoimmune diabetes, siblings of type 1 diabetic patients, coeliac patients and healthy control subjects. all sera reacting with one or more of the four autoantigens by single assays also resulted positive with maa, as well as eight of 24 type 1 diabetic patients classified initially as autoantibody-negative at disease onset based on single autoantibody assays. in addition, maa showed 92% sensitivity and 99% specificity by analysing 140 blinded sera from type 1 diabetic patients and control subjects provided in the 2010 diabetes autoantibody standardization program. maa is the first combined method also able to evaluate, in addition to glutamic acid decarboxylase (gad) and tyrosine phosphatase (ia)-2, insulin and islet beta-cell zinc cation efflux transporter (znt8) autoantibodies. it appears to be particularly appropriate as a first-line approach for large-scale population-based screenings of anti-islet autoimmunity.",1
"intermittent fasting is a type of eating schedule where a person doesn't eat any calories for a period of time. time-restricted feeding is a form of intermittent fasting that involves having a longer daily fasting period. early studies report that time-restricted feeding improves the health of the heart and metabolism in rodents and humans. in this study, researchers perform the first study to determine how time-restricted feeding affects how information from genes are used, how circulating hormones that travel in blood and attach to cells can change the cell function, and how daily patterns in the heart and metabolism can be risk factors in humans. eleven overweight adults participated in a 4-day study where they ate between 8 am and 2 pm (early time-restricted feeding) and between 8 am and 8 pm (control group for comparison). participants have their sugar continuously monitored, and blood is drawn to assess risk factors to the heart and metabolism, hormones, and gene development in blood cells. relative to the comparison group's schedule, early time-restricted feeding decreased the average 24-hour sugar levels and changes in blood sugar. in the morning before breakfast, early time-restricted feeding increased ketones (substances that the body makes if cells don't get enough blood sugar), cholesterol, and the activity of the stress response and aging gene sirt1 and the gene lc3a that cleans out damaged cells. while in the evening, time-restricted feeding tends to increase brain-derived neurotropic factor, which is a helpful protein in the spinal cord and brain, and also increases the expansion of the mtor gene, a major nutrient-sensing protein that regulates cell growth. early time-restricted feeding changes daily patterns in the cortisol stress hormone and use of several genes. early time-restricted feeding improves 24 hour blood sugar levels, changes how fats are broken down, and how gene functions are used. early time-restricted feeding may also increase cleaning of damaged cells and anti-aging effects in humans.",0
"tuberous sclerosis complex (tsc) is a rare disease that leads to noncancerous (benign) tumors forming in the body. tsc is caused by changes in two specific genes (tsc1 or tsc2) and affects multiple organs, including the kidney, lung, and brain. in the kidney, tsc can cause benign tumors and cysts (fluid swellings) to grow, which eventually leads to kidney failure. the factors promoting cyst formation and tumor growth in tsc are not completely understood. in this study, researchers report that mice with inactivation (turning off) of specific cells develop many cysts in the kidney. past studies with mice show an increase of the forkhead transcription factor 1 (foxi1) gene that impacts cell processing in cyst epithelia cells, which are important cells for kidney function. also, some gene processing is increased and work together with proton pumps called h+-atpase, which regulate functions such as nutrient intake and regulating acids between cells, on the lining of epithelial cysts cells in mice. deletion of the foxi1 gene, which is key to the survival of cells and h+-atpase processing, overrides the cyst burden in tsc1 mice. deletion of the enzyme caii causes major decreases in cyst burden and increased life expectancy in mice without caii and tsc1 versus mice without just tsc1. researchers suggest that epithelial cells in the kidneys and their transport mechanisms are important to the formation of many cysts, and slowing or stopping them is associated with significant protection against cyst development and/or enlargement in tuberous sclerosis complex (tsc).",0
"new scientific research has shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), or covid-19 (a viral, breathing-related disease), can infect various parts of the body, including cells within the heart. this paper reviews the effects covid-19 has on the heart after direct infection, which can lead to myocarditis. myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle. this paper will also outline potential treatment options for this illness. the authors proposed seven potential treatment options to help reduce heart injury in covid-19 patients. first, the virus uses specific entry points to infect heart cells so that it can replicate and grow stronger. therefore, specific drugs that target these entry points might be helpful. second, covid-19 uses a specific pathway to replicate itself. this pathway uses rna, a chain of genetic material that helps form proteins. drugs that prevent the creation of rna for viral replication could be helpful. third, covid-19 decreases the body's ability to degrade infected cells. this prevents the body from decreasing the amount of virus within it. covid-19 is able to replicate as it creates double-membrane vesicles, extra-strong chambers, as spaces safe from the body's natural defense system. fourth, covid-19 can cause the host immune response to be changed so that the virus is not targeted for removal. it can also increase inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) which alters the function of immune cells. better understanding of drugs that suppress the immune system is needed. fifth, covid-19 prevents cells from dying in the early stages of infection but induces cell death later, once it has replicated and moved to other cells. sixth, covid-19 infection can disturb energy metabolism (the process in getting energy from food). this can reduce energy production and affect cell function and viability. seventh, covid-19 creates virus proteins to lead to an imbalance within the host body. this can cause cell death, abnormal heart function, and an abnormal heartbeat.",0
"the ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus (the virus that causes covid-19 or the breathing-related infection) and its variants has created a global public health emergency. medical drugs and vaccines are needed to treat and prevent the spread of this contagious virus. this study describes how antibodies that are linked to receptor-binding domains (parts of the cell that connect the virus and allow entry to the cell) are identified in mice using a vaccine that includes a small piece of dna or genetic material to teach the body to fight the infection. monoclonal antibodies are medicines that may block the virus that causes covid-19 from attaching to human cells, making it more difficult for the virus to reproduce. certain monoclonal antibodies are selected for the study to understand how the coronavirus can be made ineffective. some antibodies with these receptor-binding domains have a high ability to make the coronavirus ineffective. these results show that monoclonal antibodies targeting certain parts of the virus can be used in combination with other monoclonal antibodies medicines against the coronavirus. the identification of these antibodies linked to receptor-binding domains and the mix of medicines may provide effective treatment and prevention against coronavirus.",0
"the proper treatment of hyperthyroidism depends on recognition of the signs and symptoms of the disease and determination of the etiology. the most common cause of hyperthyroidism is graves' disease. other common causes include thyroiditis, toxic multinodular goiter, toxic adenomas, and side effects of certain medications. the diagnostic workup begins with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level test. when test results are uncertain, measuring radionuclide uptake helps distinguish among possible causes. when thyroiditis is the cause, symptomatic treatment usually is sufficient because the associated hyperthyroidism is transient. graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and toxic adenoma can be treated with radioactive iodine, antithyroid drugs, or surgery, but in the united states, radioactive iodine is the treatment of choice in patients without contraindications. thyroidectomy is an option when other treatments fail or are contraindicated, or when a goiter is causing compressive symptoms. some new therapies are under investigation. special treatment consideration must be given to patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, as well as those with graves' ophthalmopathy or amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism. patients' desires must be considered when deciding on appropriate therapy, and dose monitoring is essential.",1
"we studied the effect of drastically reducing beta-cell (insulin-producing cell) mass by removing 90% of the pancreas on immune tolerance (state of unresponsiveness of the body's defense) to the endocrine pancreas, which controls blood sugar levels. four months after removal of almost all of the pancreas, all rats had developed signs of long-term inflammation (infection-fighting) response of islets (clusters of cells that produce hormones) and 9 of 14 rats had islet-cell antibodies (proteins made against insulin-producing cells). using microscopes, we saw immune white blood cells going into the part of the pancreas that produces substances (enzymes) that help with digestion, death of beta cells, and white blood cells that remove dying and dead cells. we saw none of these changes 2 weeks after removing 90% of the pancreas or 4 months after removing 10% of the pancreas. weekly substitution of islet antigens (substances that causes the body to defend itself) in rats with 90% of the pancreas removed prevented insulitis (disease of the pancreas caused by the infiltration of immune white blood cells) and self-made proteins. insulitis was shown to be dependent on t cells (part of the body's defense system). the tissue that produces substances (enzymes) that help with digestion did not change in any group. during the observation period, insulitis was not related to diabetes, but we saw a sizeable increase in the sizes of islets and beta-cell mass. decreasing islet inflammation by injecting islet antigens (fragments) stopped beta-cell regrowth, even though low energy continued in rats with 90% of the pancreas removed. the results suggest removing 90% but not 10% of the pancreas causes the body to mistakenly destroy its islets. we conclude that drastically reducing the islet-antigen mass allows the body to mistakenly destroy its islets, which shows a loss of immune tolerance. also, the results suggest islet-antigen autoreactive immune cells exist in rats not likely to develop autoimmune diabetes (diabetes from the body mistakenly destroying its own cells). finally, we conclude that some beta-cell regrowth happens with insulitis.",0
"uncontrolled bleeding is the leading cause of shock in trauma patients and delays in recognition and treatment have been linked to adverse outcomes. for prompt detection and management of hypovolaemic shock, atls(®) suggests four shock classes based upon vital signs and an estimated blood loss in percent. although this classification has been widely implemented over the past decades, there is still no clear prospective evidence to fully support this classification. in contrast, it has recently been shown that this classification may be associated with substantial deficits. a retrospective analysis of data derived from the traumaregister dgu(®) indicated that only 9.3% of all trauma patients could be allocated into one of the atls(®) shock classes when a combination of the three vital signs heart rate, systolic blood pressure and glasgow coma scale was assessed. consequently, more than 90% of all trauma patients could not be classified according to the atls(®) classification of hypovolaemic shock. further analyses including also data from the uk-based tarn registry suggested that atls(®) may overestimate the degree of tachycardia associated with hypotension and underestimate mental disability in the presence of hypovolaemic shock. this finding was independent from pre-hospital treatment as well as from the presence or absence of a severe traumatic brain injury. interestingly, even the underlying trauma mechanism (blunt or penetrating) had no influence on the number of patients who could be allocated adequately. considering these potential deficits associated with the atls(®) classification of hypovolaemic shock, an online survey among 383 european atls(®) course instructors and directors was performed to assess the actual appreciation and confidence in this tool during daily clinical trauma care. interestingly, less than half (48%) of all respondents declared that they would assess a potential circulatory depletion within the primary survey according to the atls(®) classification of hypovolaemic shock. based on these observations, a critical reappraisal of the current atls(®) classification of hypovolaemic seems warranted.",1
"post-traumatic trigeminal neuralgia (pttn), also known as anesthesia dolorosa, refers to the pain in the trigeminal nerve, a three-part nerve in the head that provides sensation. pttn is a crippling pain that has no established treatments, specifically for the pain around the eyes and back teeth. we describe how trigeminal nerve pain was treated in a patient who had it due to an old injury to his face. we describe surgery and treatment that blocked sensation in the facial nerves around the temples and cheek bones. this treatment could be used by dental surgeons who treat patients with facial pain. we also describe a decision support tool for recognizing and treating pttn.",0
"there are many options to control pain during joint replacement surgery to improve the patient experience. doctors should consider the unique ways that each of these options works when using them before, during, and after surgery. doctors should also keep in mind that each has different efficacy and side-effects. pain control before surgery or using anti-inflammatory drugs and opioid painkillers before the pain starts seems to work well to reduce pain after surgery. however, it is not clear what the recommended timing and type of treatment are. regarding the choice of anesthetic during surgery and pain control, anesthesia applied directly to the spine seems to have fewer general risks to the body than general anesthesia. in addition, injections of local anesthetics around the joint, regardless of technique, have been shown to improve pain scores following surgery and to have low risk overall. this is true whether the injections are used with or without adding other drugs, including those that control the body’s fight-or-flight response, opioids, nsaids or corticosteroids. when considering pain control following surgery, there are several methods. these include cold therapy, disabling nerves with injection or electrical stimulation, and medicines take by mouth or otherwise. options for medicines include tylenol®, cox inhibitors, drugs that affect the brain, tramadol (sold as ultram or zytram), ketamine, and opioid patches. however, there is no clearly preferred treatment, and doctors need to consider individual risks faced by patients when choosing appropriate pain treatments. using multiple pain treatments at once can decrease opioid usage, improve pain scores, increase patient satisfaction, and enhance early recovery. it is still not clear what the ideal medication plan to use before, during, and after surgery is. we recommend using an individualized approach to pain management around the time of surgery. in spite of this, changes to existing ways of treating pain in the scientific literature have shown good results. using a multi-pronged approach to treat severe pain following surgery has the risk for serious side effects. these including slow or shallow breathing, changes in mental state that can affect walking, low blood pressure, kidney and liver problems, blood problems, stomach problems, including ulcers, constipation or bowel obstruction. possible side effects also include nausea or vomiting, infection at injection sites, and nerve injury if nerves are disabled (peripheral blockade).",0
"two protein enzymes called ste20 (sterile 20)/sps-1 related proline/alanine-rich kinase (spak) and oxidative stress-response kinase-1 (osr1) activate the kidney-related cotransporters (carrier proteins that carry two different ions or other species from one side of the cell to the other) na(+) -k(+) -2cl(-) cotransporter (nkcc2) and na(+) -cl(-) cotransporter (ncc). knockout mouse models (experiments with mice that lack a specific gene) suggest that osr1 mainly activates nkcc2, while spak mainly activates ncc, and sometimes compensate for one another. researchers tested the idea that disrupting both enzymes causes severe polyuria (passing unusually large amounts of urine) and salt-wasting by producing spak/osr1 double knockout (dko) mice - mice without spak or osr1. dko mice showed lower systolic blood pressure (the top number of blood pressure that indicates how much pressure the blood is exerting against artery walls when the heart beats) compared to spak knockout (spak-ko) mice, but showed no severe phenotype (observable traits or characteristics) even after salt restriction in food. phosphorylation (a process of adding a phosphate group, a group of atoms that have different roles and make up dna and rna, to a molecule to prepare it to change or do work) of nkcc2 at spak/osr1-dependent sites was lower than in spak-ko mice (mice without spak), but still much greater than in wild-type or normal mice. in the innermost part of the kidney called the medulla, there was significant phosphorylation of nkcc2 at spak/osr1-dependent sites despite a complete absence of spak and osr1, which suggests the existence of another activating kinase enzyme. the distal convoluted tubule (a part within the kidney that connects to the collecting duct system that refines salt and water reabsorption) has been suggested to sense blood potassium by monitoring sodium delivery to the collecting duct. a lot of phosphorylated na(+) -cl(-) cotransporter (pncc) is dramatically lowered in spak-ko mice than in wild type mice, and the additional disruption of osr1 further reduced pncc. spak-ko and kidney-specific osr1 single knockout mice (mice without osr1 only in the kidney) maintained potassium in the blood following restrictions of potassium in food, but dko mice developed severe hypokalemia (low levels of potassium in the blood). unlike mice lacking spak or osr1 alone, spak/osr1 double knockout (dko) mice showed an inability to phosphorylate ncc under these conditions. these data suggest that ste20 (sterile 20)/sps-1 related proline/alanine-rich kinase (spak) and oxidative stress-response kinase-1 (osr1) are essential components of the pathway that maintains potassium in the blood.",0
"new recommendations for classifying diabetes mellitus include using ""type 1"" and ""type 2"" instead of ""iddm"" and ""niddm"" to identify the two major types of diabetes mellitus; simplifying the criteria for identifying diabetes mellitus to two unusual fasting blood scores; and a lower cutoff for fasting plasma glucose or blood sugar. these changes help improve identification of those at risk from effects of high blood sugar. currently, only half of those with diabetes mellitus have been identified. testing for diabetes mellitus should begin at 45 years of age and be repeated every three years in those without health risks. testing should begin earlier and more often for those with health risks. health risks include obesity, first-degree relatives with diabetes, high blood pressure, high blood fat, or prior signs of blood sugar imbalance. earlier detection of diabetes mellitus may improve blood sugar control and health issues from the disease.",0
"leg edema is a common side effect of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (ccb), medicines taken to control blood pressure and other conditions. the dose amount of cbb drugs may need to be reduced or stopped, negatively impacting the drugs' use to control blood pressure. leg edema (fluid swelling) is reported to occur less often with a type of cbb medicine called (s)-amlodipine compared to the regular racemic amlodipine medicine. researchers aim to find the number of times leg edema appeared and how well blood pressure is lowered with (s)-amlodipine compared to conventional amlodipine. this clinical trial followed 172 patients with high blood pressure, not controlled by using beta-blockers (bb) drugs or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (acei/arb) that keep blood vessels open. these patients are randomly placed in groups to receive either standard amlodipine (86 patients) or (s)-amlodipine (86 patients), while continuing their previous anti-hypertensive medications. the number of patients in this study is sufficient to find a difference in edema between the two groups. data from both treatment groups are analyzed during the study. data are analyzed to observe the difference between the two groups on how they responded to the treatment and the number of people who develop peripheral edema (swelling in lower legs and hands). pitting edema, a condition where excess fluid builds up in one part of the body and pressing into the swollen area leaves a pit or indentation, is measured and scored. altogether 146 patients completed 120 days treatment: 76 patients in the standard amlodipine group and 70 in the (s)-amlodipine group. characteristics such as age and sex and how well patients took the medicine as directed are compared between the two groups. new edema is 31.40 % in the (s)-amlodipine group and 46.51 % in the standard group. pitting edema score and patient rated edema score increase significantly in the amlodipine compared to (s)-amlodipine group after the treatment period. edema scores increase significantly in the amlodipine group from the start of the study. responders in blood pressure are 98.57 % in (s)-amlodipine and 98.68 % in amlodipine group. most common side effects are pitting edema and increase in urinary frequency. number of all side effects other than edema is similar in both groups. two serious side effects occur that are unrelated to therapy. results from other blood and heart tests in the two groups are similar. in patients with high blood pressure not controlled on prior bb and acei/arb therapy, adding (s)-amlodipine besylate at half the dose of standard amlodipine provides few side effects. there is also a reduced number of peripheral edema, and equal ability to lower blood pressure compared to amlodipine given at usual doses.",0
"pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (plp) is the active form of vitamin b6 in the body. plp is involved in more than 4% of the chemical reactions of proteins in the cell. changes in vitamin b6 metabolism have been associated with multiple human diseases. for example, mutations in the gene coding for antiquitin, a protein that appeared early in evolution, result in seizures. these seizures are due to an increase in a chemical (made during vitamin b6 metabolism) that stops the function of plp. plp is also required for the metabolism of homocysteine (an amino acid involved in vitamin b metabolism).. lower blood levels of b6 vitamers (active vitamin b6 chemicals-plp and pyridoxine) are associated with hyperhomocysteinemia (excess blood homocysteine). hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with a higher risk of many cardiovascular diseases. during the past 30 years, a lot of research has tried to explain links between vitamin b6 and cancer. high blood levels of vitamin b6, or the related lower blood levels of homocysteine, have been associated with improved disease outcome in patients with blood and solid organ neoplasms. recently, vitamin b6 metabolism has been shown to control tumor cells' ability to adjust to many different types of stress. also, increased levels of pyridoxal kinase (pdxk-a protein involved in producing plp), have been shown to predict good outcomes in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (nsclc). this research discusses the importance of vitamin b6 metabolism in the disease outcome of cancer patients.",0
"background: although the three vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) that have received emergency use authorization in the united states are highly effective, breakthrough infections are occurring. data are needed on the serial use of homologous boosters (same as the primary vaccine) and heterologous boosters (different from the primary vaccine) in fully vaccinated recipients. methods: in this phase 1-2, open-label clinical trial conducted at 10 sites in the united states, adults who had completed a covid-19 vaccine regimen at least 12 weeks earlier and had no reported history of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) infection received a booster injection with one of three vaccines: mrna-1273 (moderna) at a dose of 100 μg, ad26.cov2.s (johnson & johnson-janssen) at a dose of 5×1010 virus particles, or bnt162b2 (pfizer-biontech) at a dose of 30 μg. the primary end points were safety, reactogenicity, and humoral immunogenicity on trial days 15 and 29. results: of the 458 participants who were enrolled in the trial, 154 received mrna-1273, 150 received ad26.cov2.s, and 153 received bnt162b2 as booster vaccines; 1 participant did not receive the assigned vaccine. reactogenicity was similar to that reported for the primary series. more than half the recipients reported having injection-site pain, malaise, headache, or myalgia. for all combinations, antibody neutralizing titers against a sars-cov-2 d614 g pseudovirus increased by a factor of 4 to 73, and binding titers increased by a factor of 5 to 55. homologous boosters increased neutralizing antibody titers by a factor of 4 to 20, whereas heterologous boosters increased titers by a factor of 6 to 73. spike-specific t-cell responses increased in all but the homologous ad26.cov2.s-boosted subgroup. cd8+ t-cell levels were more durable in the ad26.cov2.s-primed recipients, and heterologous boosting with the ad26.cov2.s vaccine substantially increased spike-specific cd8+ t cells in the mrna vaccine recipients. conclusions: homologous and heterologous booster vaccines had an acceptable safety profile and were immunogenic in adults who had completed a primary covid-19 vaccine regimen at least 12 weeks earlier.",1
"first-generation antihistamines have potency, pharmacokinetic, and cost advantages compared with nonsedating second-generation antihistamines. bedtime dosing of hydroxyzine was investigated as a dosing strategy to minimize reaction time degradation and adverse subjective symptoms previously documented for hydroxyzine in divided doses. hydroxyzine, 50 mg qhs, was compared with terfenadine, 60 mg bid, in this double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of 15 healthy, asymptomatic adults. computer-based eye-hand reaction time tests of simple reaction time (srt) and choice reaction time (crt) were not statistically different among the three drugs. drowsiness, dry mouth, and irritability were significant for hydroxyzine (p = .0001, .001 and .02, respectively) compared with terfenadine or placebo, but less than seen in a previous study of hydroxyzine, 25 mg bid. symptom scores with terfenadine were comparable to placebo. histamine skin test wheal and flare were both significantly and comparably suppressed by hydroxyzine and terfenadine (p = .0001). while wheal suppression by hydroxyzine was universal, four of the 15 subjects showed little or no suppression with terfenadine (p = .03). although bedtime dosing of hydroxyzine did not eliminate subjective symptoms, it maintained skin h1-receptor antagonism the following morning and alleviated the prolongation of reaction times previously reported with hydroxyzine in divided doses. the significant adverse subjective symptoms and psychomotor performance degradations caused by first-generation antihistamines can be mitigated by creative dosing schedules.",1
"the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (pdc) is a chemical process in the body that converts molecules and links cells to the final stage of creating energy. pdc deficiency or shortage is a disorder that can be caused by changes in genes. the result of pdc deficiency mainly affects the central nervous system (the spinal cord and brain). this study aims to describe the clinical, biochemical (the chemical processes in living organisms), and genetic information in 13 patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (pdc) deficiency. all 13 patients carry some type of mutation in the genes that are involved in the pdc process. the mutation in the pdha1 gene (a gene that helps encode a building block of pdc) is the most common. these data support earlier reports describing pdha1 mutations as the main cause of pdc deficiency. the data also reveal a notable frequency of the pdhx mutation (another gene that helps encode a building block of pdc) among portuguese patients who seem to carry a mutation in the community or population. the biochemical analysis showed high levels of lactic acid (high levels occur when oxygen in the body decreases) and high levels of pyruvate plasma (a molecule that helps change sugar in the blood to energy when oxygen levels are low). all patients showed developmental delay (delays or slowness in reaching language, thinking, or motor skills). how serious these delays are seems to match up with the type and location of the mutation carried by the patient. treatment options include a ketogenic diet (low-carb/high-fat diet) and adding a vitamin called thiamine to the diet, although taking a supplement called arginine aspartate (used for helping to build proteins) may be beneficial in some patients. moreover, computer modeling of these gene mutations in this pdc deficient population created a picture of underlying causes of these mutations. the identification of the disease-causing mutations provides an insight on the severity of their impact on development and the selection of the best therapy.",0
"background in lymphedema, an imbalance in the formation and absorption of lymph causes accumulation of protein-rich fluid in the interstitium of the most gravity-dependent parts of the body. diagnosis is usually made based on patient medical history and a physical examination showing a typical appearance of the affected body part. differential diagnosis is confirmed by imaging. case report primary lymphedema is inherited in through an autosomal dominant pattern. congestive cardiac failure and non-filarial infections predispose patients to the secondary form of lymphedema, elephantiasis nostras verrucosa (env). we present the case of a 65-year-old man with lymphedema praecox complicated by congestive cardiac failure. the patient was experiencing worsening left leg swelling and had a prior history of unilateral leg swelling at puberty. the condition was inherited through an autosomal dominant pattern, as his father, elder brother, and nephew were diagnosed with the same disease. the left leg showed non-pitting edema with indurated, woody skin and lichenification. the right leg had mild pitting edema. there were numerous verrucous folds and cobblestone-like nodules, and plaques and a painless ulcer on the left leg. laboratory evaluation demonstrated an elevated b-type natriuretic peptide. he was treated with compression stockings and inelastic multi-layer bandaging and was administered limb decongestive treatment. after 1 week of therapy, his swelling had somewhat improved. conclusions various conditions can cause env and it can superimpose on any form of hereditary lymphedema. the most effective strategy for this condition seems to be a thorough workup of the underlying cause of the env and early intervention.",1
"total hip arthroplasty (tha, or hip replacement) is reported to be one of the most painful surgical procedures. how the patient is cared for and rehabilitated around the time of surgery are very important for the success of the procedure. this was a study of a group of patients that all had fast-track tha. the aim of the study was to evaluate function, ability to walk, and pain scores during the inpatient stay (6 days following surgery) and 4 weeks after the procedure. to perform the study, we included a total of 102 consecutive patients that had previously had minimally invasive cementless tha under spinal anesthesia in a fast-track setup. we measured how far patients could walk under their full weight with crutches, and how much a nurse had to help. we also measured pain using a numerical rating scale (nrs). we looked at function as measured by the range of motion (rom) and the ability to sit on a chair, to walk and to maintain personal hygiene. on top of that, we measured circumferences of patients’ thighs to look at how much swelling there was after surgery. we used the widely used harris hip score (hhs) to compare results before surgery and 4 weeks after surgery. looking at pain scores following surgery showed a constant decrease in the first week (days 1-6 after surgery). the pain scores before surgery were significantly higher than day 6 after surgery, when attempting to walk, at rest, and at night. all patients were able to walk on the day of surgery. in addition, there was a significant improvement in independent activities within the first 6 days following surgery. these activities were sitting on a chair, walking and personal hygiene. there was no significant difference between the thigh circumferences above the knee joint, measured before surgery and on day 6 after surgery. compared to before surgery, there was a significant improvement of the hhs 4 weeks after surgery. in 100% of the cases, the operation was reported to be successful and all of the treated patients would choose a fast-track setup again. in conclusion, application of a fast-track program is effective for function and ability of patients to walk. further, low pain values and fast improvement of walking distance confirms that the fast-track plan immediately after surgery is a success. finally, future studies that follow patients over time have to confirm the results by comparing a conventional and a fast-track plan.",0
"muscle cramps are a common problem represented by sudden, painful, involuntary muscle contractions. these true cramps, coming from nerves outside the brain and spinal cord, may be identifiable from other muscle pains. medical history, physical check-up, and lab screenings help determine different causes of muscle cramps. despite their harmless nature, cramps are uncomfortable for many. experience and limited medical studies guide treatment. quinine sulfate (an antimalarial drug) helps, but its side-effects are problematic. similar drugs may be just as helpful. more studies are needed to better define the effects of muscle cramps and find better medications.",0
"we aimed to find which diagnostic tool (ct, mri, or ultrasound) is more accurate for detection and no detection in diagnosing a hernia (bulging of organs) in the groin area and sub-type (direct or indirect; based on location within the groin). results showed that ultrasound was better than ct and mri in accuracy for detection and no detection in diagnosing a hernia in the groin region. results showed ultrasound and ct were very accurate for detection and no detection in diagnosing type of hernia. we found that ultrasound was the most accurate for detection and no detection. one must remember that the expertise level of the person using the diagnostic tool can determine how well the tool works. based on this review, ultrasound may be the best option when physical exam is uncertain, given that ultrasound is done acceptably at the local level.",0
"using several types of pain treatment at once has become the standard way to care for patients having joint replacement surgery. this is because this approach reduces pain better with fewer side effects than only using opioids. some pain medicines affect the whole body, including nsaids, tylenol®, corticosteroids, and gabapentinoids (such as lyrica or neurontin). these medicines, local anesthetics, and peripheral nerve blocks, are the foundation of the multi-pronged approach for joint replacement surgery. ideally, this multi-pronged approach should start before the operation and continue throughout the time of surgery and beyond discharge. there is not enough evidence to be in favor of the routine use of iv tylenol® or liposomal bupivacaine (a type of local anesthetic) as part of multi-pronged pain treatment approaches.",0
"potassium is the most abundant cation in the intracellular fluid and it plays a vital role in the maintenance of normal cell functions. thus, potassium homeostasis across the cell membrane, is very critical because a tilt in this balance can result in different diseases that could be life threatening. both oxidative stress (os) and potassium imbalance can cause life threatening health conditions. os and abnormalities in potassium channel have been reported in neurodegenerative diseases. this review highlights the major factors involved in potassium homeostasis (dietary, hormonal, genetic, and physiologic influences), and discusses the major diseases and abnormalities associated with potassium imbalance including hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and gordon's syndrome, bartter syndrome, and gitelman syndrome.",1
"objective: the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ma yinglong shexiang hemorrhoids cream combined with pearl powder on pain and complications in patients with severe pressure ulcers. methods: one hundred seventeen patients with severe pressure ulcers hospitalized and treated in our hospital (january 2019--december 2019) were divided into ma yinglong musk hemorrhoid cream group (my group), pearl powder group (pp group), and combination with ma yinglong musk hemorrhoid cream and pearl powder group (mp group), 39 patients in each group. there was no significant difference in the general data of patients in my group, pp group, and mp group. by analyzing the differences in clinical efficacy, secondary effects, scar incidence, pain, and clinical indicators of patients in the my group, pp group, and mp group, the effects of mayinglong shexiang hemorrhoid cream combined with pearl powder in the treatment of pain and complications in patients with severe pressure ulcers were explored. results: after treatment, compared with the my group and the pp group, the mp group had a higher clinical efficacy than the my group and the pp group. compared with my group and pp group, the healing time, dressing change times, and dressing change time of mp group were better than my group (p < .05). after treatment, the vas score and incidence of secondary effects of the mp group was significantly lower than that of the my group and pp group (p < .05). the incidence and area of scar formation in the mp group were lower than those in the my group and the pp group (p < .05). conclusion: compared with ma yinglong musk hemorrhoid cream or pearl powder, combination of ma yinglong musk hemorrhoid cream and pearl powder are more effective in treating severe pressure ulcer patients, and can significantly reduce the pain in the affected area and reduce the occurrence of complications.",1
"researcher studied the range of signs and symptoms to find out the causes of chronic cough. a total of 103 patients with chronic cough for at least 8 weeks and normal chest x-rays were studied from a hospital outpatient clinic in china. the causes of the chronic cough were studied using well established rules and guidelines. the diagnostic tests included: medical history, physical exam, lung function tests, sputum cell counts, esophagus acid test, cat scan of sinuses or chest, and looking into the nose or lungs with the endoscope. the final diagnosis of the cause of chronic cough was made based on all of these tests plus how patients responded to treatment. the results were compared with patients studied before in another city in china. the cause of chronic cough was found in about 95% of patients. about 83% had one cause, about 13% had 2 causes, and about 3% had 3 causes.",0
"postpartum depression (ppd-depression after childbirth) is a common and serious mental health problem. it is associated with maternal suffering and numerous negative consequences for offspring. the first six months after delivery may represent a high-risk time for depression. estimates of occurrence range from 13% to 19%. risk factors mirror those typically found with major depression, except the hormone changes found after childbirth. studies of psychological treatments have proved a variety of individual and group interventions work. medication often leads to depression improvement. but in research studies, there are often no significant differences in outcomes between patients on medication and those not on medication (placebo or active control groups). reviews meet up on recommendations for particular antidepressant medications for use while breastfeeding. prevention of ppd can be done and treatments are effective. there is a growing movement to add mental health screening into routine primary care for pregnant and postpartum women. this screening should be followed-up with treatment or referral and with follow-up care. research and patient recommendations are made throughout this review.",0
"we tested if there are 2 different types of parkinson tremors, or body shakes due to a brain-related disease affecting movement, based on individualized responses to medication altering levels of dopamine, a chemical messenger. we checked if these patterns are tremor-specific by comparing individualized responses of dopamine by tremors to those by bradykinesia (a slowing of movement). we tested responsiveness to levodopa (a parkinson's medication) in 76 patients with parkinson tremors, or shakes by a brain-related disease affecting movement. in 41 patients, a dopamine-sensitivty test was repeated after around 6 months. the dopamine response of resting tremor, but not bradykinesia, was atypical. there were 3 types of tremor dopamine-responsiveness: dopamine-responsive, intermediate, and dopamine-resistant tremor. a levodopa sensitivity test 6 months later matched these tremor response categories. patients with dopamine-responsive tremors had higher disease severity and frequency of impaired movement. parkinson resting tremors has 3 physical trait types, based on dopamine response. these tremor patterns may be linked with unrevealed biological processes and need different treatments.",0
"this article provides an overview of current cardiac device management, complications, and future areas for development. the last 70 years have seen huge advances in the field of implantable cardiac devices, from diagnostic tools to electrical therapies for bradycardia, ventricular arrhythmia and cardiac resynchronisation. while out-of-hours specialist cardiology cover and regional arrhythmia pathways are increasingly established, they are not universal, and the management of arrhythmia remains an important facet of clinical medicine for the general physician. this article discusses core recommendations from international guidelines with respect to heart rhythm diagnostics, pacing for bradycardia, cardiac resynchronisation and implantable cardioverter defibrillators, along with common complications. finally, future innovations such as the diagnostic potential of portable technologies, antibiotic envelopes for cardiac devices and the increasing use of leadless pacemakers are described.",1
"objective: to evaluate management of foreign bodies in the upper gastrointestinal tract. patients and methods: a total of 103 patients with history of foreign body ingestion were included in this study. x-ray neck and rigid oesophagoscopy was carried out in all patients for diagnosis and removal of foreign bodies. a structured questionnaire was designed to record all information. results: dysphagia (92%) and tenderness in neck (60%) were the most common clinical features. majority (89%) patients had come to the hospital within 24 hours. x-ray of the neck (lateral view) was the most useful investigation with presence of air in the esophagus being a significant finding. post-cricoid region was the site of impaction of foreign bodies in 84% of the subjects. the procedure of esophagoscopy was successful in 90 patients (97%) and failed in 3 patients (3%). coins were the most common foreign bodies (60%), followed by meat related foreign bodies (22.5%) and dentures in 5% cases. complications occurred in 18% patients and were more common in adults (37.1%) compared to children (8.8%). the most serious complication was pneumomediastinum. maximum complications occurred with dentures (80%) and bone chips (42%). conclusion: foreign body in the esophagus is a serious condition and early removal by rigid esophagoscopy is recommended which is a safe and effective procedure.",1
"senescent cells, which arise due to damage-associated signals, are apoptosis-resistant and can express a pro-inflammatory, tissue-destructive senescence-associated secretory phenotype (sasp). we recently reported that a component of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) surface protein, s1, can amplify the sasp of senescent cultured human cells and that a related mouse β-coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (mhv), increases sasp factors and senescent cell burden in infected mice. here, we show that sars-cov-2 induces senescence in human non-senescent cells and exacerbates the sasp in human senescent cells through toll-like receptor-3 (tlr-3). tlr-3, which senses viral rna, was increased in human senescent compared to non-senescent cells. notably, genetically or pharmacologically inhibiting tlr-3 prevented senescence induction and sasp amplification by sars-cov-2 or spike pseudotyped virus. while an artificial tlr-3 agonist alone was not sufficient to induce senescence, it amplified the sasp in senescent human cells. consistent with these findings, lung p16ink4a+ senescent cell burden was higher in patients who died from acute sars-cov-2 infection than other causes. our results suggest that induction of cellular senescence and sasp amplification through tlr-3 contribute to sars-cov-2 morbidity, indicating that clinical trials of senolytics and/or sasp/tlr-3 inhibitors for alleviating acute and long-term sars-cov-2 sequelae are warranted.",1
"we experienced a 72-year-old man who developed laboratory-confirmed human coronavirus hku1 pneumonia. pcr testing for sars-cov-2 from a nasopharyngeal specimen was negative twice, and rapid immunochromatographic antibody test (riat) using a commercially available kit for igm and igg against sars-cov-2 showed him turning positive for igg against sars-cov-2. we then performed riat in stored serum samples from other patients who suffered laboratory-confirmed human common cold coronaviruses (n = 6) and viruses other than coronavirus (influenza virus, n = 3; rhinovirus, n = 3; metapneumovirus, n = 1; adenovirus, n = 1) admitted until january 2019. including the present case, four of 7 (57%) showed false-positive riat results due to human common cold coronaviruses infection. two of the 4 patients showed initial negative to subsequent positive riat results, indicating seroconversion. riat was positive for igg and igm in viruses other than coronavirus in 2 (25.0%) and 1 (12.5%) patient. because of high incidence of false positive riat results, cross antigenicity between human common cold coronaviruses and sars-cov-2 can be considered. results of riat should be interpreted in light of epidemics of human common cold coronaviruses infection. prevalence of past sars-cov-2 infection may be overestimated due to high incidence of false-positive riat results.",1
"sickle cell disease (scd) was the first human genetic disorder caused by a mutation in a single gene to be described at the chemical level. scd occurs when a mutation of the beta-hemoglobin gene causes the amino acid, glutamic acid, to be replaced by valine in the beta chain of the hemoglobin protein. the signs and symptoms in scd occur because these sickle hemoglobin (hbs) proteins tend to join together where oxygen levels are lower in the body. this causes the red blood cells to change into the typical abnormal rigid sickle cell shape. these rigid red blood cells cannot pass through the smallest blood vessels well.this causes the vessels to be blocked, resulting in tissue damage and pain.these sickle red blood cells are also destroyed, which causes anemia. patients with the same genetic defect in scd can have many different outcomes, ranging from death in early childhood to a normal life span with few problems. alpha-thalassemia is a genetic disease that can change the outcome of patients with scd. also, patients with increased levels of another type of hemoglobin protein, fetal hemoglobin (hbf), tend to have a milder disease. the presence of fetal hemoglobin decreases the tendency of the sickle hemoglobin to join together in the red blood cells. increased levels of hbf may be due to other mutations in various hemoglobin genes. identifying these mutations in the hemoglobin genes has been very difficult. but researchers have been able to identify two areas on the genes that have major influences on fetal hemoglobin (hbf) levels in adults. a large part of the different hbf levels and number of painful crises in sickle cell disease patients is due to five common mutations in the hemoglobin gene.",0
"severe hypercalcemia, or too high calcium blood levels, is rare in newborns. even though hypercalcemia often shows no symptoms, it may have important effects on overall health. hypophosphatemia is when the body has low levels of phosphorous. hypophosphatemia can occur in infants experiencing malnutrition while in the womb, blood infection, and early high-energy parenteral nutrition (pn). pn is when a mother is given nutrients through iv. hypophosphatemia can cause severe hypercalcemia through an unknown mechanism. it is debated if phosphate (po4) and calcium (ca) should be given in the first week of life in preterm infants. this study reports on a female baby born at 29 weeks' gestation (time in womb). the infant had intrauterine growth retardation (iugr) and long-term severe hypercalcemia due to hypophosphatemia while on phosphorus-free pn. iugr is when a baby does not grow to normal weight during pregnancy. hypercalcemia did not improve after excess water intake but responded to infusion of po4. eventually, the infant experienced symptoms of hypocalcemia. this was likely worsened by infusion of albumin, a blood protein. following this, parathyroid hormone (pth), which controls calcium and phosphorus in the blood, and alkaline phosphatase (alp), which removes phosphate groups, returned to normal levels. severe hypercalcemia is extremely rare in newborns. however, doctors should be aware of the possible occurrence of this life-threatening condition in infants with or at risk to develop hypophosphatemia. hypophosphatemic hypercalcemia can only be managed with infusion of po4, with strict monitoring of ca and po4 concentrations.",0
"lung injuries caused by inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) in the body is a major cause of health problems in several countries. additionally, inflammation is a leading cause for disease and death within intensive care units (icu) in hospitals. the majority of patients of covid-19 (a viral, breathing-related or respiratory disease) have suffered from a condition known as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) that results from inflammation. it is similar to pneumonia (lung infection). infections within the body can trigger the excess release of cytokines. cytokines are proteins that can tell your immune system what to do. sometimes, when we are sick, cytokines stimulate too many immune cells, causing hyperactivation, which in turn causes more cytokines to release more signals. this causes a biological loop known as cytokine release syndrome (crs) that results in ards. currently, there are no medical treatments to prevent crs that is causes by viruses, bacteria, or germs. the goal of this paper was to better understand how a chemical, known as dehydrozingerone (dhz), can protect lung cells from damage caused by lipopolysaccharides (lps). lps are molecules that exist within the cell walls of bacteria and are extremely toxic. this study used two types of studies, in vitro (in cells) and in vivo (in animals), to fully comprehend how dhz can prevent lps-induced lung cell injury. for the in vitro study, cells were treated with dhz before being exposed to lps. this caused a series of inflammatory events to occur within the treated cells. the authors reviewed how dhz protected against lps damage within several different types of cells. they performed several lab tests looking at cells' internal health to better determine the effect dhz had on inflammation and how it was protective. additionally, the authors determined how dhz could prevent disease and protect against lps within rats already sick with ards. within one type of cell, dhz significantly decreased the negative effects caused by lps exposure. similarly, dhz protected lung cells by reducing lps-induced inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. meaning as the amount of dhz given was increased, the symptoms from lps treatment decreased. in the rats treated with dhz, the chemical significantly reduced lps-caused ards. dhz significantly reduced several harmful effects of lps within the rat model, including cell injury and cell death. this study is the first to show that dhz has the ability to protect against ards by decreasing harmful immune responses triggered by lps. this data provides support to develop dhz as a potential human pharmaceutical prescription or drug to protect against ards.",0
"use of tranquilizers on patients has shown the need for long-term treatment of long-term neurotic and pyschotic mental disorders. because antipsychotic drugs like perphenazine are being used to treat long-term mental disorders and there have been rare cases of yellowing of the skin and a decrease in disease-fighting cells in the blood of people who take it, we must figure out whether this drug harms the liver and blood.",0
"to date, nutritional studies have focused on the total intake of dietary fiber rather than intake timing. in this study, we examined the effect of the timing of daily helianthus tuberosus ingestion on postprandial and 24 h glucose levels, as well as on intestinal microbiota in older adults. in total, 37 healthy older adults (age = 74.9 ± 0.8 years) were recruited. the participants were randomly assigned to either a morning group (mg, n = 18) or an evening group (eg, n = 17). the mg and eg groups were instructed to take helianthus tuberosus powder (5 g/day) just before breakfast or dinner, respectively, for 1 week after the 1-week control period. the glucose levels of all participants were monitored using a continuous glucose monitoring system throughout the 2 weeks. the intestinal microbiota was analyzed by sequencing 16s rrna genes from feces before and after the intervention. there were no significant differences in the physical characteristics or energy intake between groups. helianthus tuberosus intake led to decreases in tissue glucose levels throughout the day in both groups (p < 0.01, respectively). as a result of examining the fluctuations in tissue glucose levels up to 4 hours after each meal, significant decreases in the areas under the curves (aucs) were observed for all three meals after intervention, but only in the mg (breakfast: p = 0.012, lunch: p = 0.002, dinner: p = 0.005). on the other hand, in the eg, there was a strong decrease in the auc after dinner, but only slight decreases after breakfast and lunch (breakfast: p = 0.017, lunch: p = 0.427, dinner: p = 0.002). moreover, the rate of change in the peak tissue glucose level at breakfast was significantly decreased in the mg compared to the eg (p = 0.027). a greater decrease was observed in the change in the blood glucose level after the ingestion of helianthus tuberosus in the mg than in the eg. furthermore, the relative abundance of ruminococcus in the mg at the genus level was significantly higher at baseline than in the eg (p = 0.016) and it was also significantly lower after the intervention (p = 0.013). our findings indicate that helianthus tuberosus intake in the morning might have relatively stronger effects on the intestinal microbiota and suppress postprandial glucose levels to a greater extent than when taken in the evening.",1
"purpose of review: the aim of the article is to present the basics of oral levothyroxine (lt4) absorption, reasons why patients may have persistently elevated serum thyroid stimulation hormone (tsh) levels, and alternative strategies for lt4 dosing. recent findings: although oral lt4 tablets are most commonly used for thyroid hormone replacement in patients with hypothyroidism, case studies report that liquid oral lt4, intravenous, intramuscular, and rectal administration of lt4 can successfully treat refractory hypothyroidism. summary: hypothyroidism is one of the most common endocrine disorders encountered by primary care physicians and endocrinologists. lt4 is one of the most widely prescribed medications in the world and it is the standard of care treatment for hypothyroidism. generally, hypothyroid patients will be treated with lt4 tablets to be taken orally, and monitoring will occur with routine serum thyroid tests, including tsh concentrations. however, many patients fail to maintain serum tsh levels in the target range while managed on oral lt4 tablets. a subset of these patients would be considered to have poorly controlled hypothyroidism, sometimes termed refractory hypothyroidism. for these patients, optimization of ingestion routines and alternative formulations and routes of administration of lt4 can be considered, including oral liquid, intravenous, intramuscular, and even rectal formulations.",1
"different types of diets aimed at preventing covid-19 (a viral, breathing-related disease) and a dangerous lung infection called pneumonia are continually being considered. unfortunately, studies in humans have not confirmed any specific foods to be effective in the case of covid-19. the body's immune system is the key to reducing the seriousness of covid-19, and perhaps by modifying the immune system in the right way, we can save human lives with prevention efforts. many clinical studies show that certain parts of food can help stimulate the immune response in patients with various diseases, such as cancer or aids, and in healthy people who are at risk of a viral infection. natural substances found in nature are often seen as important parts in the fight against viruses. many products consumed by people and used in traditional medicine are shown to contain substances with properties described as anti-inflammatories that can relieve pain or swelling, antibacterial to prevent the spread of bacteria, and antiviral to fight viruses. examples include vitamin c from fruits and substances in honey, garlic, onions, ginger, turmeric, and black pepper. however, there is no strong scientific evidence or analyses with a lot data suggesting that herbs, spices, health-promoting food ingredients, or dietary supplements prevent infection of coronavirus. additionally, there is little data that they minimize covid-19 symptoms or can even be used to treat infections, including severe covid pneumonia, sudden lung failure, a cytokine storm (when the body's immune system floods the blood stream with proteins called cytokines), clotting or scabbing disorders, or multiple organ failure.",0
"the current understanding of on is that it causes neuropathic pain in the distribution of the greater occipital nerve, the lesser occipital nerve, the third occipital nerve or a combination of the 3. it is currently a subset of headaches although there is some debate if on should be its own condition. occipital neuralgia causes chronic, sharp, stabbing pain in the upper neck, back of the head, and behind the ears that can radiate to the front of the head. diagnosis is typically clinical and patients present with intermittent, painful episodes associated with the occipital region and the nerves described above. most cases are unilateral pain, however bilateral pain can be present and the pain can radiate to the frontal region and face. physical examination is the first step in management of this disease and patients may demonstrate tenderness over the greater occipital and lesser occipital nerves. anesthetics like 1% to 2% lidocaine or 0.25% to 0.5% bupivacaine can be used to block these nerves and anti-inflammatory drugs like corticosteroids can be used in combination to prevent compressive symptoms. other treatments like botulinum toxin and radiofrequency ablation have shown promise and require more research. surgical decompression through resection of the obliquus capitis inferior is the definitive treatment however there are significant risks associated with this procedure.",1
"trigeminal neuralgia is caused by compression of trigeminal nerve root and it leads to demyelination gradually. it was almost idiopathic and occurred unexpected. the upper cervical spinal cord contains the spinal trigeminal tract and nucleus. fibers with cell bodies in the trigeminal ganglion enter in the upper pons and descend caudally to c2 level. we experienced a rare patient with facial pain, which was paroxysmal attack with severe pain after a clear event, cervical spinal injury (c2). so, this case reminds us of a possible cause of trigeminal neuralgia after a trauma of the head and neck.",1
"rheumatoid arthritis is a disease where the immune system attacks healthy cells in the body by mistake. it can cause pain, decrease movement, lead to poor quality of life, impact the social and economic parts of communities, and cost over $56 billion in the united states every year. acupuncture involves pricking the skin or tissues with thin needles at key points in the body to reduce pain and is widely used. however, studies show problems in the methods used to measure acupuncture. the aim of this current study is to evaluate the safety and the performance of acupuncture treatments on rheumatoid arthritis. in this study, 105 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and a specific diagnosis were randomly assigned to either the acupuncture group, the sham acupuncture group (where the patient is pricked with thin needles but at different, less key points of the body), or a waiting list group. each group had 35 patients. the acupuncture groups (both normal and sham) experienced the exact same number, depth, and stimulation of needles. a physical and visual exam of patients took place before and 5 minutes after acupuncture treatment with follow-up visits over 4 weeks. patients in the acupuncture group showed signficantly improved pain and pain sensitivity, hand grip and arm strength, as well as improved health status. quality of life significantly improved in 7 out of 8 parts of a survey. the number of swollen joints and tender joints signficantly decreased. in the sham acupuncture group (the group that received needle pricks but outside the key points of the body) did not have any significant changes in their condition except in pain improvement. the waiting list group showed an overall worsening. this is the first double-blind controlled study (where neither the patients nor the researcher knows which treatment participants are getting) on acupuncture for rheumatoid arthritis of the hand. the study shows positive effects supporting acupuncture's inclusion in other treatments for rheumatology (diseases in the joints, muscles, tendons, ligaments). the site of the acupuncture needle is very important to determine acupuncture effectiveness. because the authors in this study clearly defined the placement of the acupuncture needles on the body, they reduced possible bias, showed how the placement of the needles affects the body, improved performance of acupuncture, and identified evidence to support use of acupuncture.",0
"gabapentin is a new drug to treat seizures that appears to work well for patients. it is absorbed into the body by an active and fluid-filled transport system, and is able to be distributed to tissues in the body. gabapentin is not attached to proteins in the blood, does not create liver enzymes that can speed up chemical reactions in the body, and is not broken down. when the amount of the drug in the body is the same amount that is being cleared, the time it takes for the concentration of the gabapentin in the plasma or body to be reduced by half is 6-8 hours and is eliminated through the kidneys. gabapentin does not have any major interactions with other drugs when given with other standard drugs that treat seizures or with oral (by mouth) birth control. in 3 clinical studies, gabapentin used as an add-on anti-seizure drug to assist the main treatment reduces the frequency of partial seizures (impacting half the brain) and seizures (impacting both halves of the brain). the medicine is handled well by patients, with drowsiness and dizziness being the most common side effects. although the exact process of how gabapentin can lead to an effect is not fully understood, there is strong evidence that suggests a new process in the body. gabapentin is a unique and promising drug that could improve the quality of life of patients with epilepsy (seizure disorders) and is a welcome addition to currently available drugs for the treatment of patients with seizures that start in one part of the brain.",0
"bedsores are areas of injury to the skin or underlying tissue, or both, found in a certain part of the body. doctors often use dressings to treat bedsores and promote healing, and there are many options to choose from. doctors have also used medications applied to the skin instead of dressings to promote healing. a clear and current summary of the scientific data is needed to help make decisions about the use of dressings or medicines applied to the skin to treat bedsores. this review would ideally help people with bedsores and doctors decide the best treatment options. this review compares multiple studies to measure the likelihood of complete ulcer (bedsore) healing based on different dressings and medicines applied to the skin. we included 51 studies (2947 people) in this review and compared treatments based on the likelihood of complete healing. we compared 21 different treatments (13 dressings, 6 medicines applied to the skin and 2 mixed treatments) and looked at 39 studies in 2127 people, 783 of whom had completely healed wounds. we thought the data were limited, with relatively few participants, with few wounds, both for the number of treatments and the number of mixed treatments, and mostly small or very small studies. we thought that most of the data were low or very low quality due to unclear data combined with high likelihood of misleading results. we are not sure our ranking of interventions (treatments) is correct, but we summarize our results to compare treatments to saline gauze often used to as a wound dressing. we report only results from data we did not think was low quality, but these reported results should be considered keeping in mind the overall low certainty of data used. we are not sure whether protease-modulating (protein-altering) dressings increased the likelihood of bedsore healing compared to saline gauze. for every 1000 people, 102 more people healed with protease modulating dressings than people treated with only saline gauze. we are not sure collagenase (enzyme) ointment, foam dressings, basic wound contact dressings, and polyvinylpyrrolidone (water-soluble biological molecule) plus zinc oxide increased the likelihood of bedsore healing compared to saline gauze. we conclude that comparing data from 39 studies (rating 21 dressings and medicines applied to the skin for bedsores) is limited and the data are not reliable (due to unclear data and high likelihood of misleading results). therefore, we cannot tell which dressings or medicines applied to the skin are the most likely to heal bedsores nor whether the treatments we looked at work better than saline gauze. more research is needed to find out whether certain dressings or medicines applied to the skin improve the likelihood of bedsore healing. our study does not help decide which treatments might best be part of a large trial, and studies may need to focus on prevention, leaving doctors to decide which treatment to use based on wound symptoms, professional experience, what the patients want and cost.",0
"tardive dyskinesia (td) is a condition that includes a wide range of uncontrollable movement disorders caused by taking antipsychotics. td may cause physical and emotional pain or suffering that negatively affects quality of life. the total number of td cases in patients who have taken antipsychotics at a given time continues to be high due to frequent, often unnecessary, antipsychotic use. sensible use of antipsychotics is needed to prevent, reduce disability and death associated with, and end td for good. vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (vmat2) inhibitors, drugs that reduce dopamine (a chemical messenger released when your brain is expecting a reward), are the best treatment for td.",0
"how much caloric restriction (reducing the amount of calories consumed) will improve glycemic status (blood sugar levels) but increase ketone bodies (substances that the body makes if the cells don't get enough blood sugar) in gestational diabetic women (women diagnosed with diabetes for the first time during pregnancy) has received little attention. data are presented on two studies that monitor and control diets to investigate these questions. in the first study, a diet of 2,400 calories per day is provided to 12 gestational diabetic women for 1 week. in the second week, patients were randomly assigned to either continue the 2,400 calories per day diet or to a 1,200 calories per day diet. the average glucose (blood sugar) levels remained unchanged in the 2,400 calorie diet group but declined in the lower calorie group that had a 1,200 calories per day diet. after fasting (no food) for 9 hours overnight, insulin (a hormone in the body that allows cells in the muscles, fat, and liver to absorb sugar that is in the blood) also declined, but oral glucose tolerance (a test that measures how the body moves sugar from blood to the tissues) did not improve with the reduced calories diet. beta-hydroxybutyrate (a chemical in the body that provides energy when not enough carbohydrates or sugars have been eaten) increased in the reduced calorie group, along with an increase in ketonuria, high amounts of ketones (substances that your body makes if your cells don't get enough blood sugar) in the urine, but not in the comparison group that had the 2,400 calorie diet. a second study compared the impact of a calorie-restricted diet reduced by 33% or insulin to a full-calorie diet in a similar 2 week experiment. the study measured liver production of sugar and insulin sensitivity with labeled glucose before and during an insulin clamp (used to maintain glucose levels). diet in 3 patients improved fasting and average glucose levels. prophylactic insulin (insulin administered to the patient) in 3 people also produced smaller reductions. on average, ketonuria after a 9 hour fast declined in the same amount with both treatments. liver glucose production and insulin sensitivity were not significantly changed by gestational diabetes or the treatments compared to normal weight or obese pregnant women who did not have diabetes. in conclusion, reducing calories by half improves blood sugar levels in obese women with gestational diabetes but is connected with an increase in high amounts of ketones in the urine, which is of uncertain significance. reducing calories by 33% (to 1,600 - 1,800 calories daily) may be better in diet management of obese women with gestational diabetes mellitus and more effective than prophylactic insulin. more studies are required to confirm these results.",0
"patients with major depressive disorder remain at risk for relapse following remission and often continue to experience subthreshold symptoms. this study examined whether depressed patients who had recovered and then relapsed on fluoxetine 20 mg/day would benefit from an increase in fluoxetine dose. a total of 132 outpatients with major depressive disorder who achieved remission with 8 weeks of treatment with fluoxetine 20 mg had the dose increased to 40 mg. they were randomized to receive cognitive therapy or medication management alone and were followed for up to 28 weeks for depressive relapse and change in depressive symptoms. a total of 47 (35.6%) out of 132 patients did not complete the 28-week continuation phase. rates of discontinuation or relapse did not differ significantly between the groups. change in residual symptoms or wellbeing as measured by hamilton depression scale score or symptom questionnaire self-report also did not differ between groups. in this sample of outpatients in continuation phase treatment for major depressive disorder, the combination of cognitive therapy and fluoxetine 40 mg failed to yield any significant benefit in symptoms or relapse rates over fluoxetine 40 mg alone during 28 weeks of follow-up.",1
"current guidelines disagree or do not exist for how long to wait between checks and treatment check-ins involving the use of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (dxa) scans, a technique used by doctors to measure a patient's risk of osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become weak and brittle). a campaign to avoid unnecessary medical tests, treatments and procedures does not suggest dxa scans within 2 years of the first test. how often and for which patient characteristics doctors order repeat scans is unclear. we aim to estimate the number of people at risk who develop osteoporosis over a period and predictors of repeat dxa for checks and treatment check-ins in a healthcare facility. we studied 5992 women aged 40-84 years who underwent dxa scans to check for osteoporosis from 2006 to 2011 at a healthcare facility in sacramento, ca. main test scores included two- and five-year amounts and risks of repeat dxa by initial test results (classified into three groups: low or high risk of worsening to osteoporosis, or osteoporosis) and whether women were given osteoporosis drugs after the first dxa. for women not treated after a first dxa, 2-year amounts for low-risk, high-risk, and osteoporotic women were 8.0%, 13.8%, and 19.6%, respectively, increasing to 42.9%, 60.4%, and 57.4% by 5 years after the first screening. for treated women, average time to repeat dxa was over 3 years for all groups. compared to women with low-risk initial dxa, high-risk initial dxa significantly led to repeat screening for untreated women but not within the treated group. conclusions: repeat dxa screening was common in women both at low and high risk of worsening to osteoporosis, with a large amount of women receiving repeat scans within 2 years of initial screening. on the other hand, only 60% of those at high-risk of worsening or progression to osteoporosis were re-screened within 5 years. treatments are needed to help clinicians make better decisions regarding repeat use of dxa scans.",0
"hypophosphatasia (hpp) is a genetic condition that blocks metabolic pathways. hpp features low serum (blood) alkaline phosphatase (alp - a protein which indicates bone health) activity (hypophosphatasemia). this is caused by mutation(s) of the gene that encodes the tissue-nonspecific isoenzyme (form) of alp (tnsalp). this mutation renders the gene unable to complete it function. variations in the type of mutations largely explains hpp's remarkably broad-ranging severity. tnsalp is an enzyme expressed in the skeleton, liver, kidney, and developing teeth. in hpp, tnsalp substrates (proteins altered by tnsalp) accumulate outside of cells. one substrate is inorganic pyrophosphate (ppi), a potent inhibitor (blocker) of mineralization. superabundance of extracellular ppi explains the hard tissue complications of hpp. these complications include premature loss of deciduous teeth, rickets or bone softening, and joint swelling in some affected adults. in infants with severe hpp, blocked entry of minerals into the skeleton can cause hypercalcemia (high calcium levels). additionally, insufficient breakdown of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (plp), the major circulating form of vitamin b6, can cause seizures. elevated circulating plp is a sensitive and specific biological marker, or a measurable compound in the body that can indicate health status, for hpp. also, the tnsalp substrate phosphoethanolamine (pea) is usually elevated in serum and urine in hpp. however, this biological marker is less reliable for diagnosis. disease-specific changes occur in pediatric (child) hpp when the skeletal disease is severe. tnsalp mutation analysis is needed to determine recurrence (reappearance) for hpp in future pregnancies and for prenatal (at or before birth) diagnosis. hpp was the last bone condition to have a medical treatment. now, significant successes using asfotase alfa, a prescription drug, are published concerning severely affected newborns, infants, and children. asfotase alfa was approved by regulatory agencies around the world in 2015 typically for pediatric-onset hpp.",0
"objects that shouldn't be in the ear, nose, and throat are sometimes seen by family doctors, usually in children. the most common objects are food, plastic toys, and small household items. diagnosis is often late because the event that caused the object to get stuck wasn't seen, the symptoms are vague, and people often are diagnosed incorrectly at first. most objects stuck in the ear and nose can be removed by a skilled doctor in the office with low risk of other problems. common methods to remove the object include the use of forceps, flushing with water, and using a long, flexible suction tube. objects stuck in the throat or windpipe are emergencies and considered for surgery. x-rays are often normal. flexible or stiff tubes with cameras are usually needed to make sure the diagnosis is correct and to remove the object. doctors need to have a good reason to think there might be an object stuck in children with unexplained upper airway symptoms. it is important to understand the body’s structure and reasons to refer to a subspecialist. the available information is not enough to make strong recommendations for specific ways to remove objects.",0
"increased amounts of β-amyloid (aβ1-42) and tau, biological proteins, are considered risk factors for alzheimer's disease in healthy, older adults. we tested the effect of aging and aβ1-42 and tau amounts in brain and spine fluid on 1) energy molecules in the front of the brain and 2) reasoning skills in 144 older adults. levels of specific chemical signal molecules (gaba+) and sugars (mi/tcr) in the brain were linked to age. levels of the gaba+ trended with reasoning skills better than mi/tcr. we found that levels of a specific chemical molecule were linked to levels of t-tau. in normal older adults, the specific chemical signal molecule gaba+ decreased with age while the chemical sugar mi/tcr increased with age. age- and biomarker-related changes in brain molecules are not only located in the back of the brain as other studies show and that using a radio-wave tool can help study aging and biomarkers linked with aging diseases and alzheimer's.",0
"the aim of this study was to investigate the terms used to refer to cognitive (memory-related) and fatigue related side effects. additionally, the study aimed to understand the terms' prevalence or frequency in phase iii add-on clinical trials of anti-epileptic - or antiseizure - drugs (aeds). the authors extracted data from publicly available food and drug administration of the united states (fda) documents as well as the published literature. target drug doses were then calculated as drug loads and divided into three categories (low, average, high). odds ratio, or the measure of association between drug intake and side effect development, were calculated for each drug load. the presence of a dose-response effect, or when side effects increase when drug dose increases, was also assessed (measured). the authors found that the cognitive terms used across trials were very variable (all over the place). data on discontinuation rates (stoppings in side effects) were limited. placebo (harmless pills) rates for cognitive side effects ranged from 0 to 10.6% while those for fatigue ranged from 2.5 to 37.7%. most of the aeds exhibited a clear dose-response effect and significant odds ratios for developing side effects at high doses. due to their clinical (medical) relevance and impact on quality of life, new trials should make data related to the prevalence and discontinuation rates of these side effects publicly available. due to the clear dose response effect, doctors should consider using lower drug loads and adjusting doses to improve tolerability (or ability to take the drug).",0
"the world health organization declared the novel coronavirus, named as sars-cov-2, as a global pandemic in early 2020 after the disease spread to more than 180 countries leading to tens of thousands of cases and many deaths within a couple of months. consequently, this paper aims to summarize the evidence for the relationships between nutrition and the boosting of the immune system in the fight against the disease caused by sars-cov-2. this review, in particular, assesses the impact of vitamin and mineral supplements on the body's defence mechanisms against sars-cov-2. the results revealed that there is a strong relationship between the ingestion of biological ingredients like vitamins c-e, and minerals such as zinc, and a reduction in the effects of coronavirus infection. these can be received from either nutrition rich food sources or from vitamin supplements. furthermore, these macromolecules might have roles to play in boosting the immune response, in the healing process and the recovery time. hence, we recommend that eating healthy foods rich in vitamins c-e with zinc and flavonoids could boost the immune system and consequently protect the body from serious infections.",1
"hair loss and thinning are possible side effects in those undergoing hormonal therapies with aromatase inhibitors (drugs commonly used to treat breast cancer). alopecia (hair loss and thinning) in young patients undergoing hormonal therapy has not been previously studied. we describe two adolescents, 14 and 16 years of age, who got androgenetic alopecia (common hair loss or thinning) after receiving treatment with anastrozole (a durg usually used to treat breast cancer) for unusally short height. therefore, the possible side effect of alopecia should be considered in the young population undergoing treatment with aromatase inhibitors.",0
"background: this study aimed to measure the association of various h1-antihistamines (h1a) with torsade de pointes (tdp), and present a comprehensive overview of h1a-induced tdp cases reported to the food and drug administration adverse event reporting system (faers). methods: all h1a-induced tdp cases (n = 406) were retrieved from the faers database using the preferred term 'torsade de pointes' of meddra version-22 from 1990 to 2019. four data-mining algorithms were used for disproportionality analysis: reporting odds ratio (ror); proportional reporting ratio (prr), empirical bayes geometric mean (ebgm), and information content (ic). h1a with >3 tdp cases were included. results: a total of 12 signals (astemizole, cetirizine, chlorpheniramine, clemastine, desloratadine, diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, loratadine, meclizine, promethazine, terfenadine, and trimeprazine) were identified including six new signals (cetirizine, chlorpheniramine, clemastine, desloratadine, loratadine, and meclizine). the number of risk factors (p = 0.031) and concomitant qt-prolonging drugs (p = <0.001) were significantly lower among new signals vs old signals. moreover, new signals were strongly associated with qt-prolongation, cardiac reactions, and electrolyte abnormalities as compared with old signals. conclusions: our study found the increased torsadogenic potential of new signals compared with previously known old signals, hence necessitating clinical studies to determine the actual torsadogenic potential of newly identified signals.",1
"post-partum depression (depression after childbirth) is a serious mood disorder in women that might be triggered by changes in reproductive hormones during the period of time around pregnancy. this research study examined the drug, brexanolone (formerly sage-547 injection). brexanolone is a naturally occurring reproductive steroid hormone that affects receptors in the brain and nervous system. it is used as an iv medicine for the treatment of post-partum depression. researchers studied female inpatients who gave birth within 6 months of the study with severe post-partum depression (in four hospitals in the usa. the severity of depression was checked by the questionnaire-hamilton rating scale for depression [ham-d]. eligible women received either one, continuous iv dose of brexanolone for 60 hours or a placebo (a procedure that appears like the real treatment but has no treatment value). the women were chosen at random by a computer program to receive the real treatment or the placebo. both patients and researchers did not know who received the real treatment and who received the placebo. the most important outcome was the change in the ham-d score between the start of the study and at 60 hours . patients were followed up until for 30 days. this study (trial) is registered with clinicaltrials.gov, number nct02614547. this trial was done between dec 15, 2015 (first enrolment), and may 19, 2016 (final visit of the last enrolled patient). 21 women were randomly assigned to the brexanolone (10 women) and placebo (11 women) groups. at 60 hours, the average decrease in the depression score by the ham-d questionnaire was 21 points in the brexanolone group (compared to the score at the start of the study). in the placebo group, the ham-d score only decreased by an average of 8.8 points. no deaths, serious adverse (harmful) events, or stopping of the procedures because of adverse events were reported in either group. four of ten patients in the brexanolone group had adverse events compared with eight of 11 in the placebo group. the most frequently reported adverse events in the brexanolone group were dizziness (two patients in the brexanolone group vs three patients in the placebo group) and sleepiness (two vs none). other adverse events reported in two patients in the brexanolone group were fast heart rate and sleepiness. two patients in the placebo group had adverse events; pain at the iv site and tension headache. one patient in the placebo group had a severe treatment adverse event (insomnia). in women with severe post-partum depression, brexanolone iv resulted in a significant and clinically meaningful reduction in ham-d total score of depression, compared with placebo. our results support the reasons for focusing on gabaa receptors in order to development therapies for patients with post-partum depression. a major clinical program for the study of brexanolone in patients with post-partum depression is in progress.",0
"renal (kidney-related) secretion or release plays a key role in maintaining potassium homeostasis (processes used by the body to maintain a normal potassium concentration in the fluid outside the cells). renal release of potassium mainly takes place within the kidneys through as series of tubes and ducts. potassium is absorbed through the potassium channel that is located at the base or sides of the cell called the basolateral and is released into a tube called the lumen through potassium channels. recent studies have suggested that potassium channels 4.1 (kir4.1 or kcnj10) located within the kidney at the distal convoluted tubule (dct) (which connects to the duct system in the kidneys and helps with salt and water reabsorption) may play a role in regulating the release of potassium by targeting the nacl cotransporter (ncc) (the carrier protein that helps reabsorb sodium and chloride ions from tube fluid into the cells). this review summarizes recent progress on the role of the potassium channel kir4.1 in the control of ncc and potassium secretion (release). recent findings show that kir4.1 is activated in the basolateral membrane (the thin layer surrounding a cell located at the base or sides of the cell) of the distal convoluted tubule (dct). kir4.1 plays a major role in helping the basolateral pass potassium through the cell and in helping cell membranes have a negative charge. kir4.1 also activates proteins that send signals to other cells which in turn activate kir4.1 activity in the dct. kir4.1 depolarizes (changes the internal charge to make the cell less negative) the membrane of the distal convoluted tubule (dct), slows down other proteins that regulate cell activity, and suppresses nacl cotransporter activity. additionally, the decrease in function of kir4.1 increases activity of the epithelial na channel (the lining of the outer part of the kidney tubule) in the ducts and potassium release through urine. finally, mice with low kir4.1 activity in the dct are hypomagnesemia (have a low level of the magnesium mineral in the blood) and hypokalemia (have low levels of potassium). in summary, recent progress in exploring the control and function of kir4.1 in the distal convoluted tubule suggests that kir4.1 has an important role in starting the regulation of releasing potassium in the kidneys by targeting nacl cotransporter and may be a potassium sensor in the kidney.",0
"in patients with von hippel-lindau (vhl) disease, renal cysts and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccrcc) arise from renal tubular epithelial cells containing biallelic inactivation of the vhl tumour suppressor gene. however, it is presumed that formation of renal cysts and their conversion to ccrcc involve additional genetic changes at other loci. here, we show that cystic lesions in the kidneys of patients with vhl disease also demonstrate activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (pi3k) pathway. strikingly, combined conditional inactivation of vhlh and the pten tumour suppressor gene, which normally antagonises pi3k signalling, in the mouse kidney, elicits cyst formation after short latency, whereas inactivation of either tumour suppressor gene alone failed to produce such a phenotype. interestingly, cells lining these cysts frequently lack a primary cilium, a microtubule-based cellular antenna important for suppression of uncontrolled kidney epithelial cell proliferation and cyst formation. our results support a model in which the pten tumour suppressor protein cooperates with pvhl to suppress cyst development in the kidney.",1
"objective: this study was designed to explore the clinical application of video laryngoscopy in the diagnosis and treatment of throat foreign bodies (fbs). method: in total, 1572 patients diagnosed with throat fbs at the department of otolaryngology of nanjing drum tower hospital were retrospectively analysed. the covariables collected were the time from fb ingestion to admission, age, sex, duration of admission, and site of impaction. result: the most common fbs were fish bones, which accounted for 1446 (91.98%) of 1572 fbs. among all 1572 fbs, 1004 (63.87%) were successfully removed by video laryngoscopy without complications. a shorter duration of admission was associated with a higher diagnostic rate under video laryngoscopy. the diagnostic rate of sharp fbs was significantly higher than that of non-sharp fbs. the most common sites of throat fbs were the tongue root (42.29%), epiglottic vallecula (19.40%), tonsil (18.21%), and piriform fossa (10.65%). conclusion: video laryngoscopy is a powerful tool for the diagnosis and treatment of throat fbs, allowing for identification of rare locations of fbs as well as refractory fbs.",1
"background: covid-19 is an ongoing public health pandemic regardless of the countless efforts made by various actors. quality diagnostic tests are important for early detection and control. notably, several commercially available one step rt-pcr based assays have been recommended by the who. yet, their analytic and diagnostic performances have not been well documented in resource-limited settings. hence, this study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic sensitivities and specificities of three commercially available one step reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) assays in ethiopia in clinical setting. methods: a cross-sectional study was conducted from april to june, 2021 on 279 respiratory swabs originating from community surveillance, contact cases and suspect cases. rna was extracted using manual extraction method. master-mix preparation, amplification and result interpretation was done as per the respective manufacturer. agreements between rt-pcrs were analyzed using kappa values. bayesian latent class models (blcm) were fitted to obtain reliable estimates of diagnostic sensitivities, specificities of the three assays and prevalence in the absence of a true gold standard. results: among the 279 respiratory samples, 50(18%), 59(21.2%), and 69(24.7%) were tested positive by tib, da an, and bgi assays, respectively. moderate to substantial level of agreement was reported among the three assays with kappa value between 0 .55 and 0.72. based on the blcm relatively high specificities (95% ci) of 0.991(0.973-1.000), 0.961(0.930-0.991) and 0.916(0.875-0.952) and considerably lower sensitivities with 0.813(0.658-0.938), 0.836(0.712-0.940) and 0.810(0.687-0.920) for tib molbiol, da an and bgi respectively were found. conclusions: while all the three rt-pcr assays displayed comparable sensitivities, the specificities of tib molbiol and da an were considerably higher than bgi. these results help adjust the apparent prevalence determined by the three rt-pcrs and thus support public health decisions in resource limited settings and consider alternatives as per their prioritization matrix.",1
"the covid-19 (a breathing-related, viral disease) pandemic is a global crisis, with devastating health, business and social impacts. vaccination is a safe, simple, and effective way of protecting a person against covid-19. by the end of august 2021, only 24.6% of the world population has received two doses of a covid-19 vaccine. several covid-19 vaccines have been developed and approved for emergency use, which is when medicines not yet approved are allowed to be used. current vaccines are shown to be effective with a low risk of unexpected serious side effects, also called adverse effects. however, covid-19 vaccines are related to a relatively small number of cases of heart inflammation that can cause damage to the heart muscle via redness and swelling from an infection, anaphylaxis (severe allergic reactions that may be life-threatening), and blood clot formation. on the other hand, covid-19 vaccination is not recommended for children less than 12 years of age. also, it is proposed that some new variants (e.g., lambda and delta) are able to escape the immune response from vaccinations. this paper presents current considerations on the covid-19 vaccines including: effectiveness against new variants, challenges in distribution of the vaccines, differences in availability to groups, differences in doses by gender and race, how to transport and store the vaccines, and limitations in children and pregnant women. long-time monitoring is key in order to find vaccine effectiveness and to rule out related side effects.",0
"the term ""shock"" refers to a life-threatening blood-flow-related failure caused by an imbalance between supply and demand of oxygen for cells. hypovolemic shock is due to a reduced amount of blood in vessels and subsequently reduced amount of blood and oxygen to pump. the body compensates for the loss of volume by increasing blood volume per pump, heart rate, oxygen extraction rate, and increasing the amount of a specific molecule that increases oxygen release. hypovolemic shock from blood loss impairs blood circulation and affects many organs (e.g., kidneys, hormonal system, and blood vessel tubing). for futher identification of shock due to bleeding, vital functions, blood clotting or thickening tests and procedures assessing blood cell development are used. every hospital should have a specific guideline for massive transfusions or transfers. the personalized full-body treatment of bleeding includes maintaing a proper balance in the body and administering blood substances and factors for blood clotting.",0
"autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is a common inherited renal disorder that results from mutations in either pkd1 or pkd2, encoding polycystin-1 (pc1) and polycystin-2 (pc2), respectively. downregulation or overexpression of pkd1 or pkd2 in mouse models results in renal cyst formation, suggesting that the quantity of pc1 and pc2 needs to be maintained within a tight functional window to prevent cystogenesis. here we show that enhanced pc2 expression is a common feature of pkd1 mutant tissues, in part due to an increase in pkd2 mrna. however, our data also suggest that more effective protein folding contributes to the augmented levels of pc2. we demonstrate that the unfolded protein response is activated in pkd1 knockout kidneys and in pkd1 mutant cells and that this is coupled with increased levels of grp94, an endoplasmic reticulum protein that is a member of the hsp90 family of chaperones. grp94 was found to physically interact with pc2 and depletion or chemical inhibition of grp94 led to a decrease in pc2, suggesting that grp94 serves as its chaperone. moreover, grp94 is acetylated and binds to histone deacetylase 6 (hdac6), a known deacetylase and activator of hsp90 proteins. inhibition of hdac6 decreased pc2 suggesting that hdac6 and grp94 work together to regulate pc2 levels. lastly, we showed that inhibition of grp94 prevents camp-induced cyst formation in vitro. taken together our data uncovered a novel hdac6-grp94-related axis that likely participates in maintaining elevated pc2 levels in pkd1 mutant cells.",1
"osteoporosis, a condition in which bones become weak and brittle, and the increase in the risk of bone breaks it causes has worried women who have gone through menopause (a point in time 12 months after the last period) and older men and could become a huge problem. the best way to diagnose osteoporosis is bone densitometry, a common test to measure bone density. large-scale checks may not be possible due to economic issues or availability of densitometry. we aimed to make and test a scoring system to help doctors find which women are more likely to develop osteoporosis and should have more testing with bone densitometry. we looked at records for 1522 women who have gone through menopause over 50 years old who had dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (dxa - a common test for bone density). we compared risk scores to bone density tests. we measured bmd at the hip and lower spine. we excluded people who were previously diagnosed with osteoporosis or were taking drugs affecting bones. we came up with a simple calculation based on age, weight, history of previous falls from a standing height or lower, early menopause, and use of a certain kind of steroid. testing of this five-item osteoporosis prescreening risk assessment (opera) shows high accuracy for osteoporosis detection. opera shows high accuracy for no detection. the accuracy for results detecting osteoporosis ranged from 29 at the femoral neck to 39.2% at the lumbar spine, while the corresponding accuracy for results not detecting osteoporosis reached 96.5 and 96.2%, respectively. we conclude that the opera is a free and effective way to identify italian women who have gone through menopause at higher risk of osteoporosis. use of opera could help the appropriate and more cost-effective use of bone densitometry in developing countries.",0
"chronic cough is often attributed to reflux, postnasal drip, or asthma. we present 28 patients who had chronic cough or throat-clearing as a manifestation of sensory neuropathy involving the superior or recurrent laryngeal nerve. they had been identified as having sudden-onset cough, laryngospasm, or throat-clearing after viral illness, surgery, or an unknown trigger. cough and laryngospasm were the most common complaints. seventy-one percent of the patients had concomitant superior laryngeal nerve or recurrent laryngeal nerve motor neuropathy documented by laryngeal electromyography or videostroboscopy. after a negative workup for reflux, asthma, or postnasal drip, these patients were treated with gabapentin at 100 to 900 mg/d. symptomatic relief was achieved in 68% of the patients. sensory neuropathy of the recurrent laryngeal nerve or superior laryngeal nerve should be considered in the workup for chronic cough or larynx irritability. symptomatic management of patients with cough and laryngospasm due to a suspected sensory neuropathy may include the use of antiseizure medications such as gabapentin.",1
"antidepressants are medications used to treat depression and other disorders and can improve mood, sleep quality, and concentration. although several studies have examined how well antidepressants work long-term, there is little attention on how to manage relapses (the worsening of a medical condition that had previously improved) or recurrences (when symptoms return months or years after a person has recovered from the last episode) during continued use of antidepressant drugs. this study examined whether depressed patients who had recovered and then relapsed on fluoxetine (a type of antidepressant also called prozac) at 20 mg/day will benefit from an increase dose of fluoxetine. in this study, 18 patients who relapsed on fluoxetine 20 mg/day during long-term treatment with fluoxetine as part of a larger study had their fluoxetine dose raised to 40 mg/day and were followed for at least 1 month. twelve (67%) were full responders (patients who reached the expected improvement), 3 (17%) partial responders (patients who reached only part of the expected improvement), and 3 (17%) dropped out of the study because of side effects (e.g. insomnia and agitation). of those 15 patients who had either full or partial response, 3 complete responders had a recurrence on 40 mg/day after an average of 5.8 months and 1 partial responder had a recurrence 11 months later. overall, 11 (61%) of 18 patients still reacted to the drug during their follow-up while taking the higher dose of fluoxetine. in conclusion, an increase in dose of fluoxetine to 40 mg/day appears to be an effective way to help treat relapse among people with depression who had initially responded to fluoxetine at 20 mg/day.",0
"the ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) and its variants has posed a serious global public health emergency. therapeutic interventions or vaccines are urgently needed to treat and prevent the further dissemination of this contagious virus. this study described the identification of neutralizing receptor-binding domain (rbd)-specific antibodies from mice through vaccination with a recombinant sars-cov-2 rbd. rbd-targeted monoclonal antibodies (mabs) with distinct function and epitope recognition were selected to understand sars-cov-2 neutralization. high-affinity rbd-specific antibodies exhibited high potency in neutralizing both live and pseudotype sars-cov-2 viruses and the sars-cov-2 pseudovirus particle containing the spike protein s-rbdv367f mutant (sars-cov-2(v367f)). these results demonstrated that these antibodies recognize four distinct groups (i-iv) of epitopes on the rbd and that mabs targeting group i epitope can be used in combination with mabs recognizing groups ii and/or iv epitope to make mab cocktails against sars-cov-2 and its mutants. moreover, structural characterization reveals that groups i, iii, and iv epitopes are closely located to an rbd hotspot. the identification of rbd-specific antibodies and cocktails may provide an effective therapeutic and prophylactic intervention against sars-cov-2 and its isolates.",1
"achondroplasia is a human bone genetic disorder of the growth plate and is the most common form of inherited disproportionate short stature. it is inherited as an autosomal dominant disease with essentially complete penetrance. of these most have the same point mutation in the gene for fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3) which is a negative regulator of bone growth. the clinical and radiological features of achondroplasia can easily be identified; they include disproportionate short stature with rhizomelic shortening, macrocephaly with frontal bossing, midface hypoplasia, lumbar hyperlordosis, and a trident hand configuration. the majority of achondroplasts have a normal intelligence, but many social and medical complications may compromise a full and productive life. some of them have serious health consequences related to fluid build up in the brain, head and neck region shortening, or blockage in the upper breathing passage.. in this article, we discuss a number of treatments from the surgical limb lengthening approach and the recombinant growth hormone (rhgh) treatment, to future treatments, which include the natriuretic peptide c-type (cnp). the discussion is a comparative study of the complications and drawbacks of various experiments using numerous strategies.",1
"background: pregabalin has shown opioid sparing and analgesic effects in the early postoperative period; however, perioperative effects on cognition have not been studied. a randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled investigation in 80 donor nephrectomy patients was previously performed that evaluated the analgesic, opioid-sparing, and antihyperalgesic effects of pregabalin. this article describes a secondary exploratory analysis that tested the hypothesis that pregabalin would impair cognitive function compared to placebo. methods: eighty patients scheduled for donor nephrectomy participated in this randomized, placebo-controlled study. pregabalin (150 mg twice daily, n = 40) or placebo (n = 40) was administered on the day of surgery and the first postoperative day, in addition to a pain regimen consisting of opioids, steroids, local anesthetics, and acetaminophen. specific cognitive tests measuring inhibition, sustained attention, psychomotor speed, visual memory, and strategy were performed at baseline, 24 h, and 3 to 5 days after surgery, using tests from the cambridge neuropsychological test automated battery. results: in the spatial working memory within errors test, the number of errors increased with pregabalin compared to placebo 24 h after surgery; median (25th, 75th percentile) values were 1 (0, 6) versus 0 (0, 1; rate ratio [95% ci], 3.20 [1.55 to 6.62]; p = 0.002). furthermore, pregabalin significantly increased the number of errors in the stop-signal task stop-go test compared with placebo; median (25th, 75th percentile) values were 3 (1, 6) versus 1 (0, 2; rate ratio, 2.14 [1.13 to 4.07]; p = 0.020). there were no significant differences between groups in the paired associated learning, reaction time, rapid visual processing, or spatial working memory strategy tests. conclusions: perioperative pregabalin significantly negatively affected subdomains of executive functioning, including inhibition, and working memory compared to placebo, whereas psychomotor speed was not changed.",1
we studied relations between antihistamines (drugs for treating allergies) and torsade de pointes (very fast heart rhythm) as reported to the fda. we found 406 reports on torsade de pointes and antihistamines. we used four different statistical methods to study the cases. antihistamines that had more than three reports of torsade de pointes were included in the analysis. we found 12 drugs associated with torsade de pointes. six of the drugs were not known before to cause torsade de pointes. getting antihistamines with other drugs that cause heart complications was lower than for the known antihistamines. the new antihistamines were associated with heart complications stronger than the known ones. the new antihistamines were associated with torsade de pointes stronger.,0
"the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (pdc) quickens the permanent conversion of pyruvate (a particle used for energy-production) into acetyl-coa (another particle used for energy production). pdc shortage can occur from changes in genes involved in creating its components. the resulting physical traits, though very different, mainly affect the brain and spinal cord. this study explores the medical, biochemical and gene-related information from thirteen pdc scarce patients. the study seeks to create possible gene-physical trait connections. the data agrees with earlier reports describing a specfic gene's sequence changes as the main cause of pdc shortage. however, the results also reveal a large presence of another gene's sequence changes among portuguese patients. most carry a possibly private gene sequence change. regarding medical characteristics, all patients show coordination setback, the intensity of which seems to parallel the type and location of the patient's gene sequence change. treatment options include administration of a low-carb diet and thiamine, although arginine aspartate may also help. identifying disease-causing gene sequence changes, along with the altered cellular substances, help explain the physical traits caused by the disease and select the best treatment.",0
"background: leg edema is a common adverse effect of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (ccb) that may need dose reduction or drug withdrawal, adversely affecting the antihypertensive efficacy. leg edema is reported to occur less often with (s)-amlodipine compared to conventional racemic amlodipine. we aimed to find the incidence of leg edema as a primary outcome and antihypertensive efficacy with (s)-amlodipine compared to conventional amlodipine. methods: this prospective, double-blind, controlled clinical trial randomized 172 hypertensive patients, not controlled on beta-blockers (bb) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (acei/arb), to either conventional amlodipine (5-10 mg; n = 86) or (s)-amlodipine (2.5-5 mg; n = 86), while continuing their previous anti-hypertensive medications. sample was sufficient to find a difference in edema between the interventions with 80 % power at 5 % significance level. intension to treat analysis (itt) for safety data and per protocol analysis for efficacy data was performed. fischer's exact test was applied to observe difference between responder rates and proportions of subjects having peripheral edema in the two groups. pitting edema test scores were compared using mann-whitney test. results: altogether 146 patients (amlodipine, n = 76 and (s)-amlodipine, n = 70) completed 120 days treatment. demographic variables and treatment adherence were comparable in the two groups. incidence of new edema after randomization was 31.40 % in test group and 46.51 % in control group [p = 0.03; absolute risk reduction (arr) = 15.1 %; number needed to treat (nnt) = 7, itt analysis]. pitting edema score and patient rated edema score increased significantly in the control compared to test group (p = 0.038 and 0.036 respectively) after treatment period. edema scores increased significantly in the control group from baseline (p < 0.0001). responders in blood pressure were 98.57 % in test and 98.68 % in control group. most common adverse events (ae) were pitting edema and increased urinary frequency. incidence of all aes other than edema was similar in both groups. two serious aes occurred unrelated to therapy. biochemical and ecg parameters in the two groups were comparable. conclusions: in hypertensive patients not controlled on prior bb and acei/arb therapy, addition of (s)-amlodipine besylate at half the dose of conventional amlodipine provides better tolerability with reduced incidence of peripheral edema, and equal antihypertensive efficacy compared to amlodipine given at usual doses.",1
"objective: since several recent meta-analyses report a dose-response relationship for the antidepressant effect of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris), we investigated how these drugs are dosed in clinical practice. methods: through linkage of nation- or region-wide registers, we describe ssri doses in 50,365 individuals residing in region västra götaland, sweden, with an incident diagnosis of depression and initiating ssri treatment between 2007 and 2016. the primary question was to elucidate to what extent these individuals had been prescribed a daily dose that according to recent meta-analyses is required to elicit the maximum antidepressant effect, that is >20 mg citalopram, >10 mg escitalopram, >10 mg fluoxetine, >10 mg paroxetine or >50 mg sertraline. results: in all, 21,049 (54%) out of 38,868 individuals <65 years of age, and 9,131 (79%) out of 11,497 individuals ≥65 years of age, never received an ssri dose reported to exert maximum antidepressant effect. these prescribing practices were seen for citalopram, escitalopram and sertraline, but not for fluoxetine and paroxetine, and were frequent in both primary and secondary/tertiary care. suggesting that doses here defined as maximum efficacy doses, when prescribed, are usually not intolerable, between 59% and 68% of individuals <65 years of age received such a dose also for the subsequent prescription, that is as frequently as in those prescribed a sub-maximum efficacy dose (52-69%). conclusion: most patients being prescribed an ssri to treat their depression never receive the dose that according to recent meta-analyses is most likely to effectively combat their condition. the lack of consensus regarding effective dosing of ssris may have contributed to this state of affairs.",1
"purpose: the pharmacokinetics of gabapentin in paediatric patients with uncontrolled seizures was studied. methods: thirteen paediatric patients (mean age: 9.4 years) with uncontrolled partial seizures were included. patients received gabapentin orally until doses were individualized to 9.6-39.8 mg/kg/day. blood samples were obtained just prior to the dose and over 8 h after gabapentin was administered in the fasting state. the plasma concentration of gabapentin was measured by a high-performance liquid chromatography assay. pharmacokinetic parameters for gabapentin were determined by non-compartment methods using multivariate regression analysis. results: data from nine patients were suitable for pharmacokinetic analysis. the c(max) from 0.9 to 5.8 microg/ml (mean: 2.6 +/- 1.7 microg/ml) and t(max) from 0.5 to 2.0 h (mean: 1.6 +/- 1.0 h). the apparent clearance (cl/f) ranged from 0.12 to 1.12 l/h/kg (mean: 0.50 +/- 0.29 l/h/kg), and the elimination half-life from 3.2 to 12.2 h (mean: 5.5 +/- 0.8 h). five patients experienced moderate (n = 4) to severe (n = 1) aggressive behaviour and another gained weight on gabapentin. conclusions: our data suggests that gabapentin pharmacokinetics can vary substantially among paediatric patients. gabapentin was well tolerated in patients with uncontrolled partial seizures up to 6 months of therapy.",1
"vitamin b6 is thought to be a most versatile chemical that participates in more than 100 biochemical reactions in the body. it is involved in protein and amino acid (building blocks of protein) metabolism, carbohydrate (sugar) and lipid (fat) metabolism. it is also involved in neurotransmitter (chemicals involved in nerve impulses) production and dna/rna synthesis. vitamin b6 can also be a chemical that regulates gene expression. currently, signs and symptoms of vitamin b6 deficiency is not a common disorder in the general population. but vitamin b6 deficiency may be present without signs or symptoms especially in the elderly. this research give a complete overview of the actions of vitamin b6 in the body. researchers show which specific problems can occur due to a lack of vitamin b6. researchers also discuss possibilities for public health and adding supplements to foods. the database medline (www.ncvi.nlm.nih.gov) was searched on the computer for terms like ""vitamin b6"", ""pyridoxal"", ""cancer"", ""homocysteine"", etc. researchers included studies with early findings from the forties as well as recent results from 2006 for a complete understanding. this research was summarised and compared in different chapters. researchers have proposed that less than adequate (suboptimal) vitamin b6 levels are associated with certain diseases that particularly trouble the elderly population such as: decreased ability to think clearly, alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, and different types of cancer. some of these problems may be related to an increased homocysteine (amino acid) levels that is associated with vitamin b6 deficiency. there is also evidence for other ways suboptimal vitamin b6 levels could increase the risk for these chronic diseases.",0
"tardive dyskinesia (td) is a disorder characterized by involuntary movements, typically of the orofacial muscles and also of the extremities and other muscle groups. the condition is associated with exposure to dopamine receptor blocking agents, including antipsychotics. because the indications and off-label uses for these agents have expanded over the last 2 decades, a larger number of patients are receiving antipsychotic medications than in the past. while evidence suggests that patients being treated with second-generation antipsychotics have less risk for developing td than those treated with first-generation antipsychotics, the decreased risk is not as great as was originally expected. in addition, patients with chronic psychiatric conditions often require long-term use of antipsychotics, putting them at risk for td. this article addresses the prevalence, risk factors, and prevention of td; assessment strategies including diagnostic criteria and rating scales; and evidence for td treatments, including 2 newly approved medications: deutetrabenazine and valbenazine.",1
"research has shown that some patients with schizophrenia have lower levels of vitamin b6 in the blood than healthy people. a study showed that lower vitamin b6 levels increased symptoms of schizophrenia. higher vitamin b6 levels decreased symptoms of schizophrenia.when measuring the symptoms of schizophrenia, the loss of vitamin b6 might help cause the symptom of schizophrenia. to study the relationship between vitamin b6 and schizophrenia, research was done on mice fed a diet without vitamin b6 . this made a mouse model of vitamin b6 deficiency. after 4 weeks of that diet, blood levels of vitamin b6 in these mice decreased to 3% of the healthy mice. the vitamin b6 deficiency mice showed social and thinking (behavior) problems. also in the vitamin b6 deficiency mouse model, mice showed a high increase in a chemical that suggests increased metabolism of a hormone (noradrenaline (na)) for flight-or-flight in the brain. we proved that certain parts of the brain released this increased na in vitamin b6 deficiency mice. feeding the mice vitamin b6 supplements decreases the excess na released by the brain. treating the mice with a specific drug, guanfacine (gfc), decreased the na metabolism. doing these things helped to correct the behavior problems in the vitamin b6 deficiency mice. this research suggests that the behavior problems in the vitamin b6 deficiency mice are caused by an increase in the noradrenergic (naergic) system.",0
"natural killer (nk) cells (white blood cells that kill cells infected with a virus) are important early responders against viral infections. changes in metabolism (the process that creates fuel for the body) are crucial to fuel nk cell responses, and changes in metabolism are linked to nk cells not working correctly in obesity and cancer. however, very little is known about the metabolism requirements of nk cells during short-term or acute retroviral infection (the earliest stage of infection). using an animal model for study, researchers show that after infection, nk cells increase uptake of nutrients and reprogram how cells in metabolism work. iron deficiency or shortage significantly impairs the nk cells' abilities to fight viruses and leads to increased viral loads (quantity of virus in a person). our study thus shows the requirement of nutrients and metabolism for the antiviral activity of nk cells, and is an important finding for viral infections linked with changes in iron levels such as hiv and sars-cov-2.",0
"novel coronavirus (covid-19), which leads to a breathing-related viral disease, is causing deaths around the world and lockdowns. a weak immune system is a known risk factor for all viral flu infections. functional foods are foods that have a potentially positive effect on health beyond providing basic nutrition. functional foods help the immune system work better to prevent and control viral infections. physical activity strengthens these benefits. exercise boosts the immune system, and how often people exercise relates to how much the immune system is strengthened. functional foods that prevent non-communicable (non-infectious and chronic) disease can be used to protect against respiratory viral infections and covid-19. functional foods within popular diets include a number of immune-boosting additives, vitamins, and minerals. foods with antiviral (infection fighting) effects include fruits, vegetables, fermented foods and probiotics, olive oil, fish, nuts and seeds, herbs, roots, fungi, amino acids, peptides (protein segments), and cyclotides (peptides from plants). regular moderate exercise (movement that gets the heart beating faster) may help reduce the risk of getting the virus and help people sleep better, in addition to a healthy diet and functional foods. lifestyle and healthy nutrition with functional foods may offer additional antiviral approaches for public health.",0
"pain and a loss of feeling in the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and part of the ring finger may be a sign of carpal tunnel syndrome (pinched nerves in the wrist). this syndrome and the pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand is caused by pressure on the main nerve at the front of the forearm as it travels through the carpal tunnel, a narrow passageway at the base of the hand that is made of ligaments and bone. guidelines from the may 2019 issue of journal of orthopaedic & sports physical therapy, a scientific journal, make recommendations for evaluating, diagnosing, and treating carpal tunnel syndrome. for patients, these guidelines outline the best rehabilitation treatment options (care that can help people regain, keep, or improve abilities needed for daily life) based on the scientific research. ultimately, the best care is a combination of three things: 1) the leading science, 2) the knowledge, experience, and skills of a patient's health care provider, and 3) the patient's own input. these guidelines help inform the first step in that process. physical therapists are people who help injured or ill people improve movement and manage pain. they are well trained to help people with carpal tunnel syndrome. although some patients (anywhere from 28% to 62%) recover without treatment, others (from 32% to 58%) get worse. a key to nonsurgical treatment shown to help those with carpal tunnel syndrome is the use of a night brace; a night brace should hold the wrist in a neutral position (where the joints are not being bent) and only be worn for short-term symptom relief. for patients with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome, stretching exercises and the night brace can help. manual therapy (hands-on therapy without using a machine or device) of the neck and arms performed by a therapist can also help. education on the proper setup of computers, especially the mouse, and how hard patients should strike the keyboard may also help control symptoms of pain and loss of feeling. research shows that low-level laser therapy (a laser light used at a low level applied to the skin to reduce pain and help the body heal), thermal ultrasound (a device that provides heat to tissues to increase circulation and reduce pain), iontophoresis (a procedure that uses an electrical current to deliver medicine through the skin), and magnets provided no consistent benefit in treating carpal tunnel syndrome. if nonsurgical treatment does not help, surgery may be needed. a physical therapist can help guide a patient's recovery and decrease symptoms.",0
"mitochondria are the energy-producing organelles of the cell, generating atp via oxidative phosphorylation mainly by using pyruvate derived from glycolytic processing of glucose. ketone bodies generated by fatty acid oxidation can serve as alternative metabolites for aerobic energy production. the ketogenic diet, which is high in fat and low in carbohydrates, mimics the metabolic state of starvation, forcing the body to utilize fat as its primary source of energy. the ketogenic diet is used therapeutically for pharmacoresistant epilepsy and for ""rare diseases"" of glucose metabolism (glucose transporter type 1 and pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency). as metabolic reprogramming from oxidative phosphorylation toward increased glycolysis is a hallmark of cancer cells; there is increasing evidence that the ketogenic diet may also be beneficial as an adjuvant cancer therapy by potentiating the antitumor effect of chemotherapy and radiation treatment.",1
"a pacemaking system consists of an impulse generator and lead or leads to carry the electrical impulse to the patient's heart. pacemaker and implantable cardioverter defibrillator codes were made to describe the type of pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator implanted. indications for pacing and implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation were given by the american college of cardiologists. certain pacemakers have magnet-operated reed switches incorporated; however, magnet application can have serious adverse effects; hence, devices should be considered programmable unless known otherwise. when a device patient undergoes any procedure (with or without anesthesia), special precautions have to be observed including a focused history/physical examination, interrogation of pacemaker before and after the procedure, emergency drugs/temporary pacing and defibrillation, reprogramming of pacemaker and disabling certain pacemaker functions if required, monitoring of electrolyte and metabolic disturbance and avoiding certain drugs and equipments that can interfere with pacemaker function. if unanticipated device interactions are found, consider discontinuation of the procedure until the source of interference can be eliminated or managed and all corrective measures should be taken to ensure proper pacemaker function should be done. post procedure, the cardiac rate and rhythm should be monitored continuously and emergency drugs and equipments should be kept ready and consultation with a cardiologist or a pacemaker-implantable cardioverter defibrillator service may be necessary.",1
"nerve-related, upper hand pain greatly affects patient performance and quality of life, even with proper treatment. this article looks at leading treatments that may improve pain care, including advanced treatments that are available. this article also reviews upcoming therapies, like spinal cord electrical stimulation, peripheral or outer nerve stimulation, and dorsal root ganglion spinal cord stimulation (electrical treatment for specific cells in the spinal cord). as these therapies improve, so will their use in pain care grounded by evidence to improve patient safety and monitoring of patients with complex nerve-related pain.",0
"current monitoring technologies cannot detect early, counterbalancing changes associated with significant blood loss. we previously showed a new mathematical equation to calculate the counterbalancing blood flow mechanics or compensatory reserve index (cri) based on analysis of blood vessel wave patterns from blood flow recordings. in the present study, we theorized that cri would give better accuracy to detect blood loss compared to standard vital signs and other blood flow measures. we analyzed 20 subjects before, during, and after a regular, controlled voluntary blood loss of 1.2 liters for continuous non-surgical vital sign wave data, including cri, recordings, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels, blood flow output, and blood volume. cri decreased by 33% in a linear trend across increasing blood volume loss, with no changes in vital signs. cri had high accuracy for detecting blood volume loss. in comparison, blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen levels, blood flow output and blood volume had less accuracy for detecting the same amount of blood loss. consistent with out theory, cri detected blood loss and restoration better than other traditional body measures. single measurement of cri may enable better identification, while cri monitoring may allow earlier detection of patient status trending towards death.",0
"in lymphedema, an imbalance of a fluid called lymph causes a build up of protein-rich fluid, usually in the arms and legs. diagnosis is usually made based on patient medical history and a physical examination of the affected body part. the diagnosis may be confirmed by imaging, such as x-rays or another scan. primary lymphedema, also called hereditary lymphedema, is inherited (passed down from parent to child) through genes. congestive heart failure (inefficient heart pumping) and infections from soil particles make it easier for patients to develop the secondary form of lymphedema, elephantiasis nostras verrucosa (env). env is a rare chronic condition caused by ongoing infections with bacteria and causes a part of the body, usually the lower part of the body, to be extremely enlarged. researchers describe the case of a 65-year-old man with lymphedema complicated by congestive heart failure. the patient was experiencing worsening left leg swelling and had a prior history of leg swelling at puberty (when a child's body changes to become an adult) due to disease. the condition was inherited, as his father, elder brother, and nephew were diagnosed with the same disease. the left leg showed non-pitting edema (there was no indentation when the area of swelling is pressed) with woody skin due to scaring that was also thick and leathery. the right leg had mild pitting edema. there were numerous folds and cobblestone-like lumps, raised red patches of the skin, and a painless ulcer (sore) on the left leg. lab tests showed high levels of a hormone made by the heart called b-type natriuretic peptide. he was treated with compression stockings and bandaging and given decongestive treatment in the limb which includes several techniques such as draining fluid. after 1 week of therapy, his swelling had somewhat improved. in conclusion, various conditions can cause elephantiasis nostras verrucosa (env), and it can be an additional condition on any form of hereditary lymphedema. the most effective strategy for this condition seems to be a detailed workup of the underlying cause of the env and early treatment and management.",0
"the pandemic caused by the new coronavirus (which causes covid-19 - a viral, breathing-related illness) has caused shock waves in many countries, producing a global health crisis. lack of knowledge of how the virus works, plus the absence of effective treatments against covid-19 and/or vaccines have put the immune system and its ability to fight disease in the spotlight. having a healthy balance of specific nutrients is key to keeping parts of the immune system working in order to avoid and fight infections. there are 6 vitamins (d, a, c, folate, b6, b12) and 4 minerals (zinc, iron, copper and selenium) that the european food safety authority sees as important for the immune system to function well. in this report is an update on the evidence of 1) how nutrition impacts the immune system, 2) what things might reduce how long nutrients stay in the body, and 3) the role of the healthy balance of these nutrients during the covid-19 pandemic. first, researchers review available scientific data on the impact of a healthy balance of these nutrients on the immune system, as well as their role in covid-19 prevention and treatment. second, nutrition data from 10 european countries are compiled and analyzed, and the relationship between country nutrition and covid-19 data is evaluated. additionally, the possible effect of genes on nutrient balance is considered for these 10 nutrients. using genetic information from available databases, researchers estimated that countries may be at a greater risk of low nutritional balance. results from the review show the importance of keeping a correct nutritional balance of these 10 nutrients for the health of the immune system and highlights the importance of vitamin d and iron in the context of covid-19. the study of these nutrients and their environment shows that the amount consumed of certain vitamins and minerals-especially vitamins d, c, b12, and iron-are inversely or oppositely associated with higher covid-19 numbers and/or death (i.e., the higher the nutrition, the lower the risk of covid-19 illness and vice versa). this finding is very important for groups with genes shown to lower micronutrient status. in conclusion, using nutritional and genetic data and how they influence the immune system and how long nutrients stay in the body can be key tools to help strengthen the immune system of individuals and prepare people to fight viruses such as covid-19.",0
"background: the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (pdc) catalyzes the irreversible decarboxylation of pyruvate into acetyl-coa. pdc deficiency can be caused by alterations in any of the genes encoding its several subunits. the resulting phenotype, though very heterogeneous, mainly affects the central nervous system. the aim of this study is to describe and discuss the clinical, biochemical and genotypic information from thirteen pdc deficient patients, thus seeking to establish possible genotype-phenotype correlations. results: the mutational spectrum showed that seven patients carry mutations in the pdha1 gene encoding the e1α subunit, five patients carry mutations in the pdhx gene encoding the e3 binding protein, and the remaining patient carries mutations in the dld gene encoding the e3 subunit. these data corroborate earlier reports describing pdha1 mutations as the predominant cause of pdc deficiency but also reveal a notable prevalence of pdhx mutations among portuguese patients, most of them carrying what seems to be a private mutation (p.r284x). the biochemical analyses revealed high lactate and pyruvate plasma levels whereas the lactate/pyruvate ratio was below 16; enzymatic activities, when compared to control values, indicated to be independent from the genotype and ranged from 8.5% to 30%, the latter being considered a cut-off value for primary pdc deficiency. concerning the clinical features, all patients displayed psychomotor retardation/developmental delay, the severity of which seems to correlate with the type and localization of the mutation carried by the patient. the therapeutic options essentially include the administration of a ketogenic diet and supplementation with thiamine, although arginine aspartate intake revealed to be beneficial in some patients. moreover, in silico analysis of the missense mutations present in this pdc deficient population allowed to envisage the molecular mechanism underlying these pathogenic variants. conclusion: the identification of the disease-causing mutations, together with the functional and structural characterization of the mutant protein variants, allow to obtain an insight on the severity of the clinical phenotype and the selection of the most appropriate therapy.",1
"as the study's background, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) is a harmful behavioural disorder affecting daily ability to function, learn, and interact with peers. this publication measures the role of omega-3/6 fatty acids in the treatment and management of adhd. a review of 16 randomised controlled trials was done. trials included a total of 1,514 children and young people with adhd who were given either an omega-3/6 treatment or a dummy treatment. of the studies identified, 13 reported helpful benefits on adhd symptoms including improvements in hyperactivity, impulsivity, attention, visual learning, word reading, and working/short-term memory. four studies used supplements containing a 9 : 3 : 1 ratio of eicosapentaenoic acid (omega-3) : docosahexaenoic acid (omega-3) : gamma linolenic acid (omega-6) which appeared effective at improving red blood cell levels. supplementation with this ratio of fatty acids also showed promise as a secondary therapy to traditional medications, lowering the dose and improving the compliance with medications such as methylphenidate (stimulant to treat adhd). in conclusion, adhd is a frequent and harmful childhood condition. given negative feelings towards psychostimulant medications, omega-3/6 fatty acids offer great promise as a suitable secondary therapy for adhd.",0
"the us preventive services task force (uspstf) guideline for osteoporosis screening concludes that there is a lack of evidence about optimal rescreening intervals and states that intervals >2 years may be necessary to better predict fracture risk. in addition, the uspstf cites a prospective study showing that repeat measurement of bmd after 8 years added little predictive value compared with baseline dexa scan results. reconsider the intervals at which you recommend rescreening for osteoporosis; for post-menopausal women with a baseline of normal bone mineral density (bmd) or mild osteopenia, a 15-year interval is probably sufficient.",1
"etiology: though most commonly thought of in the setting of trauma, there are numerous causes of hemorrhagic shock that span many systems. blunt or penetrating trauma is the most common cause, followed by upper and lower gastrointestinal sources. obstetrical, vascular, iatrogenic, and even urological sources have all been described. bleeding may be either external or internal. a substantial amount of blood loss to the point of hemodynamic compromise may occur in the chest, abdomen, or retroperitoneum. the thigh itself can hold up to 1 l to 2 l of blood. pathophysiology: hemorrhagic shock is due to the depletion of intravascular volume through blood loss to the point of being unable to match the tissues demand for oxygen. as a result, mitochondria are no longer able to sustain aerobic metabolism for the production of oxygen and switch to the less efficient anaerobic metabolism to meet the cellular demand for adenosine triphosphate. in the latter process, pyruvate is produced and converted to lactic acid to regenerate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nad+) to maintain some degree of cellular respiration in the absence of oxygen. the body compensates for volume loss by increasing heart rate and contractility, followed by baroreceptor activation resulting in sympathetic nervous system activation and peripheral vasoconstriction. typically, there is a slight increase in the diastolic blood pressure with narrowing of the pulse pressure. as diastolic ventricular filling continues to decline and cardiac output decreases, systolic blood pressure drops. due to sympathetic nervous system activation, blood is diverted away from noncritical organs and tissues to preserve blood supply to vital organs such as the heart and brain. while prolonging heart and brain function, this also leads to other tissues being further deprived of oxygen causing more lactic acid production and worsening acidosis. this worsening acidosis along with hypoxemia, if left uncorrected, eventually causes the loss of peripheral vasoconstriction, worsening hemodynamic compromise, and death. the body’s compensation varies by cardiopulmonary comorbidities, age, and vasoactive medications. due to these factors, heart rate and blood pressure responses are extremely variable and, therefore, cannot be relied upon as the sole means of diagnosis.",1
"continuing treatment with antidepressants after patients have responded to medication has been shown to greatly reduce the risk of relapse, which is when a medical condition that had previously improved starts to worsen. however, the risk of a relapse is not completely eliminated. a number of theories have been suggested to account for this possible decline in how well antidepressant medicines work. a common first approach to help a patient who is relapsing is to increase the dose of the antidepressant medicine. researchers evaluated the chance patients will respond to an increase in the dose of fluoxetine (a type of antidepressant also called prozac) in patients relapsing during a long-term study of two different dosing plans of fluoxetine. patients who have major depressive disorder are treated for 13 weeks with 20 mg/day of fluoxetine in a large us study. the 501 patients who responded to the medicine are randomly put into either the group receiving 20 mg/day of fluoxetine, the group receiving sham treatment that has the appearance of the drug but is not the real medicine, or 90 mg of fluoxetine weekly. they will be in these groups for 25 weeks during a part of the study called the continuation phase. if the patients relapse during the continuation phase, they are offered a different 25-week treatment plan called a rescue phase where the study medication dose is increased as 1) patients on placebo will restart fluoxetine at 20 mg/day, 2) patients on fluoxetine 20 mg/day will have their dose increased to 40 mg/day, and 3) patients on the 90-mg weekly dose will have their dose increased to 90-mg twice a week. the results of the rescue phase the patients in group 2 (who received 20 mg/day) and group 3 (who received the 90-mg weekly). researchers used scoring tools that measure depression severity and seeing how much the depression scores are reduced since the time of the last relapse. additional analyses to evaluate how well the medicine worked include changes in these scoring tools from the start of the study to the end. safety checks include assessment of unexpected side effects, vital signs (e.g. blood pressure, temperature), and tests done in a lab. overall, patients relapsing during the continuation treatment phase responded to an increased dose (57% of the 40-mg-daily group and 72% of the 90-mg-twice-weekly group). the average score of the tool that measure depression severity decreased and was maintained for up to 6 months in the people who responded. there are 35 patients who either did not respond or responded at first but then relapsed after increasing medication. in conclusion, patients who relapsed after first responding to fluoxetine can benefit from an increase in the dose amount of fluoxetine. these results also generally support increasing the dose as a first-line treatment plan for a patient who has relapsed while taking a previously effective dose of an antidepressant. increasing fluoxetine 90 mg once weekly to twice weekly appears to have side effects that patients can handle and is just as effective in restoring response as when daily fluoxetine dose is increased from 20 mg to 40 mg.",0
"rationale for review: heterologous prime-boost doses of covid-19 vaccines ('mix-and-match' approach) are being studied to test for the effectiveness of oxford (azd1222), pfizer (bnt162b2), moderna (mrna-1273) and novavax (nvx-cov2373) vaccines for covid in 'com-cov2 trial' in uk, and that of oxford and pfizer vaccines in 'combivacs trial' in spain. later, other heterologous combinatios of coronavac (db15806), janssen (jnj-78436735), cansino (ad5-ncov), and other were also being trialed to explore their effectiveness. previously, such a strategy was deployed for hiv, ebola virus, malaria, tuberculosis, influenza, and hepatitis b to develop the artificial acquired active immunity. the present review explores the science behind such an approach for candidate covid-19 vaccines developed using eleven different platforms approved by the world health organization. key findings: the candidate vaccines' pharmaceutical parameters (e.g. platforms, number needed to vaccinate and intervals, adjuvanted status, excipients and preservatives added, efficacy and effectiveness, vaccine adverse events, and boosters), and clinical aspects must be analysed for the mix-and-match approach. heterologous prime-boost trials showed safety, effectiveness, higher systemic reactogenicity, well tolerability with improved immunogenicity, and flexibility profiles for future vaccinations, especially during acute and global shortages, compared to the homologous counterparts. conclusions/recommendations. still, large controlled trials are warranted to address challenging variants of concerns including omicron and other, and to generalize the effectiveness of the approach in regular as well as emergency use during vaccine scarcity.",1
"animal and human research studies suggest that vitamin b6 deficiency (not enough vitamin b6) affects the immune system. white blood cell function and antibody production are damaged. delayed allergy reactions are reduced (like the reaction to a tuberculosis (tb) skin test)). taking enough vitamin b6 to get levels back to normal corrects the immune system problems. taking very high doses supplements does not cause further improvement. human research also show that the amount of vitamin b6 in the body may affect tumor growth and disease. vitamin b6 deficiency (not enough vitamin b6 in the body) has been associated with immune system changes in the elderly.vitamin b6 deficiency also affects people with hiv infections, kidney disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. future research studies should focus on explaining exactly how vitamin b6 affects the immune system and the right amount of vitamin b6 to take for the best immune system function.",0
"aim: leg edema, observed on comprehensive geriatric assessment (cga) of 142 elderly outpatients with a variety of chronic diseases, was studied clinically to clarify its incidence and its associated risk factors. methods: the severity of pitting edema was assessed at 3 points, namely, the pretibial edge, medial malleolus, and the dorsum of the foot. on palpation, edema was graded as 0 to 3 for each point on one leg, the sum of which was used as the edema score. according to the edema score, subjects were divided into 3 groups; the moderate to severe (ms) group, the slight to mild (sm) group, and the group without pitting edema. the ms group was defined as having an edema score of 4 or more or edema of grade 2 or more, while the sm group was defined as having an edema score of 2 to 3 points without edema of grade 2 or more. the status of underlying disease, vascular risks, varicose veins, medications, daily activity, nutrition, total protein (tp), albumin, brain natriuretic peptide (bnp), and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (egfr) were compared among the 3 groups. results: there were 36 subjects in the ms group and 19 subjects in the sm group. diabetes, atrial fibrillation, varicose veins, and polypharmacy were more frequent in the ms group than in the control group. sedentary life style, house-bound, and gait trouble were significantly more frequent in the ms and sm groups. there were no significant differences in the scores of the mini-nutritional assessment short form among the groups, although both the body weight and calf circumference in the ms group were significantly greater than those in the group without pitting edema. low serum tp, albumin and egfr were seen in the ms group as well as high bnp levels. multiple regression analysis revealed diabetes, varicose veins, sedentarism, and hypoalbuminemia as risk factors associated with leg edema (r(2)=0.365, p<0.0001). conclusion: leg edema was frequent in the elderly outpatients and was associated strongly with diabetes, varicose veins, sedentarism, and hypoalbuminemia. these findings suggest that advising against a sedentary life style could help the resolution of edema, and also indicates the clinical usefulness of cga. furthermore, leg edema should be seriously considered along with nutritional assessment because edema could influence various anthropometric parameters.",1

"the coronavirus and the resulting covid-19 disease (a viral, breathing-related disease) has impacted tens of millions of people around the world. vaccines that are safe and work well are urgently needed. in a clinical study that is in progress, people who are at least 16 years old are randomly placed in a group to receive two doses of either a placebo (a shot that does not have medicine) or the bnt162b2 vaccine. the bnt162b2 vaccine works by increasing proteins that help the immune system. the main study outcomes are how well the vaccine works against covid-19 and its safety. a total of 43,548 participants are randomly put into two groups. among this group, 43,448 received shots: 21,720 with the bnt162b2 vaccine and 21,728 with the placebo. among people who received the bnt162b2 vaccine, 8 got covid-19 at least 7 days after they received the second dose. among people who received the placebo, 162 got covid-19. the bnt162b2 vaccine was 95% effective in preventing covid-19. similar results are observed across smaller groups of participants when looking at age, sex, race, ethnicity, weight, and the presence of other conditions. among 10 cases of serious covid-19 starting after the first dose, 9 cases happened in people who received the placebo and 1 in someone who received the bnt162b2 vaccine. the safety of the bnt162b2 vaccine is described as having short-term, mild-to-moderate pain on the arm where the shot was given, tiredness, and a headache. the number of serious side effects is low and is similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. in conclusion, receiving two doses of the bnt162b2 vaccine provided 95% protection against covid-19 in people 16 years or older. safety over an average of 2 months is similar to those of other vaccines.",0
"orofacial pain syndromes are diseases known to cause pain in the face and mouth. we discuss clinical examinations of the neural system that help identifying trigeminal nerve pain and other chronic facial pain conditions, but not headaches and problems with tmj. the international classification of headache disorders 2018 classifies these facial pain disorders under the heading painful cranial neuropathies and other facial pains. clinical examinations of the nervous system help identifying painful conditions of the trigeminal nerve, which carries sensation from the face to the brain. these conditions may start after an injury (posttraumatic trigeminal neuropathy) or herpes infection (postherpetic trigeminal neuropathy). other related conditions are burning mouth syndrome (a burning, scalding, or tingling feeling in the mouth) and persistent idiopathic facial and dental pain, which is described as continuing pain in the face and teeth of unknown cause. even patients who appear normal on clinical examination have damage to their nervous system that can cause trigeminal nerve pain. diagnostic tests include recording electrical signals in the muscles (electroneuromyography), mri of the nerves around the eyes, blink reflexes and jaw jerk when different nerves are stimulated, recording electrical signals after the nerves are stimulated, and tests for pain sensation. responsiveness of the blink reflex and records of the electrical signals after repeated nerve stimulation show if the response is suppressed. medical imaging called navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation shows the areas of the brain that change due to chronic nerve pain. consistent use of the above tests will help understanding the chronic facial pain conditions.",0
"fast and accurate covid-19 tests help reduce the spread of the disease, including in hospitals. some of the known tests are expensive, take a long time and need training to do the test. other tests are fast and easy to do without training. accuracy of the easier and faster tests compared to the traditional tests is an area of interest. the quidel rapid test was approved for emergency use in patients within the first 5 days of covid-19 symptoms. these tests agreed with the traditional test for 83 to 99 out of 100 patients with positive results and 97 to all 100 patients with negative results. for the covid-19 patients that did not have symptoms, the tests were not as accurate as the traditional test. we compared test results at a hospital in june - august 2020. among 1,732 patients that had no symptoms the rapid test agreed with the traditional test on about 60 out of 100 positive tests, and on almost all negative tests. among 307 patients that had symptoms the rapid test agreed with the traditional test on over 70 out of 100 positive tests, and on almost all negative tests. as rapid test misses many covid-19 cases, traditional tests might be needed when the disease is on the rise. false negative test results cause delays in quarantine and treatment of covid-19.",0
"dopamine is a chemical messenger that carries signals between brain cells and affects mood, motivation, and movement. the breakdown and inactivation of dopamine in parkinson's disease (pd) may initially be addressed by increased cognitive (thought-related) control brought about by cholinergic mechanisms (types of drugs that inhibit, enhance, or imitate the action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, the primary signaling molecule of nerve cells). shift to cognitive control of walking can be measured by prefrontal cortex activation (activating the part of the brain that controls behavior, such as decision-making). levodopa (a drug that enters the brain and helps replace missing dopamine, a chemical that carries signals between brain cells) improves certain aspects of gait (how a person walks) and worsens others. cholinergic influence on gait and prefrontal cortex activity remains unclear. this study examines dopaminergic (drugs that increase dopamine activity) and cholinergic influence on gait and prefrontal cortex activity while walking in pd. a clinical study examines the effects of levodopa and donepezil (a type of drug that helps mental function) in parkinson's disease. in this study, 20 people with parkinson's disease were randomly put in treatment groups, and 19 completed the study. participants were randomly put in either the group that received both levodopa + donepezil or the group that received levodopa + placebo (sham) treatments, with 2 weeks spent on treatment and a 2-week washout (the study phase when the drug is stopped and no other drug is used). the main outcome (result) is change in prefrontal cortex activity while walking. secondary outcomes are change in gait, dual-task performance (doing two tasks at the same time), and attention. levodopa decreased prefrontal cortex activity (the part of the brain that controls behavior, such as decision-making) compared with off medication, whereas the addition of donepezil reversed this decrease. gait speed and stride length while doing single- and dual-task conditions improved with combined donepezil and levodopa compared with off medication. dual-task reaction time was quicker with levodopa compared with off medication, and accuracy improved with the combined donepezil and levodopa drugs. cholinergic drugs, specifically donepezil for 2 weeks, can alter prefrontal cortex activity when walking and improve secondary cognitive task accuracy and gait in parkinson's disease. further studies will investigate whether higher prefrontal cortex activity while walking is associated with gait changes.",0
"this is a comprehensive literature review of chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs). we provide a description of the background, etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management regarding cfs. cfs is a multifaceted illness that has many symptoms and a wide array of clinical presentations. as of recent, cfs has been merged with myalgic encephalomyelitis (me). much of the difficulty in its management has stemmed from a lack of a concrete understanding of its etiology and pathogenesis. there is a potential association between dysfunction of the autoimmune, neuroendocrine, or autonomic nervous systems and the development of cfs. possible triggering events, such as infections followed by an immune dysregulation resulting have also been proposed. in fact, me/cfs was first described following epstein barr virus (ebv) infections, but it was later determined that it was not always preceded by ebv infection. patient diagnosed with cfs have shown a noticeably earlier activation of anaerobic metabolism as a source of energy, which is suggestive of impaired oxygen consumption. the differential diagnoses range from tick-borne illnesses to psychiatric disorders to thyroid gland dysfunction. given the many overlapping symptoms of cfs with other illnesses makes diagnosing it far from an easy task. the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) considers it a diagnosing of exclusion, stating that self-reported fatigue for at minimum of six months and four of the following symptoms are necessary for a proper diagnosis: memory problems, sore throat, post-exertion malaise, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, myalgia, multi-joint pain, headaches, and troubled sleep. in turn, management of cfs is just as difficult. treatment ranges from conservative, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt) and antidepressants, to minimally invasive management. minimally invasive management involving ranscutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation of target points has demonstrated significant improvement in fatigue and associated symptoms in a 2017 randomized controlled study. the understanding of cfs is evolving before us as we continue to learn more about it. as further reliable studies are conducted, providing a better grasp of what the syndrome encompasses, we will be able to improve our diagnosis and management of it.",1
"the three vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) work well and fewer vaccinated people get sick. breakthrough infections still sometimes happen, which means vaccinated people may get sick. we need data on the use of the same booster and boosters that are different from the primary vaccine in fully vaccinated people. in this clinical trial, fully vaccinated adults with no reported history of covid-19 infection got a booster injection at least 12 weeks after the primary vaccination. they got one of the three vaccines: moderna, johnson & johnson-janssen, or pfizer. on trial days 15 and 29 they were checked for booster safety, signs of the body’s response to the vaccine, and ability to build up protection against the covid-19 virus. 458 people participated in the trial. 154 got moderna, 150 got johnson & johnson, and 153 got pfizer. signs of the body’s response to the booster were similar to the primary vaccine. more than half had injection-site pain, general discomfort, headache, or muscle aches. all boosters increased the body's ability to protect itself against the sars-cov-2 virus from 4-fold to over 70-fold. the numbers of the antibodies that protect against covid-19 increased from 5-fold to over 50-fold. using the same vaccine for the boosters increased the protection up to 20-fold, but using a different vaccine increased the protection more. all boosters, except for johnson & johnson, increased the body's ability to protect itself agains the spike that the virus uses to get into the body cells. the johnson & johnson booster increased the number of cells that block the virus spike in people who were vaccinated with moderna or pfizer. all boosters were safe and increased protection against covid-19 in adults who were fully vaccinated at least 12 weeks earlier.",0
"inguinal hernia, a bulging of digestive organs occurring in the groin area, is the most often diagnosed hernia. during their lifetime one third of males are diagnosed with an inguinal hernia. people are most likely to get an inguinal hernia in childhood and after 50 years old. doctors usually diagnose an inguinal hernia by a lump in the groin region although some patients can have blocked intestines. inguinal hernia repair is the only treatment and is one of the most common surgeries done. surgery is usually non-urgent and done under anesthesia. the repair involves strengthening the area of the groin, often using a plastic mesh; either by traditional or minimally invasive surgery. the most common complications after a hernia repair are the hernia returning and long-term discomfort, but the rate of a hernia returning has gone down with the use of mesh and minimally invasive surgery. this data-driven review describes the spread, contributing factors, and causes of inguinal hernias and the most common surgeries, focusing on recent methods.",0
"to try improving treatment in glioblastoma (a brain cancer), this work collected data on the cancer's symptoms and traits along with references to perphenazine (an anti-psychotic medication). this study found five areas of possibly beneficial treatment. 5 perphenazine attributes of benefit to glioblastoma treatment include blocking two target sites for chemical messengers, reducing movement of specific cells, activating certain enzymes, and reducing nausea. perphenazine works with current chemradiotherapy and common medicines used to treat glioblastoma. perphenzaine attributes argue for a trial to add it to current standard treatment with temozolomide (an anti-cancer drug) and irradiation. a specific brain region seeds the brain with mutated cells that become reappearing gliobastoma after outward movement. the current work shows how perphenazine may reduce this outward growing brain cancer. perphenazine is an old, common, cheap antipsychotic drug used clinically worldwide since the 1950's. perphenzaine has been well-tolerated in psychiatric groups, in healthy groups, and in non-psychiatric but medically ill groups who use perphenazine to reduce nausea. for now (summer, 2020), glioblastoma needs a multi-drug approach until a core treatment can be identified. perphenazine has many attributes that recommend its use in glioblastoma treatment.",0
"physical therapy is routinely delivered to patients after discharge from the hospital following knee arthroplasty. posthospitalization physical therapy is thought to be beneficial, particularly for those patients most at risk of poor outcome, the subgroup with persistent function-limiting pain, despite an apparently successful surgery. research teams have undertaken 3 large-scale multicenter phase 3 randomized clinical trials designed specifically for patients at risk of poor outcome following knee arthroplasty. all 3 trials screened for poor outcome risk using different methods and investigated different physical therapist interventions delivered in different ways. despite the variety of types of physical therapy and mode of delivery, all trials found no effects of the enhanced treatment compared with usual care. in all cases, usual care required a lower dosage of physical therapy compared with the enhanced interventions. this perspective compares and contrasts the 3 trials, speculates on factors that could explain the no-effect findings, and proposes areas for future study designed to benefit the poor outcome phenotype.",1
"background: monoclonal antibody therapy (mat) is recommended in mild to moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) patients who are at risk of progressing to severe disease. due to limited data on its outcomes and the logistic challenges in administering the drug, mat has not been widely used in the united states (us) despite of emergency use authorization (eua) approval by the food and drug administration (fda). aim: we aim to study the outcomes of mat in patients predominantly from ethnic minority groups and the challenges we experienced in implementing the infusion therapy protocol in an inner-city safety-net-hospital in the south bronx. methods and results: we conducted a retrospective observational study of 49 patients who were offered mat as per eua protocol of fda. patient who met the criteria for mat and received therapy were included in treatment group (n = 38) and the remaining (n = 11) who declined treatment were included in the control group. a majority of patients (76%) in the study group reported symptomatic improvement, the day after infusion. there was statistically significant reduction in covid-19 related hospitalizations (7.8 vs 54.5%, p = < 0.001) mortality (0 vs 18.1%, p value = 0.008) in the treatment group. conclusion: mat reduced both hospitalization and mortality in this predominantly hispanic patient population with mild to moderate covid-19 with high risk factors for disease progression.",1
"objective: to determine the effect of carbohydrate restriction on perinatal outcome in patients with diet-controlled gestational diabetes mellitus (gdm). methods: women with diet-controlled gdm were divided non-randomly into two groups based on their dietary carbohydrate content: those with low dietary carbohydrate content (below 42%) and those with high dietary carbohydrate content (exceeding 45%). subjects kept dietary accounts and were followed with daily fasting and postprandial glucose assessments. subjects also were tested daily for urinary ketones. glycosylated hemoglobin, mean fasting and postprandial glucose values, incidence of macrosomia and large for gestational age (lga) infants, cesarean deliveries for cephalopelvic disproportion and macrosomia, and need for insulin therapy were compared between the groups. results: the two groups were identical in terms of demographic characteristics. significant reductions in the postprandial glucose values were seen among subjects in the low-carbohydrate group (p < .04). fewer subjects in the low-carbohydrate group required the addition of insulin for glucose control (p < .047; relative risk [rr] 0.14; 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.02, 1.00). the incidence of lga infants was significantly lower in the low-carbohydrate group (p < .035; rr 0.22; 95% ci 0.05, 0.91). subjects in the low carbohydrate group also had a lower rate of cesarean deliveries for cephalopelvic disproportion and macrosomia (p < .037; rr 0.15; 95% ci 0.04, 0.94). conclusion: carbohydrate restriction in patients with diet-controlled gdm results in improved glycemic control, less need for insulin therapy, a decrease in the incidence lga infants, and a decrease in cesarean deliveries for cephalopelvic disproportion and macrosomia.",1
"objective: the spectrum and frequency of causes and the diagnostic protocol for chronic cough were explored. methods: a total of 194 patients with at least 3 weeks of chronic cough and normal chest radiographs were recruited from the outpatient clinic of guangzhou institute of respiratory diseases between july 2003 to june 2004. the causes were investigated using a well-established protocol. the diagnostic protocol included history inquiring and physical examination, pulmonary function tests, induced sputum cell differentials, 24 h esophageal ph monitoring, ct of the paranasal sinuses or chest, fiberoptic rhinoscopy or bronchoscopy. the final diagnosis was made based on clinical manifestation, examination findings and a positive response to therapy. results: the cause of chronic cough was defined in 95.4% of the patients, with a single cause found in 153 patients (82.7%), and multiple causes in 32 patients (17.3%). the five most important causes of cough were: eosinophilic bronchitis (n = 51, 22.4%), rhinitis and/or paranasal sinusitis (pnds, n = 39, 17.1%), cough-variant asthma (n = 31, 13.6%), atopic cough (n = 28, 12.3%), and gastroesophageal reflux (n = 27, 11.8%). conclusions: the spectrum and frequency of causes of chronic cough in our study is different from the previous reports in western countries. eosinophilic bronchitis and atopic cough are important causes of chronic cough. a modified diagnostic protocol was established accordingly.",1
"background: antipsychotic drugs are the core treatment for schizophrenia. treatment guidelines state that there is no difference in efficacy between the various first-generation antipsychotics, however, low-potency first-generation antipsychotic drugs are sometimes perceived as less efficacious than high-potency first-generation compounds by clinicians, and they also seem to differ in their side effects. authors' conclusions: the results do not show a superiority in efficacy of high-potency perphenazine compared with low-potency first-generation antipsychotics. there is some evidence that perphenazine is more likely to cause akathisia and less likely to cause severe toxicity, but most adverse effect results were equivocal. the number of studies as well as the quality of studies is low, with quality of evidence for the main outcomes ranging from moderate to very low, so more randomised evidence would be needed for conclusions to be made.",1
"detecting chemical compounds in exhaled human breath may help determine health status, identify disease, or measure environmental exposure. recent advances in research of small energy molecules (metabolomics) led to better methods to explore human health status in breath. despite some methodological challenges, exhaled breath is a desirable tool for metabolomics due to its non-surgery, convenient, and limitless availability. many breath-based tests that target internal or external gas compounds are established and used in practice. this review outlines the concept of breath analysis regarding these unique breath-based tests and their applications. the breath biological disease markers in each test are discussed based on their production in humans and development and use of the associated tests. the paper ends with a short look into future tests and direction of breath research.",0
"this multicentre study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and consequences of progressive or abrupt withdrawal of clobazam in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in a double blind study in comparison to lorazepam and buspirone. 128 outpatients suffering from generalized anxiety disorder according to dms iii criteria were included in the study and treated for three weeks. they were randomly divided into 4 groups: group 1: 32 patients receiving clobazam, abruptly withdrawn and replaced by a placebo; group 2: 29 patients receiving clobazam with progressive withdrawal over 3 weeks, clobazam being replaced by a placebo; group 3: 33 patients receiving lorazepam with progressive withdrawal over 3 weeks, lorazepam being replaced by a placebo; group 4: 34 patients receiving buspirone, abruptly withdrawn and replaced by a placebo. the dosages were increased progressively during the first week of treatment. at the end of this time, the patients received either 30 mg clobazam or 30 mg buspirone or 3 mg lorazepam daily. after the first week, the hamilton anxiety rating scale (hars) showed a significant improvement in clobazam and lorazepam groups but not in buspirone group. all the drugs were equally effective after three weeks of treatment. the anti-anxiety activity persisted after withdrawal of the studied drug in the 4 groups, without any signs of rebound anxiety or withdrawal syndrome. no clinically relevant differences were found between the 4 groups regarding safety. the side-effects reported were mainly drowsiness in clobazam and lorazepam groups, nausea and headache in buspirone group. in conclusion, clobazam like lorazepam improved anxiety more quickly than buspirone; after 3 weeks of therapy, efficacy was comparable with the 3 drugs and persisted after treatment discontinuation.",1
"over 80 mabs have been shown to block the interaction between the sars-cov-2 s1 glycoprotein and its cellular receptor, thus neutralizing virus infectivity in vitro. some of those mabs demonstrate therapeutic efficacy to curtail viral burden and lung inflammation in animal models. the neutralization mechanisms of mabs against sars-cov-2 in vivo are not fully understood, but optimal protection correlates with fc effector functions. approximately 30 sars-cov-2 neutralizing m abs are undergoing clinical trials in covid-19 patients. some were granted emergency authorization since they reduced viral load, disease severity, and hospitalization in randomized, controlled phase ii clinical trials. however, mabs are unaffordable for healthcare systems in many developing countries due to their high cost (> usd 1,500/vial), meaning that most infected people would not have access to them. another obstacle for covid-19 therapy with mabs is the emergence of viral variants harboring changes in the receptor-binding domain (rbd) of the s1 glycoprotein. the variants of concern (voc) exhibit enhanced transmissibility or virulence, circulate worldwide, and include those designated as alpha, beta, epsilon, gamma, and delta, first detected in the uk, south africa, brazil, usa, and india, respectively. therapeutic mabs, and antibodies in the plasma of vaccinated or convalescent individuals, fail to neutralize voc efficiently.",1
"underactive thyroid is one of the most common conditions caused by a lack of specific hormones in adults. underactive thyroid is usually easily identified and successfully treated. however, small changes in thyroid function determine symptoms that can be caused by many conditions. primary underactive thyroid caused by a long-term inflamed thyroid, which in turn is caused by thyroid cells that are attacked by infection-preventing cells, is the most common cause of too little thyroid hormones in adults. central underactive thyroid, which is not very common and has many causes, is when an otherwise normal thyroid makes too little thyroid hormone due to lack of thyroid-stimulating hormone. thyroid hormone replacement with levothyroxine (lt4) is the normal treatment of primary and central underactive thyroid. treatment guidelines for an underactive thyroid recommend a single drug, levothyroxine (lt4), because of how well it works, how long it has been used, few side effects, how easy it is to use, how well it is absorbed in the stomach, how long it lasts in the blood, and low cost. although taking lt4 daily treats underactive thyroid, many people still have underactive thyroids due to conditions that do not allow absorption in the stomach, inflammation of the stomach lining caused by thyroid cells that are attacked by infection-preventing cells, pancreatic and live disease, two or more drugs interacting with each other, gene variations, eating too much fiber, and more commonly, not following the prescribed lt4 treatment. taking levothyroxine as prescribed for underactive thyroid depends on when and if it is taken on an empty stomach. for all of these reasons, many adults still have underactive thyroids. doctors have tried many ways to make people take levothyroxine as prescribed and make levothyroxine more easily absorbed in the stomach.",0
"emerging evidence suggests that endothelial activation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) and multi-organ failure in patients with covid-19. however, the molecular mechanisms underlying endothelial activation in covid-19 patients remain unclear. in this study, the sars-cov-2 viral proteins that potently activate human endothelial cells were screened to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in endothelial activation. it was found that nucleocapsid protein (np) of sars-cov-2 significantly activated human endothelial cells through tlr2/nf-κb and mapk signaling pathways. moreover, by screening a natural microbial compound library containing 154 natural compounds, simvastatin was identified as a potent inhibitor of np-induced endothelial activation. remarkablely, though the protein sequences of n proteins from coronaviruses are highly conserved, only np from sars-cov-2 induced endothelial activation. the nps from other coronaviruses such as sars-cov, mers-cov, hub1-cov and influenza virus h1n1 did not activate endothelial cells. these findings are well consistent with the results from clinical investigations showing broad endotheliitis and organ injury in severe covid-19 patients. in conclusion, the study provides insights on sars-cov-2-induced vasculopathy and coagulopathy, and suggests that simvastatin, an fda-approved lipid-lowering drug, may benefit to prevent the pathogenesis and improve the outcome of covid-19 patients. importance coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), caused by the betacoronavirus sars-cov-2, is a worldwide challenge for health-care systems. the leading cause of mortality in patients with covid-19 is hypoxic respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). to date, pulmonary endothelial cells (ecs) have been largely overlooked as a therapeutic target in covid-19, yet emerging evidence suggests that these cells contribute to the initiation and propagation of ards by altering vessel barrier integrity, promoting a pro-coagulative state, inducing vascular inflammation and mediating inflammatory cell infiltration. therefore, a better mechanistic understanding of the vasculature is of utmost importance. in this study, we screened the sars-cov-2 viral proteins that potently activate human endothelial cells and found that nucleocapsid protein (np) significantly activated human endothelial cells through tlr2/nf-κb and mapk signaling pathways. moreover, by screening a natural microbial compound library containing 154 natural compounds, simvastatin was identified as a potent inhibitor of np-induced endothelial activation. our results provide insights on sars-cov-2-induced vasculopathy and coagulopathy, and suggests that simvastatin, an fda-approved lipid-lowering drug, may benefit to prevent the pathogenesis and improve the outcome of covid-19 patients.",1
"many drugs often used to treat generalized anxiety disorder (gad) have been labeled ""potentially inappropriate"" for use in patients 65-years-old and above because they may cause more risks than benefits. however, it is not known how often these drugs are given to patients. from a database of patients in germany, we identified all patients 65-years-old and above with gad who had seen a primary care doctor or received a prescription between 10/1/2003 and 9/30/2004. among drugs to treat gad (including benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants [tcas], ssris, venlafaxine, hydroxyzine, buspirone, pregabalin, and trifluoperazine), long-acting benzodiazepines, some short-acting benzodiazepines at relatively high doses, some tcas, and hydroxyzine were categorized ""potentially inappropriate"" for people 65-years-old and above. we looked at 975 elderly patients with gad. average age was 75 years, and 72% were women; 29% were also diagnosed with depression. forty percent of people in the study were given inappropriate anxiety-treating drugs - most often, bromazepam (10% of all subjects), diazepam (9%), doxepin (7%), amitriptyline (5%), and lorazepam (5%). twenty-three percent of people in the study were given long-acting benzodiazepines, 10% were given short-acting benzodiazepines at relatively high doses, and 12% were given tcas categorized as potentially inappropriate. we conclude that german doctors often prescribe drugs labeled as potentially inappropriate to their elderly patients with gad, especially those also diagnosed with depression. more research is needed to understand whether certain groups of elderly patients with gad exist with whom the benefits outweigh the risks of these drugs.",0
"background: to develop an ostai tool and compare this with the national osteoporosis foundation recommendations in 2013 (nof 2013) for bone mineral density (bmd) testing among taiwan postmenopausal women. methods: taiwan osteoporosis association (toa) conducted a nationwide bmd survey by a bus installed with a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (dxa) between 2008 and 2011. all of the participants completed questionnaire, which included demographics and risk factors of osteoporotic fracture in frax tool. we used the database to analyze potential risk factors for osteoporosis and followed the model by koh et al. to develop a risk index via multiple variable regression analysis and item reduction. we used the index values to set up a simple algorithm (namely ostai) to identify those who need bmd measurement. receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve and the area under the curve (auc) was used to compare the sensitivity/specificity analysis of this model with that of recommendations by nof 2013. results: a total of 12,175 taiwan postmenopausal women enrolled in this survey. the index value was derived by age and body weight of the participants according to weighted odds of each risk factor and the selected cutoff value was set at ""-1"". there are 6393 (52.5%) participants whose index value is below ""-1"" and whose risk of osteoporosis was 57.5% (3674/6393). the auc for ostai and nof 2013 were 0.739 (95% confidence interval (ci), 0.728-0.749, p<0.001) and 0.618 (95% ci, 0.606-0.630, p<0.001), respectively. the sensitivity and specificity of ostai, at the selected cutoff value of -1, and nof 2013 to identify osteoporosis were 73.1%, 62.0% and 78.3%, 45.7%, respectively. conclusions: as osta for asian populations, ostai is an useful tool to identify taiwan postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, in comparison with nof 2013, ostai may be an easier and better tool for referral to bmd measurement by dxa in this area.",1
"the classification of diabetes was originally limited to only two categories called juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus, now known as type 1 diabetes mellitus, and adult-onset diabetes mellitus, now known as type 2 diabetes mellitus. this has grown to a recognition of more than 50 subcategories caused by various pathogenic mechanisms or accompanying other diseases and syndromes. the diagnosis of diabetes has evolved from physician recognition of typical symptoms to detection of ambient hyperglycemia and, thence, to the definition of excessive plasma glucose levels after an overnight fast and/or following challenge with a glucose load (oral glucose tolerance test or ogtt), and more recently, by measurement of glycated hemoglobin (a1c). screening has uncovered a much higher prevalence of diabetes in the united states and elsewhere, as well as its enormous public health impact. modern testing has defined individuals at high risk for the development of diabetes and pregnant women whose fetuses are at increased risk for mortality and morbidity. diagnostic glycemic criteria for presymptomatic diabetes have been set using diabetic retinopathy as a specific complication of the disease: a1c ≥6.5%; fasting plasma glucose (fpg) ≥126 mg/dl; or plasma glucose measured 2 hours after an ogtt (2-hour pg) ≥200 mg/dl. for patients with typical symptoms, a random plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dl is diagnostic. the 2-hour pg yields the highest prevalence and a1c the lowest. a1c is the most convenient and practical test, requiring no preparation, is analytically superior, and has the lowest intraindividual variation. it is more expensive than the fpg, but the same or less than the ogtt. the 2-hour pg is the most burdensome to the patient and has the highest intraindividual variation. standardized measurement of a1c is not available everywhere. confirmation of an abnormal test with the same test is recommended. studies in various populations show inconsistency among the glycemic tests. of people meeting the a1c criterion, 27%–98% meet plasma glucose criteria. of people meeting plasma glucose criteria, 17%–78% meet the a1c criterion. these discrepancies occur because each test measures different aspects of hyperglycemia that may vary among patients. while the risk of future diabetes is continuously associated with plasma glucose and a1c, the areas between the upper limits of normal and the diabetes cutpoints have been called “prediabetes” or “high risk for diabetes.” these have been defined categorically as a1c 6.0%–6.4% or 5.7%–6.4%; impaired fasting glucose (ifg), fpg 100–125 mg/dl; and impaired glucose tolerance (igt), 2-hour pg 140–199 mg/dl. a1c 6.0%–6.4% increases the odds ratio (or) for progression to diabetes (or 12.5–16) more than the range of 5.7%–6.4% (or 9.2). in u.s. studies, the incidence of type 2 diabetes averages approximately 6% per year in people with igt and can reverse spontaneously. ifg is more prevalent than igt in the united states, though igt rises more sharply with age. ifg increases the risk of future diabetes to various degrees in different countries, with odds ratios ranging from 2.9 to 18.5.",1
"purpose of review: hyperkalemia is a potentially fatal electrolyte disorder, more commonly present when the potassium excretion capacity is imparied. hyperkalemia can lead to adverse outcomes, especially due to severe cardiac arrhythmias. it can also impair the cardiovascular effects of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (raasis) and potassium rich diets, as hyperkalemia frequently leads to their discontinuation. recent findings: potassium is a predictor of mortality and should be monitored closely for patients who are at risk for hyperkalemia. acute hyperkalemia protocols have been revised and updated. randomized trials have shown that the new anti-hyperkalemic agents (patiromer and zirconium cyclosilicate) are effective hyperkalemia treatment options. the use of anti-hyperkalemic agents may allow for a less restrictive potassium diet and lower raasi discontinuation rates. summary: hyperkalemia should be monitored closely for high-risk patients, as it is associated with adverse outcomes. new therapies have demonstrated effective control, offering hope for potential use in patients that would benefit from diet or medications associated with an increase in serum potassium, indicating that the use of hyperkalemic agents can be associated with better outcomes.",1
"we encountered an elderly male patient who after cardiac surgery for mitral stenosis had refractory pitting edema in both legs involving painful leg joints after a 1-month history of waxing and waning arthralgia. his family doctor had prescribed a combination of diuretics, 40 mg furosemide and 25 mg spironolactone; however, pitting edema in his lower legs persisted. he was diagnosed with worsening of congestive heart failure because of a previous cardiac surgery and was transferred to our hospital. on admission, we closely observed the patient's condition and noticed that his body temperature increased to 38.0 °c every evening. furthermore, his ankle joints felt feverish and were swollen. therefore, we suspected polyarthritis as an etiology, although we initially suspected rheumatoid arthritis (ra). antibody testing did not support ra diagnosis; therefore we concluded the association of remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema (rs3pe) syndrome with his condition. after daily treatment with 15 mg prednisolone, the refractory edema symptom dramatically improved. the concept of rs3pe syndrome could explain such as an impressive clinical course. <learning objective: physicians encounter patients with pitting edema of unknown etiology in daily clinical practice. in particular, cardiologists usually tend to prescribe diuretics for patients with pitting edema in their legs. cardiologists should consider rs3pe syndrome as a differential diagnosis, for patients with localized pitting edema in their extremities. this report cautions regarding arbitrarily prescribing diuretics for localized pitting edema.>.",1
"osteoporosis-related fractures affect approximately one in two white women and one in five white men in their lifetime. the impact of fractures includes loss of function, significant costs, and increased mortality. the u.s. preventive services task force recommends using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry to screen all women 65 years and older, and younger women who have an increased fracture risk as determined by the world health organization's frax fracture risk assessment tool. although guidelines are lacking for rescreening women who have normal bone mineral density on initial screening, intervals of at least four years appear safe. the u.s. preventive services task force found insufficient evidence to recommend screening for osteoporosis in men; other organizations recommend screening all men 70 years and older. in patients with newly diagnosed osteoporosis, suggested laboratory tests to identify secondary causes include serum 25-hydroxyvitamin d, calcium, creatinine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone. first-line treatment to prevent fractures consists of fall prevention, smoking cessation, moderation of alcohol intake, and bisphosphonate therapy. clinicians should consider discontinuing bisphosphonate therapy after five years in women without a personal history of vertebral fractures. raloxifene, teriparatide, and denosumab are alternative effective treatments for certain subsets of patients and for those who are unable to take or whose condition does not respond to bisphosphonates. the need for follow-up bone mineral density testing in patients receiving treatment for osteoporosis is uncertain.",1
"to improve how well treatment for glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer, works, we looked at studies on the disease-related processes associated with glioblastoma and their interaction with how the antipsychotic perphenazine affects the body. that study found five areas of possibly helpful interaction. studies showed 5 independent qualities of perphenazine that might help treat glioblastoma, including changing how cells grow and move and reducing nausea. perphenazine can be taken with current chemotherapy and radiation treatments and with commonly prescribed glioblastoma drugs. these qualities suggest the addition of perphenazine to current chemotherapy and radiation treatment should be studied. part of the brain sends out damaged cells that become recurring glioblastoma after they move outward. this paper shows how perphenazine might decrease this activity. perphenazine is an old, generic, cheap drug used to treat psychotic disorders worldwide since the 1950s. studies over time have shown perphenazine does not cause many side effects in normal people, people with mental illness, and ill people taking perphenazine to reduce nausea. as of summer 2020, glioblastoma requires multiple drugs to treat it until and unless it is better understood and a single treatment drug is found. we conclude that perphenazine has many qualities that suggest its use in treating glioblastoma.",0
"we admitted a 46 year old male to treat his worsening depression and anxiety. he had a prior history of symptoms of schizophrenia and mood disorders and long-lasting lower back pain. he was started on gabapentin (nerve pain medication), 300 mg twice daily for his back pain and anxiety symptoms. his only other medication was hydrocodone, a pain and cough medication. over the next few days, he developed worsening swelling in both legs. he did not have any heart-related symptoms. physical exam only noted serious swelling with all lab values and imaging not being serious. gabapentin use was stopped, and his leg swelling improved over the next few days. frequency of leg swelling with gabapentin use is around 7 to 7.5% with all studies being in elderly patients receiving doses above 1200 mg/day. this case shows that lower doses of gabapentin can also cause this harmful effect. this serious effect should be noted since gabapentin is used in conditions like diabetic nerve pain, which is linked with other diseases that can give rise to swelling in both legs. presence of gabapentin-caused leg swelling can thus confuse the diagnosis.",0
"drugs used to treat psychotic disorders are usually given by mouth, but it is hard to measure if people take the drugs as instructed. slow-releasing shots, created in the 1960s, became popular as long-term treatment to keep conditions stable. perphenazine decanoate and enanthate are slow-release shots used to treat psychotic disorders. we aimed to measure the medical, social, and economic effects of slow-releasing perphenazine decanoate and enanthate shots compared to no treatment, drugs used to treat psychotic disorders by mouth, and other slow-releasing shots used to treat psychotic disorders for people with schizophrenia (a reality-distorting mental illness). we state that slow-releasing perphenazine shots are used in denmark, finland, iceland, norway, sweden, belgium, portugal, and the netherlands. at least 250,000 people have schizophrenia in these countries and could be given slow-releasing perphenazine shots. the four trials with useful results had 313 total people. none of the studies compared the effects of antipsychotics taken by mouth to a slow-releasing shot. people with schizophrenia should use their own judgement until more studies are done and doctors know the effects of slow-release perphenazine shots.",0
"pediatric generalized anxiety disorder (gad) is characterized by excessive and uncontrollable worry about a variety of events and is accompanied by physical symptoms such as headaches, tension, restlessness, gastrointestinal distress, and heart palpitations. symptoms impose marked distress and interfere with social, emotional, and educational functioning. gad occurs in over 10% of children and adolescents, has an average age of onset of 8.5 years, and is more often reported in girls. common co-occurring conditions include separation anxiety disorder and social phobia. assessment involves a multi-informant, multi-method approach involving the child, parents, and school teachers. a clinical interview should be conducted to assess for the three primary ways anxiety presents: behaviors, thoughts, and somatic symptoms. several semi-structured diagnostic interviews are available, and the anxiety disorders interview schedule is increasingly used. rating scales completed by the patient, caregivers, and teachers provide useful information for diagnosis and symptom monitoring. several scales are available to assess patients for the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th edition) gad diagnosis; however, instruments generally cannot distinguish children with gad from children with similar anxiety disorders. both cognitive-behavioral therapy (cbt) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) have demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of pediatric anxiety disorders including gad. evidence suggests that the combination of cbt plus sertraline offers additional benefit compared with either treatment alone. with pharmacotherapy, systematic tracking of treatment-emergent adverse events such as headaches, stomach aches, behavioral activation, worsening symptoms, and emerging suicidal thoughts is important. recommended starting doses are fluvoxamine 25 mg/day, fluoxetine 10 mg/day, and sertraline 25 mg/day, though lower starting doses are possible. dosing can be adjusted as often as weekly with the goal of achieving a high-quality response, while minimizing side effects. long-term treatment with medication has not been well studied; however, to achieve optimal long-term outcome extended use of medication may be required. it is recommended to continue medication for approximately 1 year following remission in symptoms, and when discontinuing medication to choose a stress-free time of the year. if symptoms return, medication re-initiation should be considered seriously.",1
"objective: we evaluated the interaction of serum folate and vitamin b12 with methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) c677t genotypes on the risk of first ischemic stroke and on the efficacy of folic acid treatment in prevention of first ischemic stroke. methods: a total of 20,702 hypertensive adults were randomized to a double-blind treatment of daily enalapril 10 mg and folic acid 0.8 mg or enalapril 10 mg alone. participants were followed up every 3 months. results: median values of folate and b12 concentrations at baseline were 8.1 ng/ml and 280.2 pmol/l, respectively. over a median of 4.5 years, among those not receiving folic acid, participants with baseline serum b12 or serum folate above the median had a significantly lower risk of first ischemic stroke (hazard ratio [hr], 0.74; 95% confidence interval [ci], 0.57-0.96), especially in those with mthfr 677 cc genotype (wild-type) (hr, 0.49; 95% ci, 0.31-0.78). folic acid treatment significantly reduced the risk of first ischemic stroke in participants with both folate and b12 below the median (2.3% in enalapril-folic acid group vs 3.6% in enalapril-only group; hr, 0.62; 95% ci, 0.46-0.86), particularly in mthfr 677 cc carriers (1.6% vs 4.9%; hr, 0.24; 95% ci, 0.11-0.55). however, tt homozygotes responded better with both folate and b12 levels above the median (hr, 0.28; 95% ci, 0.10-0.75). conclusions: the risk of first ischemic stroke was significantly higher in hypertensive patients with low levels of both folate and b12. effect of folic acid treatment was greatest in patients with low folate and b12 with the cc genotype, and with high folate and b12 with the tt genotype.",1
"tardive dyskinesia (td) is a condition of potentially irreversible abnormal involuntary movements associated with dopamine receptor blocking agents, such as antipsychotics. while prevention is the best strategy, it is not always possible. this report outlines strategies to reduce td symptoms, including the use of the fda-approved treatment options (valbenazine and deutetrabenazine).",1
"objective: postpartum mood disorders represent a serious problem affecting 10-20% of women and support groups offer a promising intervention modality. the current study examined participant satisfaction with and effectiveness of a peer-facilitated postpartum support group. intervention: the program consists of a free, peer-support group, developed to increase social support and destigmatise postpartum mood symptoms. the weekly group is co-facilitated by former group attendees and maternal health professionals. setting: the peer-support program is offered in an urban city in the southeastern united states. design: to address study aims, a community-based participatory research approach was implemented. participant satisfaction was assessed via mixed methods analyses. differences in depression scores at follow-up between program attendees and a community sample were examined via weighted linear regression analysis following propensity score analysis. finally, within-group change in depression scores for program attendees was examined using a repeated measures anova. participants: intake program data were provided by the sponsoring organisation (n = 73) and follow-up data were collected via an online survey from program attendees (n = 45). a community sample was recruited to establish a comparison group (n = 152). measurements and findings: participant satisfaction was high with overwhelmingly positive perceptions of the program. postparticipation depression scores were similar to those of the community sample at follow-up (p = .447). among attendees, pre-post analyses revealed reductions in depression symptoms with significant interactions for time × complications (p ≤ .001) and time × delivery method (p ≤ .017). key conclusions: overall, findings indicate this peer-support program is not only acceptable to program attendees but also they provide a potential mechanism for improving mental health outcomes; however, further evaluation is needed. findings also emphasise the importance of integrating evaluation procedures into community-based mental health programming to support effectiveness. implications for practice: peer-support groups are an acceptable form of intervention for women experiencing postpartum depression.",1
"the pandemic caused by the new coronavirus has caused shock waves in many countries, producing a global health crisis worldwide. lack of knowledge of the biological mechanisms of viruses, plus the absence of effective treatments against the disease (covid-19) and/or vaccines have pulled factors that can compromise the proper functioning of the immune system to fight against infectious diseases into the spotlight. the optimal status of specific nutrients is considered crucial to keeping immune components within their normal activity, helping to avoid and overcome infections. specifically, the european food safety authority (efsa) evaluated and deems six vitamins (d, a, c, folate, b6, b12) and four minerals (zinc, iron, copper and selenium) to be essential for the normal functioning of the immune system, due to the scientific evidence collected so far. in this report, an update on the evidence of the contribution of nutritional factors as immune-enhancing aspects, factors that could reduce their bioavailability, and the role of the optimal status of these nutrients within the covid-19 pandemic context was carried out. first, a non-systematic review of the current state of knowledge regarding the impact of an optimal nutritional status of these nutrients on the proper functioning of the immune system as well as their potential role in covid-19 prevention/treatment was carried out by searching for available scientific evidence in pubmed and litcovid databases. second, a compilation from published sources and an analysis of nutritional data from 10 european countries was performed, and the relationship between country nutritional status and epidemiological covid-19 data (available in the worldometers database) was evaluated following an ecological study design. furthermore, the potential effect of genetics was considered through the selection of genetic variants previously identified in genome-wide association studies (gwas) as influencing the nutritional status of these 10 considered nutrients. therefore, access to genetic information in accessible databases (1000genomes, by ensembl) of individuals from european populations enabled an approximation that countries might present a greater risk of suboptimal status of the nutrients studied. results from the review approach show the importance of maintaining a correct nutritional status of these 10 nutrients analyzed for the health of the immune system, highlighting the importance of vitamin d and iron in the context of covid-19. besides, the ecological study demonstrates that intake levels of relevant micronutrients-especially vitamins d, c, b12, and iron-are inversely associated with higher covid-19 incidence and/or mortality, particularly in populations genetically predisposed to show lower micronutrient status. in conclusion, nutrigenetic data provided by joint assessment of 10 essential nutrients for the functioning of the immune system and of the genetic factors that can limit their bioavailability can be a fundamental tool to help strengthen the immune system of individuals and prepare populations to fight against infectious diseases such as covid-19.",1
"coronavirus variants of concern (variants that are easier to transmit and/or are more severe) show reduced effect from monoclonal antibodies which are drugs that may block the virus that causes covid-19 (a viral breathing-related disorder) from attaching to human cells, making it more difficult for the virus to reproduce. researchers tested equine or horse-derived polyclonal antibodies (antibody drugs that attack several parts of the covid-19 virus) that are being tested in clinical trials in costa rica against five globally circulating variants of concern: alpha, beta, epsilon, gamma and delta. the results show that equine polyclonal antibodies efficiently make the variant of concern ineffective. equine polyclonal antibodies are found to be an effective, low-cost, and accessible covid-19 treatment for the variants of concern.",0
"""inborn errors of metabolism,"" first identified 100 years ago by garrod, are metabolic errors from birth and important evidence for chemical and biological individuality. asbjörn fölling identified phenylketonuria (pku), an inherited physical disorder, in 1934. pku impairs cognitive development due to toxic buildup of a specific molecule, phenylalanine. the metabolic characteristics of pku occur due to nurture, in which a normal diet includes the molecule l-phenylalanine, and nature, where dna mutations influence the gene that creates the l-phenylalanine breakdown enzyme. the phenylalanine breakdown enzyme converts pku into another molecule, tyrosine, using oxygen and non-protein helpers. pku is among the first genetic diseases to enter, via newborn testing, publich health and demonstrate the use of successful treatment. this success of treatment has shifted attitudes about genetic diseases. pku shows how dna and genes affect physical traits, how modern humans have evolved, and how genetic databases now exist to document genetic mutations. every individual has unique, physical characteristics involving pku that require unique treatment. pku shows the genetic components of disease and health.",0
"among the many complications associated with pregnancy, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (hdp) constitute one of the most important. since the pathophysiology of hdp is complex, new disease biomarkers (dbms) are needed to serve as indicators of disease activity. however, in the current status of laboratory medicine, despite the fact that blood pressure measurement has been used for a long time, not many dbms contribute adequately to the subsequent diagnosis and treatment. in this article, we discuss studies focusing on peptide fragments in blood identified by comprehensive quantitative methods, among the currently proposed dbm candidates. furthermore, we describe the basic techniques of peptidomics, especially quantitative proteomics, and outline the current status and challenges of measuring peptides in blood as dbm for hdp.",1
"past studies describe a new process to transport and reabsorb sodium and chloride ions (atoms or molecules that carry electrical charges) from one side of the cell to the other. one is called the na+-driven cl-/2hco3- exchanger (ndcbe) that is a protein that exchanges na+ (sodium) from outside the cell for cl- (chloride) that is in the cell. there is no lab or test tube experiments that show evidence for the role of na+-driven cl-/2hco3- exchanger (ndcbe) in maintaining a sodium balance. in this present study, researchers show that reducing na+-driven cl-/2hco3- exchanger in mice causes only minor disruptions of sodium homeostasis (processes used by the body to maintain a normal sodium concentration in the fluid outside the cells). researchers provide evidence that the na+/cl- cotransporter (ncc) (the carrier protein that helps reabsorb sodium and chloride ions from tube fluid into the cells) compensated for the lack of action of the na+-driven cl-/2hco3- exchanger. to understand the role of na+-driven cl-/2hco3- exchanger, researchers generated an experiment with ndcbe/ncc double-knockout mice, mice without ncc or ndcbe. on a normal diet, ndcbe/ncc double-knockout and single-knockout mice showed similar activation of the hormone system that helps regulate blood pressure, electrolytes, and some heart-related function; however, only ndcbe/ncc double-knockout mice showed lower potassium in the blood. also, ndcbe/ncc double-knockout mice showed an increase in the surface sodium channels (enac) and the potassium channel ca2+-activated k+ channels bkca. when sodium-chloride is depleted, only ndcbe/ncc double-knockout mice developed altered blood volume contraction, despite increased kidney activity. notably, the increase in aldosterone (a hormone that regulates sodium and potassium levels) expected from the sodium-chloride loss was weakened in ndcbe/ncc double-knockout mice. single knock-out and ndcbe/ncc double-knockout mice had similar blood potassium concentrations when this occurred. in conclusion, the na+-driven cl-/2hco3- exchanger is necessary for maintaining sodium balance and volume of blood when salt is reduced or when na+/cl- cotransporter is turned off in mice. furthermore, na+-driven cl-/2hco3- exchanger has an important role in preventing hypokalemia (low levels of potassium). because na+/cl- cotransporter and na+-driven cl-/2hco3- exchanger are both targets of thiazide targets (which reduces sodium reabsorption), the combined slowing of na+/cl- cotransporter and the na+-driven cl-/2hco3- exchanger/pendrin system (a multifaceted transporter that plays important roles in various functions of the kidney) may explain thiazide generated hypokalemia in some patients.",0
"‘mix-and-match’ boosters against covid-19 are being studied in uk and spain using oxford, pfizer, moderna and novavax vaccines. other combinations of coronavac, janssen, and cansino are also being tested. the ‘mix-and-match’ strategy has been used before to develop body protection against other diseases. we will try to understand why this approach might work for covid-19. to study the mix-and-match approach, we look at how the different vaccines work, the chemicals in the vaccines and their side effects. the mix-and-match strategy is safe, improves body protection and allows to deal with vaccine shortages.",0
"tardive dyskinesia is characterized by possibly irreversible, abnormal, uncontrolled movements related to the use of antipsychotics. we try to suggest ways to treat tardive dyskinesia. preventing tardive dyskinesia is very important, and doctors should prescribe antipsychotics as recommended, including only prescribing them for certain conditions, using the lowest working dose, and limiting how long patients take them. the first recommended treatment of tardive dyskinesia is to have the patient stop taking antipsychotics if possible. stopping antipsychotics is not possible for many patients with serious mental illness due to the disease returning. switching from a first-generation (older) to a second-generation (newer) antipsychotic, such as clozapine or quetiapine, may help reduce tardive dyskinesia symptoms. studies show tests with new vesicular monoamine transporter (vmat) inhibitors, drugs that reduce dopamine (a chemical messenger released when your brain is expecting a reward), deutetrabenazine and valbenazine, to be the best additional treatment for tardive dyskinesia. canada has not approved these drugs for use. we conclude that information on tardive dyskinesia treatment is limited, and preventing td is the best way to manage it. more studies that look at safety and how well deutetrabenazine and valbenazine work are needed, and it is uncertain how reliably available these drugs are to patients outside of the united states.",0
"early detection of many disorders, mainly inherited, is feasible with population-wide analysis of newborn dried blood spot samples. phenylketonuria was the prototype disorder for newborn screening (nbs) and early dietary treatment has resulted in vastly improved outcomes for this disorder. testing for primary hypothyroidism and cystic fibrosis (cf) was later added to nbs programs following the development of robust immunoassays and molecular testing. current cf testing usually relies on a combined immunoreactive trypsin/mutation detection strategy. multiplex testing for approximately 25 inborn errors of metabolism using tandem mass spectrometry is a relatively recent addition to nbs. the simultaneous introduction of many disorders has caused some re-evaluation of the traditional guidelines for nbs, because very rare disorders or disorders without good treatments can be included with minimal effort. nbs tests for many other disorders have been developed, but these are less uniformly applied or are currently considered developmental. this review focuses on australasian nbs practices.",1
"cystic echinococcosis or hydatid disease is caused by the infection with the larval stage of long tapeworm, echinococcus granulosus. this condition often remains asymptomatic for years before the cyst grows large enough to cause symptoms in affected organs. the most common organs involved are liver and lungs although the heart, brain, bone, central nervous system, and kidney may also be involved. this case is about a young woman who presented with left flank pain and urinary tract infection who was later diagnosed as having left renal hydatid cyst. the cyst was approximately 7.8×6.6×8cm with internal multiple septations at the lower pole cortex of the left kidney. laparoscopic pericystectomy was performed and with no postoperative complications, she was discharged on albendazole and other supportive medication. with timely management using combination therapy, this condition is curable and the patient can live a healthy life with normal kidney function.",1
"twenty-five patients with panic disorder were treated with the serotonin uptake inhibitor fluoxetine (a common antidepressant) for up to 12 months. for most, treatment started with 5 mg/day to reduce side effects. nineteen (76%) showed improvement in panic attacks. four (16%) could not stand fluoxetine due to its side effects. using low starting doses of fluoxetine for panic disorders may improve its acceptability and use.",0
"the objective of this study was to evaluate whether first-degree relatives (fdrs) of patients with type 2 diabetes had abnormal circadian insulin secretion and, if so, whether this abnormality affected their glucose metabolism. six african-american fdrs with normal glucose tolerance and 12 matched normal control subjects (who had no family history of diabetes) were exposed to 48 h of hyperglycemic clamping (approximately 12 mmol/l). insulin secretion rates (isrs) were determined by deconvolution of plasma c-peptide levels using individual c-peptide kinetic parameters. detrending and smoothing of data (z-scores) and computation of autocorrelation functions were used to identify isr cycles. during the initial hours after start of glucose infusions, isrs were approximately 60% higher in fdrs than in control subjects (585 vs. 366 nmol/16 h, p < 0.05), while rates of glucose uptake were the same (5.6 mmol x kg(-1) x h(-1)), indicating that the fdrs were insulin resistant. control subjects had well-defined circadian (24 h) cycles of isr and plasma insulin that rose in the early morning, peaked in the afternoon, and declined during the night. in contrast, fdrs had several shorter isr cycles of smaller amplitude that lacked true periodicity. this suggested that the lack of a normal circadian isr increase had made it impossible for the fdrs to maintain their compensatory insulin hypersecretion beyond 18 h of hyperglycemia. as a result, isr decreased to the level found in control subjects, and glucose uptake fell below the level of control subjects (61 vs. 117 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1), p < 0.05). in summary, we found that fdrs with normal glucose tolerance had defects in insulin action and secretion. the newly recognized insulin secretory defect consisted of disruption of the normal circadian isr cycle, which resulted in reduced insulin secretion (and glucose uptake) during the ascending part of the 24 h isr cycle.",1
"our first goal in this article was to establish a database of literature and other evidence on newborn screening programmes and technology for genetic disorders related to metabolism. we also aimed to rigorously review data to evaluate newborn screening for genetic disorders related to metabolism. we aimed to summarize the evidence for whether various newborn screening programs for genetic disorders related to metabolism are appropriate and necessary. we aimed to make this summary in relation to the natural history of these diseases, and for both existing and possible programs. we further aimed to identify gaps in knowledge and make recommendations for further research that is needed. finally, we aimed to make recommendations for the future development and organisation of newborn screening for genetic disorders related to metabolism in the uk. there were three parts to this research. we rigorously reviewed research papers on genetic disorders related to metabolism, newborn screening programs, new technologies for screening, and economic factors. we decided how we would include or exclude papers, and made a working database of relevant papers. all the papers we selected were read by two or three experts and were critically assessed using a standard format. seven criteria for a screening programme, based on the principles formulated by wilson and jungner (who, 1968), were used to summarise the evidence. these were the following: the disorder is well defined by signs and symptoms. the disease occurs in populations relevant to the uk. the disorder is associated with serious health problems or death. effective treatment is available for the disease. the disorder can be helped by addressing it in the time before it appears. there is an ethical, safe, simple and robust screening test for the disorder. screening for the disorder is cost-effective. a questionnaire was sent to all newborn screening laboratories in the uk. there are site visits to assess new methodologies for newborn screening. we used the traditional way of defining a genetic disorder related to metabolism. this was that the disorder was caused by a single mutated gene that affected a single type of enzyme needed for metabolism. we found that phenylketonuria matched all the criteria. this disorder could be used as a gold standard when comparing other disorders, even though the screening process can vary and systems for notifying patients are not good enough. of the many disorders of metabolism of organic and fatty acids, we can only make the case for newborn screening of glutaric aciduria type 1 (ga1) and medium-chain acy-coa dehydrogenase (mcad deficiency). advancements in therapy for ga1 can prevent damage to the brain and nerves but more research into the costs and benefits of screening for this disorder is needed. mcad deficiency can be treated simply and cheaply, preventing possible early death and brain handicap. newborn screening for these diseases depends on the introduction of tandem mass spectrometry (tandem ms) technology. but, this screening could also detect some other disorders at the same time. these other disorders are related to organic acid metabolism and happen to one in 15,000 people. newborn screening for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (cah) has worked well in other countries and the uk should see similar benefits. this disease occurs in one in 17,000 people. a national programme of newborn screening for cah would be justified, and could be looked at again after an agreed period of time. another disorder, biotinidase deficiency, is rare in the uk (estimated at one in 100,000), but that may be outweighed by how simple the screening process is and the benefits of preventing the disease.",0
"postpartum depression (ppd) is depression that occurs after childbirth. it is common disorder that is disabling, but it is treatable. the strongest risk factor for ppd is a history of mood or anxiety disorders, especially if women have active symptoms during pregnancy. ppd is one of the most common complications of childbirth. it is very important to discover the most effective treatments in order to have the best outcomes for mothers, infants, and their families. there is new understanding of how ppd changes the body's functions. also, new treatments offer possible different ways to add to current medications, mind-body treatments, and evidence-based psychotherapy. the benefits and potential harms of treatment, including during breastfeeding, are presented.",0
"there is little evidence about the connection beween blood levels of vitamin b6 and later mortality (death rate). researchers studied the connection between blood levels of vitamin b6 levels and mortality from all causes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer using facts collected from the national health and nutrition examination survey (nhanes). our study examined 12,190 adults participating in nhanes from 2005 to 2010 in the united states. mortality was linked to national death index (ndi) records up to 31 december 2015. the chemical, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (plp), is the active form of vitamin b6 in the body. vitamin b6 blood levels were defined as deficient (not enough), insufficient (low), and sufficient (enough) depending on the level of plp in the blood.. researchers created a model to accurately estimate the risk of death (cox model) between blood levels of vitamin b6 and plp and mortality from all causes and from specific causes. this study showed vitamin b6 was sufficient in 70.6% of participants. but, 12.8% of participants had deficient vitamin b6 blood levels. during follow-up, a total of 1244 deaths were recorded, including 294 cancer deaths and 235 cardiovascular disease deaths. participants with higher blood vitamin b6 had a 15% lower risk of all-cause mortality and a 19% lower risk of cardiovascular disease mortality for each unit level of plp (using the cox model). higher plp blood levels were not significantly associated with a lower risk of cancer mortality (using the cox model). compared with sufficient vitamin b6 levels, deficient and insufficient vitamin b6 levels were significantly associated with a higher risk for all-cause mortality (cox model). there was no significant association for cause-specific mortality. participants with higher levels of vitamin b6 had a lower risk for all-cause mortality. these findings suggest that maintaining a sufficient level of vitamin b6 in the blood may lower the all-cause mortality risk in the general population.",0
"this study evaluated the use of telerehabilitation during the postoperative period for patients who underwent total knee arthroplasty (tka) or unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (uka). specifically, this study evaluated the following: (1) patient compliance and adherence to the program, (2) time spent performing physical therapy exercises, (3) the usability of the virtual rehabilitation platform, and (4) clinical outcome scores in a selected primary knee arthroplasty cohort. a total of 157 consecutive patients underwent tka (n = 18) or uka (n = 139). these patients used a telerehabilitation system with an instructional avatar, three-dimensional motion measurement and analysis software, and real-time televisit capability designed for arthroplasty patients. compliance was determined by how many times the patients followed prescribed repetitions of exercises. the total time spent performing exercises for each patient was collected. the usability of the virtual rehabilitation platform (on the patient's end) was evaluated using the system usability scale (sus) questionnaire. the number of in-person and televisits was recorded for each patient. patient-reported outcomes were collected through the patient and clinician interfaces and included the knee society score (kss) for pain and functions, the western ontario and mcmaster universities osteoarthritis index (womac) score, and boston university activity measure for post-acute care (am-pac) score. patients spent an average of 29.5 days partaking in the therapy. tka and uka patients had a mean of 3.5 and 3.2 outpatient follow-up visits, each, for in-office therapy with a physical therapist, respectively. this figure exceeded the mean number of real-time virtual patient-clinician visits by 0.8 visits per patient in the tka cohort and by 1 visit per patient in the uka cohort. patients spent on average 26.5 minutes per day conducting an average of 13.5 exercises. by the end of rehabilitation, patients had spent an average of 10.8 hours performing exercises, and of all the exercises performed, approximately 21 exercises were uniquely designed. mean sus score in the cohort was 93 points, which was interpreted as being above the 50th percentile point of the scale. following therapy, kss pain and function scores improved markedly and the improvements were measured at 368% for tka and 350% for uka (pain) and 27% for uka and 33% for tka (function). in addition, womac scores improved by 57% and 66% for uka and tka patients while the improvement in am-pac scores was at 22% and 24%. this telerehabilitation platform encouraged clinician-patient interaction beyond the hospital setting and offers the advantage of cost savings, convenience, at-home monitoring, and coordination of care, all of which are geared to improve adherence and overall patient satisfaction. additionally, the biometric data can be used to develop custom physical therapy regimens to assure proper rehabilitation, which is lacking in other telerehabilitation applications that use noninteractive videos that can be watched on mobile devices and tablets.",1
"the aim was to determine the accuracy of anterior nasal swab in rapid antigen (ag) tests in a low sars-cov-2 prevalence and massive screened community. individuals, aged 18 years or older, who self-booked an appointment for real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) test in march 2021 at a public test center in copenhagen, denmark were included. an oropharyngeal swab was collected for rt-pcr testing, followed by a swab from the anterior parts of the nose examined by ag test (sd biosensor). accuracy of the ag test was calculated with rt-pcr as reference. we included 7074 paired conclusive tests (n = 3461, female: 50.7%). the median age was 48 years (iqr: 36-57 years). the prevalence was 0.9%, that is, 66 tests were positive on rt-pcr. thirty-two had a paired positive ag test. the sensitivity was 48.5% and the specificity was 100%. this study conducted in a low prevalence setting in a massive screening set-up showed that the ag test had a sensitivity of 48.5% and a specificity of 100%, that is, no false positive tests. the lower sensitivity is a challenge especially if ag testing is not repeated frequently allowing this scalable test to be a robust supplement to rt-pcr testing in an ambitious public sars-cov-2 screening.",1
"background and aims: in previous studies, we successfully applied low level laser therapy (lllt) in patients with non-specific chronic pain of the shoulder joint and lower back. the purpose of the present study was to assess the effectiveness of lllt for chronic joint pain of the elbow, wrist, and fingers. subjects and methods: nine male and 15 female patients with chronic joint pain of the elbow, wrist, or fingers, who were treated at the rehabilitation outpatient clinic at our hospital from april, 2007 to march, 2009 were enrolled in the study. we used a 1000 mw semiconductor laser device. each tender point and three points around it were irradiated with laser energy. each point was irradiated twice for 20 s per treatment, giving a total of three minutes for all 4 points. patients visited the clinic twice a week, and were evaluated after four weeks of treatment. pain was evaluated with a visual analogue scale (vas). statistical analysis of the vas scores after laser irradiation was performed with wilcoxon's signed rank sum test, using spss ver.17. results: all vas scores were totaled and statistically analyzed. the average vas score before irradiation was 59.2±12.9, and 33.1±12.2 after the irradiation, showing a significant improvement in vas score (p<0.001) after treatment. the treatment effect lasted for about one and a half days in the case of wrist pain, epicondylitis lateralis (tennis elbow), and carpal tunnel syndrome. in other pain entities, it lasted for about three to fifteen hours. no change in the range of motion (rom) was seen in any of the 24 subjects. conclusion: we concluded that lllt at the wavelength and parameters used in the present study was effective for chronic pain of the elbow, wrist, and fingers.",1
"background/aim: breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women around the world and the leading cause of cancer-related death among women. the knowledge about modifiable risk factors, such as diet, can be an acceptable, cheap and non-pharmacological prevention tool. the aim of this study was to investigate the association between dietary fat, dietary fatty acids, fish intake, and breast cancer in women. patients and methods: a case-control study was designed. a total of 201 consecutive, newly diagnosed, polish female cancer patients (mean age: 58 years) and 201 one-to-one age-matched controls were enrolled. a standardized questionnaire assessing various socio-demographic, clinical, lifestyle, and dietary characteristics was applied via face-to-face interviews. detailed dietary intake information was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire. odds ratios (or) and 95% confidence intervals (95%ci) were obtained using multiple unconditional logistic regression models controlling for non-dietary and dietary potential confounders. results: consumption of polyunsaturated fats (pufa) over 10% of total energy intake was associated with a significantly lower risk of breast cancer compared to low intake of pufa (or=0.4, 95%ci=0.19-0.85). low (<0.2) omega-3/ omega-6 ratio (or=2.04, 95%ci=0.996-4.17), fish consumption less than once every six months (or=3.37, 95%ci=1.57-7.23) and being overweight (or=2.07, 95%ci=1.3-3.3) were associated with increased risk of breast cancer. residents of rural areas had a significantly higher risk compared to women from urban areas (or=1.8, 95%ci=1.06-3.03). conclusion: high intake of pufa can decrease the risk of breast cancer, while the low omega-3/omega-6 ratio increases the risk. in addition, overweight state, eliminating fish from the diet and living in rural areas can also increase the risk of breast cancer.",1
"the aim of newborn screening is to identify healthy infants that will develop significant metabolic or endocrine disorders if left undiagnosed and untreated. newborn screening measures specific substances in various ways. using the most sensitive screening tests can ultimately reduce or eliminate permanent consequences. specificity of a test distinguishes true negative results from false negative results (when the test is negative but the patient actually has the disease). in general, this article discusses disorders that have treatments and that can be detected by routine and expanded newborn screening. we give recommendations for testing by a general practice doctor, with confirmation by a metabolic or endocrine specialist. we organize disorders in a table by the physical process they affect in the body or by the substance that is tested. in doing this we also pay attention to how the disease first appears, lab tests that can confirm the disorders, and treatments available. there are many challenges for following up with patients, including diagnosis and appropriate understanding of the consequences of the disorders. meeting these challenges will require information. this can only be gained with large-scale studies that follow children identified by newborn screening over time to see their outcomes. newborn screening can only fully serve families once we have this knowledge.",0
"background: the basolateral potassium channel in the distal convoluted tubule (dct), comprising the inwardly rectifying potassium channel kir4.1/kir5.1 heterotetramer, plays a key role in mediating the effect of dietary potassium intake on the thiazide-sensitive nacl cotransporter (ncc). the role of kir5.1 (encoded by kcnj16) in mediating effects of dietary potassium intake on the ncc and renal potassium excretion is unknown. methods: we used electrophysiology, renal clearance, and immunoblotting to study kir4.1 in the dct and ncc in kir5.1 knockout (kcnj16-/- ) and wild-type (kcnj16+/+ ) mice fed with normal, high, or low potassium diets. results: we detected a 40-ps and 20-ps potassium channel in the basolateral membrane of the dct in wild-type and knockout mice, respectively. compared with wild-type, kcnj16-/- mice fed a normal potassium diet had higher basolateral potassium conductance, a more negative dct membrane potential, higher expression of phosphorylated ncc (pncc) and total ncc (tncc), and augmented thiazide-induced natriuresis. neither high- nor low-potassium diets affected the basolateral dct's potassium conductance and membrane potential in kcnj16-/- mice. although high potassium reduced and low potassium increased the expression of pncc and tncc in wild-type mice, these effects were absent in kcnj16-/- mice. high potassium intake inhibited and low intake augmented thiazide-induced natriuresis in wild-type but not in kcnj16-/- mice. compared with wild-type, kcnj16-/- mice with normal potassium intake had slightly lower plasma potassium but were more hyperkalemic with prolonged high potassium intake and more hypokalemic during potassium restriction. conclusions: kir5.1 is essential for dietary potassium's effect on ncc and for maintaining potassium homeostasis.",1
"after peripheral nerves (the parts of the nervous system outside the brain and spinal cord) are injured, people often feel discomfort for a long time. a chemical called substance p is involved in the process of feeling pain. lowering the amount of this chemical involved in the transmission of nerve signals lessens pain. capsaicin was a good long-term treatment for people who experienced an unpleasant abnormal sensation after injury to the trigeminal nerve. trigeminal nerve is a large, three-part nerve in the head that provides sensation. capsaicin is a chemical that lowers the amount of substance p in the body. drugs that lower the amount of substance p in the body may be used alone or together with other medications to treat traumatic trigeminal dysesthesia (an unpleasant abnormal sensation after injury to the trigeminal nerve.)",0
"sarcoidosis is a disease characterized by growths of inflammatory cells in the body. the activated macrophage, a specialized white blood cell defender against invaders, in sarcoidosis produces interleukin-1 (il-1), a molecule which signals inflammation. interleukin-1, among other functions, activates the liver production of c-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation. we measured the blood c-reactive protein in 17 patients with active lung-related sarcoidosis, 10 with other long-lasting lung diseases of unknown cause, 11 with active lung tuberculosis (a bacterial lung infection), and 10 healthy volunteers. blood c-reactive protein was measured with a specific lab test. the blood c-reactive protein was not detected in 13 patients with active sacroidosis and was detected in four. c-reactive protein was not detected in 7 patients with other lung diseases and was detected in 3 cases. the tests of c-reactive protein in patients with lung tuberculosis-related mucus was detected in 10 cases. no c-reactive protein was detected in healthy patients. there was a difference between groups when sarcoidosis and tuberculosis blood c-reactive protein measurements were compared, along with a difference between the group of other lung diseases and tuberculosis. measuring blood c-reactive protein is valuable to differentiate sacroidosis and other lung-lasting lung diseases of unknown causes from tuberculosis and other diseases known to cause an immediate response.",0
"potassium channels are proteins that allow rapid and careful flow of potassium ions (an atom that carries an electrical charge) across the cell boundary and generates electrical signals in cells. two potassium channels located in cells of the kidneys called potassium channels kir4.1 and kir5.1 play a key role on controlling how potassium from foods affect how salt is reabsorbed. the role of kir5.1 in how it passes on potassium from foods in the kidneys and how it releases potassium is unknown. researchers studied kir4.1 and kir5.1 in different parts of the kidneys by using two different types of mice (called wild-type mice - or normal mice - and knockout mice - mice without a specific gene like the one encoding kir5.1) fed with normal, high, or low potassium diets. when compared with the wild-type mice, the knockout mice that were fed a normal potassium diet had higher transmission of potassium, had more negative charges in some cell boundaries or membranes, had higher activation of major salt reabsorption pathways, and had an increase in the release of sodium in the urine. neither a diet high nor low in potassium affected the potassium channel that is located at the base or sides of the cell or the negative charges in the cell membranes in the knockout mice. although high potassium reduced activation of major salt reabsorption pathways and low potassium increased activation of major salt reabsorption pathways in wild-type mice, these effects were not found in the knockout mice. high potassium diets slowed or stopped release of sodium in the urine while low potassium diets increased the release of sodium in the urine in wild-type mice but not in knock-out mice. when compared with wild-type mice, knockout mice who had normal potassium level diets had slightly lower plasma potassium (potassium in the blood). however, knockout mice were more hyperkalemic (having a higher than normal level of potassium in the bloodstream) with a long, high potassium diet and hypokalemic (having a lower than normal level of potassium in the blood) with a restricted potassium diet. kir5.1 is key for the effect of potassium from foods on how salt is reabsorbed and for maintaining a stable balance of potassium.",0
"endocrine therapy-induced hair loss (etihl) associated with aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen treatment is currently mostly reported but remained an unresolved therapeutic issue in patients with breast cancer (bc) since the number of studies regarding the management is limited in literature. herein we investigated the possible causes of this clinical problem and its relation with endocrine therapies widely used for bc survivors and made some modest practical recommendations in light of the literature review in order to provide an optimal management. on the basis of literature findings, common causes of hair loss apart from endocrine therapies should be investigated with an initial evaluation workup and then should be corrected, if observed. treatment with topical 5-alpha reductase inhibitors and supplementation of vitamin c and omega-3 fatty acids are likely appeared to be the most appropriate treatment agents for etihl without causing an adverse effect on bc prognosis. however, more prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled studied are required in order to confirm our results and also identify the clinical effects of this problem on patients with bc.",1
"pallister-hall syndrome (phs, m146510) was first described in 1980 in six newborns. it is a pleiotropic disorder of human development that comprises hypothalamic hamartoma, central polydactyly, and other malformations. this disorder is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and has been mapped to 7p13 (s. kang et al.autosomal dominant pallister-hall syndrome maps to 7p13. am. j. hum. genet. 59, a81 (1996)), co-localizing the phs locus and the gli3 zinc finger transcription factor gene. large deletions or translocations resulting in haploinsufficiency of the gli3 gene have been associated with greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (gcps; m175700) although no mutations have been identified in gcps patients with normal karyotypes. both phs and gcps have polysyndactyly, abnormal craniofacial features and are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, but they are clinically distinct. the polydactyly of gcps is commonly preaxial and that of phs is typically central or postaxial. no reported cases of gcps have hypothalamic hamartoma and phs does not cause hypertelorism or broadening of the nasal root or forehead. the co-localization of the loci for phs and gcps led us to investigate gli3 as a candidate gene for phs. herein we report two phs families with frameshift mutations in gli3 that are 3' of the zinc finger-encoding domains, including one family with a de novo mutation. these data implicate mutations in gli3 as the cause of autosomal dominant phs, and suggest that frameshift mutations of the gli3 transcription factor gene can alter the development of multiple organ systems in vertebrates.",1
"sars-cov-2 infection, also known as covid-19 (a viral, breathing-related disease), has caused a global pandemic that has hurt both public health and the economy. a protein of the virus has several purposes and plays an important role in creating the protective outer shell of the virus and helping the virus replicate itself. in order to better understand how the virus protein works, proteins within human cells that interact with the covid-19 protein were identified. the authors identified 160 proteins within two different human cell types that interact in some way with the covid-19 protein. the human proteins found to interact with the virus protein are responsible for several cell functions, all of which impact the creation of more proteins. additionally, some human proteins identified to interact with the virus protein have roles in defending the body from viruses. this study thoroughly characterized how the viral protein and the host (or human) protein interact when a person is infected. these findings can provide a foundation for future studies on the development and treatment options for covid-19.",0
"an international committee recommends diagnosing diabetes if hemoglobin a1c (hba1c), an iron-rich blood protein joined to a sugar, is at or over 6.5% with multiple tests. the committee recommends not ""mixing different methods to diagnose diabetes"" because ""the tests are not completely concordant [or consistent]: using different tests could easily lead to confusion"". fasting blood sugar tests and blood sugar tests after simple sugar intake may help identify diabetes only if testing for hba1c is not possible. hba1c testing is useful for greater convenience, accuracy, and uniformity, but as the single tool for identification, it may lead to measurement errors. unknown factors may alter scores of the iron-rich blood protein relative to the actual blood sugar level. thus, tests for this iron-rich blood protein connected to a sugar should be combined with other blood sugar values for diabetes identification. if a score for hba1c disagrees with the general reading, blood sugar testing should be performed. a cut-off point at or over 6.5% for hba1c misses many with type 2 diabetes, high fasting blood sugar, and impaired blood sugar sensitivity. using tests for hba1c and blood sugar measurements identifies diabetes better than hba1c tests alone.",0
"purpose: this study was conducted to evaluate the effect of age, age-related changes in renal function, and gender on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of orally administered gabapentin (gbp). methods: the pharmacokinetics of a single 400-mg oral dose of gbp were studied in 36 healthy subjects (18 men and 18 women) aged 20-78 years. serial blood samples and total urine output were collected for 48 h after the dose. gbp concentrations in plasma and urine were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography, and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by noncompartmental methods. results: all subjects tolerated the drug well, with only mild symptoms reported. no change in maximal gbp plasma concentration (cmax), time at which cmax occurred (tmax), or apparent volume of distribution (v/f) with age was noted. a significant linear decline in apparent oral clearance (cl/f), elimination-rate constant (lambda z), and renal clearance (clr) with increasing age was observed (p < 0.005). because total urinary recovery of unchanged drug (an estimate of f for gbp) did not change with age, the decline in cl/f and lambda z can be explained by the decline in clr. the only pharmacokinetic parameter that was significantly different between genders was cmax, which was approximately 25% higher for women than for men (p = 0.016), consistent with gender differences in body size. conclusions: the results of this study suggest that changes in renal function are responsible for age-related changes in gbp pharmacokinetics. reduction of gbp dosage may be required in elderly patients with reduced renal function. the pharmacokinetics of gbp are similar in men and women.",1
"multiple sclerosis (ms) is a complex disease of the central nervous system (cns) that involves an intricate and aberrant interaction of immune cells leading to inflammation, demyelination, and neurodegeneration. due to the heterogeneity of clinical subtypes, their diagnosis becomes challenging and the best treatment cannot be easily provided to patients. biomarkers have been used to simplify the diagnosis and prognosis of ms, as well as to evaluate the results of clinical treatments. in recent years, research on biomarkers has advanced rapidly due to their ability to be easily and promptly measured, their specificity, and their reproducibility. biomarkers are classified into several categories depending on whether they address personal or predictive susceptibility, diagnosis, prognosis, disease activity, or response to treatment in different clinical courses of ms. the identified members indicate a variety of pathological processes of ms, such as neuroaxonal damage, gliosis, demyelination, progression of disability, and remyelination, among others. the present review analyzes biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) and blood serum, the most promising imaging biomarkers used in clinical practice. furthermore, it aims to shed light on the criteria and challenges that a biomarker must face to be considered as a standard in daily clinical practice.",1
"purpose: the covid-19 pandemic has galvanized the development of new vaccines at an unprecedented pace. since the widespread implementation of vaccination campaigns, reports of ocular adverse effects after covid-19 vaccinations have emerged. this review summarizes ocular adverse effects possibly associated with covid-19 vaccination, and discusses their clinical characteristics and management. results: ocular adverse effects of covid-19 vaccinations include facial nerve palsy, abducens nerve palsy, acute macular neuroretinopathy, central serous retinopathy, thrombosis, uveitis, multiple evanescent white dot syndrome, vogt-koyanagi-harada disease reactivation, and new-onset graves' disease. studies in current literature are primarily retrospective case series or isolated case reports - these are inherently weak in establishing association or causality. nevertheless, the described presentations resemble the reported ocular manifestations of the covid-19 disease itself. hence, we hypothesize that the human body's immune response to covid-19 vaccinations may be involved in the pathogenesis of the ocular adverse effects post-covid-19 vaccination. conclusion: ophthalmologists and generalists should be aware of the possible, albeit rare, ocular adverse effects after covid-19 vaccination.",1
"an inherited disorder of many kidney cysts (swellings) is an important cause of kidney failure, for which there is no treatment. gene sequence changes in pkd1 (a gene active in kidney cells) are the leading cause of the disease. the disease begins before birth and worsens slowly, but it is not known if creation of cysts is an ongoing process during adult life. we show that silencing of pkd1 in mice younger than 13 days leads to severely cystic kidneys within 3 weeks. silencing at day 14 or later results in cysts only after 4 months. we found that cell growth is not higher in those with cysts versus similar-age healthy animals, but the sudden change in response to pkd1 silencing was linked to a new brake point during kidney growth and changes in gene expression. the effects of pkd1 silencing may be defined by a developmental switch that signals the end of the final kidney maturation process. pkd1 monitors development of tubes in growing and adult kidneys, but the disease-related effects of silencing are defined by the organ's developmental status. these results influence clinical understanding of the disease and treatment options.",0
"background: pressure ulcers, also known as bedsores, decubitus ulcers and pressure injuries, are localised areas of injury to the skin or the underlying tissue, or both. dressings are widely used to treat pressure ulcers and promote healing, and there are many options to choose from including alginate, hydrocolloid and protease-modulating dressings. topical agents have also been used as alternatives to dressings in order to promote healing. a clear and current overview of all the evidence is required to facilitate decision-making regarding the use of dressings or topical agents for the treatment of pressure ulcers. such a review would ideally help people with pressure ulcers and health professionals assess the best treatment options. this review is a network meta-analysis (nma) which assesses the probability of complete ulcer healing associated with alternative dressings and topical agents. main results: we included 51 studies (2947 participants) in this review and carried out nma in a network of linked interventions for the sole outcome of probability of complete healing. the network included 21 different interventions (13 dressings, 6 topical agents and 2 supplementary linking interventions) and was informed by 39 studies in 2127 participants, of whom 783 had completely healed wounds. we judged the network to be sparse: overall, there were relatively few participants, with few events, both for the number of interventions and the number of mixed treatment contrasts; most studies were small or very small. the consequence of this sparseness is high imprecision in the evidence, and this, coupled with the (mainly) high risk of bias in the studies informing the network, means that we judged the vast majority of the evidence to be of low or very low certainty. we have no confidence in the findings regarding the rank order of interventions in this review (very low-certainty evidence), but we report here a summary of results for some comparisons of interventions compared with saline gauze. we present here only the findings from evidence which we did not consider to be very low certainty, but these reported results should still be interpreted in the context of the very low certainty of the network as a whole. it is not clear whether regimens involving protease-modulating dressings increase the probability of pressure ulcer healing compared with saline gauze (risk ratio (rr) 1.65, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.92 to 2.94) (moderate-certainty evidence: low risk of bias, downgraded for imprecision). this risk ratio of 1.65 corresponds to an absolute difference of 102 more people healed with protease modulating dressings per 1000 people treated than with saline gauze alone (95% ci 13 fewer to 302 more). it is unclear whether the following interventions increase the probability of healing compared with saline gauze (low-certainty evidence): collagenase ointment (rr 2.12, 95% ci 1.06 to 4.22); foam dressings (rr 1.52, 95% ci 1.03 to 2.26); basic wound contact dressings (rr 1.30, 95% ci 0.65 to 2.58) and polyvinylpyrrolidone plus zinc oxide (rr 1.31, 95% ci 0.37 to 4.62); the latter two interventions both had confidence intervals consistent with both a clinically important benefit and a clinically important harm, and the former two interventions each had high risk of bias as well as imprecision. authors' conclusions: a network meta-analysis (nma) of data from 39 studies (evaluating 21 dressings and topical agents for pressure ulcers) is sparse and the evidence is of low or very low certainty (due mainly to risk of bias and imprecision). consequently we are unable to determine which dressings or topical agents are the most likely to heal pressure ulcers, and it is generally unclear whether the treatments examined are more effective than saline gauze. more research is needed to determine whether particular dressings or topical agents improve the probability of healing of pressure ulcers. the nma is uninformative regarding which interventions might best be included in a large trial, and it may be that research is directed towards prevention, leaving clinicians to decide which treatment to use on the basis of wound symptoms, clinical experience, patient preference and cost.",1
"sickle cell disease (scd) is a blood disorder with complex disease effects that includes lasting (chronic) hemolysis (red blood cell destruction), vaso-occlusion (blood flow blockage) and inflammation (infection-fighting processes). increased white blood cell-red blood cell-boundary cell interactions, due to increases expression of sticking molecules and activated boundary cells, are thought to play a main role in starting and developing of scd vaso-occlusive events and organ damage. several new disease effect-based treatments for scd are being developed, chiefly targeting the inflammatory pathways. omega-3 fatty acids are polyunsaturated fatty acids that are known to have effects on many biological processes. eicosapentaenoic acid (epa) and docosahexaenoic acid (dha) are the main biologically active omega-3 fatty acids. the helpful effects of dha and epa on chronic inflammatory disorders and heart-related or cardiovascular diseases are well recognized. the helpful effects of omega-3 fatty acids are linked to their anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic (blood clotting) eicosanoids (signaling molecules), and the new class of epa and dha derived fat level influencers: resolvins, protectins and maresins (other fatty-acid-related molecules). blood cell membranes or boundaries of patients with scd have abnormal fatty acids composition characterized by high ratio of pro-inflammatory arachidonic acid (aa) to anti-inflammatory dha and epa (high omega-6/omega-3 ratio). also, experimental and clinical studies provide evidence that treatment with dha does lead to improvement in blood cell deforming properties of sickle rbc, inflammation and hemolysis. the clinical studies have shown improvements in vaso-occlusion crisis (voc) rate, markers of inflammation, sticking molecules, and hemolysis. in total, the results of studies on the helpful effects of omega-3 fatty acids in scd provide a good body of evidence that omega-3 fatty acids could be a safe and effective treatment for scd.",0
"for the study's background, aromatase inhibitors (ais) are common hormone therapy (ht) for the secondary treatment of postmenopausal hormone-sensitive early breast cancer. treatment stoppage due to toxicitiy is an important issue that may help clinicians find effective clinical treatments to allow proper treatment duration. we reviewed the main reasors for interruption of ais at our center from 2006 to 2009. for the study's methods, 236 patients treated with secondary ais were analyzed. average age was 64 years (ranging from 35 to 89 years). average treatment follow-up was 53 months (ranging from 6 to 60). prior secondary chemotherapy (cancer-specific drugs) was taxane for 47 patients and anthracycline for 43 patients. 118 patients received letrozole, 101 anastrozole, and 17 exemestane (breast cancer-treating drugs). twenty-four patients (10%) needed stoppage of the first ai assigned due to toxicity. severe arthralgia (joint stiffness) was the main reason for stoppage in 13/24 patients. no differences in the frequency of arthralgia were noted in patients who received taxanes or anthracyclines. headache, alopecia (hair loss or thinning), itching, skin reactions, allergic reactions with high-blood-pressure events, xerostomia (dry mouth), xerophthalmia (eye dryness), lack of sleep, and sleepiness were other reasons for stopping treatment. with mathematical analysis, age (65 years) and ht were linked with the start of arthralgia. alternative ht (ai or tamoxifen - an estrogen-influencing drug) was offered to patients who wanted or needed to permanently stop the ongoing drug. in conclusion, 10% of patients stopped the first ai assigned because of toxicity. average time course of all side effects leading to ht stoppage was 155 days and 135 days for arthralgia. a switch to another ht with toxicity monitoring is recommended for avoiding premature and permanent stoppage of an effective treatment.",0
"diets low in carbohydrates and proteins and enriched in fat stimulate the hepatic synthesis of ketone bodies (kb). these molecules are used as alternative fuel for energy production in target tissues. the synthesis and utilization of kb are tightly regulated both at transcriptional and hormonal levels. the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (pparα), currently recognized as one of the master regulators of ketogenesis, integrates nutritional signals to the activation of transcriptional networks regulating fatty acid β-oxidation and ketogenesis. new factors, such as circadian rhythms and paracrine signals, are emerging as important aspects of this metabolic regulation. however, kb are currently considered not only as energy substrates but also as signaling molecules. β-hydroxybutyrate has been identified as class i histone deacetylase inhibitor, thus establishing a connection between products of hepatic lipid metabolism and epigenetics. ketogenic diets (kd) are currently used to treat different forms of infantile epilepsy, also caused by genetic defects such as glut1 and pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency syndromes. however, several researchers are now focusing on the possibility to use kd in other diseases, such as cancer, neurological and metabolic disorders. nonetheless, clear-cut evidence of the efficacy of kd in other disorders remains to be provided in order to suggest the adoption of such diets to metabolic-related pathologies.",1
"in total hip replacement (thr) and total knee replacement (tkr), pain from surgery is managed with multiple types of anaesthesia used together. it is not clear if applying a local anaesthetic directly to the wound before sewing it up provides additional pain control. we systematically reviewed randomised controlled trials of using local anaesthetic in patients having thr or tkr. we searched several medical literature databases up to december 2012. the information we gathered from the studies was: pain after surgery, both at rest and during activity after 24 and 48 hours, whether opioids were needed, when and how much patients walked, hospital stay, and additional problems cause by the surgery. in 13 studies including 909 patients having thr, patients that got local anaesthetic had a bigger reduction in pain at 24 hours at rest and at 48 hours during activity. in tkr, various regimens using multiple types of anesthesia were reported. in 23 studies including 1439 patients having tkr, using local anaesthetic reduced pain at 24 hours at rest and at 48 hours during activity, compared with patients receiving no local anesthetic, or placebo (sham treatment so patients were not biased). in studies where more local anaesthetic was used after closing the wound, there was evidence of a bigger reduction. there was no evidence of pain control on top of what was provided by femoral nerve block, a type of local anesthetic applied directly to a large nerve in the thigh. patients that got local anaesthetic spent, on average, an estimated 0.83 fewer days in hospital after thr and 0.87 fewer days in hospital after tkr. they also had took fewer opioids, walked earlier, and vomited less. not many studies reported long-term outcomes. our first conclusion is that local anaesthesia is effective in reducing short-term pain and hospital stay in patients having thr and tkr. second, studies should assess whether local anaesthesia can prevent long-term pain. finally, enhanced pain control with additional medicine through a catheter should be weighed against a possible infection risk.",0
"objectives: parkinson's disease (pd) features both motor and non-motor symptoms that substantially impact quality of life (qol). levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (lcig) reduces motor complications and improves some non-motor symptoms in advanced pd (apd). change in patients' health-related quality of life (hrqol) is a common endpoint in pd trials and has become an important factor in judging overall effect of lcig. however, hrqol is considered to be only one dimension of qol. the primary aim of this prospective observational study was to observe the effects of lcig on individual quality of life (iqol) in pd and caregivers. the secondary aim was to investigate its effects on patients' motor and non-motor symptoms as well as effects on caregiver burden. materials & methods: utilizing the schedule for the evaluation of individual quality of life-questionnaire (seiqol-q) and the personal wellbeing index-adult (pwi-a), twelve patients with advanced pd and their caregivers were followed for six months after initiation of lcig treatment. results: at the final follow-up, improvements of iqol for patients (median seiqol index improvement 0.16, p < .05) and caregivers (median seiqol index improvement 0.20, p < .05) were seen together with improvements of motor and non-motor symptoms. there were no significant improvements of hrqol. conclusions: the study results indicate that lcig improves iqol in pd in addition to the improvement of motor and non-motor symptoms. furthermore, this study signals that lcig may also contribute to improvement of iqol in caregivers.",1
"treatment of pdh deficiency rarely influences the course of the disease. it is usually possible to reverse or minimize systemic lactic acid accumulation by giving a high fat/low carbohydrate ""ketogenic"" diet, but this does not alleviate the neurological symptoms as structural damage in the brain is present from before birth and many patients do not have significant metabolic problems. there is some evidence that dichloroacetate (which inhibits the specific pdh kinase and thereby activates any residual functioning complex) will also reduce the metabolic disturbance in some patients, but, again, this is rarely accompanied by any objective improvement in neurological performance. a more favorable outcome can be expected in the extremely rare patients with a thiamine responsive form of the disease and, for this reason, a short therapeutic trial of thiamine is worth trying in all cases.",1
"wound pressure injuries have been given various names over the last several years. in the past, they were referred to as pressure ulcers, decubitus ulcers, or bed sores; and now they are most commonly termed ""pressure injuries."" pressure injuries are defined as the breakdown of skin integrity due to some types of unrelieved pressure. this can be from a bony area on the body coming into contact with an external surface which leads to pressure injury. these wounds represent the destruction of normal structure and function of the skin and soft tissue through a variety of mechanisms and etiologies. the wound healing process is affected by various factors including infection, the presence of chronic diseases like diabetes, aging, nutritional deficiency like vitamin c, medications like steroids, and low perfusion of oxygen and blood flow to the wound in cases of hypoxia and cold temperature. pressure ulcers result from long periods of repeated pressure applied to the skin, soft tissue, muscle, and bone. in pressure ulcers, the external pressure exceeds capillary closing pressure.",1
"the us preventative services task force (uspstf) guideline for screening osteoporosis, a bone-weakening disease, states that there is a lack of evidence about best rescreening intervals. the guideline states that intervals >2 years may be needed to better preduct fracture risk. also, the uspstf mentions a study in which repeat measurement of bone mineral density (bmd) or hardness after 8 years adds litte value relative to inital bone scans. reconsider the intervals at which you recommend rescreening for osteoporosis. for post-menopausal or older women with normal bmd or mild bone weakening, a 15-year interval is likely enough.",0
"background: in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (adpkd), cyst development and enlargement lead to eskd. macrophage recruitment and interstitial inflammation promote cyst growth. tweak is a tnf superfamily (tnfsf) cytokine that regulates inflammatory responses, cell proliferation, and cell death, and its receptor fn14 (tnfrsf12a) is expressed in macrophage and nephron epithelia. methods: to evaluate the role of the tweak signaling pathway in cystic disease, we evaluated fn14 expression in human and in an orthologous murine model of adpkd. we also explored the cystic response to tweak signaling pathway activation and inhibition by peritoneal injection. results: meta-analysis of published animal-model data of cystic disease reveals mrna upregulation of several components of the tweak signaling pathway. we also observed that tweak and fn14 were overexpressed in mouse adpkd kidney cysts, and tweak was significantly high in urine and cystic fluid from patients with adpkd. tweak administration induced cystogenesis and increased cystic growth, worsening the phenotype in a murine adpkd model. anti-tweak antibodies significantly slowed the progression of adpkd, preserved renal function, and improved survival. furthermore, the anti-tweak cystogenesis reduction is related to decreased cell proliferation-related mapk signaling, decreased nf-κb pathway activation, a slight reduction of fibrosis and apoptosis, and an indirect decrease in macrophage recruitment. conclusions: this study identifies the tweak signaling pathway as a new disease mechanism involved in cystogenesis and cystic growth and may lead to a new therapeutic approach in adpkd.",1
"damage to dna and changes to the body's response to dna damage, called dna damage response or ddr, could be one of the processes involved in the development of kidney cysts (growths) in the inherited disease called autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (adpkd). this study aims to test the idea that certain types of dna damage and ddr signaling are increased in adpkd experiments. in the part of the human adpkd genes that transfer information to molecules, the dna damage response (ddr) genes increased 16 times compared with that in a normal kidney. ddr also more than doubled in tissues with cysts compared to ddr in tissues with few cysts. in tissues from end-stage human adpkd, certain genes and protein enzymes involved in the ddr to detect and repair damaged dna focus on cystic kidney epithelial cells, which are important cells for kidney function. in lab tests, protein enzymes are also increased in human adpkd cells located in the tubal duct system of the kidneys when compared with normal tubal cells. additionally, some dna damage increases genes and cell survival in human adpkd cells, and worsens cyst growth in one animal experiment. in contrast, dna damage response (ddr) gene processing is only temporarily increased on the day of birth in mice, and not altered at later times up to 12 months of age. in conclusion, ddr signals to other cells are not controlled well in human adpkd and during the early phases of animal adpkd. the use of the dna damage response in adpkd may promote survival of gene cells that have mutated (changed) and contribute to cyst growth in the kidneys.",0
"pressure ulcers are a common and serious problem predominately among elderly persons who are confined to bed or chair. additional factors associated with pressure ulcer development include cerebrovascular accident, impaired nutritional intake, urinary or fecal incontinence, hypoalbuminemia, and previous fracture. implementation of preventive measures, such as an in-depth assessment for mobility, a pressure-relieving device combined with adequate repositioning, and thorough evaluation for nutritional status and urinary incontinence, significantly reduce pressure ulcer incidence. if the pressure ulcer is a partial thickness (stage ii) wound, the causative factors are probably friction or moisture. if the ulcer is full thickness (stage iii and iv), it is secondary to pressure or shearing forces. the development of wound infection is the most common complication in the management approach. osteomyelitis is not an uncommon occurrence and must be initially ruled out in all full thickness pressure ulcers. surgical debridement of necrotic tissue is necessary prior to further treatment and assessments. antibiotic therapy is indicated only upon evidence of infection (cellulitis, osteomyelitis, leukocytosis, bandemia, or fever). topical pharmacologic agents may be used to prevent or treat infection but must be carefully controlled to avoid such adverse effects as toxicity to the wound, allergic reaction, and development of resistant pathogens. proper use of occlusive dressings increase patient comfort, enhance healing, decrease the possibility of infection, save time, and reduce costs. a patient presenting an ulcer that fails to improve or, because of its size, will take a great deal of time to heal should be evaluated for surgical closure.",1
"objective: this post hoc analysis of the csppt (china stroke primary prevention trial) assessed the individual variation in total homocysteine (thcy)-lowering response after an average 4.5 years of 0.8 mg daily folic acid therapy in chinese hypertensive adults and evaluated effect modification by methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) c677t genotypes and serum folate levels. approach and results: this analysis included 16 413 participants from the csppt, who were randomly assigned to 2 double-blind treatment groups: either 10-mg enalapril+0.8-mg folic acid or 10-mg enalapril, daily and had individual measurements of serum folate and thcy levels at baseline and exit visits and mthfr c677t genotypes. mean baseline thcy levels were comparable between the 2 treatment groups (14.5±8.5 versus 14.4±8.1 μmol/l; p=0.561). after 4.5 years of treatment, mean thcy levels were reduced to 12.7±6.1 μmol/l in the enalapril+folic acid group, but almost stayed the same in the enalapril group (14.4±7.9 μmol/l, group difference: 1.61 μmol/l; 11% reduction). more importantly, thcy lowering varied by mthfr genotypes and serum folate levels. compared with cc and ct genotypes, participants with the tt genotype had a more prominent l-shaped curve between thcy and serum folate levels and required higher folate levels (at least 15 ng/ml) to eliminate the differences in thcy by genotypes. conclusions: compared with cc or ct, thcy in the tt group manifested a heightened l-shaped curve from low to high folate levels, but this difference in thcy by genotype was eliminated when plasma folate levels reach ≈15 ng/ml or higher. our data raised the prospect to tailor folic acid therapy according to individual mthfr c677t genotype and folate status.",1
"the purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of dopamine agonists (medication that imitates the actions of dopamine in the body to relieve symptoms related to low levels of dopamine) and monoamine oxidase type-b (mao-b) inhibitors (medications that prevent enzymes in the body from breaking down dopamine which allows more dopamine available in the brain) for parkinson's disease. researchers performed a thorough review of published studies to identify clinical trials investigating 4 dopamine agonists and 3 mao-b inhibitors for parkinson's disease. data are pulled together from the published studies in a computer analysis that allows different comparisons of the 7 drugs. researchers created the model to include dopamine agonists and mao-b inhibitors being given as single therapy (only one drug used) or in combination with levodopa. the main outcomes (results) are unified parkinson's disease rating scale (updrs) scores (rating tool used to measure the severity and progression of parkinson's disease in patients), serious adverse events (unfavorable or unintended changes in health), and withdrawals (symptoms after a person stops taking a drug). the effectiveness of each dopamine agonist and mao-b inhibitor versus a comparison drug is estimated. altogether, 79 published studies are included in the analysis. all the investigated drugs are effective compared with placebos (inactive substances that look like the drug being tested in the experiment) when given as single therapy (the only drug given) except the mao-b inhibitor, safinamide. in conclusion, dopamine agonists are found to be effective as treatment for parkinson's disease, both when given in a single therapy and in combination with levodopa. the mao-b inhibitors selegiline and rasagiline are also found to be effective for treating parkinson's disease, and selegiline is the best option in combination with levodopa among all the drugs investigated.",0
"background: attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) is the most commonly diagnosed behavioural disorder of childhood, affecting 3-5% of school-age children. the present study investigated whether the supplementation of soy-derived phosphatidylserine (ps), a naturally occurring phospholipid, improves adhd symptoms in children. methods: thirty six children, aged 4-14 years, who had not previously received any drug treatment related to adhd, received placebo (n = 17) or 200 mg day(-1) ps (n = 19) for 2 months in a randomised, double-blind manner. main outcome measures included: (i) adhd symptoms based on dsm-iv-tr; (ii) short-term auditory memory and working memory using the digit span test of the wechsler intelligence scale for children; and (iii) mental performance to visual stimuli (go/no go task). results: ps supplementation resulted in significant improvements in: (i) adhd (p < 0.01), ad (p < 0.01) and hd (p < 0.01); (ii) short-term auditory memory (p < 0.05); and (iii) inattention (differentiation and reverse differentiation, p < 0.05) and inattention and impulsivity (p < 0.05). no significant differences were observed in other measurements and in the placebo group. ps was well-tolerated and showed no adverse effects. conclusions: ps significantly improved adhd symptoms and short-term auditory memory in children. ps supplementation might be a safe and natural nutritional strategy for improving mental performance in young children suffering from adhd.",1
"background: surgical pain is managed with multi-modal anaesthesia in total hip replacement (thr) and total knee replacement (tkr). it is unclear whether including local anaesthetic infiltration before wound closure provides additional pain control. methods: we performed a systematic review of randomised controlled trials of local anaesthetic infiltration in patients receiving thr or tkr. we searched medline, embase and cochrane central to december 2012. two reviewers screened abstracts, extracted data, and contacted authors for unpublished outcomes and data. outcomes collected were post-operative pain at rest and during activity after 24 and 48 hours, opioid requirement, mobilisation, hospital stay and complications. when feasible, we estimated pooled treatment effects using random effects meta-analyses. results: in 13 studies including 909 patients undergoing thr, patients receiving local anaesthetic infiltration experienced a greater reduction in pain at 24 hours at rest by standardised mean difference (smd) -0.61 (95% ci -1.05, -0.16; p = 0.008) and by smd -0.43 (95% ci -0.78 -0.09; p = 0.014) at 48 hours during activity. in tkr, diverse multi-modal regimens were reported. in 23 studies including 1439 patients undergoing tkr, local anaesthetic infiltration reduced pain on average by smd -0.40 (95% ci -0.58, -0.22; p < 0.001) at 24 hours at rest and by smd -0.27 (95% ci -0.50, -0.05; p = 0.018) at 48 hours during activity, compared with patients receiving no infiltration or placebo. there was evidence of a larger reduction in studies delivering additional local anaesthetic after wound closure. there was no evidence of pain control additional to that provided by femoral nerve block. patients receiving local anaesthetic infiltration spent on average an estimated 0.83 (95% ci 1.54, 0.12; p = 0.022) and 0.87 (95% ci 1.62, 0.11; p = 0.025) fewer days in hospital after thr and tkr respectively, had reduced opioid consumption, earlier mobilisation, and lower incidence of vomiting. few studies reported long-term outcomes. conclusions: local anaesthetic infiltration is effective in reducing short-term pain and hospital stay in patients receiving thr and tkr. studies should assess whether local anaesthetic infiltration can prevent long-term pain. enhanced pain control with additional analgesia through a catheter should be weighed against a possible infection risk.",1
"as of january 3, 2021, a total of 20,346,372 cases of covid-19 (a viral, breathing-related disease) and 349,246 deaths associated with covid-19 have been reported in the united states. long-lasting effects of covid-19 over the course of a lifetime are currently unknown; however, continuing symptoms and serious complications are being reported by some covid-19 survivors, including people who first have a mild acute (sudden) case. on december 11, 2020, the food and drug administration (fda) issued an emergency use authorization (eua), which allows unapproved medicines to be used, for pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine to prevent covid-19, administered as 2 doses separated by 21 days. a group of medical and public health experts called the advisory committee on immunization practices issued a temporary recommendation in december 2020 for using the pfizer vaccine; the first available doses were to be used for health care staff and people who lived in long-term care facilities. as of december 23, 2020, a reported 1,893,360 first shots of the pfizer vaccine had been administered in the united states, and reports of 4,393 (0.2%) unexpected side effects (adverse events) after receiving the pfizer vaccine had been submitted to the vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers), a national vaccine safety tracking system that accepts reports of adverse events after vaccination. among these reports of adverse events, 175 case reports were identified for further review as possible cases of severe allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis - a life-threatening allergic reaction. anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction that occurs rarely after vaccination and usually starts within minutes to hours of receiving the vaccine. there were 21 cases with anaphylaxis, including 17 in people with a documented history of allergies or allergic reactions, 7 of whom had a history of anaphylaxis. the average time between receiving the vaccine to the start of symptoms was 13 minutes, but the range of time for symptoms to start was between 2 minutes - 150 minutes. among 20 people with follow-up information available, all had recovered or been sent home. of the remaining case reports that were found not to have anaphylaxis, 86 cases were judged not to be anaphylaxis allergic reactions, and 61 were considered nonallergic adverse events. seven case reports were still under investigation. this report summarizes the case reports of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and nonanaphylaxis allergic reactions, after receiving the first shot of the pfizer vaccine during december 14-23, 2020, in the united states. cdc has issued updated temporary clinical guidance for use of covid-19 vaccines currently allowed in the united states and temporary guidance for preparing for people who experience anaphylaxis. in addition to checking for reasons a person should not get the vaccine and precautions before giving the covid-19 vaccines, the locations providing the vaccine should have necessary supplies if anaphylaxis occurs. additionally, these locations should set aside time to observe people who receive the vaccine and should immediately treat people experiencing anaphylaxis signs and symptoms.",0

"boosters to prevent sars-cov-2 infections in those who had the first vaccines are needed because the amount of body substances that protect against the virus goes down and people get covid-19, which is called breakthrough infections. although 80 out of 100 people in singapore had 2 doses of a covid-19 vaccine, covid-19 surged in september 2021 as the social distancing and quarantine rules were relaxed. adults 60 years and older who got the first vaccine at least 6 months before were invited to get a booster of pfizer or moderna. we estimated sars-cov-2 infections and disease severity after getting a booster and by type of booster. rates and severity of sars-cov-2 infections between september 15 and october 31, 2021, among those eligible to receive vaccine boosters were studied. covid-19 patients were found through testing of those with symptoms and high-risk workers and close contacts without symptoms. we measured infections confirmed by tests and severe disease (requiring oxygen support, intensive care admission, or death due to covid-19). people who got the boosters 12 days before were included in the booster group, and non-booster group otherwise. depending on the day of observation, a person could be in either group. we estimated getting infected and severe disease between booster and non-booster groups that got the first vaccination with pfizer or moderna. we accounted for the patients' sex, race, housing type, age, and the date of second vaccine that may be related to the strength of protection. we observed the rate of infection in those who got the same booster as the first vaccine and a different vaccine as booster. out of 703,209 people who were allowed to have a booster during the study, 576,132 got boosters. more than half of the people were 60 to 69 years old, a third 70 to 79 years, and a tenth of the people were 0 years and older. slightly more than half of the people were women. among those for whom the first vaccine and the booster was pfizer, about 230 people got covid-19 and about 2 had severe disease. among those who had the first pfizer vaccine but no booster, 600 got covid-19 and 20 had severe disease. among those who had a different booster, about 150 people got covid-19 and about 2 had severe disease. among those who had moderna as their first vaccine and booster, about 134 got covid-19. among those who first had moderna and then a pfizer booster, about 100 had covid-19. the number of severe infections among those who had moderna as the first vaccine was too small to count. people who got different boosters had less covid-19 infections than those boosted with the same vaccine as the first. people who first had pfizer and then any booster had less severe disease than those who did not have boosters. this study has limitations, such as not knowing why people decided for or against boosters, short time between the booster and the study, and no data from younger age groups. the study supports having vaccine boosters. boosting with different vaccines may provide greater protection against covid-19.",0
"achondroplasia, the most common form of human dwarfism is a rare condition that occurs in approximately 1:20,000 births. the major clinical outcome of achondroplasia is attenuated growth, rhizomelic shortening of the long bones and craniofacial abnormalities. as of today there is no pharmacological treatment for achondroplasia. some improvement in the patients well being and daily function can be achieved by a surgical limb lengthening procedure. growth hormone treatment seems to have only modest short term success and to lack long term benefits. achondroplasia results from a single point mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3). in 97% of the patients, there is a glycine to arginine substitution at position 380 within the fgfr-3 transmembrane domain leading to receptor overactivation. this fgf receptor tyrosine kinase is expressed by chondrocytes in the growth plate of developing long bones and plays a crucial role in bone growth. genetic disruption of the fgfr-3 gene in mice leads to a remarkable increase in the length of the vertebral column and long bones. this suggests that overaction of fgfr3 signaling may specifically impair chondrocyte function within the epiphyseal growth plates and cause achondroplasia. reconstituted normal bone growth may therefore be achieved by attenuation of fgfr3 signaling in the appropriate cells within the growth plate. it is highly conceivable that drug development strategies aimed either towards blocking extracellular ligand binding or towards intracellular checkpoints along the fgf signal transduction cascade, may prove successful in the treatment of achondroplasia. this review focuses on the possible approaches for developing a drug for achondroplasia and related skeletal disorders, using chemical, biochemical and molecular strategies.",1
"pressure ulcers, also known as pressure injuries and bed sores, are localized areas of injury to the skin or underlying tissues, or both. dressings made from a variety of materials, including foam, are used to treat pressure ulcers. an evidence-based evaluation of dressings for pressure ulcers is needed to promote informed decision-making on dressing use. this review is part of a suite (group) of cochrane reviews (scientific articles) investigating the use of dressings in the treatment of pressure ulcers. each review will focus on a particular dressing type. the aim of this paper is to assess (measure) the clinical and cost effectiveness of foam wound dressings for healing pressure ulcers in people with an existing pressure ulcer in any care setting. this review included nine trials with a total of 483 participants. all participants were adults (59 years or older) with an existing pressure ulcer category/stage ii or above - each category increasing in severity. all trials had two treatment groups, comparing foam dressings with other dressings for treating pressure ulcers. the certainty of evidence ranged from low to very low. this is because of various negative aspects of the collected data, including bias and imprecision (low confidence in results) due to small sample sizes (small participant groups) and wide confidence intervals. the authors had very little confidence in the estimate of effect of included studies. the authors present data for four comparisons. one trial compared a silicone foam dressing with another (hydropolymer) foam dressing. the study evaluated the treatments in 38 participants with an eight-week (short-term) follow-up. it was unclear whether alternate types of foam dressing affected the incidence (frequency) of healed pressure ulcers or negative side effects. it is unclear as there was low certainty of evidence with serious study limitations and imprecision. four trials with an average sample size of 20 participants compared foam dressings with hydrocolloid (gel-forming) dressings for eight weeks or less (short-term). it was unclear whether foam dressing affected healing in comparison to hydrocolloid dressings over a short follow-up period in three trials. it is unclear as there was low certainty of evidence with serious study limitations and imprecision. it was uncertain if there was a difference in risk of negative side effects between groups. it is unclear as there was low certainty of evidence with serious study limitations and imprecision. reduction in ulcer size, patient satisfaction/acceptability, pain and cost effectiveness data were also reported. however, the authors determined the evidence was of very low certainty. one trial with 34 participants compared foam and hydrogel dressings over an eight-week (short-term) follow-up. it was uncertain if the foam dressing affected the probability (likelihood) of healing, negative side effects, or reduction in ulcer size. it is unclear as there was low certainty of evidence with serious study limitations and imprecision. the remaining three trials with a total of 181 participants compared foam with basic wound contact dressings. follow-up times ranged from short-term (8 weeks or less) to medium-term (8 to 24 weeks). it was uncertain whether foam dressings affected the probability of healing compared with basic wound contact dressings in either the short term or medium term groups. it was uncertain whether foam dressings affected time to complete healing or negative side effects in the medium term groups. this is because it is unclear as there was low certainty of evidence with serious study limitations and imprecision. reduction in ulcer size, patient satisfaction/acceptability, pain and cost effectiveness data were reported again. however, the authors determined the evidence was of very low certainty. none of the included trials reported quality of life or pressure ulcer recurrence (reappearing). the authors conclude that it is unclear if foam dressings are more clinically effective, more acceptable to users, or more cost effective compared to alternative dressings in treating pressure ulcers. it was difficult to make accurate comparisons between foam dressings and other dressings. this is due to the lack of data on the reduction of wound size, complete wound healing, treatment costs, or insufficient time-frames. quality of life and patient acceptability/satisfaction associated with foam dressings were not measured in any of the included studies. the authors determined the certainty of the evidence in the included trials as low to very low. clinicians need to carefully consider the lack of strong evidence concerning clinical and cost-effectiveness of foam dressings for treating pressure ulcers when making treatment decisions. special consideration needs to be given when investigating wound management properties available by each dressing type and the care context.",0
"study objective: to evaluate the efficacy of a 4-day ""burst"" course of prednisone added to standard treatment with h1 antihistamines for the management of acute urticaria in outpatients. design: prospective, randomized, double-blinded, clinical trial. setting: emergency department of an urban tertiary care teaching hospital. participants: adult patients with urticarial rash of no more than 24 hours' duration, regardless of cause. patients were excluded if they manifested wheezing, stridor, or angioedema or if they had taken antihistamines or glucocorticoids within 5 days of arrival at the ed. patients also were excluded if there was a history of diabetes or active peptic ulcer disease. interventions: all patients were asked to evaluate the severity of pruritus (""itch score"") on a 10-cm visual analog scale. patients were then given diphenhydramine, 50 mg intramuscularly, and discharged home on a regimen of hydroxyzine, 25 mg orally, every 4 to 8 hours for pruritus, plus either prednisone, 20 mg, or placebo orally every 12 hours for 4 days. patients' conditions were reassessed clinically, with itch score calculated again 2 days later, and again at 5 days by telephone. results: forty-three patients were enrolled; 24 received prednisone and 19 received placebo. the two groups had similar itch scores at enrollment (prednisone, 8.1 +/- 1.7; placebo, 7.4 +/- 2.1, p = .25 [anova]), but at 2- and 5-day follow-up the prednisone group had significantly lower itch scores (1.3 +/- 1.3 and .0 +/- .0 versus 4.4 +/- 2.2 and 1.6 +/- 1.0, respectively; p < .0001 [ancova] at each interval) and greater clinical improvement in rash. response did not correlate with age, sex, or identification of an allergen. no adverse effects were noted in either group. conclusion: the addition of a prednisone burst improves the symptomatic and clinical response of acute urticaria to antihistamines. patients' conditions improved more quickly and more completely when prednisone was administered, without any apparent adverse effects.",1
"methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) is a critical folate-metabolising enzyme which requires riboflavin as its co-factor. a common polymorphism (677c→t) in the mthfr gene results in reduced mthfr activity in vivo which in turn leads to impaired folate metabolism and elevated homocysteine concentrations. homozygosity for this polymorphism (tt genotype) is associated with an increased risk of a number of conditions including heart disease and stroke, but there is considerable variability in the extent of excess risk in various reports. the present review will explore the evidence which supports a role for this polymorphism as a risk factor for a number of adverse health outcomes, and the potential modulating roles for b-vitamins in alleviating disease risk. the evidence is convincing in the case which links this polymorphism with hypertension and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, particularly preeclampsia. furthermore, elevated blood pressure was found to be highly responsive to riboflavin intervention specifically in individuals with the mthfr 677tt genotype. future intervention studies targeted at these genetically predisposed individuals are required to further investigate this novel gene-nutrient interaction. this polymorphism has also been associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects (ntd) and other adverse pregnancy outcomes; however, the evidence in this area has been inconsistent. preliminary evidence has suggested that there may be a much greater need for women with the mthfr 677tt genotype to adhere to the specific recommendation of commencing folic acid prior to conception for the prevention of ntd, but this requires further investigation.",1
"extracellular vesicles (evs) are found in all biological fluids. evs are released by cells and are used as carriers of biomarkers. biomarkers are measurable substances that can indicate illness. because of this, evs can potentially help identify diseases, such as colorectal cancer (crc) or cancer of the colon. evs are heavily modified with carbohydrates or sugar-carrying molecules, such as tetraspanins, integrins, and mucins. this modification allows evs to reflect the characteristics of the original cell. because evs reflect the original cells, they can offer valuable targets for detection of crc. this study reports on a testing assay (device) to detect and characterize different surface carbohydrates of evs. the assay no longer requires extensive purification (filtration) steps. the assay is tested in five different crc and the hek 293 cell lines. hek 293 cells are human kidney cells. the evs candidates from cell culture (growing in a lab) were evaluated on a panel of serum (blood) samples. the panel included early-stage and late-stage crc patients, benign (normal) condition, and healthy control samples. most of the crc cell lines expressed proteins associated with abnormal cell function and conventional tumor markers. a unique assay was used to detect cd151cd63, a specific combination of foreign substances associated with cancer induction (causation). the cd151cd63 assay showed significantly elevated levels in early-stage crc without detecting any benign and late-stage samples. conventional cea assay detected mostly late-stage crc and with only four early-stage cases. other assays provided similar results to the cd151cd63 assay. these results indicate the potential use of cd151cd63 assay for early detection of crc patients in human serum.",0
"objective: to report a novel wireless neuromodulation system for treatment of refractory craniofacial pain. background: previous studies utilizing peripheral nerve stimulation (pns) of the occipital and trigeminal nerves reported positive outcomes for alleviating neuropathic pain localized to the craniofacial and occipital areas. however several technological limitations and cosmetic concerns inhibited a more widespread acceptance and use of neuromodulation. also, a relatively high incidence of adverse events like electrode erosions, dislocation, wire fracture and/or infection at the surgical site mandates a change in our approach to neuromodulation technology and implant techniques in the craniofacial region. methods: we report a novel approach for the management of craniofacial pain with a wirelessly powered, minimally invasive pns system. the system is percutaneously implanted and placed subcutaneously adjacent to affected facial nerves via visual guidance by the clinician. in this feasibility study, pilot evidence was gathered in a cohort of ten subjects suffering from a combination of chronic headaches, facial pain for at least 15 days per month and for at least 4h/day. results: at four weeks post-implant follow up, all patients reported sustained pain relief of the primary pain area. electrode location and total number of electrodes used per subject varied across the cohort. the average pain reduction using the visual analog scale was ≥82%. the procedure had no adverse events or side effects. conclusion: percutaneous placement of a wireless neurostimulation device directly adjacent to affected craniofacial nerve(s) is a minimally invasive and reversible method of pain control in patients with craniofacial pain refractory to conventional medical managements. preliminary results are encouraging and further larger scale studies are required for improved applications.",1
"public health practices, including handwashing and vaccinations, help reduce the spread and impact of infections. however, the global impact of infection is high, and additional measures are necessary. sudden infections in the lung, also called acute respiratory tract or breathing-related infections, for example, were responsible for about 2.38 million deaths worldwide in 2016. the role nutrition plays in supporting the immune or infection-fighting system is well-documented. a lot of data from existing studies show that vitamins and natural acids play important roles in supporting the immune system. these include vitamins a, b6, b12, c, d, e, and folate; trace elements, including zinc, iron, selenium, magnesium, and copper; and the omega-3 fatty acids and other acids. not eating or maintaining enough of these nutrients is common, leading to a decrease in the body's ability to resist infections which may result in higher illness, loss, and death because of disease. based on this available information, the following conclusions are made: 1) using supplements to add vitamins, minerals, and omega-3 fatty acids is a safe, effective, and inexpensive way to help support immune system functions; 2) supplements above the recommended amount, but still within safety limits, for certain nutrients may be allowed; and 3) public health officials are encouraged to include nutrition plans in their recommendations to improve public health.",0
"the natural development of parkinson's disease (a brain disorder that affects movement and coordination) is largely unknown because patients are usually evaluated while on treatment. as parkinson's disease progresses, the true impact of the long-term response to levodopa (a drug that enters the brain and helps replace missing dopamine, a chemical that carries signals between brain cells) remains unknown because it can only be estimated indirectly in treated patients. researchers aimed to describe the natural progression of motor (movement) symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and slowness of movement by evaluating the natural off state (when symptoms return) in patients with parkinson's disease who have never taken drugs to treat the disease. researchers also aimed to investigate the effects of daily levodopa on the progression of motor disability (partial or total loss of movement in part of the body) in the off medication state over a 2-year period. in this study in sub-saharan africa, 30 parkinson's disease patients started levodopa and are assessed using the unified parkinson's disease rating scale (updrs), a rating tool used to measure the severity and progression of parkinson's disease in patients. data are collected at the start of the study and at 1-year and 2-year follow-up appointments. taking levodopa for the first time has a significant improvement in motor symptoms. at 1-year follow-up, off state (when symptoms return) updrs-iii score after overnight withdrawal of levodopa was considerably lower than natural off. this effect does not change based on how long the person has the disease. at the 2-year follow-up, motor signs after overnight off are still milder than natural off. the on state (patient feels energetic and can move) updrs-iii at the first-ever levodopa challenge is similar to the overnight off score at 1-year follow-up, and the two conditions are connected. compared to the natural progression of motor disability, levodopa treatment resulted in a lower annual decline in updrs-iii scores in the off state with a lower number than expected, which is explained by disease duration. using data taken from before treatment started, researchers made predictions of the natural off at 1-year and 2-year follow-up visits and estimated that the magnitude of how long patients have a response to levodopa ranged between 60% and 65% of benefit on motor ability provided by levodopa, independently of how long patients had the disease. although levodopa is linked to changes in motor ability, overnight off disability (when symptoms return) during levodopa is less severe than the natural course of the disease, independently of how long patients had the disease. the same applies to the yearly decline in updrs-iii scores in the off state. further research is needed to clarify the processes underlying the long-duration response to levodopa in parkinson's disease. understanding the natural course of parkinson's disease and how long motor improvements last while on levodopa may help to develop treatment strategies, increasing its impact to improve patient quality of life and to better understand the outcome of clinical studies on therapies that still rely on the overnight off to define parkinson's disease progression.",0
"purpose: the vast majority of mutations responsible for epilepsy syndromes such as genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (gefs+) and dravet syndrome (ds) occur in the gene encoding the type 1 alpha subunit of neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel (scn1a). methods: 63 individuals presenting with either ds or gefs + syndrome phenotype were screened for scn1a gene mutation using sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (mlpa). results: our research study identified 15 novel pathogen mutations in the scn1a gene of which 12 appeared to be missense mutations with addition of two frameshift-deletions and one in-frame deletion. the distribution of clinical phenotypes in patients carrying scn1a mutations was as follows: twelve patients had classical ds, three patients had gefs + syndrome and two relatives of ds patients were suffering from febrile seizures. conclusions: our study highlights the phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneities of ds and gefs + with the important aim of gaining a deeper understanding of scn1a-related disorders. this study also represents the first genetic analysis of the scn1a gene in a hungarian cohort with the ds and gefs + syndrome phenotype.",1
"edema is a build up of fluid in the body's tissues and does not drain properly, producing noticeable clinical signs and symptoms. the rapid development of pitting edema, which is when pressing into the swollen area leaves a pit or indentation, associated with diseases that affects other parts of the body requires timely diagnosis and management. the ongoing build up of edema in one or both lower legs often suggests veins in the lower limbs are not allowing enough blood to flow to the heart, especially in the presence of gravity-related swelling and build up of iron deposits under the skin that has a shade of brown pigment. skin care is crucial in preventing skin breakdown and venous ulcers, open sores on the skin from abnormal vein function. inflamed skin in the lower legs called eczematous (stasis) dermatitis is a kind of eczema (skin swelling) caused by poor circulation and can be helped with moisturizers and topical steroid creams. patients who have had a condition where a blood clot forms in the vein called deep venous thrombosis should wear compression stockings. if a doctor believes a diagnosis for deep venous thrombosis is possible even after negative (no detection) results are noted on tests, further investigation may include imaging scans to rule out pelvic or thigh proximal venous thrombosis or compression. occasional airflow blockage during sleep called obstructive sleep apnea may cause edema in both legs even in the absence of high blood pressure. discolored, non-pitting (non-indentable) skin with edema is often a sign of lymphedema, fluid build-up in soft tissues when the lymph system is damaged or blocked, which can present in one or both lower limbs. possible other causes of lymphedema include tumor, trauma, previous pelvic surgery, inguinal lymphadenectomy (lymph node dissection), and previous radiation therapy. use of compression devices that are inflatable sleeves worn on the legs or compression stockings may be helpful in these cases.",0
"there have been significant advances in pacing and implantable defibrillator technology over the past decade. the relationships between ventricular activation sequence and cardiac mechanical performance are now better appreciated, and will become more completely understood. even in the setting of infra-his block and bundle branch block, ventricular activation over the purkinje system can now be achieved in many patients with direct pacing of the his bundle, providing a more physiologic alternative to rv pacing that should avoid pacing induced ventricular dysfunction, as well as provide an alternative to left ventricular pacing for crt. advances in the lead technology will increase ease and use of this form of pacing. when activation of the ventricles from the his purkinje system is not feasible, lv pacing for cardiac resynchronization therapy (crt) will continue to be important for patients with depressed ventricular function associated with left bundle branch block. surprisingly, crt is often beneficial even though present implementation is limited to the few lv pacing sites accessible through the coronary venous system. the advent of pacing leads with multiple electrodes for placement in the coronary venous system is a notable advance, that in contrast to traditional bipolar leads, provides multiple lv pacing configurations from which to select the optimal site for lv pacing without compromising lead stability. this option also addresses problems of phrenic nerve stimulation and high pacing thresholds that often limit delivery of lv pacing. these leads will also allow performance of simultaneous pacing from multiple lv sites, which may improve mechanical performance in situations other than left bundle branch block.",1
"inguinal hernia is the most frequently diagnosed hernia and during their lifetime one third of males are diagnosed with an inguinal hernia. the age distribution is bimodal with the highest incidence in childhood and after 50 years of age. diagnosis is usually reached through clinical examination of a lump in the inguinal region although some patients can present with intestinal obstruction. inguinal hernia repair is the only definitive treatment and is one of the most common surgical procedures performed. it is usually performed as an elective procedure in local, spinal or general anasthesia. the repair constitutes of reinforcing the posterior wall of the inguinal canal, often using a polypropylene mesh; either via an open anterior approach or posteriorly from within the abdomen with laparoscopy. the most common complications following a hernia repair are recurrent hernia and chronic -discomfort but recurrence rates have improved with the use of mesh and laparoscopic techniques. this evidence based review describes the -epidemiology and etiology of inguinal hernia together with the most common surgical procedures; focusing on recent innovations.",1
"detection of chemical compounds in exhaled human breath provides an opportunity to determine several aspects about human health. these aspects include evaluating physiological state (how the body is functioning), determining any disease, and/or assessing (measuring) environmental exposures (or things in the environment that can lead to disease). recent advancements in metabolomics research have led to better opportunities to explore human metabolic profiles in depth. metabolomics is the study of metabolites within the body. metabolites are small substances involved in cell metabolism or energy-production. despite some test challenges, exhaled breath represents a good sample for metabolomics applications. breath is ideal as it is non-invasive, convenient, and nearly limitless in availability. there are several breath-based tests that target either internal or external chemical compounds. these tests are already established and are in practical and/or clinical use. this paper reviews the concept of breath analysis used for these unique tests and their applications. the breath biomarkers targeted in each test are discussed in relation to their function in the human body. additionally, the paper evaluates the development and implementation of the associated tests. the paper concludes with a brief insight into prospective (future) tests and an outlook of the future direction of breath research.",0
"we aim to understand how well different drugs work to treat tardive dyskinesia (td) - a movement disorder. on december 12, 2017, we searched for published scientific studies looking at the treatment of td versus sugar pills. we included studies if they looked at treatment of td as the main result and randomly assigned participants to groups receiving td treatment or sugar pills. we used statistical methods to combine the results of multiple studies. results favored vitamin e over sugar pills in td symptom reduction. the results of the published vitamin e studies were different from results of unpublished studies. taking vitamin e for a shorter amount of time and at a lower dose was associated with greater td symptom reduction. results favored vitamin b6 over sugar pills in td symptom reduction. results favored vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (vmat2) inhibitors, drugs that reduce dopamine (a chemical messenger released when your brain is expecting a reward), over sugar pills in td symptom reduction. results favored amantadine - a dopamine promoter - over sugar pills. results did not favor calcium channel blockers, which block transport of calcium in the body, over sugar pills. we conclude that many studies show that vmat2 inhibitors, vitamin e, vitamin b₆, and amantadine may work to treat td. because results of the published vitamin e studies were different from results of unpublished studies and taking vitamin e for a shorter amount of time and at a lower dose was associated with greater td symptom reduction, the benefits of vitamin e in td might not be as great as studies suggest. studies comparing td treatments to each other are needed to compare how well they work and how cost-effective they are.",0
"pacemakers are devices that generate artificial electrical pulses. a heart specialist or pacemaker technologist will be able to control the pacing rate and other functions, whether the device is temporary or permanent. pacemakers are typically categorized as external (main device is outside the body) or internal (device is implanted in the body). the external variety is almost always placed to temporarily stabilize the patient or to assist some type of surgical procedure. the implantable type is usually permanent and often much more complex than the temporary, external variety. pacemakers are one type of a cardiac implantable electronic device (known as cied). this broad category also includes implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (icds), which are devices designed to directly treat a slow heart rate. collectively, this group of devices was first introduced in the 1950s, shortly after the creation of the transistor that can record electrical activity inside heart cells. as technology has improved, so has the pacemaker device. the first implantable icd was developed in 1980, and since that time, it has become more difficult to tell the difference between pacemakers and icds. this is because every icd currently implanted has an anti-bradycardia (anti-slow-heart-rate) pacing function. it is critical for the patient and any health care provider to understand which device has been implanted to prevent unnecessary icd therapy. this is most likely to occur with interference by another electrical device and could lead to activation of the device (if it is an icd). most types of cardiac implantable electronic devices (cied) use several insulated lead wires with non-insulated tips that are implanted in the heart, either by inserting a catheter into a vein or directly by a heart surgeon. pacemakers in the heart are made up of two parts: the pulse generator and the leads or electrodes.",0
"groin hernias are caused by a defect of the abdominal wall in the groin area and comprise inguinal and femoral hernias. inguinal hernias are more common in men. although groin hernias are easily diagnosed on physical examination in men, ultrasonography is often needed in women. ultrasonography is also helpful when a recurrent hernia, surgical complication after repair, or other cause of groin pain (e.g., groin mass, hydrocele) is suspected. magnetic resonance imaging has higher sensitivity and specificity than ultrasonography and is useful for diagnosing occult hernias if clinical suspicion is high despite negative ultrasound findings. herniography, which involves injecting contrast media into the hernial sac, may be used in selected patients. becoming familiar with the common types of surgical interventions can help family physicians facilitate postoperative care and assess for complications, including recurrence. laparoscopic repair is associated with shorter recovery time, earlier resumption of activities of daily living, less pain, and lower recurrence rates than open repair. watchful waiting is a reasonable and safe option in men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic inguinal hernias. watchful waiting is not recommended in patients with symptomatic hernias or in nonpregnant women.",1
"pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency (pdcd) or shortage is a rare disorder that can impact metabolism and lead to problems in the brain and nerves. structural brain abnormalities are common in pdcd. a case of a patient with pdcd is described. a 20-month-old boy with hypotonia (low muscle tone) and developmental delay, was seen by doctors and also had hypoxia (low levels of oxygen in tissues) and trouble breathing due to bronchiolitis (a lung infection). while in the hospital, he was prescribed pediasure® feeds, a child formula or nutritional food product. two days after starting these feeds, he stopped breathing and needed a tube inserted in his throat to help him breathe. after being stable and fasting (no food or drinks), feeding with pediasure® resulted in the recurrence of lactic acidosis (lactic acid build up that can cause nausea, vomiting, and breathing problem). the mri (scanned image) of the brain was normal. pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency (pdcd) was confirmed by viewing the muscle tissue under a microscope. the most common cause of pdcd is a mutation in one of the genes called pdha1 (a gene that encodes a building block of pcd). the seriousness of pdcd can range from infant death to more delayed onset of symptoms as in the child case described here. a normal brain mri is reported in only 2% of patients with pdcd. there is no effective treatment for pdcd. in patients with muscle weakness and who are unable to eat foods with glucose, the presence of lactic acidosis should raise the suspicion of pdcd regardless of the patient's age and normal mri.",0
"phenylketonuria (pku; also known as phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) deficiency) is an autosomal recessive disorder of phenylalanine metabolism, in which especially high phenylalanine concentrations cause brain dysfunction. if untreated, this brain dysfunction results in severe intellectual disability, epilepsy and behavioural problems. the prevalence varies worldwide, with an average of about 1:10,000 newborns. early diagnosis is based on newborn screening, and if treatment is started early and continued, intelligence is within normal limits with, on average, some suboptimal neurocognitive function. dietary restriction of phenylalanine has been the mainstay of treatment for over 60 years and has been highly successful, although outcomes are still suboptimal and patients can find the treatment difficult to adhere to. pharmacological treatments are available, such as tetrahydrobiopterin, which is effective in only a minority of patients (usually those with milder pku), and pegylated phenylalanine ammonia lyase, which requires daily subcutaneous injections and causes adverse immune responses. given the drawbacks of these approaches, other treatments are in development, such as mrna and gene therapy. even though pah deficiency is the most common defect of amino acid metabolism in humans, brain dysfunction in individuals with pku is still not well understood and further research is needed to facilitate development of pathophysiology-driven treatments.",1
"the purpose of this review is to summarize current research and care for people with achondoplasia (a form of dwarfism). achondroplasia is the most common nonlethal bone growth impairment and its characteristics can be seen at birth. a lot of information is available about how achondroplasia progresses over time. achondroplasia is diagnosed by a medical exam and x-rays. achondroplasia is characterised by features such as short limbs and a relatively large head. children commonly have ear infections, delayed walking, and eventually develop bowed legs and a curve in the back. people with achondroplasia are generally of normal intelligence. the genetic cause of achondroplasia was discovered in 1994. since then, research efforts aim to understand the mechanisms that lead to achondroplasia as well as to develop and improve treatments. diagnosis for achondroplasia allows families and doctors to plan future care for affected children. coordinating care between professionals from different disciplines helps each child with achodroplasia get the best treatment.",0
"guidelines for patient care recommend use of fracture risk scores, or the likelihood of having a major bone break, for checks and drug treatment decisions. the timing of treatment-level or screening-level fracture risk scores based on guidelines has not been estimated in women who have gone through menopause (a point in time 12 months after the last period). we measured new occurences of teratment-level and testing-level fracture risk scores in postmenopausal women aged 50 years and older, before receiving drug treatment and the first hip or clinical vertebral fracture. in 54,280 women who had gone through menopause aged 50 to 64 years without a bone mineral density test, we could not estimate the time for 10% to need treatment based on a common osteoporosis questionnaire due to too few scores suggesting treatment. in 6096 women who had scores from a common osteoporosis questionnaire, the estimated time to need treatment was 7.6 years and 5.1 years for those aged 65 to 69 and aged 75 to 79, respectively. of 17,967 women aged 50 to 64 with an initial screening-level frax (or fracture-risk score), 100 (0.6%) broke their hip or spine by age 65 years. we conclude that women who have gone through menopause with questionnaire scores that did not suggest treatment were unlikely to have a score suggesting treatment between ages 50 and 64 years. after age 65, questionnaire scores suggesting treatment, osteoporosis, and serious bone breaks due to osteoporosis suggest doing more questionnaires and bone mineral density testing more often.",0
"background: use of heterologous prime-boost covid-19 vaccine schedules could facilitate mass covid-19 immunisation. however, we have previously reported that heterologous schedules incorporating an adenoviral vectored vaccine (chadox1 ncov-19, astrazeneca; hereafter referred to as chad) and an mrna vaccine (bnt162b2, pfizer-biontech; hereafter referred to as bnt) at a 4-week interval are more reactogenic than homologous schedules. here, we report the safety and immunogenicity of heterologous schedules with the chad and bnt vaccines. methods: com-cov is a participant-blinded, randomised, non-inferiority trial evaluating vaccine safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity. adults aged 50 years and older with no or well controlled comorbidities and no previous sars-cov-2 infection by laboratory confirmation were eligible and were recruited at eight sites across the uk. the majority of eligible participants were enrolled into the general cohort (28-day or 84-day prime-boost intervals), who were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1) to receive chad/chad, chad/bnt, bnt/bnt, or bnt/chad, administered at either 28-day or 84-day prime-boost intervals. a small subset of eligible participants (n=100) were enrolled into an immunology cohort, who had additional blood tests to evaluate immune responses; these participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to the four schedules (28-day interval only). participants were masked to the vaccine received but not to the prime-boost interval. the primary endpoint was the geometric mean ratio (gmr) of serum sars-cov-2 anti-spike igg concentration (measured by elisa) at 28 days after boost, when comparing chad/bnt with chad/chad, and bnt/chad with bnt/bnt. the heterologous schedules were considered non-inferior to the approved homologous schedules if the lower limit of the one-sided 97·5% ci of the gmr of these comparisons was greater than 0·63. the primary analysis was done in the per-protocol population, who were seronegative at baseline. safety analyses were done among participants receiving at least one dose of a study vaccine. the trial is registered with isrctn, 69254139. findings: between feb 11 and feb 26, 2021, 830 participants were enrolled and randomised, including 463 participants with a 28-day prime-boost interval, for whom results are reported here. the mean age of participants was 57·8 years (sd 4·7), with 212 (46%) female participants and 117 (25%) from ethnic minorities. at day 28 post boost, the geometric mean concentration of sars-cov-2 anti-spike igg in chad/bnt recipients (12 906 elu/ml) was non-inferior to that in chad/chad recipients (1392 elu/ml), with a gmr of 9·2 (one-sided 97·5% ci 7·5 to ∞). in participants primed with bnt, we did not show non-inferiority of the heterologous schedule (bnt/chad, 7133 elu/ml) against the homologous schedule (bnt/bnt, 14 080 elu/ml), with a gmr of 0·51 (one-sided 97·5% ci 0·43 to ∞). four serious adverse events occurred across all groups, none of which were considered to be related to immunisation. interpretation: despite the bnt/chad regimen not meeting non-inferiority criteria, the sars-cov-2 anti-spike igg concentrations of both heterologous schedules were higher than that of a licensed vaccine schedule (chad/chad) with proven efficacy against covid-19 disease and hospitalisation. along with the higher immunogenicity of chad/bnt compared with chad/chad, these data support flexibility in the use of heterologous prime-boost vaccination using chad and bnt covid-19 vaccines.",1
"objective: to explore the spectrum and frequency of causes for chronic cough in chinese patients. methods: 86 patients with chronic cough were enrolled in the study. the diagnostic procedure was based on the anatomical protocol for diagnosing chronic cough designed by irwin, and additional cytological assay was performed for sputum induced by hypertonic saline aerosol inhalation. the efficacy of therapy specific to the diagnosis was evaluated. results: definite diagnosis was made in 77 (89.5%) out of the 86 patients with chronic cough. the most common causes included cough variant asthma (cva) (24/86, 27.9%), postnasal drip syndrome (pnds) (22/86, 25.6%), eosinophilic bronchitis (eb) (13/86, 15.1%), and gastroesophageal reflux (ger) (12/86, 14.0%). after active management based on the diagnosis, cough improved in 72 patients (93.5%). conclusions: in addition to cva, pnds and ger, eosinophilic bronchitis is also an important cause of chronic cough. a positive response to the specific therapy is essential to a definite diagnosis.",1
"vaccines are needed to prevent covid-19 (a viral respiratory disease) and to protect people who are at a high risk for complications or harm. the mrna-1273 vaccine helps the body make proteins that will strengthen the immune system to fight the coronavirus that causes covid-19. the 3rd phase of a clinical study is conducted in 99 centers across the united states. people who are at a high risk for the coronavirus or its complications are randomly placed in either the group to receive two shots of the mrna-1273 vaccine or in the placebo group (people will be given a shot of an inactive substance). the main result researchers are interested in is the prevention of covid-19 starting at least 14 days after the second shot in study participants who have not already been infected with coronavirus. the trial includes 30,420 volunteers who are randomly placed in a group to receive the vaccine or to receive the placebo. more than 96% of volunteer participants receive both shots, and 2.2% are positive for (or have) the coronavirus at the start of the study. covid-19 is found in 185 participants in the placebo group and in 11 people in the mrna-1273 vaccine group. the effectiveness of the vaccine is 94.1%. in additional analyses, the vaccine is found to be effective during the patient evaluation 14 days after the first dose, in participants who were positive for coronavirus at the start of the study, and in participants 65 years old or older. serious covid-19 occurs in 30 participants, with one death. all 30 are in the placebo group. moderate, short-lasting side effects after vaccination occur more often in the mrna-1273 vaccination group. serious side effects are rare, and the number of times it occurred is similar in the two groups. in conclusion, the mrna-1273 vaccine group shows 94.1% effectiveness at preventing covid-19, including serious cases of covid-19. aside from short reactions to mrna-1273, no safety concerns are found.",0
"repeated positive covid-19 tests show that the risk of new people getting the disease is growing. we studied what causes positive test results. we studied children with covid-19 who were at the hospital in february - march 2020. 133 children had negative rpeated covid-19 test results and 51 had positive results. among patients with repeated positive tests, there were more with cough and fewer with shortness of breath, compared to patients with the negative test. patients who had symptoms and repeated positive tests were admitted to the hospital and had positive test results earlier. people who had repeated positive tests also had different blood test results compared to the people with negative tests. coughing and a certain blood test result were each associated with a positive retest result. patients who stayed at the hospital for less than 2 weeks or had symptoms shortly after getting covid-19 should be quarantined. these results could help identify patients who require closer surveillance.",0
"in patients with von hippel-lindau (vhl) disease, kidney cysts (growths) and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccrcc), a type of kidney cancer, come from cells in the kidneys called epithelial cells that inactivate (or turn off) the vhl gene. the vhl gene keeps cells from growing and dividing too fast. however, it is believed that formation of kidney cysts and their change to the ccrcc kidney cancer involve additional genetic changes at other locations. this study shows that cystic wounds in the kidneys of patients with vhl disease also show activation of the enzyme called phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (pi3k) pathway, which regulates key cells processes. when two genes called vhlh and pten that keep cells from growing too fast are turned off, this brings about cyst formation in the kidneys of mice after a short delay. however, inactivation of only one of these genes fails to produce this same effect. interestingly, cells lining these cysts frequently lack primary cilium, that acts like a cell antenna and is important for stopping or slowing kidney epithelial cells from multiplying and for stopping cyst formation. these results support a model in which the pten tumor suppressor protein cooperates with pvhl to stop cyst development in the kidney.",0
"covid-19 (a viral breathing-related disorder) may cause diseases such as pneumonia (lung infection), heart-related changes, and multiple organ failure, which has been related to cytokine storm (an immune reaction where the body releases too many cytokines, which play a role in the body's normal immune response, into the blood too quickly), a systematic inflammatory response (the body's natural reaction against injury and infection in which the immune system attacks the body's own tissues), and an attack by the immune system. also, an oxidative stress imbalance, which can lead to cell and tissue damage, has been shown to occur in covid-19 patients. n- acetyl-l-cysteine (nac) is used to build antioxidants (vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that protect and repair cells), and its presence may be followed by reduced, or charged, glutathione (gsh), a key antioxidant that protects tissues and cells. nac may be a potential preventive drug for a variety of disorders that involve gsh depletion and oxidative stress. at very high doses, n- acetyl-l-cysteine (nac) is also used as a medicine against paracetamol intoxication (too much of a common oral medication called acetaminophen used for pain and reducing fevers). nac may help prevent sars-cov-2, the virus leading to covid-19, from entering cells. nac taken orally (by mouth) is likely to weaken the risk of developing covid-19. also, high-does n- acetyl-l-cysteine (nac) taken intravenously (medication delivered through the vein) may play a role in expanding the treatment of severe covid-19 cases and help control lung and heart complications.",0
"dystonia is a complicated brain-related movement disorder with uncontrollable muscle contractions. many studies imply microorganisms inside us as a possible factor for brain-related disorders, but the link between the gut microorganisms (microbiota) and dystonia remains poorly explored. here, the gut microbiota of 57 patients with dystonia and 27 age- and environment-matched healthy patients was analyzed by 16s dna sequencing. further, we analyzed the gut microbiome and molecules in the blood. no change in some gut-diversity was found, while other gut-diversity was very different, with a more diverse community among dystonia patients than among healthy patients (controls). the most different change in dystonia showed an increase in certain types of microorganisms labeled clostridiales, including blautia obeum, dorea longicatena, and eubacterium hallii, and a reduction in other microorganisms labeled bacteroides vulgatus and bacteroides plebeius. the analysis showed that genes related to the molecules tryptophan and purine creation were more abundant in gut microbiota from patients with dystonia, while genes linked to energy cycles, vitamin b6, and glycan (a specific sugar) breakdown were less abundant. analyzing blood molecules revealed changed levels of molecules called l-glutamic acid, taurine, and d-tyrosine, suggesting changes in brain signaling molecule metabolism. the most modified molecules decreased with the abundance of microorganism members belonging to the clostridiales, revealing the effect of the gut microbiota on brain molecule activity. this study is the first to show gut microbial differences in patients with dystonia and found possible links between gut microbiota and blood brain signaling molecules, providing new insight into the causes of dystonia. importance dystonia is the third most common movement disorder after tremors and parkinson's disease (a brain disorder affecting movement). however, the cause for many cases is not known. this is the first study so far that reveals significant changes of gut microbiome and links the change of blood molecules with gut changes in patients with dystonia. we show a general overrepresentation of clostridiales and underrepresentation of bacteroidetes in patients with dystonia compared to healthy controls. the analysis found that genes related to the creation tryptophan, which makes the brain signaling molecule serotonin, were more active in dystonia patients. changed levels of several blood molecules were found to be linked with microbial changes, such as d-tyrosine, taurine, and glutamate, indicating differences in brain signaling molecule metabolism in dystonia. analysis suggests that brain signaling molecule system dysfunction may be a possible pathway by which the gut microbiome participates in the development of dystonia. the gut microbiome changes provide new insight into the cause of dystonia, suggesting new potential treatment directions.",0
"background: vaccines are needed to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) and to protect persons who are at high risk for complications. the mrna-1273 vaccine is a lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated mrna-based vaccine that encodes the prefusion stabilized full-length spike protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), the virus that causes covid-19. methods: this phase 3 randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at 99 centers across the united states. persons at high risk for sars-cov-2 infection or its complications were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two intramuscular injections of mrna-1273 (100 μg) or placebo 28 days apart. the primary end point was prevention of covid-19 illness with onset at least 14 days after the second injection in participants who had not previously been infected with sars-cov-2. results: the trial enrolled 30,420 volunteers who were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either vaccine or placebo (15,210 participants in each group). more than 96% of participants received both injections, and 2.2% had evidence (serologic, virologic, or both) of sars-cov-2 infection at baseline. symptomatic covid-19 illness was confirmed in 185 participants in the placebo group (56.5 per 1000 person-years; 95% confidence interval [ci], 48.7 to 65.3) and in 11 participants in the mrna-1273 group (3.3 per 1000 person-years; 95% ci, 1.7 to 6.0); vaccine efficacy was 94.1% (95% ci, 89.3 to 96.8%; p<0.001). efficacy was similar across key secondary analyses, including assessment 14 days after the first dose, analyses that included participants who had evidence of sars-cov-2 infection at baseline, and analyses in participants 65 years of age or older. severe covid-19 occurred in 30 participants, with one fatality; all 30 were in the placebo group. moderate, transient reactogenicity after vaccination occurred more frequently in the mrna-1273 group. serious adverse events were rare, and the incidence was similar in the two groups. conclusions: the mrna-1273 vaccine showed 94.1% efficacy at preventing covid-19 illness, including severe disease. aside from transient local and systemic reactions, no safety concerns were identified.

"group 1 (all types of cho) the intervention followed the american dietetic association nutrition practice guidelines for gestational diabetes. women received an individual food plan based on cho restriction (40–45% of tei), using a cho counting strategy (basic level). moderate energy restriction was recommended only for overweight and obese women (24 kcal/kg). breakfast cho intake was limited to 15–30 g, and adequate fiber intake was promoted (20–35 g/day). women in this group were advised to choose any type of cho, except added refined sugars. energy and cho prescriptions were revised at every visit and changes were done according to weight gain and whether or not ketonuria was present. if ketones were present and weight gain was subnormal, energy prescription was increased (200 to 300 kcal/day). if weight gain was adequate, energy was not modified and carbohydrates were increased (no more than 45% of tei). fat intake recommendation was maintained (<40% of tei), and protein recommendation adjustment was made accordingly (20–25% of tei). group 2 (low gi cho) women in this group received the same intervention as women in group 1, but were counseled to eliminate all moderate and high gi foods (gi > 55). tropical fruits, refined breads, breakfast cereals, flour tortilla, white rice, refined cookies and pastries, potatoes, carrots, beets, and refined sugars were eliminated from their plan. papaya was the only moderate gi fruit permitted because it is one of the most frequently consumed high-fiber foods in this population. corn tortillas were included only when combined with beans, as well as corn flakes combined with milk, according to some evidence that the combination of these foods decreases their gi. conclusions. inclusion of low gi cho as part of a comprehensive nutrition intervention is equally effective in improving glycemic control as compared to all types of cho. this strategy had a positive effect in preventing excessive maternal weight gain but increased the risk of prematurity.",1
"previous studies have demonstrated that both anastrozole and letrozole are well tolerated. letrozole suppresses estrogen to a greater degree than anastrozole in the serum and breast tumor. concerns have been raised that greater potency may adversely affect patients' quality of life (qol). one hundred eighty-one postmenopausal women with invasive estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers were randomized to receive either 12 weeks of letrozole followed by 12 weeks of anastrozole or the reverse sequence. one hundred and six received immediate adjuvant aromatase inhibitors (ais) following surgery, and 75 received extended adjuvant therapy. the functional assessment of cancer therapy endocrine subscale (fact-b-es) qol questionnaires were completed to assess qol on each drug. additional side-effect profiles were collected. each patient completed a patient preference form. twenty-one patients withdrew before study end, 10/179 (5.6%) while taking letrozole and 4/173 (2.3%) while taking anastrozole (p = 0.12). tamoxifen-naïve patients had a higher mean es (endocrine symptoms subscale) score at entry versus those having extended therapy (66.0 vs. 61.9; p = 0.001). there was no significant change in fact-b-es (overall) scores or es scores while patients were taking anastrozole or letrozole and no significant differences between drugs. nearly 80% of patients reported one or more side effects with either agent. no differences in frequency, grade, or range of side effects were seen between drugs. of 160 patients, 49 (30.6%) preferred letrozole, 57 (35.6%) preferred anastrozole, and 54 (33.8%) had no preference (p = 0.26, pearson's chi-squared test). in conclusion, both ais are equally well tolerated. there were no significant differences in qol scores between the two drugs.",1
"background: circular rnas (circrnas) have attracted increasing attention in recent years for their potential application as disease biomarkers due to their high abundance and stability. in this study, we attempted to screen circrnas that can be used to predict postoperative recurrence and survival in patients with gastric cancer (gc). methods: high-throughput rna sequencing was used to identify differentially expressed circrnas in gc patients with different prognoses. the expression level of circrnas in the training set (n = 136) and validation set (n = 167) was detected by quantitative real-time pcr (qrt-pcr). kaplan-meier estimator, receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve and cox regression analysis were used to evaluate the prognostic value of circrnas on recurrence-free survival (rfs) and overall survival (os) in gc patients. cerna network prediction, gene ontology (go) and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (kegg) analyses were performed for the circrnas with prognostic significance. results: a total of 259 differentially expressed circrnas were identified in gc patients with different rfs. we found two circrnas (hsa_circ_0005092 and hsa_circ_0002647) that highly expressed in gc patients with good prognoses, and subsequently established a predictive model for postoperative recurrence and prognosis evaluation, named circpanel. patients with circpanellow might have shorter recurrence-free survival (rfs) and overall survival (os). we also performed circrna-mirna-mrna network prediction and functional analysis for hsa_circ_0005092 and hsa_circ_0002647. conclusions: circpanel has the potential to be a prognostic biomarker in gc patients with greater accuracy than a single circrna and certain traditional tumor markers (e.g., cea, ca19-9 and ca724).",1
"hypothyroidism is one of the most common hormone deficiencies in adults. most of the cases, particularly those of overt hypothyroidism, are easily diagnosed and managed, with excellent outcomes if treated adequately. however, minor alterations of thyroid function determine nonspecific manifestations. primary hypothyroidism due to chronic autoimmune thyroiditis is largely the most common cause of thyroid hormone deficiency. central hypothyroidism is a rare and heterogeneous disorder characterized by decreased thyroid hormone secretion by an otherwise normal thyroid gland, due to lack of tsh. the standard treatment of primary and central hypothyroidism is hormone replacement therapy with levothyroxine sodium (lt4). treatment guidelines of hypothyroidism recommend monotherapy with lt4 due to its efficacy, long-term experience, favorable side effect profile, ease of administration, good intestinal absorption, long serum half-life and low cost. despite being easily treatable with a daily dose of lt4, many patients remain hypothyroid due to malabsorption syndromes, autoimmune gastritis, pancreatic and liver disorders, drug interactions, polymorphisms in dio2 (iodothyronine deiodinase 2), high fiber diet, and more frequently, non-compliance to lt4 therapy. compliance to levothyroxine treatment in hypothyroidism is compromised by daily and fasting schedule. many adult patients remain hypothyroid due to all the above mentioned and many attempts to improve levothyroxine therapy compliance and absorption have been made.",1
"the aim of the study was to report on the prevalence and severity of laryngopharyngeal symptoms in patients with copd compared to controls. a total of 27 patients with copd and 13 controls matched according to age and gender were included. demographic data included age, gender, history of smoking and history of allergic rhinitis. the reflux symptom index described by belafsky et al. was used. the frequency and average score of each of the laryngopharyngeal symptoms were computed. the mean age of patients was 61.67 â± 11.09 years. ninety-two percent were smokers and 11.1 % had allergy rhinitis. the mean of total reflux symptom index in patients was significantly higher compared to controls (12.70 â± 7.06 vs. 3.00 â± 2.94). in the copd group, 18 subjects had a positive reflux symptom index (>11) compared to one in the control group (p value <0.05). there was also a significant difference between the means of six laryngopharyngeal symptoms in patients vs. controls: copd patients had higher degree of hoarseness, throat clearing, excessive throat mucus, cough and sticking sensation in the throat. laryngopharyngeal reflux is more prevalent in patients vs. controls: the frequency and severity of laryngopharyngeal symptoms is significantly higher in copd patients.",1
"phenylketonuria (pku) is a disorder inherited from both parents in which the body cannot properly turn food into energy due to lack of a specific protein (phenylalanine hydroxylase, pah) in the liver. pku can cause intellectual disability if not treated. treatment, which includes a low phenylalanine diet with formulas containing molecules that form proteins, begins soon after diagnosis within the first weeks of life. although treatment diets prevent intellectual disability in pku patients treated early, many patients do not follow the diets because they do not taste good. treatment diets also may lack certain nutrients, especially vitamin d and b12. patients who do not follow the diets generally show poorer performance in some mental skills. work has been done to improve the quality of medical diets including their taste. using certain molecules that form certain proteins are examples of ways to improve medical diets. transferring genetic material into a patient's cell and replacing or substituting a substance that is lacking in the pku patient's body have been successful in recent years. in this review, we discuss current and possible future treatments for pku.",0
"objective: the object of the study was to determine whether time of day, interval after a standard meal, and maternal body mass influence plasma glucose concentrations in women with gestational diabetes mellitus. study design: identical mixed meals were administered on 2 separate occasions 1 week apart to 30 women with dietarily treated gestational diabetes and pregnancies between 28 and 38 weeks' gestation. one meal was administered at 7 am (morning meal) and the other was administered at 9 pm (evening meal), each after a fast of >/=5 hours. the order of the meals (morning first versus evening first) was assigned randomly. sixteen of the women had a body mass index >/=27 kg/m(2) (overweight) and 14 women had a body mass index <27 kg/m(2) (lean). venous plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, free fatty acids, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and bound and free cortisol were measured hourly for 9 hours after each of the test meals. results: when all women were considered together glucose concentrations after the morning meal were significantly greater at 1 hour, were not different at 2 hours, and were significantly lower from 3 through 9 hours postprandially than those at corresponding times after the evening meal. plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate and free fatty acid concentrations were higher between 5 and 9 hours after the morning meal than at the same times after the evening meal. total and free cortisol levels were higher for the first 7 hours after the morning feeding, reflecting known diurnal variation in cortisol concentrations. overweight patients' glucose values were significantly greater than those of lean subjects during the last 4 hours of the overnight fast. conclusions: among women with dietarily treated gestational diabetes the glucose concentrations were significantly higher from 3 to 9 hours after an evening meal, whereas suppression of free fatty acids and beta-hydroxybutyrate was less sustained after a morning feeding. the mechanisms underlying these differences remain to be determined but may involve diurnal influences of counterregulatory hormones. the relationships between measurements of maternal glycemia and maternal and perinatal outcomes in pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes may be clarified by establishing a uniform duration of a fast and by developing meal-specific preprandial and postprandial maternal glucose targets for these patients.",1
"pacemakers are adjustable artificial electrical pulse generators commonly to aid heart rate, frequently emitting a pulse between 0.5 and 25 milliseconds with 0.1 to 15 volts, up to 300 times per minute. the heart specialist or pacemaker technologist can assess and control the pacing rate, pulse width, voltage, and whether the device is temporary or permanent. pacemakers are usually categorized as external or internal. the external type is almost always placed for temporary stabilization of the patient or to help some type of surgery. the implantable type is usually permanent and often, more complex than the temporary, external type. pacemakers are one type of heart-related or cardiac implantable electronic devices (or cied). cieds also include implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (icds), which corrects irregular heart beats. together, this group of devices was first introduced in the 1950s, shortly after the transistor, which alters electrical signals. as technology improved, so has the pacemaker. the first implantable icd was created in 1980. since then, it has become more difficult to differentiate between pacemakers and icds. this difficulty is because every icd currently implanted aids against a slow heart rate. it is important for the patient and clinician to know which device has been implanted to prevent unnecessary icd therapy. this is likely to occur with any electromagnetic interference (emi) and may activate the device (if it is an icd). most types of cieds use many electrically-isolated lead wires with non-electrically-isolated tips impanted in the heart, either by skin vein insertion or directly by a heart surgeon. heart-related pacemakers are made of the pulse generator and the leads or electrical contact points.",0
"polyuria-polydipsia syndrome consists of the three main entities: central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia. reliable distinction between these diagnoses is essential as treatment differs substantially, with the wrong treatment potentially leading to serious complications. past diagnostic measures using the classical water deprivation test had several pitfalls and clinicians were often left with uncertainity concerning the diagnosis. with the establishment of copeptin, a stable and reliable surrogate marker for arginine vasopressin, diagnosis of the polyuria-polydipsia syndrome has been newly evaluated. whereas unstimulated basal copeptin measurement reliably diagnoses nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, two new tests using stimulated copeptin cutoff levels showed a high diagnostic accuracy in differentiating central diabetes insipidus from primary polydipsia. for the hypertonic saline infusion test, osmotic stimulation via the induction of hypernatraemia is used. this makes the test highly reliable and superior to the classical water deprivation test, but also requires close supervision and the availability of rapid sodium measurements to guarantee the safety of the test. alternatively, arginine infusion can be used to stimulate copeptin release, opening the doors for an even shorter and safer diagnostic test. the test protocols of the two tests are provided and a new copeptin-based diagnostic algorithm is proposed to reliably differentiate between the different entities. furthermore, the role of copeptin as a predictive marker for the development of diabetes insipidus following surgical procedures in the sellar region is described.",1
"extracellular vesicles (evs) are found in all biological fluids, providing potential for the identification of disease biomarkers such as colorectal cancer (crc). evs are heavily glycosylated with specific glycoconjugates such as tetraspanins, integrins, and mucins, reflecting the characteristics of the original cell offering valuable targets for detection of crc. we report here on europium-nanoparticle (eunp)-based assay to detect and characterize different surface glycoconjugates of evs without extensive purification steps from five different crc and the hek 293 cell lines. the promising evs candidates from cell culture were clinically evaluated on small panel of serum samples including early-stage (n = 11) and late-stage (n = 11) crc patients, benign condition (n = 11), and healthy control (n = 10). the majority of crc cell lines expressed tetraspanin sub-population and glycovariants of integrins and conventional tumor markers. the subpopulation of cd151 having cd63 expression (cd151cd63) was significantly (p = 0.001) elevated in early-stage crc (8 out of 11) without detecting any benign and late-stage samples, while conventional cea detected mostly late-stage crc (p = 0.045) and with only four early-stage cases. the other glycovariant assays such as ceacon-a, ca125wga, ca 19.9ma696, and ca 19.9con-a further provided some complementation to the cd151cd63 assay. these results indicate the potential application of cd151cd63 assay for early detection of crc patients in human serum.",1
"mark wearing is now present everywhere. this is because of the covid-19 pandemic (a global, viral, respiratory illness). mask wearing has increased medical device-related pressure injuries, or skin sores, in persons that have higher chances of their skin breaking down. the ear has a unique structure that is more vulnerable to injury from pressure. right now is a time of mandatory personal protective equipment requirements in healthcare facilities. continual wear of personal protective equipment requires care for and assessment (evaluation) of the skin of the ear. this study presents a case of a pressure injury on the ear. this study will also review the anatomy of the ear and provide strategies for assessment and treatment of pressure injuries of the ear. when treating a mask-related pressure injury, you first begin by removing the mask. if the patient continues to require a mask, provide a mask or “ear saver” mask strap that secures around the head or back of the neck rather than the ear. however, providing an ""ear saver"" does not remove the need for continued monitoring of the skin areas that undergo continued pressure. infection should be considered and ruled out. local cellulitis (bacterial skin infection) is characterized by warmth, redness, pain, and swelling. presence of pus might indicate a deeper infection and/or abscess (swollen area with pus). if there is signs of infection, treatment should be initiated with topical treatment (applied directly to the skin) and/or systemic antibiotics (drugs that affect the whole body). treatment method chosen will depend on the skin health and severity of infection. removing hair in the area may be helpful. this may be helpful as it eliminates things that may stray into the wound. additionally, hair is a source of contamination. it is important to understand that a healed wound may not have the same physical strength as normal tissue. additionally, healed skin may be vulnerable to reoccurring injuries, also known as recidivism.",0
"standards of diagnosing diabetes in children have not been established with nearly the same precision as has been used in adults recently revised american diabetes association (ada) guidelines uses the standard of ≥ 6.5 % in the hba1c test as a diagnosis of diabetes. recent studies in children show that the hba1c test is not as accurate as other tests that measure glucose in the blood. however, other glucose measuring blood tests have not yet been verified to work in children. future studies, to see which glucose measuring test is best in children, are unlikely to happen. accepting the ada guidelines for diagnosing diabetes in children appears to be the best option for pediatricians. future studies on blood glucose tests should try to develop a guideline for doctors to treat ‘pre-diabetes’. however, such treatment, and the best way to diagnose and treat ’pre-diabetes’, has not been proven.",0
"objective: although total knee replacement (tkr) surgery is highly prevalent and generally successful, functional outcomes post-tkr vary widely. most patients receive some physical therapy (pt) following tkr, but pt practice is variable and associations between specific content and dose of pt interventions and functional outcomes are unknown. research has identified exercise interventions associated with better outcomes but studies have not assessed whether such evidence has been translated into clinical practice. we characterized the content, dose, and progression of usual post-acute pt services following tkr, and examined associations of specific details of post-acute pt with patients' 6-month functional outcomes. methods: post-acute pt data were collected from patients who were undergoing primary unilateral tkr and participating in a clinical trial of a phone-based coaching intervention. pt records from the terminal episode of care were reviewed and utilization and exercise content data were extracted. descriptive statistics and linear regression models characterized pt treatment factors and identified associations with 6-month outcomes. results: we analyzed 112 records from 30 pt sites. content and dose of specific exercises and incidence of progression varied widely. open chain exercises were utilized more frequently than closed chain (median 21 [interquartile range (iqr) 4-49] versus median 13 [iqr 4-28.5]). median (iqr) occurrence of progression of closed and open chain exercise was 0 (0-2) and 1 (0-3), respectively. shorter timed stair climb was associated with greater total number of pt interventions and use and progression of closed chain exercises. discussion: data suggest that evidence-based interventions are underutilized and dose may be insufficient to obtain optimal outcomes.",1
"the use of wound dressings based on moist wound healing principles has recently changed how pressure ulcers (skin sores) are treated. moist wound healing is when an injury is kept damp to prevent drying out. these products may improve healing rates. they may also offer improved comfort to the patient, reduced dressing time, and improved wound appearance. however, healing is unlikely to occur unless the reasons the ulcer was formed are addressed. there are several principles of ulcer management or healing. these principles include: eliminating or reducing pressure and other contributing factors, treating infection, appropriate wound management, involvement and education of the patient and caregivers, and maintenance of healed tissue. it is estimated that 95% of all pressure ulcers are preventable. preventing ulcers rather than treating ulcers is a priority in the effort to reduce the incidence (frequency) of this common, complex, and difficult problem. use of assessment (measurement) tools that identify the main reasons pressure ulcers are caused is helpful to predict and prevent injuries to the skin.",0
"we compared background insulin release in nine islet-cell antibody (protein made against insulin-producing cells) positive, non-diabetic parents or siblings of children with type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes and nine normal people matched for age, sex and weight. short-term insulin responses to an i.v. (injected) glucose tolerance test were similar in the two groups. we measured blood insulin in people who had not had anything to eat for a period of time in blood samples taken every minute for 2 hours. we looked at blood insulin over time to see how it rises and falls. the islet-cell antibody-positive group (group with the antibody) did not have a regular pattern, but normal people had a 13-minute cycle. the islet-cell antibody-positive group did have a peak every 13 minutes. we conclude that the overall rise and fall of background insulin release is changed in islet-cell antibody positive people even when the short-term insulin response is normal.",0
"as background for this study, atopic dermatitis (eczema) is a common childhood disease, potentially influenced by pre-birth nutritional exposures such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufas). as the objective for this study, in a racially diverse group, we hypothesized that childhood atopic dermatitis would be linked with higher pre-birth omega-6 (n-6) and lower omega-3 (n-3) pufas. we included mother-child groups, births 2006 to 2011, enrolled in the university of tennessee health sciences center conditions affecting neurocognitive (brain-related intelligence) development in early childhood group. main events included second trimester blood n-3 and n-6 pufa status and the ratio of the two (n-6:n-3). we measured child current atopic dermatitis symptoms in the previous 12 months of age approximately 4 to 6 years. we investigated the link between pufa exposures and atopic dermatitis using mathematical analysis. we measured for effect modification by maternal pre-birth smoking, atopic (allergy-related) disease history, and child sex. the results include among 1131 women, 67% were african american and 42% had an atopic disease history; 17% of children had atopic dermatitis. higher pre-birth n-6 pufas were linked with increased relative odds of child atopic dermatitis, and statistical models show that this link was seen in two-member groups in which the women had a history of atopic disease. neither pre-birth n-3 pufas nor n-6:n-3 were linked with child atopic dermatitis. in conclusion, in this racially diverse cohort, higher second trimester n-6 pufas were linked with atopic dermatitis in children of women with atopy. pufas may represent a modifiable risk factor for atopic dermatitis, especially in individuals with an inherited risk factor.",0
"metabolic epilepsies (seizures) arise in the context of rare hereditary or inborn errors of metabolism (iem) and can be caused in rare disorders. a common feature of these disorders is they cause brain-related symptoms, such as epileptic seizures, developmental delay (delays in reaching language, thinking, social, or motor skills), and movement disorders. the ketogenic diet, a low-carb/high-fat diet, has been successfully used to treat such conditions. how a ketogenic diet exactly impacts inborn errors of metabolism is not known, but it is likely that they influence the negative impacts of genetic mutations. benefits of a ketogenic diet are broadly grouped into restoration of parts of metabolism that are impaired, improved maintenance of cells and cells processes, reduced pain and swelling, and processes that control gene activity without changing the dna. it is possible that a ketogenic diet may be useful in other disorders of metabolism that include epileptic seizures. at the same time, there are some disorders where ketogenic diets should be avoided. more research is needed to better describe metabolic epilepsies that would benefit from a ketogenic diet. expanding knowledge will be important to design metabolism-based treatments.",0

"pallister-hall syndrome (phs) is a rare disease caused by changes in a single gene (the basic unit of inheritance.) the abnormalities include extra fingers and toes, growth of non-cancer masses in the brain, changes in the flap that protect the windpipe, improper function of the endocrine system that regulates body functions through hormones, and other problems. the signs of this disease vary and are passed down through either parent. we studied if phs causes any mental health problems. we measured how well the brain is working in 19 phs patients ranging in age from 7 to 75 years. the evaluation included clinical examination, patients' reports and tests of brain functions. seven of 14 adults had at least one of the mental health conditions most commonly found in the public. three other patients had delays in mental development or low scores on the tests that measure how well the brain is working. the tests usually evaluate reading, use of language, attention, learning, reasoning, remembering, problem-solving, and more. we did not find mental health problems specifically associated with phs. the frequency of each of the problems in these patients was the same as expected in the group of 19 people. the rate of mental problems in phs cannot be compared to the overall rate of mental problems in the general population because of the way this study collected the data.",0
"background: given the importance of flexible use of different covid-19 vaccines within the same schedule to facilitate rapid deployment, we studied mixed priming schedules incorporating an adenoviral-vectored vaccine (chadox1 ncov-19 [chad], astrazeneca), two mrna vaccines (bnt162b2 [bnt], pfizer-biontech, and mrna-1273 [m1273], moderna) and a nanoparticle vaccine containing sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein and matrix-m adjuvant (nvx-cov2373 [nvx], novavax). methods: com-cov2 is a single-blind, randomised, non-inferiority trial in which adults aged 50 years and older, previously immunised with a single dose of chad or bnt in the community, were randomly assigned (in random blocks of three and six) within these cohorts in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a second dose intramuscularly (8-12 weeks after the first dose) with the homologous vaccine, m1273, or nvx. the primary endpoint was the geometric mean ratio (gmr) of serum sars-cov-2 anti-spike igg concentrations measured by elisa in heterologous versus homologous schedules at 28 days after the second dose, with a non-inferiority criterion of the gmr above 0·63 for the one-sided 98·75% ci. the primary analysis was on the per-protocol population, who were seronegative at baseline. safety analyses were done for all participants who received a dose of study vaccine. the trial is registered with isrctn, number 27841311. findings: between april 19 and may 14, 2021, 1072 participants were enrolled at a median of 9·4 weeks after receipt of a single dose of chad (n=540, 47% female) or bnt (n=532, 40% female). in chad-primed participants, geometric mean concentration (gmc) 28 days after a boost of sars-cov-2 anti-spike igg in recipients of chad/m1273 (20 114 elisa laboratory units [elu]/ml [95% ci 18 160 to 22 279]) and chad/nvx (5597 elu/ml [4756 to 6586]) was non-inferior to that of chad/chad recipients (1971 elu/ml [1718 to 2262]) with a gmr of 10·2 (one-sided 98·75% ci 8·4 to ∞) for chad/m1273 and 2·8 (2·2 to ∞) for chad/nvx, compared with chad/chad. in bnt-primed participants, non-inferiority was shown for bnt/m1273 (gmc 22 978 elu/ml [95% ci 20 597 to 25 636]) but not for bnt/nvx (8874 elu/ml [7391 to 10 654]), compared with bnt/bnt (16 929 elu/ml [15 025 to 19 075]) with a gmr of 1·3 (one-sided 98·75% ci 1·1 to ∞) for bnt/m1273 and 0·5 (0·4 to ∞) for bnt/nvx, compared with bnt/bnt; however, nvx still induced an 18-fold rise in gmc 28 days after vaccination. there were 15 serious adverse events, none considered related to immunisation. interpretation: heterologous second dosing with m1273, but not nvx, increased transient systemic reactogenicity compared with homologous schedules. multiple vaccines are appropriate to complete primary immunisation following priming with bnt or chad, facilitating rapid vaccine deployment globally and supporting recognition of such schedules for vaccine certification.",1
"objective: in the present study, an attempt was made to examine the effects of aural stimulation with ointment containing capsaicin on swallowing function in order to develop a novel and safe treatment for non-obstructive dysphagia in elderly patients. patients and methods: the present study included 26 elderly patients with non-obstructive dysphagia. ointment containing 0.025% capsaicin (0.5 g) was applied to the external auditory canal with a cotton swab under otoscope only once or once a day for 7 days before swallowing of a bolus of colored water (3 ml), which was recorded by transnasal videoendoscopy and evaluated according to the endoscopic swallowing score. results: after a single application of 0.025% capsaicin ointment to the right external auditory canal, the endoscopic swallowing score was significantly decreased, and this effect lasted for 60 minutes. after repeated applications of the ointment to each external auditory canal alternatively once a day for 7 days, the endoscopic swallowing score decreased significantly in patients with more severe non-obstructive dysphagia. of the eight tube-fed patients of this group, three began direct swallowing exercises using jelly, which subsequently restored their oral food intake. conclusion: these findings suggest that stimulation of the external auditory canal with ointment containing capsaicin improves swallowing function in elderly patients with non-obstructive dysphagia. by the same mechanism used by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to induce cough reflex, which has been shown to prevent aspiration pneumonia, aural stimulation with capsaicin may reduce the incidence of aspiration pneumonia in dysphagia patients via arnold's ear-cough reflex stimulation.",1
"many adults with persistently low blood levels of alkaline phosphatase, a protein that influences levels of the high-energy molecule phosphate, possibly have a mutation in the alpl gene that encodes alkaline phosphatase. many adults also have increased phosphate-carrying compounds in blood and urine. these adults may have low blood phosphate levels (hypophosphatasia). the study determines what proportion of adults with persistently low blood alkaline phosphatase levels (hypophosphatasemia) have mutations in the alpl gene or accumulated phosphate-carrying compounds. some adults with persistent hypophosphatasemia share symptoms with the adult form of low blood phosphate levels or hypophosphatasia (hpp). in hpp, alpl mutations lead to persistent hypophosphatasemia and phosphate-carrying compounds in blood (pyridoxal-5-phosphate (plp) or active vitamin b6) and urine (phosphoethanolamine (pea) or a key molecule to build cell boundaries). blood alp activity, bone-specific alp, blood plp, and urine pea were measured in adults with persistently low levels of alp. variations of the alpl gene were classified as disease-causing or pathogenic (p), likely pathogenic (lp), variants of uncertain significance (vus), likely harmless or benign (lb), and benign (b). p and lp variants were also grouped as ""positive alpl variants"". lb and b were grouped as ""negative alpl variants."" fifty subjects completed all the tests. sixteen percent had only negative alpl variatns. of the remaining 42, 67% had at least one copy of the p variant, 19% for an lp variant, and 14% for a vus. tests results agreed with each other and showed that the amount of alp trended oppositely with the quantity of the molecules that it acts upon. those with positive alpl variants had lower alp and bone-specific alp and had higher plp and pea than those with negative alpl variants. around half of those with positive alpl variants or alpl vus had increases in blood plp. three quarters had increases in urine pea. adults with persistently low alp levels frequently had alpl mutations and increased phosphate-carrying compounds. these adults may have low blood phosphate levels.",0
"introduction: hemorrhage is the leading cause of preventable death in combat, although early recognition of hemorrhage is still challenging on the battlefield. hypothesis/problem: the objective of this study was to describe the shock index (si) in a healthy military population, and to measure its variation during a controlled blood loss, simulated by blood donation. methods: a prospective observational study that enrolled military subjects, volunteers for blood donation, was conducted. demographic and clinical information, concerning both the patient and the blood collection, were recorded. baseline vital signs were measured, before and after donation, in a 45° supine position. statistical analysis was performed after calculation of si. results: a total of 483 participants were included in the study. the mean blood donation volume was 473ml (sd = 44ml). the median pre- and post-blood donation si were significantly different: 0.54 (iqr = 0.48-0.63) and 0.57 (iqr = 0.49-0.66), respectively (p = .002). changes in pre-/post-donation blood pressure (bp) and heart rate (hr) also reached statistical difference but represented a clinically poor relevance. the multivariate analysis showed no significant associations between si variations and age, sex, body mass index (bmi), sport activities, blood donation volume, and enteral volume replacement (evr). conclusion: in this model of mild hemorrhage, si exhibited significant variations but failed to reach clinical relevance. further studies are needed to prove the benefit of si calculation as a possible parameter for early recognition of hemorrhage in combat casualties at the point of injury.",1
"nutrient intake plays a significant role in the health outcomes of all pregnant women. in a pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus (gdm), excellent glucose control is as foundational as appropriate weight gain and adequate nutrient intake. the controversies in gdm management include the following: how far to manipulate energy intake, dietary composition (carbohydrates and fats), and gestational weight gain. signs that food restrictions have gone too far include weight loss or lack of weight gain, undereating to avoid insulin therapy, positive urinary ketones, and intentional restriction of healthy foods. if a balance between nutrient needs and glucose control cannot be achieved, then concurrent medication therapy is needed to assist in reducing insulin resistance and supplementing insulin production to provide normoglycemia and improved pregnancy outcomes. medical nutrition therapy is a self-management therapy. education, support, and follow-up are required to assist the woman to make lifestyle changes essential to successful nutrition therapy. women with gdm are at increased risk for type 2 diabetes; learning to manage gdm with lifestyle change provides an opportunity to affect personal risk factors and the health of the whole family.",1
"objectives: to determine the national rate and trend of inappropriate medication administration to elderly emergency department (ed) patients. secondary objectives were to identify risk factors for receiving an inappropriate medication and to determine whether administration is sometimes justified based on diagnosis. design: retrospective analysis of ed visits in the 1992-2000 national hospital ambulatory medical care survey. inappropriate medications identified using beers' 1997 explicit criteria. setting: eds of u.s. noninstitutionalized general and short-stay hospitals. participants: ed survey patients aged 65 and older. measurements: magnitude and rate of administration of 36 medications. results: inappropriate medications were administered in an estimated 16.1 million (95% confidence interval (ci)=14.9-17.3 million) or 12.6% (95% ci=11.6-13.5%) of elderly ed visits from 1992 to 2000. the rate of inappropriate administration was unchanged throughout the study period (p=.40). six drugs accounted for 70.8% of inappropriate administration: promethazine (22.2%), meperidine (18.0%), propoxyphene (17.2%), hydroxyzine (10.3%), diphenhydramine (7.1%), and diazepam (6.0%). in multivariate analysis, number of ed medications was the strongest predictor, with an odds ratio for two to three medications of 6.0 (95% ci=5.3-6.7) and for four to six medications of 8.1 (95% ci=7.2-9.2). diagnoses indicating potentially appropriate uses of these medications were rarely present. for example, only 42.4% of patients receiving diphenhydramine and 7.4% receiving hydroxyzine were diagnosed with an allergic process. conclusion: elderly ed patients are frequently administered inappropriate medications. potentially appropriate uses of generally inappropriate drugs cannot account for such administrations. inappropriate administration rates remain unchanged despite the 1997 publication of explicit criteria.",1
"cystic echinococcosis, also called hydatid disease, is caused by the infection of a long tapeworm called echinococcus granulosus, after it has hatched into the larval stage. a person can often have this condition without symptoms for years before the cyst (growth) grows large enough to cause symptoms in affected organs. the most common organs involved are the liver and lungs although the heart, brain, bone, central nervous system (spinal cord and brain), and kidney may also be involved. this case is about a young woman who presented with left back pain and urinary tract infection (uti - bladder infection) who was later diagnosed as having left kidney hydatid cyst. the cyst was about 7.8×6.6×8cm with multiple compartments at the lower pole cortex (lower part) of the left kidney. a procedure that uses tiny incisions was performed to remove the cyst and some tissue around the cyst. no complications occurred after the procedure, and she was sent home with anti-worm medicine and other medications. with timely management using several therapies, this condition is curable, and the patient can live a healthy life with normal kidney function.",0
"objective: to explore the spectrum and clinical features of causes for chronic cough. methods: a total of 103 patients with at least 8 weeks of chronic cough and normal chest radiographs were recruited from the outpatient clinic of china-japan friendship hospital department of respiratory diseases between oct 2005 to feb 2009. the causes were investigated using a well established protocol according to the chinese respiratory society guidelines for management of cough. the diagnostic protocol included history inquiring and physical examination, pulmonary function tests, induced sputum cell differentials, 24 h esophageal ph monitoring, ct of the paranasal sinuses or chest, fiberoptic rhinoscopy or bronchoscopy. the final diagnosis was made based on clinical manifestations, examination findings and a positive response to therapy. the results were compared with those reported in guangzhou before. results: the cause of chronic cough was defined in 95.1% of the patients, of which 83 patients (83.5%) with a single cause, 32 (13.6%) with 2 causes, and 3 (2.9%) with 3 causes.",1
"antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (ag-rdts) can complement molecular diagnostics for covid-19. the recommended temperature for storage of sars-cov-2 ag-rdts ranges between 2-30 °c. in the global south, mean temperatures can exceed 30 °c. in the global north, ag-rdts are often used in external testing facilities at low ambient temperatures. we assessed analytical sensitivity and specificity of eleven commercially-available sars-cov-2 ag-rdts using different storage and operational temperatures, including short- or long-term storage and operation at recommended temperatures or at either 2-4 °c or at 37 °c. the limits of detection of sars-cov-2 ag-rdts under recommended conditions ranged from 1.0×106- 5.5×107 genome copies/ml of infectious sars-cov-2 cell culture supernatant. despite long-term storage at recommended conditions, 10 min pre-incubation of ag-rdts and testing at 37 °c resulted in about ten-fold reduced sensitivity for five out of 11 sars-cov-2 ag-rdts, including both ag-rdts currently listed for emergency use by the world health organization. after 3 weeks of storage at 37 °c, eight of the 11 sars-cov-2 ag-rdts exhibited about ten-fold reduced sensitivity. specificity of sars-cov-2 ag-rdts using cell culture supernatant from common respiratory viruses was not affected by storage and testing at 37 °c, whereas false-positive results occurred at outside temperatures of 2-4 °c for two out of six tested ag-rdts, again including an ag-rdt recommended by the who. in summary, elevated temperatures impair sensitivity, whereas low temperatures impair specificity of sars-cov-2 ag-rdts. consequences may include false-negative test results at clinically relevant virus concentrations compatible with transmission and false-positive results entailing unwarranted quarantine assignments. storage and operation of sars-cov-2 ag-rdts at recommended conditions is essential for successful usage during the pandemic.",1
"more than 2 million people in the united states have myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (me/cfs). we performed targeted, broad-spectrum metabolomics to gain insights into the biology of cfs. we studied a total of 84 subjects using these methods. forty-five subjects (n = 22 men and 23 women) met diagnostic criteria for me/cfs by institute of medicine, canadian, and fukuda criteria. thirty-nine subjects (n = 18 men and 21 women) were age- and sex-matched normal controls. males with cfs were 53 (±2.8) y old (mean ± sem; range, 21-67 y). females were 52 (±2.5) y old (range, 20-67 y). the karnofsky performance scores were 62 (±3.2) for males and 54 (±3.3) for females. we targeted 612 metabolites in plasma from 63 biochemical pathways by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography, electrospray ionization, and tandem mass spectrometry in a single-injection method. patients with cfs showed abnormalities in 20 metabolic pathways. eighty percent of the diagnostic metabolites were decreased, consistent with a hypometabolic syndrome. pathway abnormalities included sphingolipid, phospholipid, purine, cholesterol, microbiome, pyrroline-5-carboxylate, riboflavin, branch chain amino acid, peroxisomal, and mitochondrial metabolism. area under the receiver operator characteristic curve analysis showed diagnostic accuracies of 94% [95% confidence interval (ci), 84-100%] in males using eight metabolites and 96% (95% ci, 86-100%) in females using 13 metabolites. our data show that despite the heterogeneity of factors leading to cfs, the cellular metabolic response in patients was homogeneous, statistically robust, and chemically similar to the evolutionarily conserved persistence response to environmental stress known as dauer.",1
"most interventions to prevent postpartum depression (ppd) focus on the mother rather than the mother-infant dyad. as strong relationships between infant sleep and cry behavior and maternal postpartum mood have been demonstrated by previous research, interventions targeted at the dyad may reduce symptoms of ppd. the goal of the current study was to examine the effectiveness of practical resources for effective postpartum parenting (prepp). prepp is a new ppd prevention protocol that aims to treat women at risk for ppd by promoting maternally mediated behavioral changes in their infants, while also including mother-focused skills. results of this randomized control trial (rct) (n = 54) indicate that this novel, brief intervention was well tolerated and effective in reducing maternal symptoms of anxiety and depression, particularly at 6 weeks postpartum. additionally, this study found that infants of mothers enrolled in prepp had fewer bouts of fussing and crying at 6 weeks postpartum than those infants whose mothers were in the enhanced tau group. these preliminary results indicate that prepp has the potential to reduce the incidence of ppd in women at risk and to directly impact the developing mother-child relationship, the mother's view of her child, and child outcomes.",1
"new recommendations for the classification and diagnosis of diabetes mellitus include the preferred use of the terms ""type 1"" and ""type 2"" instead of ""iddm"" and ""niddm"" to designate the two major types of diabetes mellitus; simplification of the diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus to two abnormal fasting plasma determinations; and a lower cutoff for fasting plasma glucose (126 mg per dl [7 mmol per l] or higher) to confirm the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. these changes provide an easier and more reliable means of diagnosing persons at risk of complications from hyperglycemia. currently, only one half of the people who have diabetes mellitus have been diagnosed. screening for diabetes mellitus should begin at 45 years of age and should be repeated every three years in persons without risk factors, and should begin earlier and be repeated more often in those with risk factors. risk factors include obesity, first-degree relatives with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia or previous evidence of impaired glucose homeostasis. earlier detection of diabetes mellitus may lead to tighter control of blood glucose levels and a reduction in the severity of complications associated with this disease.",1
"hypophosphatasia is genetic condition that blocks metabolic pathways. it is characterized by hypophosphatasemia or low serum (blood) levels of a protein, alkaline phosphatase, that indicates bone health. this biomarker, or a measurable compound to determine health status, reflects mutations within the gene that encodes the tissue-nonspecific isoenzyme (form) of alkaline phosphatase (tnsalp). tnsalp is an enzyme that is expressed in the skeleton, liver, kidney and developing teeth. in hypophosphatasia, accumulation of tnsalp natural substrates (substances altered by tnsalp) occurs. these substrates include inorganic pyrophosphate, an inhibitor (blocker) of mineralization. accumulation of inorganic pyrophosphate explains the tooth loss, rickets or bone softening, and joint swelling. severely affected infants sometimes also have hypercalcemia (high calcium levels) and hyperphosphatasemia (high alkaline phosphatase levels). this is due to the blocked entry of minerals into the skeleton and pyridoxine-dependent seizures. the seizures are cause by insufficient breakdown of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, the major circulating form of vitamin b6. the different types of possible mutations of alpl (which encodes for alkaline phosphatase) largely accounts for the wide range of severity of hypophosphatasia (a rare, genetic bone disorder). high serum concentrations of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate represent an accurate and specific biomarker for hypophosphatasia. also, levels of phosphoethanolamine (which helps construct cell boundaries) are usually elevated in serum and urine. however, these biomarkers are less reliable for diagnosis. tnsalp mutation detection is important to determine is recurrence may occur and prenatal diagnosis. diagnosing pediatric (child) hypophosphatasia is aided by observing disease-specific changes when the skeletal disease is severe. hypophosphatasia was the last bone disease to receive a medical treatment. now, significant successes for severely affected child patients are recognized using asfotase alfa, a prescription drug.",0
"alarming variants of sars-cov-2 (a viral respiratory disease) show reduced elimination by vaccine-induced and highly-specific antibodies. thus, different treatments are needed. we tested horse-derived polyclonal antibodies (pabs), a mixture of antibodies that bind to the same foreign organism. these pabs are being measured in costa rica against five alarming, global variants: alpha, beta, epsilon, gamma, and delta. horse-derived pabs efficiently treat the concerning variants with much lower dosages than those used in clinical trials. horse-derived pabs are an effective, broad coverage, low-cost treatment for covid-19 (a widespread viral respiratory disease).",0
"purpose: increased epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) expression may promote breast cancer resistance to endocrine therapy. we have therefore investigated whether neoadjuvant gefitinib, an egfr inhibitor, might overcome biologic and clinical resistance to neoadjuvant anastrozole in a phase ii placebo-controlled trial. patients and methods: postmenopausal women with stage i to iiib hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer received anastrozole 1 mg daily for 16 weeks and were randomly assigned at a ratio of 2:5:5 to receive, in addition, gefitinib 250 mg/d orally for 16 weeks: placebo 1 tablet/d orally for 2 weeks and then gefitinib for 14 weeks or placebo for 16 weeks. the primary end point was biologic change in proliferation as measured by ki67 at 2 and 16 weeks; the main secondary end point was overall objective response (or). results: two hundred six women were randomly assigned. mean changes in ki67 with anastrozole and gefitinib versus anastrozole alone were -77.4% and -83.6%, respectively, between baseline and 16 weeks (geometric mean ratio = 1.37; 95% ci, 0.79 to 2.39; p = .26), -80.1% and -71.3% between baseline and 2 weeks (geometric mean ratio = 0.70; 95% ci, 0.39 to 1.25; p = .22) and -19.3% and -43% (geometric mean ratio = 1.42; 95% ci, 0.86 to 2.35; p = .16) between 2 and 16 weeks. ors in the combination and anastrozole alone groups were 48% and 61% (estimated difference = -13.1%; 95% ci, -27.3% to 1.2%), respectively, with a nonsignificant trend against the combination (p = .08) and 48% versus 72% (estimated difference = -24.1%; 95% ci, -45.3% to -2.9%) in the progesterone-receptor-positive subgroup, which was significant (p = .03) and consistent with ki67 changes. common treatment-related adverse events included diarrhea, rash, alopecia, dry skin, and nausea. there was no evidence of a pharmacokinetic interaction. conclusion: addition of gefitinib to neoadjuvant anastrozole had no additional clinical or biologic effect, failing to support our original hypothesis.",1
"background lipedema is a common condition that presents as excessive fat deposition in the extremities, initially sparing the trunk, ankles, and feet, and is found mainly in women, usually occurring after puberty or pregnancy. lipedema can progress to include lipo-lymphedema of the ankles and feet. this report is of a 41-year old woman with stage 3 lipedema and lipo-lymphedema with excessive fat of the lower body since puberty, with progression to swollen ankles and feet despite dietary caloric restriction. case report a 41-year-old woman noticed increased fat in her legs since age 12. her weight and leg size increased until age 21, when she reached a maximum weight of 165 kg, and underwent a roux-en-y gastric bypass. over 12 months, she lost 74.8 kg. her trunk significantly reduced in weight, but her legs did not. fifteen years later, during recovery from hysterectomy surgery, she became progressively weaker and swollen over her entire body. laboratory test results showed hypoalbuminemia (2.0 g/dl), lymphopenia, and hypolipoproteinemia. she was diagnosed with protein and calorie malnutrition with marked gut edema requiring prolonged parenteral nutrition. after restoration of normal protein, her health returned and her pitting edema resolved, but her extremities remained enlarged. she was subsequently diagnosed with lipedema. conclusions this report demonstrates that early and correct diagnosis of lipedema is important, as women who believe the condition is due to obesity may suffer the consequences of calorie or protein-calorie deficiency in an attempt to lose weight.",1
"pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency or shortage is a rare disorder that can impact metabolism and lead to problems in the nervous sytem. the objective of this study is to describe cases of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency after starting a ketogenic (low carb/high fat) diet and to review other studies that have images of the brain in patients with the disorder. medical information from 3 cases of patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency who had magnetic resonance imagings (mris), or scans of the brain, taken before and after they started a ketogenic diet are reported. researchers searched for other published cases of patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency who also had multiple mris. the 3 cases in this report showed improvement by being on a ketogenic diet. two cases showed a reversal of some brain lesions or damage on repeat mri after starting a ketogenic diet. the study's search for other cases found 13 patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency who had some form of treatment, and of this group 4 patients had repeat mris that showed definite improvement. in all cases, improvement occurred in lesions in the basal ganglia, a part of the brain that helps coordinate movement. in patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency, basal ganglia lesions on mri are reversible with treatment in some cases and could serve as a way to measure how a patient responds to treatment.",0
"diet strategies for preventing covid-19 (a breathing-related viral disorder) and pneumonia (an infection the inflames the lung air sacs) are being considered. unfortunately, as with drugs, human studies have not confirmed specific foods to be effective with covid-19. we know the immune system is key to reducing the severity of covid-19. perhaps by influencing it the right way, we can save humans with preventative steps. many studies show that certain foods used as medicine can beneficially activate the immune response in patients with many diseases, like cancer or aids (a disease from an immunodeficiency virus), and healthy people at risk of viral infections. natural substances are usually seen as valuable tools in the fight against viruses due to the structural diversity and safety of the substances. many products consumed by people and used in traditional medicine have substances with anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antiviral properties like vitamins and other plant chemicals. however, there is no evidence that herbs, spices, health-promoting food ingredients, or dietary supplements can prevent, reduce, or treat covid-19 or other infections, including severe covid-19 pneymonia, immediate lung failure, inflammatory molecule overproduction, blood clotting disorders, or multiple organ failure.",0
"hyperkalemia is a condition where the potassium level in the blood is higher than normal. potassium is a very important mineral (electrolyte) in the body. hyperkalemia is a potentially fatal electrolyte disorder. it more likely occurs when the body cannot get rid of potassium as well as it should. hyperkalemia can lead to serious problems. especially because hyperkalemia can cause severe problems with the heart beat. the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (raas) is a hormone system that manages blood pressure and fluid balance in the body. drugs that block the raas (raas blockers) have good effects on the cardiovascular system (heart and blood vessels). but the raas blockers can cause hyperkalemia. high-potassium diets can also have good effects on the cardiovascular system. but doctors have to stop giving these raas blockers and also recommend low-potassium diets in patients with hyperkalemia. potassium can predict mortality. potassium levels should be checked often in patients at risk for hyperkalemia. the rules for treating hyperkalemia that occurs rapidly have been updated. patient studies have shown that the new drugs to treat hyperkalemia (patiromer and zirconium cyclosilicate) work well to treat hyperkalemia. these new drugs may let doctors continue to use the raas blockers more often. doctors may be able to recommend less strict potassium diets too. hyperkalemia should be closely watched for in high-risk patients because it can lead to poor outcomes. new drugs have been shown to work well. there is hope that these new drugs can control the blood potassium levels in patients that would benefit from raas blockers and diets higher in potassium, leading to better overall treatment results.",0
"hypertension, a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke, is the world's leading cause of preventable, premature death. a common polymorphism (677c→t) in the gene encoding the folate metabolizing enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) is associated with increased blood pressure, and there is accumulating evidence demonstrating that this phenotype can be modulated, specifically in individuals with the mthfr 677tt genotype, by the b-vitamin riboflavin, an essential co-factor for mthfr. the underlying mechanism that links this polymorphism, and the related gene-nutrient interaction, with hypertension is currently unknown. previous research has shown that 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, the product of the reaction catalysed by mthfr, appears to be a positive allosteric modulator of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (enos) and may thus increase the production of nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator. blood pressure follows a circadian pattern, peaking shortly after wakening and falling during the night, a phenomenon known as 'dipping'. any deviation from this pattern, which can only be identified using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (abpm), has been associated with increased cardiovascular disease (cvd) risk. this review will consider the evidence linking this polymorphism and novel gene-nutrient interaction with hypertension and the potential mechanisms that might be involved. the role of abpm in b-vitamin research and in nutrition research generally will also be reviewed.",1
"rapid diagnostics tests are useful for detecting covid-19 virus. misleading demos of the rapid test on social media showed it can find covid-19 virus in the tap water and food. to fight misleading information, we studied the results of the rapid tests that did not follow testing rules. we did the test in a wrong way on water, food, other liquids and samples without the covid-19 virus. we also studied how different temperatures and humidity change test results. doing the test wrong caused false positive results saying there is covid-19 virus in the materials that did not have it. false results may happen because the parts of the test change if the test is done wrong. the test changed less in extremes of temperature and humidity. our study supports strictly following the test instructions to reduce false positive results of covid-19 rapid test. false positive results increase anxiety, overuse of public health resources, and spread of rumors. the panbio rapid covid-19 test that we studied is used in over 120 countries worldwide. it is very important to understand how to get accurate test results. recently on social media, this kit was shown to generate false positives when manufacturer recommendations were not followed. health professionals know that not doing the tests right causes errors in the results. knowing what causes the errors will help them explain the errors and stop rumors. many different parts of the test need to work properly to avoid mistakes. in many cases, test errors are caused by the chemicals our bodies have to fight other infections or some other chemicals that accidentally got into the test. our study shows how the parts of the test can cause errors if the test is not done right. following the manufacturer instructions is critical for accurate test results.",0
"newborn screening is important for the early detection of many congenital genetic and metabolic disorders, aimed at the earliest possible recognition and management of affected newborns, to prevent the morbidity, mortality, and disabilities associated with an inherited metabolic disorder. this comprehensive system includes; testing, education, follow up, diagnosis, treatment, management, and evaluation. there are major differences among many of the disorders being considered for inclusion in newborn screening programs. in recent times, advances in laboratory technology such as tandem mass spectrometry (ms/ms), which is more specific, sensitive, reliable, and comprehensive than traditional assays, has increased the number of genetic conditions that can be diagnosed through neonatal screening programs at birth. with a single dried filter paper blood spot, ms/ms can identify more than 30 inherited metabolic disorders in around two to three minutes. advances in the diagnosis and treatment and an increased understanding of the natural history of inborn errors of metabolism have produced pressure to implement expanded newborn screening programs in many countries. even as many countries throughout the world have made newborn screening mandatory, in iran, nationwide newborn screening for inherited metabolic disorders other than hypothyroidism has not been initiated, hence, there is little information about these diseases. this article aims to review the recent advances in newborn metabolic screening and its situation in iran and other countries.",1
"background: atopic dermatitis is a common childhood disease, potentially influenced by prenatal nutritional exposures such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufas). objective: in a racially diverse cohort, we hypothesized that childhood atopic dermatitis would be associated with higher prenatal omega-6 (n-6) and lower omega-3 (n-3) pufas. methods: we included mother-child dyads, births 2006 to 2011, enrolled in the university of tennessee health sciences center conditions affecting neurocognitive development in early childhood cohort. primary exposures included second trimester plasma n-3 and n-6 pufa status and the ratio of the two (n-6:n-3). we assessed child current atopic dermatitis symptoms in the previous 12 months at age approximately 4 to 6 years. we investigated the association between pufa exposures and atopic dermatitis using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders. we assessed for effect modification by maternal prenatal smoking, atopic disease history, and child sex. results: among 1131 women, 67% were african american and 42% had an atopic disease history; 17% of children had atopic dermatitis. higher prenatal n-6 pufas were associated with increased relative odds of child atopic dermatitis (adjusted odds ratio: 1.25; confidence interval: 1.01-1.54 per interquartile range difference), and interaction models demonstrated that this association was seen in dyads in which the women had a history of atopic disease. neither prenatal n-3 pufas nor n-6:n-3 were associated with child atopic dermatitis. conclusion: in this racially diverse cohort, higher second trimester n-6 pufas were associated with atopic dermatitis in children of women with atopy. pufas may represent a modifiable risk factor for atopic dermatitis, particularly in individuals with a familial predisposition.",1
"parkinson's disease is diagnosed when bradykinesia (slowness of movement) occurs together with rigidity or tremors, along with other characteristics. the diagnosis is based on the signs, symptoms, and health history of the patient. attention should be paid to other criteria that might indicate another diagnosis and to 'red flag' (investigate further) features. there is no cure or treatment that can reduce the activity and progression for parkinson's disease, and the rate of progression varies among patients. the most effective treatment to help symptoms is levodopa (a drug that enters the brain and helps replace missing dopamine), which has superior benefits for quality of life in early parkinson's disease compared to other therapies. changes in the ability to move and dyskinesia (involuntary and uncontrollable movements) later in the disease's development can be improved by adding another treatment that assists the primary treatment. around 10% of patients per year with motor (movement) changes that are not responding to treatment may be able to take advanced therapies, including deep-brain stimulation surgery (surgery that implants devices to stimulate certain areas of the brain). there is emerging evidence for the management of non-motor symptoms (symptoms unrelated to movement such as lack of pain or tiredness) in parkinson's disease, and the importance of multidisciplinary care (when professionals from different fields work together to deliver comprehensive care that addresses the patient's needs). in this article, the evidence foundation for the best diagnosis and care of parkinson's disease is discussed.",0
"dystonia is a disorder of the nervous system. it involves unusual posture or parts of your body moving in ways you can't control. dystonia could be a sign of many underlying disorders, sometimes with other symptoms and sometimes not. we will focus on dystonia without other symptoms. this can be hereditary or have an unknown origin. dystonia varies in how it appears, but it can affect all age groups, and can significantly impact daily life. we understand more about different types of dystonia since discovering the genes causing it. some of the most common forms of hereditary dystonia are caused by mutations in genes called tor1a, thap1, gch1 and kmt2b. these mutations may cause: problems with genes turning on or off; problems with sending or receiving dopamine (a neurotransmitter involved in motivation); problems adjusting the connections of brain cells; or problems suppressing unwanted brain activity. dystonia is mainly diagnosed by signs a doctor can recognize. it is still difficult to diagnose and explain dystonia. dystonia can be treated with: drugs (specifically anticholinergics, which block a neurotransmitter); injections of botulinum toxin (such as botox); and insertion of electrodes into the brain. however, we hope that more research will produce better diagnostics, treatments, and maybe cures.",0
"postpartum depression (depression after childbirth) is one of the most common mental disorders. its occurance is estimated to be between 10% and 15%. even though the origin of postpartum depression has many causes, it is known that genetics play an important role in the onset of this disorder. this research reviews evidence supporting the role of genetics in postpartum depression (ppd). this research will determine which genes and mutations are associated with ppd. the review will discuss how this association may occur. also, this research studies if these genes are related to (or the same as) genes linked to major depression (md). to seek out gaps in the current knowledge that require more research, a thorough review was done in the electronic databases pubmed, lilacs and scielo. the search words ""postpartum depression"" and ""genetics"" were used. literature searches were done for articles in peer-reviewed journals up until april 2014. peer-reviewed journals use experts in the same field to go over the studies before publishing the articles. during the literature search, the search words ""postpartum depression"" and ""genetics"" were linked 56 times.. the rules for including the articles in this study were articles written in portuguese, spanish or english that were available to the institutional or the authors. this search resulted in 20 papers. genes and mutations related to major depression (md) have been the most studied. these genes are involved in the metabolism of chemicals that effect emotions (such as serotonin, catecholamines, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and tryptophan. )some of these genes and mutations have been related to ppd. the results are not all in agreement. some depend on epigenetics (which can change the way your genes work without changing the dna itself). the results are in the early stages. further studies are required to determine the genes that are involved in ppd. more studies are needed to define the relationship between these genes and ppd.",0
"foreign bodies in the ear, nose, and throat are occasionally seen in family medicine, usually in children. the most common foreign bodies are food, plastic toys, and small household items. diagnosis is often delayed because the causative event is usually unobserved, the symptoms are nonspecific, and patients often are misdiagnosed initially. most ear and nose foreign bodies can be removed by a skilled physician in the office with minimal risk of complications. common removal methods include use of forceps, water irrigation, and suction catheter. pharyngeal or tracheal foreign bodies are medical emergencies requiring surgical consultation. radiography results are often normal. flexible or rigid endoscopy usually is required to confirm the diagnosis and to remove the foreign body. physicians need to have a high index of suspicion for foreign bodies in children with unexplained upper airway symptoms. it is important to understand the anatomy and the indications for subspecialist referral. the evidence is inadequate to make strong recommendations for specific removal techniques.",1
"tardive dyskinesias (tds) are still common long-term sequelae of antipsychotic treatment. they are generally irreversible and associated with cognitive deficits, a decrease in quality of life and increased mortality. furthermore, they potentially contribute to further stigmatization of the affected patients. however due to limited treatment options, antipsychotic drugs are still one of the cornerstones in treatment of most severe mental illnesses. therefore, knowledge about risk factors and prevention of tds is crucial. if tds occur, the immediate optimization of the antipsychotic drug regimen is required. targeted medical treatments such as vmat - 2 inhibitors can be considered. the novel vmat-2 inhibitors are not yet approved in germany. other drugs that are currently used to treat tds include clonazepam and gingko biloba. this review summarizes the current evidence of treatment options of tds and seeks to formulate clinical recommendations for the prevention and management of tds.",1
"pregabalin abuse has become an emerging concern; thus, the current study has been designed to study the neurotoxic hazards of prolonged high-dose of pregabalin (akin to that abused by addicts) and to evaluate the effect of alpha tocopherol as a possible ameliorating agent. the current study evaluated the brain neurotransmitters; dopamine, glutamate, and norepinephrine. the study also assessed the expression of the apoptosis-related markers bax, bcl2, and caspase 3. western-blotted analysis of the three major mitogen-activated protein kinases (mapks), the c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk), the p38 mapk, and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk), has also been performed. the study also evaluated oxidative stress via assessment of the cortical tissue levels of reduced glutathione and malondialdehyde and the activity of superoxide dismutase. histopathological examination and histomorphometric evaluation of the darkly degenerated cortical neurons have also been performed. pregabalin in high doses (150 mg/kg/day and 300 mg/kg/day) disrupted the erk/jnk/p38-mapk signaling, reversed the bax/bcl2 ratio, and induced oxidative stress. it also diminished the release of dopamine, glutamate, and norepinephrine and increased the count of degenerated neurons. alpha tocopherol treatment significantly attenuated the deleterious effects induced by pregabalin. the role of alpha tocopherol in ameliorating the oxidative stress injury, and apoptosis induced by pregabalin, along with its role in normalizing neurotransmitters, modulating the erk/jnk/p38-mapk signaling pathways and improving the histopathological cortical changes, offers alpha tocopherol as a promising adjunctive therapy in patients undergoing prolonged pregabalin therapy as those suffering from prolonged seizures and neuropathies.",1
"there is evidence that alteration in plasma fatty acid composition may play a role in certain neurological disorders. this case control study was conducted to evaluate the association between plasma fatty acid levels and mental retardation in korean children. plasma phospholipid fatty acids, plasma lipids, dietary fatty acids and selected nutrients were measured in 31 mentally retarded boys (mean age 9.93 +/-1.5 yrs) and matched controls. total plasma omega-3 fatty acids (sigmaw3), docosahexaenoic acid (dha) and high density lipoprotein (hdl) concentrations were significantly lower and the sigmaomega-6/sigmaomega-3 ratio was significantly higher in cases than in controls. the odds in favor of mental retardation increased by 69 % for each unit increase in the sigmaomega-6/ sigmaomega-3 ratio (adjusted odds ratio = 1.69, 95% ci = 1.25-2.29). significant variation in plasma sigmaomega-3 and the sigmaomega-6/ sigmaomega-3 ratio was explained by mental retardation and plasma hdl concentrations (45% and 37 % respectively). there was a significant inverse association between plasma dha and mental retardation. for each unit increase in plasma dha, odds of mental retardation decreased by 74 %. there was no significant difference in either total dietary fat or fatty acids intakes between cases and controls. the energy intake of cases was significantly higher than the controls. these results suggest that proportion of plasma sigmaomega-3 fatty acids, particularly, dha, and the sigmaomega-6/ sigmaomega-3 ratio are associated with mental retardation in children in this study.",1
"inguinal hernias, or organ bulging at the lower ab area, is the most frequent hernia afflicting one third of males. these lower-ab organ bulges occur most frequently in childhood and after 50 years. clinicians identify these inguinal hernias by a lump in the lower-ab area or when patients have intestinal blockage. surgery of the lower-ab organ bulge is the only treatment and is very common. surgery of the lower-ab organ bulge is usually performed with anasthesia. the surgery involves reinforcing the lower abdomen wall with mesh. while long-lasting discomfort and reappearing hernias or organ bulges may follow a hernia repair, the rate of reappearance has improved with mesh and small-incisions. the article reviews the spread and causes of inguinal hernia along with common surgical treatments.",0
"membrane lipid replacement is the use of functional oral supplements containing cell membrane glycerolphospholipids and antioxidants to safely replace damaged membrane lipids that accumulate during aging and in various chronic and acute diseases. most if not all clinical conditions and aging are characterized by membrane phospholipid oxidative damage, resulting in loss of membrane and cellular function. clinical trials have shown the benefits of membrane lipid replacement supplements in replenishing damaged membrane lipids and restoring mitochondrial function, resulting in reductions in fatigue in aged subjects and patients with a variety of clinical diagnoses. recent observations have indicated that membrane lipid replacement can be a useful natural supplement strategy in a variety of conditions: chronic fatigue, such as found in many diseases and disorders; fatiguing illnesses (fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome); chronic infections (lyme disease and mycoplasmal infections); cardiovascular diseases; obesity, metabolic syndrome and diabetes; neurodegenerative diseases (alzheimer's disease); neurobehavioral diseases (autism spectrum disorders); fertility diseases; chemical contamination (gulf war illnesses); and cancers (breast, colorectal and other cancers). membrane lipid replacement provides general membrane nutritional support during aging and illness to improve membrane function and overall health without risk of adverse effects.",1
"increased expression of β-amyloid (aβ1-42) and tau proteins are considered risk-factors for alzheimer's disease in healthy older adults. aβ1-42 is a protein deposited in organs, clumps referred to as plaques, during certain diseases. tau proteins are proteins that stabilizes microtubules or structures within cells. this paper investigated the effect of aging and cerebrospinal (brain and spine) fluid levels of aβ1-42 and tau on two health endpoints. these endpoints include evaluating frontal metabolites with a proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (mrs) and cognition (thinking ability) in cognitively normal older adults. levels of a neurotransmitter (a signaling molecule) known as gamma aminobutyric acid (gaba+) were predicted by age. levels of myo-inositol relative to creatine (mi/tcr), a ratio of two metabolites in the brain often used to determine disease state, were predicted by age. levels of gaba+ predicted cognitive performance better than mi/tcr. additionally, frontal levels of n-acetyl aspartate, another brain metabolite, relative to creatine (tnaa/tcr) were predicted by levels of t-tau, the protein. in cognitively normal older adults, levels of frontal gaba+ and mi/t cr are predicted by aging. levels of gaba+ decreased with age. levels of mi/tcr increased with age. these results suggest that age- and biomarker-related changes in brain metabolites are not only located in the posterior cortex. additionally, these studies demonstrate that mrs is a viable tool to study aging and aging biomarkers associated with alzheimer's disease.",0
"those with depression may fall back after temporary improvement and still experience minor symptoms. this work compares the rate of re-suffering depression and the frequency of depressive symptoms between patients treated with fluoxetine (an antidepressant medication) alone or with thought therapy. 132 patients with temporary improvement from depression after 8 weeks with 20 mg of fluoxetine had the dose increased to 40 mg. the patients randomly received either cognitive or thought therapy or medication management and were monitored for changes in symptoms or regression for 28 weeks. 47 patients did not complete the 28-week phase. rates of non-completion or regression did not differ between groups. change in depressive symptoms did not differ between groups. in this work, cognitive or thought therapy with 40 mg of fluoxetine did not give additional benefit compared to fluoxetine 40 mg alone during the 28 weeks of follow-up.",0
"clinical experience with tranquilizers has shown the need for prolonged therapy for chronic neurotic and psychotic disorders. since phenothiazine derivatives such as perphenazine are being employed in this manner and since there have been rare reports of jaundice and leukopenia associated with its administration, questions about a potential deleterious effect of this drug on the liver and blood have to be answered.",1
"the coronavirus disease has caused a global pandemic (covid-19 - a viral breathing-related disease), with huge health and economic losses. the us food and drug administration (fda) has granted emergency use authorization, where unapproved medicines may be used, for treatment with the pfizer/biontech and moderna covid-19 vaccines. many people have a history of bad allergic reactions to specific foods, medicine, or vaccines, so people all over the world have great concerns about these two vaccines. this article compares the use, reasons to take, reasons to not get, and side effects of the pfizer and moderna vaccines. the documents and information are collected from multiple databases and sources, including the fda and world health organization. researchers used key search terms to collect information: coronavirus, sars-cov-2 (the coronavirus's name), covid-19 pandemic, vaccines, pfizer vaccine, moderna vaccine, impact of drugs, benefits, allergic responses, reasons to take vaccines, reasons to not take the vaccine, and unexpected serious side effects. twelve documents including research articles, clinical studies, and websites are used to record the required information. based on available information, both vaccines are beneficial in providing immunity (resistance) against the coronavirus infection. the pfizer vaccine is recommended to people 16 years of age and older. it triggers an immune response for at least 119 days after the first vaccination and is 95% effective in preventing the coronavirus infection. however, the moderna vaccine is recommended to people 18 years of age and older. it triggers an immune response for at least 119 days after the first vaccination and is 94.5% effective in preventing the coronavirus infection. however, some allergic reactions have been reported for both vaccines. the covid-19 vaccines can cause mild side effects after the first and second shot, including pain, redness or swelling at the site of the vaccine shot, fever, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, itching, chills, and joint pain. rarely, it can cause anaphylactic shock which is a severe allergic reaction that begins very quickly and can be life-threatening. side effects are reported to be lower in the pfizer vaccine compared to moderna; however, the moderna vaccine is easier to transport and store. in conclusion, the fda has granted emergency use authorization for the pfizer and moderna covid-19 vaccines. these vaccines can protect people from coronavirus infection by forming antibodies (protective proteins made by the immune system to fight infections) and provide immunity against a coronavirus infection. both vaccines can cause different side effects, but these reactions are found to be less frequent in the pfizer vaccine compared to the moderna vaccine. however, the moderna vaccine is easier to transport and store compared to the pfizer vaccine.",0
"hypophosphatasia (hpp) is the heritable dento-osseous disease caused by loss-of-function mutation(s) of the gene alpl that encodes the tissue-nonspecific isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase (tnsalp). tnsalp is a cell-surface homodimeric phosphomonoester phosphohydrolase expressed in healthy people especially in the skeleton, liver, kidneys, and developing teeth. in hpp, diminished tnsalp activity leads to extracellular accumulation of its natural substrates including inorganic pyrophosphate (ppi), an inhibitor of mineralization, and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (plp), the principal circulating form of vitamin b6 (b6). autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance involving >450 usually missense defects scattered throughout alpl largely explains the remarkably broad-ranging severity of this inborn-error-of-metabolism. in 1985 when we identified elevated plasma plp as a biochemical hallmark of hpp, all 14 investigated affected children and adults had markedly increased plp levels. however, pyridoxal (pl), the dephosphorylated form of plp that enters cells to cofactor many enzymatic reactions, was not low but often inexplicably elevated. levels of pyridoxic acid (pa), the b6 degradation product quantified to assess b6 sufficiency, were unremarkable. canonical signs or symptoms of b6 deficiency or toxicity were absent. b6-dependent seizures in infants with life-threatening hpp were later explained by their profound deficiency of tnsalp activity blocking plp dephosphorylation to pl and diminishing gamma-aminobutyric acid synthesis in the brain. now, there is speculation that altered b6 metabolism causes further clinical complications in hpp. herein, we assessed the plasma pl and pa levels accompanying previously reported elevated plasma plp concentrations in 150 children and adolescents with hpp. their mean (sd) plasma pl level was nearly double the mean for our healthy pediatric controls: 66.7 (59.0) nm versus 37.1 (22.2) nm (p < 0.0001), respectively. their pa levels were broader than our pediatric control range, but their mean value was normal; 40.2 (25.1) nm versus 39.3 (9.9) nm (p = 0.7793), respectively. in contrast, adults with hpp often had plasma pl and pa levels suggestive of dietary b6 insufficiency. we discuss why the b6 levels of our pediatric patients with hpp would not cause b6 toxicity or deficiency, whereas in affected adults dietary b6 insufficiency can develop.",1
"chronic throat clearing or a feeling of 'something' at the back of the throat (or nose) is a common cause for referral to ear, nose, and throat dostors. treatment of the problem causing these symptoms may help. but in many cases the cause is not found. currently, there is no accepted treatment which is effective against these symptoms. researchers studied a plan of sipping ice cold sparkling, fizzy (carbonated) water to help stop the cycle of throat-clearing. a questionnaire was mailed to 72 patients that had been told to use this plan. improvement was seen in the severity of the symptoms in 63% of these patients the greatest improvement was seen in patients who had the worse symptoms and who had them most often. doctors advise that sipping ice cold carbonated water can help to break the cycle of throat-clearing.",0
"the detection of chemical compounds in exhaled human breath presents an opportunity to determine physiological state, diagnose disease or assess environmental exposure. recent advancements in metabolomics research have led to improved capabilities to explore human metabolic profiles in breath. despite some notable challenges in sampling and analysis, exhaled breath represents a desirable medium for metabolomics applications, foremost due to its non-invasive, convenient and practically limitless availability. several breath-based tests that target either endogenous or exogenous gas-phase compounds are currently established and are in practical and/or clinical use. this review outlines the concept of breath analysis in the context of these unique tests and their applications. the respective breath biomarkers targeted in each test are discussed in relation to their physiological production in the human body and the development and implementation of the associated tests. the paper concludes with a brief insight into prospective tests and an outlook of the future direction of breath research.",1
"as of january 3, 2021, a total of 20,346,372 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) and 349,246 associated deaths have been reported in the united states. long-term sequalae of covid-19 over the course of a lifetime currently are unknown; however, persistent symptoms and serious complications are being reported among covid-19 survivors, including persons who initially experience a mild acute illness.* on december 11, 2020, the food and drug administration (fda) issued an emergency use authorization (eua) for pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine to prevent covid-19, administered as 2 doses separated by 21 days. on december 12, 2020, the advisory committee on immunization practices (acip) issued an interim recommendation for use of pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine (1); initial doses were recommended for health care personnel and long-term care facility residents (2). as of december 23, 2020, a reported 1,893,360 first doses of pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine had been administered in the united states, and reports of 4,393 (0.2%) adverse events after receipt of pfizer biontech covid-19 vaccine had been submitted to the vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers). among these, 175 case reports were identified for further review as possible cases of severe allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis. anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction that does occur rarely after vaccination, with onset typically within minutes to hours (3). twenty-one cases were determined to be anaphylaxis (a rate of 11.1 per million doses administered), including 17 in persons with a documented history of allergies or allergic reactions, seven of whom had a history of anaphylaxis. the median interval from vaccine receipt to symptom onset was 13 minutes (range = 2-150 minutes). among 20 persons with follow-up information available, all had recovered or been discharged home. of the remaining case reports that were determined not to be anaphylaxis, 86 were judged to be nonanaphylaxis allergic reactions, and 61 were considered nonallergic adverse events. seven case reports were still under investigation. this report summarizes the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of case reports of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and nonanaphylaxis allergic reactions, after receipt of the first dose of pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine during december 14-23, 2020, in the united states. cdc has issued updated interim clinical considerations for use of mrna covid-19 vaccines currently authorized in the united states (4) and interim considerations for preparing for the potential management of anaphylaxis (5). in addition to screening for contraindications and precautions before administering covid-19 vaccines, vaccine locations should have the necessary supplies available to manage anaphylaxis, should implement postvaccination observation periods, and should immediately treat persons experiencing anaphylaxis signs and symptoms with intramuscular injection of epinephrine (4,5).",1
"patients with end-stage renal disease (esrd) on maintenance dialysis have a high risk of developing hyperkalemia, generally defined as serum potassium (k+) concentrations of >5.0 mmol/l, particularly those undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. currently, the key approaches to the management of hyperkalemia in patients with esrd are dialysis, dietary k+ restriction, and avoidance of medications that increase hyperkalemia risk. in this review, we highlight the issues and challenges associated with effective management of hyperkalemia in patients undergoing maintenance dialysis using an illustrative case presentation. in addition, we examine the potential nondialysis options for the management of these patients, including use of the newer k+ binder agents patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, which may reduce the need for the highly restrictive dialysis diet, with its own implication on nutritional status in patients with esrd, as well as reducing the risk of potentially life-threatening hyperkalemia.",1
"total hip replacement (thr) and total knee replacement (tkr) are painful surgical procedures, especially tkr. managing pain well after surgery leads to gaining back function better and earlier and prevents chronic pain. studies on the control of pain during the rehabilitation period after surgery are not common. the goal of this study is to present results of a protocol for anesthesia at the time of surgery, and a pain treatment protocol in use in the orthopaedic and the rehabilitation intensive units of our hospital. this study looked at outcomes from past procedures without intervening. it included 100 patients, 50 that had thr and 50 that had tkr. from the medical records, we looked at the numeric rating scale (nrs) for pain for all patients. we analyzed this pain measurement with respect to the spinal anaesthesia given for the surgery, local anaesthesia, and the regimen of pain medicine used in the orthopaedic unit after the surgery. we also analyzed the pain ratings with respect to pain medicine given while in the rehabilitation unit, additional pain medication given as needed because of more intense pain, and any side effects of the pain treatment. patients reached normal function (walking at least 50 meters and climbing/descending stairs) in 8 days on average without medication-related side effects. how much extra pain medicine was used to address more intense pain during rehabilitation was correlated with how pain was recorded on the nrs. pain was controlled very well with the protocols for anesthesia at the time of surgery and pain treatment.",0
"objective: a large number of people experience misophonia. in 2013, the amsterdam study group recommended diagnostic criteria for misophonia. however, misophonia is not yet included in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders. this report is the first report on drug use that directly affects misophonia and demonstrates a 14-year-old adolescent girl with misophonia successfully treated with fluoxetine. methods: the patient's misophonia symptoms had been continuing for approximately 2 years, and her quality of life was significantly reduced. psychotherapy conditions could not be applied, and fluoxetine 10 mg/d was started and increased to 20 mg/d after a week. at the second-month follow-up, because of partial improvement, fluoxetine dose was increased to 30 mg/d. results: at the fourth-month follow-up, there was a 40% decrease in amsterdam misophonia scale score with a 70% decrease in the children's global assessment scale scores. by the 16th week, the overall functionality level was good at the end. conclusions: fluoxetine may be used as an effective drug in the treatment of misophonia.",1
"each year, 4 to 5 million newborns receive state-mandated screening. although the advisory committee on heritable disorders in newborns and children has identified 34 core conditions that should be incorporated into screening programs, each state manages, funds, and maintains its own program. state programs encompass screening, as well as the diagnosis and coordination of care for newborns with positive findings. testing for core disorders is fairly standardized, but more extensive screening varies widely by state, and the rigorous evaluation of new screening panels is ongoing. the core panel includes testing for three main categories of disorders: metabolic disorders (e.g., amino acid and urea cycle, fatty acid oxidation, and organic acid disorders); hemoglobinopathies; and a group of assorted conditions, including congenital hearing loss. family physicians must be familiar with the expanded newborn screening tests to effectively communicate results to parents and formulate interventions. they must also recognize signs of metabolic disorders that may not be detected by screening tests or that may not be a part of standard newborn screening in their state. for infants with positive screening results leading to diagnosis, long-term follow-up involves ongoing parental education, regular medical examinations, management at a metabolic treatment center, and developmental and neuropsychological testing to detect associated disorders in time for early intervention.",1
"sarcoidosis is a disease that is characterized by granuloma formation or the tiny growth collections of inflammation (infection-fighting) cells. one of these cell types is the immune cell, macrophage. macrophages are one of the most important building blocks of this disease. macrophage in sarcoidosis produces interleukin-1 (ii-1), a protein that helps fight infections. interleukin-1 has many functions, including the stimulation of the hepatic (liver) production of c-reactive protein. c-reactive protein is a type of protein found in the blood that increases during times of internal inflammation (redness and swelling from infection-fighting). serum (blood) c-reactive protein was measured in 48 patients. seventeen of the patients had active sarcoidosis in the lung. ten patients had other lung diseases of unknown origin. eleven patients had active lung tuberculosis (a serious lung infection). ten patients were healthy volunteers. serum c-reactive protein was measured. the serum c-reactive protein was negative (no detection) in 13 patients suffering from active sarcoidosis and positive in four. patients with other lung diseases had negative results in 7 cases and positive (was detected) in 3 cases. the analyses of c-reactive protein in patients with lung tuberculosis were positive in 10 cases. all the healthy controls had negative c-reactive protein measurements. the difference between the groups was statistically significant when sarcoidosis and tuberculosis serum c-reactive protein measurements were compared. there was also a significant difference between the group of other lung diseases and tuberculosis. levels of serum c-reactive protein are valuable in the identification of sarcoidosis and other lung diseases of unknown origin from tuberculosis and other diseases.",0
"thyroiditis covers multiple disorders represented by inflammation of the thyroid gland. the most common disorder is hashimoto thyroiditis. patients have enlarged thyroids, reduced thyroid function, and increased proteins targeting thyroid products. levothyroxine (a thyroid hormone treatment) improves thyroid function and size. post-birth thyroiditis is temporary or lasting thyroid dysfunction occuring within a year of childbirth, miscarriage, or medical abortion. supplemental thyroid hormone release into the blood may cause excess thyroid function. temporary or permanent reduced thryoid function may follow excess thyroid function due to thyroid hormone depletion and destruction of hormone-producing cells. patients should be monitored for changes in thyroid function. beta blockers (common high blood pressure medication) can treat symptoms of the initial phase of excess thyroid function. levothyroxine should be considered for later phases in women with high thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. subacute or fairly rapid thyroiditis (thyroid inflammation) is a temporary, thyroid-hormone-excess state with frontal neck pain, reduced thyroid-stimulating hormone, and low iodine sensitivity. fairly rapid thyroiditis often follows an upper airway viral illness, thought to trigger inflammatory destruction of thyroid cells. in most cases, the thyroid gland suddenly returns to normal after several months. high-dose aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs help give thyroid pain relief.",0
"background: neuropathic facial pain occurs due to pathologic dysfunctions of a nerve responsible for mediating sensory fibers to the head. surgical interventions, in cases of failed medical therapy, include microvascular decompression, radiofrequency (rf) ablation, percutaneous balloon decompression, and stereotactic radiosurgery. in this review, we focused on rf ablation as a treatment for chronic facial pain. objectives: the objective of this review was to summarize available evidence behind rf ablation for facial pain, including pain outcome measures, secondary outcomes, and complications. study design: systematic review. setting: this systematic review examined studies that applied the use of rf ablation for management of facial pain. methods: this systematic review was reported following the guidelines outlined in the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (prisma). two reviewers independently scored the methodological quality of the selected studies. due to heterogeneity of studies, a best-evidence synthesis of the available prognostic factors was provided. results: we reviewed 44 studies and assessed their short- and long-term pain relief measurements, as well as secondary outcomes including patient satisfaction, quality of life improvements, decrease in oral medication use, and recurrence rates. maximal pain relief was achieved in treatment groups using combined continuous radiofrequency (crf) and pulsed radiofrequency (prf) therapies, followed by crf therapy alone and finally prf therapy alone. all treatment regimens improved secondary outcomes. common complications of treatment included facial numbness, masseter weakness, cheek hematomas, diminished corneal reflex, and dry eyes. limitations: a large variability in definitions of trigeminal neuralgia, rf technique, and patient selection bias was observed in our selected cohort of studies. in addition, there was a paucity of strong longitudinal randomized controlled trials and prospective studies. conclusions: this systematic review found evidence that rf ablation is efficient in treating patients with facial pain, as well as in improving quality of life and reducing oral medication use. maximal pain control is achieved using combined crf and prf therapy. complications are uncommon and include facial numbness, masseter weakness, cheek hematomas, diminished corneal reflex, and dry eyes.",1
"most swallowing problems can be treated, but the treatment depends on the type of swallowing difficulty. a multi-type team of surgeons, speech-related organ specialists, and speech-language therapists is needed to create appropriate treatment. a clear medical history, swallowing muscle examination, and monitoring with small devices of swallowing of food with various textures help decide if swallowing exercises alone or additional drug or surgical treatment is needed to prevent breathing, eating, and hydration issues.",0
"for the study's background, we studied disease-causing types of the brain-located gene called scn1a, which is the most frequent cause of epileptic seizures or epilepsy. physical attributes make up a wide spectrum including the severe childhood epilepsy, dravet syndrome, epilepsy characterized by drug-resistant seizures, lower intelligence, and high death risk, and the milder genetic epilepsy with fever-like seizures plus (gefs+), characterized by normal intelligence. early identification of a child's risk for developing dravet syndrome versus gefs+ is key for giving disease-modifying treatments when available before intelligence impairment come up. our objective was to develop and verify a disease prediction model using medical and genetic biomarkers for early identification of scn1a-related epilepsies. for the study's methods, it was a multicenter group study comprising data from previous scn1a-positive dravet syndrome and gefs+ patients consistently treated with genetic testing (march 2001-june 2020). data includes age of seizure start and a newly-developed scn1a genetic score. a training group was used to develop multiple disease prediction models that were verified using two independent groups. the main measure was the accuracy of the model predicting dravet syndrome versus other gefs+ phenotypes. 1018 participants were included. the frequency of dravet syndrome was 616/743 (83%) in the training group, 147/203 (72%) in test group 1 and 60/72 (83%) in test group 2. a high scn1a genetic score - 133.4 versus 52.0 - and young age of start - 6.0 months versus 14.8 months - were each linked with dravet syndrome versus gefs+. a combined 'scn1a genetic score and seizure onset' model separated dravet syndrome from gefs+ more effectively and outperformed all other models. model performance was replicated in both test group 1 and 2. in short, the prediction model allows measurable estimation at disease start whether a child will develop dravet syndrome versus gefs+, helping clinicians with treatment counseling and decisions on early use of specific treatments. this study provides strong evidence that a combined 'scn1a genetic score and seizure onset' model identifies dravet syndrome from other gefs+ phenotypes.",0
"tardive dyskinesia (td) is a disorder of involuntary movements, typlically of the lower face muscles, limbs, and other muscle groups. the condition is linked to exposure with blocking agents, like antipsychotics used to treat mental illnesses, of the chemical messenger dopamine. since the allowed and off-label uses for these agents has increased over the last 20 years, more patients are receiving antipsychotics than before. while patients treated with one class of antipsychotics may have less risk for developing td than those treated with another class, the decreased risk is not as big as expected. also, patients with long-lasting mental illnesses often need long-term use of antipsychotics, pytting them at risk for td. this article describes the widespreadness of td, its risk factors, its prevention, its identification strategies like medical criteria and ratings, and evidence for its treatments, including deutetrabenazine and valbenzaine used for treating movement disorders.",0
"background: arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (amc) is characterised by congenital joint contractures in two or more body areas. amc exhibits wide phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity. our goals were to improve the genetic diagnosis rates of amc, to evaluate the added value of whole exome sequencing (wes) compared with targeted exome sequencing (tes) and to identify new genes in 315 unrelated undiagnosed amc families. methods: several genomic approaches were used including genetic mapping of disease loci in multiplex or consanguineous families, tes then wes. sanger sequencing was performed to identify or validate variants. results: we achieved disease gene identification in 52.7% of amc index patients including nine recently identified genes (cntnap1, magel2, adgrg6, adcy6, gldn, lgi4, lmod3, unc50 and scn1a). moreover, we identified pathogenic variants in asxl3 and stac3 expanding the phenotypes associated with these genes. the most frequent cause of amc was a primary involvement of skeletal muscle (40%) followed by brain (22%). the most frequent mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive (66.3% of patients). in sporadic patients born to non-consanguineous parents (n=60), de novo dominant autosomal or x linked variants were observed in 30 of them (50%). conclusion: new genes recently identified in amc represent 21% of causing genes in our cohort. a high proportion of de novo variants were observed indicating that this mechanism plays a prominent part in this developmental disease. our data showed the added value of wes when compared with tes due to the larger clinical spectrum of some disease genes than initially described and the identification of novel genes.",1
"diabetes mellitus is a common disease whose side effects are severe. for decades, the diagnosis of diabetes and prediabetes was using only fasting (without food) glucose or glucose two hours during an by-mouth (oral) glucose sensitivity test. recently, it is possible to use hba1c (a simple blood sugar test). each of these tests has pros and cons that must be well known by clinicians for better care for patients. so they could use one, two or three of this tests to reach a proper diagnosis. this article's aim is about the strong and weak points of these tests.",0
"sickle cell anemia (sca) is a disease characterized by abnormal red blood cell rheology. because of their effects on hbs polymerization and red blood cell deformability, alpha-thalassemia and the residual hbf level are known genetic modifiers of the disease. the aim of our study was to determine if the number of hbf quantitative trait loci (qtl) would also favor a specific sub-phenotype of sca as it is the case for alpha-thalassemia. our results confirmed that alpha-thalassemia protected from cerebral vasculopathy but increased the risk for frequent painful vaso-occlusive crises. we also showed that more hbf-qtl may provide an additional and specific protection against cerebral vasculopathy but only for children with alpha-thalassemia (-α/αα or -α/-α genotypes).",1
"hypovolemic shock exists as a spectrum, with its early stages characterized by subtle pathophysiologic tissue insults and its late stages defined by multi-system organ dysfunction. the importance of timely detection of shock is well known, as early interventions improve mortality, while delays render these same interventions ineffective. however, detection is limited by the monitors, parameters, and vital signs that are traditionally used in the intensive care unit (icu). many parameters change minimally during the early stages, and when they finally become abnormal, hypovolemic shock has already occurred. the compensatory reserve (cr) is a parameter that represents a new paradigm for assessing physiologic status, as it comprises the sum total of compensatory mechanisms that maintain adequate perfusion to vital organs during hypovolemia. when these mechanisms are overwhelmed, hemodynamic instability and circulatory collapse will follow. previous studies involving cr measurements demonstrated their utility in detecting central blood volume loss before hemodynamic parameters and vital signs changed. measurements of the cr have also been used in clinical studies involving patients with traumatic injuries or bleeding, and the results from these studies have been promising. moreover, these measurements can be made at the bedside, and they provide a real-time assessment of hemodynamic stability. given the need for rapid diagnostics when treating critically ill patients, cr measurements would complement parameters that are currently being used. consequently, the purpose of this article is to introduce a conceptual framework where the cr represents a new approach to monitoring critically ill patients. within this framework, we present evidence to support the notion that the use of the cr could potentially improve the outcomes of icu patients by alerting intensivists to impending hypovolemic shock before its onset.",1
"background and objectives: pathogenic variants in the neuronal sodium-channel î±1-subunit gene (scn1a) are the most frequent monogenic cause of epilepsy. phenotypes comprise a wide clinical spectrum including the severe childhood epilepsy, dravet syndrome, characterized by drug-resistant seizures, intellectual disability and high mortality, and the milder genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (gefs+), characterized by normal cognition. early recognition of a child's risk for developing dravet syndrome versus gefs+ is key for implementing disease-modifying therapies when available before cognitive impairment emerges. our objective was to develop and validate a prediction model using clinical and genetic biomarkers for early diagnosis of scn1a-related epilepsies. methods: retrospective multicenter cohort study comprising data from scn1a-positive dravet syndrome and gefs+ patients consecutively referred for genetic testing (march 2001-june 2020) including age of seizure onset and a newly-developed scn1a genetic score. a training cohort was used to develop multiple prediction models that were validated using two independent blinded cohorts. primary outcome was the discriminative accuracy of the model predicting dravet syndrome versus other gefs+ phenotypes. results: 1018 participants were included. the frequency of dravet syndrome was 616/743 (83%) in the training cohort, 147/203 (72%) in validation cohort 1 and 60/72 (83%) in validation cohort 2. a high scn1a genetic score 133.4 (sd, 78.5) versus 52.0 (sd, 57.5; p < 0.001) and young age of onset 6.0 (sd, 3.0) months versus 14.8 (sd, 11.8; p < 0.001) months, were each associated with dravet syndrome versus gefs+. a combined 'scn1a genetic score and seizure onset' model separated dravet syndrome from gefs+ more effectively (area under the curve [auc], 0.89 [95% ci, 0.86-0.92]) and outperformed all other models (auc, 0.79-0.85; p < 0.001). model performance was replicated in both validation cohorts 1 (auc, 0.94 [95% ci, 0.91-0.97]) and 2 (auc, 0.92 [95% ci, 0.82-1.00]). discussion: the prediction model allows objective estimation at disease onset whether a child will develop dravet syndrome versus gefs+, assisting clinicians with prognostic counseling and decisions on early institution of precision therapies (http://scn1a-prediction-model.broadinstitute.org/). classification of evidence: this study provides class ii evidence that a combined 'scn1a genetic score and seizure onset' model distinguishes dravet syndrome from other gefs+ phenotypes.",1
"hashimoto's thyroiditis is caused by thyroid cells that are attacked by infection-preventing cells and is the most common cause of an underactive thyroid. more people around the world are taking nigella sativa, a powerful herbal medicine, as a nontraditional way to treat many long-term diseases including high cholesterol, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes. the current study aimed to rate the effects of nigella sativa on how well the thyroid is working, blood vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) - 1 (a protein that promotes new blood vessels), nesfatin-1 (a chain of amino acids that affects hunger) and physical body measurements in people with hashimoto's thyroiditis. we randomly split forty people with hashimoto's thyroiditis and between 22 and 50 years old into two group and gave one group powdered nigella sativa and the other group sham treatment for 8 weeks. we measured changes in physical body measurements, what people ate, thyroid function, blood vegf and nefastin-1 levels after 8 weeks. taking nigella sativa caused lower body weight and body mass index (bmi). people taking nigella sativa had lower blood levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone and antibodies that target the thyroid and higher levels of blood thyroid hormone (t4) after 8 weeks. people taking nigella sativa had lower blood levels of vegf. none of these changes were seen in the group who took the sham treatmentl. based on a statistical model, changes in the ratio of the waist to the hip and thyroid hormones predicted changes in blood vegf and nesgfatin-1 levels in the group who took nigella sativa. we concluded that powdered nigella sativa improved thyroid function and physical body measurements in people with hashimoto's thyroiditis. nigella sativa lowered blood vegf levels. nigella sativa can be a useful non-traditional treatment for people with hashimoto's thyroiditis to make the disease less severe.",0
"a 46 year old male with past medical history of schizoaffective (reality-distorting) disorder, a mental disorder, and chronic lower back pain, is admitted to a medical facility to manage worsening depression and anxiety. he is started on a medicine called gabapentin (nerve pain medication) for his back pain and anxiety symptoms. his only other medication is an opioid pain reliever called hydrocodone. over the next few days, he starts developing worsening edema, swelling caused by too much fluid trapped in the body's tissues, in both legs. he does not have any cardiovascular (heart) related symptoms. a physical exam found pitting edema, where pressing into the swollen area leaves a pit or indentation. all other lab tests and imaging scans did not show anything significant. gabapentin is stopped and the swelling in his legs improved over the following days. in other studies, the occurrence of swollen feet (pedal edema) while on gabapentin is about 7 to 7.5% in elderly patients receiving doses above 1200 mg/day. this case illustrates that lower doses of gabapentin can also cause this negative effect. it is important to recognize this negative effect because gabapentin is used in conditions like nerve damage common with diabetes (diabetic neuropathy), which is associated with multiple illnesses that can give rise to swelling in both legs.",0
objective: the objective of this study was to compare the use of hemoglobin a1c to oral glucose tolerance testing to diagnose overt type 2 diabetes in the first trimester of pregnancy. the study used a nonexperimental descriptive design to compare the use of the hemoglobin a1c test results to oral glucose tolerance test results. methods: the study used a sample of 45 women at high risk for type 2 diabetes in the first trimester of pregnancy. participants were consented to draw a hemoglobin a1c with their ordered oral glucose tolerance testing for comparison of the two tests' ability to diagnose overt type 2 diabetes. results: hemoglobin a1c tests were highly positively correlated with oral glucose tolerance testing for diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in women in the first trimester of pregnancy. conclusion: the research provides beginning evidence that the hemoglobin a1c should be considered as a first-tier diagnostic test for overt type 2 diabetes in the first trimester of pregnancy.,1
"healtchare guidelines recommend using fracture risk scores for screening and drug treatment decisions. the timing of occurence of treatment-level (according to 2014 guidelines by an expert goup) or screening-level (according to 2011 guidelines by national experts) fracture risk scores has not been estimated in postmenopausal women who finished their last menstrual cycle. we conducted a risk analysis of new occurence of treatment- and screening-level fracture risk scores in postmenopausal women aged 50 years and older, before receiving drug treatment and hip or spine fracture. in 54, 280 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 64 years without a bone hardness test, the time for 10% to get a treatment-level fracture risk score could not be estimated correctly due to rare amount of treatment-level scores. in 6096 women who had fracture risk scores calculated with bone hardness, the estimated unadjusted time to treatment-level fracture risk ranged from 7.6 years for those aged 65 to 69, to 5.1 years, for those aged 75 to 79 at the start. of 17,967 women aged 50 to 64 with a screening-level fracture risk score at the start, 100 (0.6%) had a hip or back fracture by age 65 years. postmenopausal women with sub-threshold fracture risk scores at the start were unlikely to get a treatment-level fracture risk score between 50 and 64 years. after age 65, the increased amount of treatment-level fracture risk scores, bone weakening, and major fractures from bone weakening support more frequent consideration of fracture risk and bone hardness testing.",0
"introduction: the vital renal replacement therapy makes it impossible for dialysis patients to distance themselves socially. this results in a high risk of sars-cov-2 infection and developing covid-19 with excess mortality due to disease burden and immunosuppression. we determined the efficacy of a 100 µg booster of mrna-1273 (moderna, inc., cambridge, massachusetts, usa) 6 months after two doses of bnt162b2 (biontech/pfizer, mainz, germany/new york, ny, usa) in 194 sars-cov-2 naïve dialysis patients. methods: anti-sars-cov-2-spike antibodies were measured with the elecsys® anti-sars-cov-2 s assay (roche diagnostics gmbh, germany) 4 and 10-12 weeks after two doses of bnt162b2 as well as 4 weeks after the mrna-1273 booster. the presence of neutralizing antibodies was measured by the sars-cov-2 surrogate virus neutralization test (genscript biotech, usa). two different cut-offs for positivity were used, one according to the manufacturer's specifications and one correlating with positivity in a plaque reduction neutralization test (prnt). roc analyses were performed to match the anti-sars-cov-2-spike antibody cut-offs with the cut-offs in the surrogate neutralization assay accordingly. results: any level of immunoreactivity determined by anti-sars-cov-2-spike antibody assay was found in 87.3% (n = 144/165) and 90.6% (n = 164/181) 4 and 10-12 weeks after two doses of bnt162b2. this was reduced to 68.5% or 60.6% 4 weeks and 51.7% or 35.4% 10-12 weeks, respectively, when using the roc revealed cut-offs for neutralizing antibodies in the surrogate neutralization test (manufacturer given cut-off ≥ 103 u/ml and cut-off correlating with prnt ≥ 196 u/ml). four weeks after the mrna-1273 booster, the concentration of anti-sars-cov-2-spike antibodies increased to 23 119.9 u/ml and consecutively to 97.3% for both cut-offs of neutralizing antibodies. conclusion: two doses of bnt162b2 followed by one dose of mrna-1273 within 6 months in patients receiving maintenance dialysis resulted in significant titers of sars-cov-2-s-ab. while two doses of mrna vaccine only achieved adequate humoral immunity in a minority, the third vaccination boosts the development of virus-neutralizing quantities of sars-cov-2 spike antibodies (against wild type sars-cov-2) in almost all patients.",1
"background: effect of nifedipine on pressure ulcer (pu) healing has not been evaluated in the human subjects yet. study question: in this study, the effect of topical application of nifedipine 3% ointment on pu healing in critically ill patients was investigated. study design: this was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical. measures and outcomes: in this study, 200 patients with stage i or ii pu according to 2-digit stirling pressure ulcer severity scale were randomized to receive topical nifedipine 3% ointment or placebo twice daily for 14 days. changes in the size and stage of the ulcers were considered as primary outcome of the study. the stage of the ulcers at baseline and on day 7 and day 14 of study was determined by using 2-digit stirling scale. in addition, the surface area of the wounds was estimated by multiplying width by length. results: in total, 83 patients in each group completed the study. the groups were matched for the baseline stage and size of pus. mean decrease in the stage of pu in the nifedipine group was significantly higher than the placebo group on day 7 (-1.71 vs. -0.16, respectively, p < 0.001) and day 14 (-0.78 vs. -0.09, respectively, p < 0.001). furthermore, the mean decrease in the surface area of pu was significantly higher in the nifedipine group compared with the placebo group on day 7 (-1.44 vs. -0.32, respectively, p < 0.001) and day 14 (-2.51 vs. -0.24, respectively, p < 0.001) of study. conclusions: topical application of nifedipine 3% ointment for 14 days significantly improved the healing process of stage i or ii pus in critically ill patients.",1
"this study conducted an analysis using patients from the china stroke primary prevention trial. the goal of this study was to explore the impact of folic acid (a specific vitamin) on arterial stiffness (hardness of arteries or specific blood vessels). additionally, this study aimed to measure the modifying or influencing effect of a specific gene (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase-mthfr) in chinese patients with hypertension (high blood pressure). this study enrolled 2,529 hypertensive (high blood pressure) chinese patients. participants were randomized to receive treatment with either a combination of enalapril (common blood pressure medication) and folic acid or enalapril. brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (pwv) is a measurement of arterial stiffness. it is measured by looking at the brachial and tibial arteries, located within the upper arm. pwv was taken by trained medical staff using appropriate equipment during both baseline (before treatment) and exit (end of treatment) visits, approximately 5 years after enrollment. this trial was registered with clinicaltrials.gov (nct00794885). during the follow-up, change in folate (vitamin in the body) was significantly and independently linked with change in pwv in patients. patients with cc genotype (a person's collection of specific genes) had a significantly greater pwv response to folic acid than those with genotype ct or tt. the positive effect of folic acid on improved pwv was modified by what genotype the patient had. the study concluded that within the analyzed subgroup of chinese hypertensive patients who had received a 5-year antihypertensive therapy, increase in folate status were correlated or linked with decreased pwv. additionally, individuals with cc genotype showed greatest pwv response to folic acid treatment.",0
"mitochondria (the powerhouse of a cell) play several important roles in the body. these roles include providing energy and participating in pathways of inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection). the event of mitochondria increasing inflammation is associated with the release of products from mitochondrial damage. one of these products is mitochondrial dna which can increase inflammation within the body. this review aimed to show the importance of the mitochondria in energy production and in the intervention in the development of several diseases, mainly covid-19 (a viral, respiratory disease). additionally the paper aimed to show how the mitochondria organelle uses several different ways to allow the replication and maintenance of a virus. this can lead to the worsening and spread of inflammation. the reviewed scientific evidence suggested that mitochondria are involved in the replication of covid-19. the virus forms double-walled vesicles, a small chamber outside or within a cell, that evades detection by the host's immune system. these vesicles can then damage mitochondria within cells, releasing mitochondrial dna into the body. this can trigger the innate immune system, the defense system you were born with, which increase inflammation within the body. this review concluded that while the role of the mitochondria in covid-19 is still being studied, the use of mitochondrial dna as an indicator of illness is a potential area yet to be researched.",0
"background: heterologous vaccinations against sars-cov-2 with chadox1 ncov-19 and a second dose of an mrna-based vaccine have been shown to be more immunogenic than homologous chadox1 ncov-19. in the current study, we examined the kinetics of the antibody response to the second dose of three different vaccination regimens (homologous chadox1 ncov-19 vs. chadox1 ncov-19 + bnt162b2 or mrna-1273) against sars-cov-2 in a longitudinal manner; whether there are differences in latency or amplitude of the early response and which markers are most suitable to detect these responses. methods: we performed assays for anti-s1 igg and iga, anti-ncp igg and a surrogate neutralization assay on serum samples collected from 57 participants on the day of the second vaccination as well as the following seven days. results: all examined vaccination regimens induced detectable antibody responses within the examined time frame. both heterologous regimens induced responses earlier and with a higher amplitude than homologous chadox1 ncov-19. between the heterologous regimens, amplitudes were somewhat higher for chadox1 ncov-19 + mrna-1273. there was no difference in latency between the igg and iga responses. increases in the surrogate neutralization assay were the first changes to be detectable for all regimens and the only significant change seen for homologous chadox1 ncov-19. discussion: both examined heterologous vaccination regimens are superior in immunogenicity, including the latency of the response, to homologous chadox1 ncov-19. while the iga response has a shorter latency than the igg response after the first dose, no such difference was found after the second dose, implying that both responses are driven by separate plasma cell populations. early and steep increases in surrogate neutralization levels suggest that this might be a more sensitive marker for antibody responses after vaccination against sars-cov-2 than absolute levels of anti-s1 igg.",1
"covid-19 may cause pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiovascular alterations, and multiple organ failure, which have been ascribed to a cytokine storm, a systemic inflammatory response, and an attack by the immune system. moreover, an oxidative stress imbalance has been demonstrated to occur in covid-19 patients. n- acetyl-l-cysteine (nac) is a precursor of reduced glutathione (gsh). due to its tolerability, this pleiotropic drug has been proposed not only as a mucolytic agent, but also as a preventive/therapeutic agent in a variety of disorders involving gsh depletion and oxidative stress. at very high doses, nac is also used as an antidote against paracetamol intoxication. thiols block the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 thereby hampering penetration of sars-cov-2 into cells. based on a broad range of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, which are herein reviewed, the oral administration of nac is likely to attenuate the risk of developing covid-19, as it was previously demonstrated for influenza and influenza-like illnesses. moreover, high-dose intravenous nac may be expected to play an adjuvant role in the treatment of severe covid-19 cases and in the control of its lethal complications, also including pulmonary and cardiovascular adverse events.",1
"the total-body content of potassium (k+) and distribution of k+ across the cell membranes (the thick layer that surrounds cells) is very important for normal functioning of the body's cells. total-body k+ content (a method for measuring body composition and mass of cells) is determined by changes in the release of k+ by the kidneys in response to how much k+ is taken in. insulin (a hormone that allows the cells in the muscles, fat, and liver to absorb sugar from the blood) and β-adrenergic tone (a group of organs and nerves where hormones are able to signal to other cells) also help keep potassium (k+) distribution at normal levels. despite these different systems, disorders of changing k+ levels are common. understanding the pathophysiology (physical changes that come with a particular syndrome or disease) and regulating processes that determine how the body distributes and balances k+ is key to developing treatments to restore k+ homeostasis (processes used by the body to maintain a normal potassium concentration in the fluid). researchers review the normal regulating process of total-body potassium (k+) before highlighting common disorders in k+ homeostasis and their treatment. this review of k+ homeostasis is a resource for health care providers and a tool for educators teaching students to understand key factors involved in k+ balance.",0
"covid-19 is an ongoing public health pandemic. quality diagnostic tests are important for early detection and control. the world health organization (who) recommends some tests that detect covid-19 virus. but we do not know how accurate these tests are. this study estimates accuracy of three commercial rapid tests in a clinical setting in ethiopia from april to june 2021 we got 279 nasal swabs from community testing, contact cases and suspected cases. among the 279 respiratory samples, 50, 59, and 69 tested positive by the three tests. the tests agreed ranging from moderate to strong agreement. the tests accurately recognized people that did not have covid (91 to 99 out of 100), but had more mistakes identifying people who had covid, only 81 to 83 out of 100 sick people were found. all three tests were almost equal in identifying people with covid-19, but one test was worse than the other two in identifying people without the disease.",0
"an 18 year-old woman presented to an outside hospital with seizure activity after a massive ingestion of lamotrigine, bupropion, trazodone, buspirone, and possibly isoretinoin. her initial vital signs were remarkable for tachycardia (120 bpm). she was intubated for airway protection. for treatment of status epilepticus, she received a total of 12 mg of iv lorazepam along with a lorazepam infusion titrated to 15 mg/hr, a propofol infusion of unknown dosing, and phenobarbital 650 mg. she was transferred to a receiving hospital. her initial ecg at the receiving hospital showed a qrs of 117 ms which narrowed with 50 meq of sodium bicarbonate after approximately 6 hours. she required norepinephrine intermittently for blood pressure support for approximately 2 days. the patient had no dysrhythmias. eeg showed no epileptiform activity from approximately 11 hours-32 hours post ingestion. at the receiving hospital, her serum lamotrigine concentration was 109 mcg/ml (reference 3.0-14.0 mcg/ml) 7 hours after ingestion. her bupropion concentration was 92 ng/ml (reference 50-100 ng/ml). she was extubated on hospital day 5 and discharged to a psychiatric facility on hospital day 13.",1
"background: genome-wide and clinical studies have linked the 677c→t polymorphism in the gene encoding methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) with hypertension, whilst limited evidence shows that intervention with riboflavin (i.e. the mthfr co-factor) can lower blood pressure (bp) in hypertensive patients with the variant mthfr 677tt genotype. we investigated the impact of this common polymorphism on bp throughout adulthood and hypothesised that riboflavin status would modulate the genetic risk of hypertension. methods: observational data on 6076 adults of 18-102 years were drawn from the joint irish nutrigenomics organisation project, comprising the trinity-ulster department of agriculture (tuda; volunteer sample) and the national adult nutrition survey (nans; population-based sample) cohorts. participants were recruited from the republic of ireland and northern ireland (uk) in 2008-2012 using standardised methods. results: the variant mthfr 677tt genotype was identified in 12% of adults. from 18 to 70 years, this genotype was associated with an increased risk of hypertension (i.e. systolic bp ≥ 140 and/or a diastolic bp ≥ 90 mmhg): odds ratio (or) 1.42, 95% confidence interval (ci) 1.07 to 1.90; p = 0.016, after adjustment for antihypertensive drug use and other significant factors, namely, age, male sex, bmi, alcohol and total cholesterol. low or deficient biomarker status of riboflavin (observed in 30.2% and 30.0% of participants, respectively) exacerbated the genetic risk of hypertension, with a 3-fold increased risk for the tt genotype in combination with deficient riboflavin status (or 3.00, 95% ci, 1.34-6.68; p = 0.007) relative to the cc genotype combined with normal riboflavin status. up to 65 years, we observed poorer bp control rates on antihypertensive treatment in participants with the tt genotype (30%) compared to those without this variant, ct (37%) and cc (45%) genotypes (p < 0.027). conclusions: the mthfr 677tt genotype is associated with higher bp independently of homocysteine and predisposes adults to an increased risk of hypertension and poorer bp control with antihypertensive treatment, whilst better riboflavin status is associated with a reduced genetic risk. riboflavin intervention may thus offer a personalised approach to prevent the onset of hypertension in adults with the tt genotype; however, this requires confirmation in a randomised trial in non-hypertensive adults.",1
"loss of function in mitochondria, the key organelle responsible for cellular energy production, can result in the excess fatigue and other symptoms commonly found in chronic diseases. a reduction in mitochondrial function occurs as a result of several changes. these include: maintenance loss of the transmembrane (trans-cell-boundary electrical) potential of the inner mitochondrial membrane, abnormal function of the electron transport chain, or reduced transport of critical metabolites (energy-regulating molecules) into mitochondria. these changes result in a reduced efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation (energy creation) and reduced production of adenosine-5'-triphosphate (atp - the main currency of energy in a cell). several components of this system require routine replacement. this system can be assisted with natural supplements. clinical trials have shown the utility of using oral (by mouth) replacement supplements. combinations of these supplements can reduce the fatigue and other symptoms associated with chronic disease. these supplements can naturally restore mitochondrial function, even in long-term patients with uncontrollable fatigue.",0
"hyperkalemia is a condition where the potassium level in the blood is higher than normal. potassium is an important mineral in the body. hyperkalemia is caused by problems with potasium metabolism and it can be life-threatening. it can be caused by a problem with the kidneys getting rid of the potassium through the urine. it can also be caused by a problem moving potassium into the cells from the bloodstream or both. hyperkalemia that comes on rapidly is usually caused by an illness, dehydration, or by starting medicines that affect normal potassium balance in the body. hyperkalemia can also be caused by other syndromes or conditions in patients with kidney diseases that are caused by diabetes. signs that hyperkalemia may be life-threatening include ekg changes that are typically seen with high potassium levels or by a rapid rise in potassium levels on a blood test. urine tests for potassium, creatinine (a waste product from muscles), and osmolality (the kidney's ability to balance water in urine) should be done as a first step in finding the cause for the hyperkalemia. finding the cause for the hyperkalemia will have an effect on the ongoing treatment. giving calcium through an iv can improve the abnormal ekg changes and reduce the risk of abnormal heartbeats, but this treatment does not lower the blood potassium level. blood potassium levels can be lowered quickly by giving iv insulin and glucose, and by giving medicines called beta2 agonists through an inhaler or both. to then lower total body potassium levels, sodium polystyrene (a potassium-binding medicine) is started, sometimes with iv lasix and saline.",0
"background: vitamin b6 is thought to be a most versatile coenzyme that participates in more than 100 biochemical reactions. it is involved in amino acid and homocysteine metabolism, glucose and lipid metabolism, neurotransmitter production and dna/rna synthesis. vitamin b6 can also be a modulator of gene expression. nowadays, clinically evident vitamin b6 deficiency is not a common disorder, at least in the general population. nevertheless, a subclinical, undiagnosed deficiency may be present in some subjects, particularly in the elderly. objective: this review gives a complete overview over the metabolism and interactions of vitamin b6. further, we show which complications and deficiency symptoms can occur due to a lack of vitamin b6 and possibilities for public health and supplemental interventions. methods: the database medline (www.ncvi.nlm.nih.gov) was searched for terms like ""vitamin b6"", ""pyridoxal"", ""cancer"", ""homocysteine"", etc. for a complete understanding, we included studies with early findings from the forties as well as recent results from 2006. these studies were summarised and compared in different chapters. results and conclusion: in fact, it has been proposed that suboptimal vitamin b6 status is associated with certain diseases that particularly afflict the elderly population: impaired cognitive function, alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, and different types of cancer. some of these problems may be related to the elevated homocysteine concentrations associated to vitamin b6 deficiency, but there is also evidence for other mechanisms independent of homocysteine by which a suboptimal vitamin b6 status could increase the risk for these chronic diseases.",1
"purpose: the aim of the study was to determine which diagnostic modality [computerized tomography (ct), magnetic resonance imaging (mri), or ultrasound (us)] is more precise in terms of sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing inguinal hernia and sub-type of inguinal hernia (direct or indirect). results: bubble charts depicting the size of each patient cohort and percentual range for both sensitivity and specificity showed that us was better than ct and mri in diagnosing inguinal hernia. bubble charts for us and ct depicted high values within the studies that reported sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing type of hernia. conclusions: we found that us had the highest sensitivity and specificity. however, it must be taken into consideration that performance is highly dependent on the operator's level of expertise. based on this systematic review, ultrasound may be the preferred imaging modality when physical examination is inconclusive, given that local expertise in performing us examination for hernia disease is adequate.",1
"in previous studies, we used low level laser therapy (lllt), therapy with applying light on the body's surface, in patients with non-specific, long-lasting pain of the shoulder joint and lower back. this work measures the success of this specific light therapy for lasting joint pain of the elbow, wrist, and fingers. nine male and fifteen female patients with long-lasting joint pain of the elbow, wrist, or fingers were treated at our hospital's recovery clinic from april, 2007 to march, 2009. these patients were employed in the study. patients visited the clinic twice a week and were checked after four weeks of treatment. pain was measured with a specific pain scale. the average pain score noticeably improved after treatment. the treatment effect lasted for about one and a half days regarding wrist pain, tennis elbow, and carpal tunnel syndrome, which involves pinched nerves in the wrist. in other pain types, the treatment effect lasted for about three to fifteen hours. no change in the range of motion was seen in any of the 24 patients. lllt at the settings used in this study was useful for long-lasting pain of the elbow, wrist, and fingers.",0
"autosomal dominant mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3) cause achondroplasia (ach), the most common form of dwarfism in humans, and related chondrodysplasia syndromes that include hypochondroplasia (hch), severe achondroplasia with developmental delay and acanthosis nigricans (saddan), and thanatophoric dysplasia (td). fgfr3 is expressed in chondrocytes and mature osteoblasts where it functions to regulate bone growth. analysis of the mutations in fgfr3 revealed increased signaling through a combination of mechanisms that include stabilization of the receptor, enhanced dimerization, and enhanced tyrosine kinase activity. paradoxically, increased fgfr3 signaling profoundly suppresses proliferation and maturation of growth plate chondrocytes resulting in decreased growth plate size, reduced trabecular bone volume, and resulting decreased bone elongation. in this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms that regulate growth plate chondrocytes, the pathogenesis of ach, and therapeutic approaches that are being evaluated to improve endochondral bone growth in people with ach and related conditions.",1
"background: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) infection and the resulting coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) have afflicted tens of millions of people in a worldwide pandemic. safe and effective vaccines are needed urgently. methods: in an ongoing multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, pivotal efficacy trial, we randomly assigned persons 16 years of age or older in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses, 21 days apart, of either placebo or the bnt162b2 vaccine candidate (30 μg per dose). bnt162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified rna vaccine that encodes a prefusion stabilized, membrane-anchored sars-cov-2 full-length spike protein. the primary end points were efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed covid-19 and safety. results: a total of 43,548 participants underwent randomization, of whom 43,448 received injections: 21,720 with bnt162b2 and 21,728 with placebo. there were 8 cases of covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose among participants assigned to receive bnt162b2 and 162 cases among those assigned to placebo; bnt162b2 was 95% effective in preventing covid-19 (95% credible interval, 90.3 to 97.6). similar vaccine efficacy (generally 90 to 100%) was observed across subgroups defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body-mass index, and the presence of coexisting conditions. among 10 cases of severe covid-19 with onset after the first dose, 9 occurred in placebo recipients and 1 in a bnt162b2 recipient. the safety profile of bnt162b2 was characterized by short-term, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache. the incidence of serious adverse events was low and was similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. conclusions: a two-dose regimen of bnt162b2 conferred 95% protection against covid-19 in persons 16 years of age or older. safety over a median of 2 months was similar to that of other viral vaccines.

"all relevant german child-care medical groups created the agreed-upon guideline. ultrasound or sound-wave imaging is the standard imaging for pre- and post-birth kidney cysts (fluid-filled swellings) and should exclude non-kidney growths in the abdomen and genitals. magnetic resonance imaging or imaging with radio waves and magnetic fields has selected uses. suspicion of a kidney disease with cysts should prompt talking with a child-care kidney specialist. pre-birth management should be personalized to different degress of disease severity. after renal oligohydramnios (diseases where scarce fluid surrounds the fetus due to kidney damage), we recommend delivery in a preganancy-specialized center. newborns should not be denied kidney replacement therapy because of age. children with a single, enlarged, nonfunctional kidney with cysts do not need regular imaging or kidney removal, but long-term kidney-related follow-ups (as do children with single or multiple kidney abnormalities with cysts). arpkd (autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease), an inherited disorder of many kidney cysts, nephronophthisis (kidney inflammation), bardet-biedl syndrome (an inherited disorder that impairs kidneys, eyes, and more), and specific liver-related gene mutations cause disease outside the kidneys. genetic testing is advisable. children with an inherited disorder leading to tumors in the skin, brain, kidney and more, or a high risk of tumors (e.g. von hippel lindau syndrome) or kidney cysts should have regular ultrasounds. even children without symptoms and of parents with adpkd (a similar variant of arpkd) should be monitored for high blood pressure and protein in the urine. examining for adpkd in minors via ultrasound or genes should only be done after in-depth counseling. simple fluid-filled sacs are very rare in children. adpdk in parents should be excluded. compex fluid-filled sacs in the kidney need further investigation.",0
"objective: to describe the historical refinements, understanding of physiology and clinical outcomes observed with thyroid hormone replacement strategies. methods: a medline search was initiated using the search terms, levothyroxine, thyroid hormone history, levothyroxine mono therapy, thyroid hormone replacement, combination lt4 therapy, levothyroxine bioequivalence. pertinent articles of interest were identified by title and where available abstract for further review. additional references were identified in the course of review of the literature identified. results: physicians have intervened in cases of thyroid dysfunction for more than two millennia. ingestion of animal thyroid derived preparations has been long described but only scientifically documented for the last 130 years. refinements in hormone preparation, pharmaceutical production and regulation continue to this day. the literature provides documentation of physiologic, pathologic and clinical outcomes which have been reported and continuously updated. recommendations for effective and safe use of these hormones for reversal of patho-physiology associated with hypothyroidism and the relief of symptoms of hypothyroidism has documented a progressive refinement in our understanding of thyroid hormone use. studies of thyroid hormone metabolism, action and pharmacokinetics have allowed evermore focused recommendations for use in clinical practice. levothyroxine mono-therapy has emerged as the therapy of choice of all recent major guidelines. conclusions: the evolution of thyroid hormone therapies has been significant over an extended period of time. thyroid hormone replacement is very useful in the treatment of those with hypothyroidism. all of the most recent guidelines of major endocrine societies recommend levothyroxine mono-therapy for first line use in hypothyroidism.",1
"aims: gabapentin (gbp) is widely used to treat neuropathic pain, including diabetic neuropathic pain. our objective was to evaluate the role of diabetes and glycaemic control on gbp population pharmacokinetics. methods: a clinical trial was conducted in patients with neuropathic pain (n = 29) due to type 2 diabetes (n = 19) or lumbar/cervical disc herniation (n = 10). all participants were treated with a single oral dose gbp. blood was sampled up to 24 hours after gbp administration. data were analysed with a population approach using the stochastic approximation expectation maximization algorithm. weight, body mass index, sex, biomarkers of renal function and diabetes, and genotypes for the main genetic polymorphisms of slc22a2 (rs316019) and slc22a4 (rs1050152), the genes encoding the transporters for organic cations oct2 and octn1, were tested as potential covariates. results: gbp drug disposition was described by a 1-compartment model with lag-time, first-order absorption and linear elimination. the total clearance was dependent on estimated glomerular filtration rate. population estimates (between-subject variability in percentage) for lag time, first-order absorption rate, apparent volume of distribution and total clearance were 0.316 h (10.6%), 1.12 h-1 (10.7%), 140 l (7.7%) and 14.7 l/h (6.97%), respectively. no significant association was observed with hyperglycaemia, glycated haemoglobin, diabetes diagnosis, age, sex, weight, body mass index, slc22a2 or slc22 a4 genotypes. conclusion: this population pharmacokinetics model accurately estimated gbp concentrations in patients with neuropathic pain, using estimated glomerular filtrationrate as a covariate for total clearance. the distribution and excretion processes of gbp were not affected by hyperglycaemia or diabetes.",1
"more than 2 million people in the united states have myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (me/cfs). this diseases is characterized by immense fatigue, pain, and abnormal sleep. this study performed metabolomics, or evaluated biological metabolites or energy-regulating molecules, to gain insights into the biology of cfs. this study evaluated a total of 84 subjects. forty-five subjects (22 men and 23 women) met diagnostic criteria for me/cfs. thirty-nine subjects (18 men and 21 women) were age- and sex-matched normal controls. males with cfs were on average 53 (±2.8) years old. females were on average 52 (±2.5) years old. the karnofsky performance scores (a scoring system to determine ability to perform tasks) were 62 for males and 54 for females. the study targeted 612 metabolites in plasma (blood) from 63 biochemical pathways. patients with cfs showed abnormalities in 20 metabolic pathways. eighty percent of the diagnostic metabolites were decreased, consistent with a hypometabolic, or abnormally low metabolic rate, syndrome. pathway abnormalities included several types of dysregulated metabolisms. high accuracy for diagnosis was found in both males and females using metabolite levels. the data show that, despite several different factors leading to cfs, the cellular metabolic response in patients was the same, statistically robust, and chemically similar to the environmental stress known as dauer.",0
"achondroplasia (mim 100800) is the most common non-lethal skeletal dysplasia. its incidence is between one in 10,000 and one in 30,000. the phenotype is characterized by rhizomelic disproportionate short stature, enlarged head, midface hypoplasia, short hands and lordotic lumbar spine, associated with normal cognitive development. this autosomal-dominant disorder is caused by a gain-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the type 3 receptor for fibroblast growth factor (fgfr3); in more than 95% of cases, the mutation is g380r. the diagnosis is suspected on physical examination and confirmed by different age-related radiological features. anticipatory and management care by a multidisciplinary team will prevent and treat complications, including cervical cord compression, conductive hearing loss and thoracolumbar gibbosity. weight counselling, psychosocial guidance and professional integration programmes play an important role in the global quality of life of these patients and their families.",1
"polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufas) are involved both in immune system regulation and inflammation. in particular, within the pufas category, omega-3 (ω-3) may reduce inflammation, whereas omega-6 (ω-6) pufas are generally considered to have a proinflammatory effect. recent evidence highlights an imbalance in the ω-3:ω-6 ratio with an increased intake of ω-6, as a consequence of the shift towards a westernized diet. in critical age groups such as infants, toddlers and young children, as well as pregnant and lactating women or fish allergic patients, ω-3 intake may be inadequate. this review aims to discuss the potential beneficial effects of pufas on pediatric food allergy prevention and treatment, both at prenatal and postnatal ages. data from preclinical studies with pufas supplementation show encouraging effects in suppressing allergic response. clinical studies results are still conflicting about the best timing and dosages of supplementation and which individuals are most likely to benefit; therefore, it is still not possible to draw firm conclusions. with regard to food-allergic children, it is still debated whether pufas could slow disease progression or not, since consistent data are lacking. in conclusion, more data on the effects of ω-3 pufas supplementation alone or in combination with other nutrients are warranted, both in the general and food allergic population.",1
"evidence is emerging that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) can infect various organs of the body, including cardiomyocytes and cardiac endothelial cells in the heart. this review focuses on the effects of sars-cov-2 in the heart after direct infection that can lead to myocarditis and an outline of potential treatment options. the main points are: (1) viral entry: sars-cov-2 uses specific receptors and proteases for docking and priming in cardiac cells. thus, different receptors or protease inhibitors might be effective in sars-cov-2-infected cardiac cells. (2) viral replication: sars-cov-2 uses rna-dependent rna polymerase for replication. drugs acting against ssrna(+) viral replication for cardiac cells can be effective. (3) autophagy and double-membrane vesicles: sars-cov-2 manipulates autophagy to inhibit viral clearance and promote sars-cov-2 replication by creating double-membrane vesicles as replication sites. (4) immune response: host immune response is manipulated to evade host cell attacks against sars-cov-2 and increased inflammation by dysregulating immune cells. efficiency of immunosuppressive therapy must be elucidated. (5) programmed cell death: sars-cov-2 inhibits programmed cell death in early stages and induces apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis in later stages. (6) energy metabolism: sars-cov-2 infection leads to disturbed energy metabolism that in turn leads to a decrease in atp production and ros production. (7) viroporins: sars-cov-2 creates viroporins that lead to an imbalance of ion homeostasis. this causes apoptosis, altered action potential, and arrhythmia.",1
"the main source of energy for brain and other organs is glucose. to obtain energy for all tissue, glucose has to come through glycolysis; then as pyruvate it is converted to acetyl-coa by pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (pdc) and finally enters citric acid cycle. what happens when one of these stages become disturb? mutation in genes encoding subunits of pdc leads to pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency. abnormalities in pdc activity result in severe metabolic and brain malformations. for better understanding the development and mechanism of pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency the murine model of this disease has been created. studies on a murine model showed similar malformation in brain structures as in the patients suffered from pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency such as reduced neuronal density, heterotopias of grey matter, reduced size of corpus callosum and pyramids. there is still no effective cure for pdc-deficiency. promising therapy seemed to be ketogenic diet, which substitutes glucose to ketone bodies as a source of energy. studies have shown that ketogenic diet decreases lactic acidosis and inhibits brain malformations, but not the mortality in early childhood. the newest reports say that phenylbutyrate increases the level of pdc in the brain, because it reduces the level of inactive form of pdh. experiments on human fibroblast and zebra fish pdc-deficiency model showed that phenylbutyrate is promising cure to pdc-deficiency. this review summarizes the most important findings on the metabolic and morphological effects of pdc-deficiency and research for treatment therapy.",1
"total-body potassium (k+) content and appropriate distribution of k+ across the cell membrane is vitally important for normal cellular function. total-body k+ content is determined by changes in excretion of k+ by the kidneys in response to intake levels. under normal conditions, insulin and β-adrenergic tone also make important contributions in maintaining internal distribution of k+. however, despite these homeostatic pathways, disorders of altered k+ homeostasis are common. appreciating the pathophysiology and regulatory influences that determine the internal distribution and external balance of k+ is critical in designing effective treatments to restore k+ homeostasis. we provide an up-to-date review of the regulatory aspects of normal k+ physiology as a preface to highlighting common disorders in k+ homeostasis and their treatment. this review of k+ homeostasis is designed as a resource for clinicians and a tool for educators who are teaching trainees to understand the pivotal factors involved in k+ balance.",1
"medical nutrition therapy (mnt) plays an important role in the management of gestational diabetes mellitus (gdm), and accordingly, it has a significant impact on women and newborns. the primary objective of mnt is to ensure adequate pregnancy weight gain and fetus growth while maintaining euglycemia and avoiding ketones. however, the optimal diet (energy content, macronutrient distribution, its quality and amount, among others) remains an outstanding question. overall, the nutritional requirements of gdm are similar for all pregnancies, but special attention is paid to carbohydrates. despite the classical intervention of restricting carbohydrates, the latest evidence, although limited, seems to favor a low-glycemic index diet. there is general agreement in the literature about caloric restrictions in the case of being overweight or obese. randomized controlled trials are necessary to investigate the optimal mnt for gdm; this knowledge could yield health benefits and cost savings.",1
"this guideline was developed by all relevant german pediatric medical societies, which are groups that represent medical professionals that focus on pediatric or child-concerned medicine. an ultrasound is a type of x-ray to see images inside the body and is the common method to view kidney cysts (growths) before and after birth. this method can also exclude cysts in the stomach (abdomen) and inside the genitals. an mri also takes images of the body and may also be needed in some cases. suspicion of a cystic kidney disease should lead to consulting a kidney specialist of children. care provided during pregnancy should align with how serious the disease is and will be slightly different for each patient. oligohydramnios occur when there is too little amniotic fluid (the fluid that surrounds the baby in the womb) and can sometimes be caused by kidney dysfunction. with this condition, it is recommended that delivery occurs in a birth-delivering center where specialty care is available. newborns should not be denied therapy that replaces the normal blood-filtering function of the kidneys just because of their age. children with unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney, where one kidney is large with cysts and is not functioning, do not require routine x-rays or surgery to remove one or both kidneys. however they will need long-term follow-up with kidney specialists (as do children with other kidney problems where one or both kidneys are not working well and have cysts). certain diseases such as arpkd (autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease - an inherited kidney disease with cysts), nephronophthisis (kidney scarring), and bardet-biedl syndrome (a full-body, inherited disease), as well as genetic changes, cause disease outside the kidney, and genetic testing for these conditions is recommended. children with tuberous sclerosis complex (tsc - a rare disease that leads to noncancerous tumors forming in the body) or a high risk of developing tumors or kidney cysts should have regular ultrasounds to take images of the inside of the body. even children of parents with adpkd (autosomal dominant pkd) who do not have symptoms should be monitored for high blood pressure and increased levels of protein in the urine. testing for adpkd in minors using an ultrasound or genetic testing should only be done after a great deal of counseling. simple cysts are very rare in children, and adpkd in a parent should be excluded. complex kidney cysts require more investigation.",0
"edema is a buildup of fluid in the body that occurs as the filtration rate exceeds the drainage rate, producing noticeable symptoms. the rapid development of swelling linked with full-body disease needs timely identification and treatment. the long-lasting buildup of fluid in one or both legs often indicates blood vessel impairment, especially in the presence of swelling in the limbs and iron buildup. skin care is needed in preventing skin breakdown and vein-related open sores. skin inflammation from swelling in the legs can be managed with specific moisturizers and steroid creams. patients who have had deep venous thrombosis (deep vein blood clotting) should wear compression socks to prevent its symptoms like pain and swelling. if clinicians remain suspicious of deep venous thrombosis even when lab tests do not detect it, further lab tests may be performed to rule out other forms of blood clotting and compression. obstructuve sleep apnea (disorder in which breathing is consistently interrupted during sleep by a blockage) may cause swelling in both legs even without lung-related high blood pressure. sturdy skin with swelling characterizes lymphedema (fluid buildup when the body's drainage system is blocked), which can present in one or both legs. possible secondary causes of lymphedema include tumor, blunt force, previous hip surgery, lymph node (immune system organ) removal, and previous radiation therapy. use of compression devices to prevent blood clotting or socks may be helpful in these cases.",0
"perphenazine 8 mg (op8) can be taken by mouth for the following uses: (1) as a nonsedating drug to prevent nausea and vomiting; (2) like promethazine, an antihistamine (allergy drug) , to prevent psychotic symptoms caused by ketamine (a pain relief drug); and (3) as a safe one-dose drug. we also rated the success of one-dose op8 compared to one 40 mg dose of aprepitant, used to prevent nausea and vomiting, given to people before rectum, anus, and colon operations in our center with guidelines designed to help people recover more quickly from surgery, reduce opioid use, and reduce nausea and vomiting after surgery. in this study, we saw no differences in nausea and vomiting prevention on the same day of surgery and one day after surgery between patients who got op8 versus aprepitant. as guidelines to help people recover more quickly from surgery become more widespread and used for other surgeries, successfully preventing nausea and vomiting after surgery is key to improving patient results. op8 should be studied as part of a cost-effective, multi-process way to help people recover more quickly from surgery.",0
"c-reactive protein (crp) is a protein that has remained relatively unchanged from evolution. crp has similar forms in vertebrates and many invertebrates and participates in the systemic (full-body) response to inflammation (infection-fighting). its plasma (blood) concentration increases during inflammation. this is a characteristic that has long been employed for clinical purposes. crp is a pattern recognition molecule. this means crp binds to specific molecular configurations typically found during cell death or on the surfaces of pathogens (foreign organisms). the rapid increase in crp production within hours after tissue injury or infection suggests that it contributes to host defense. this also indicates that crp is part of the innate immune response. recently, an association between minor crp elevation and future major heart-related events has been recognized. this has lead to government health agencies recommending that patients at intermediate risk of coronary heart disease (damage in the heart's major blood vessels) might benefit from measurement of crp. this review focuses on the current understanding of the structure of crp, the molecules it binds and interacts with, and its functions.",0
"muscle cramp is a temporary but intense and painful involuntary contraction of skeletal muscle that can occur in many different situations. the causes of, and cures for, the cramps that occur during or soon after exercise remain uncertain, although there is evidence that some cases may be associated with disturbances of water and salt balance, while others appear to involve sustained abnormal spinal reflex activity secondary to fatigue of the affected muscles. evidence in favour of a role for dyshydration comes largely from medical records obtained in large industrial settings, although it is supported by one large-scale intervention trial and by field trials involving small numbers of athletes. cramp is notoriously unpredictable, making laboratory studies difficult, but experimental models involving electrical stimulation or intense voluntary contractions of small muscles held in a shortened position can induce cramp in many, although not all, individuals. these studies show that dehydration has no effect on the stimulation frequency required to initiate cramping and confirm a role for spinal pathways, but their relevance to the spontaneous cramps that occur during exercise is questionable. there is a long history of folk remedies for treatment or prevention of cramps; some may reduce the likelihood of some forms of cramping and reduce its intensity and duration, but none are consistently effective. it seems likely that there are different types of cramp that are initiated by different mechanisms; if this is the case, the search for a single strategy for prevention or treatment is unlikely to succeed.",1
"digestive organs (e.g., intestines) coming out through a weak point or tear in the abdomen causes groin hernias and includes inguinal (groin area) and femoral (upper thigh area) hernias. inguinal hernias happen more in men. although groin hernias are easily seen in a physical exam in men, ultrasound is often needed in women. ultrasound is also helpful when a doctor thinks a hernia has returned, there is a complication after surgery to repair the hernia, or there is another cause of pain (e.g., groin mass, fluid collection in the scrotum). mri has higher accuracy for detection and no detection than ultrasound and is useful for diagnosing hidden hernias if a doctor thinks it is hernia even if an ultrasound does not show one. injecting a substance into the hernia sac to improve visibility in x-rays may be used in some patients. learning about the common types of surgeries can help family doctors improve care after surgery and look for complications, including the hernia returning. minimally invasive repair has a shorter recovery time, earlier return to daily activities, less pain, and lower return rates than traditional repair. men with inguinal hernias and with few to no symptoms can reasonably and safely watch the hernia without treatment unless symptoms appear or change. watching without treatment unless symptoms appear or change is not suggested in people with hernias with symptoms or in nonpregnant women.",0
"pressure ulcers, or bedsores, are injuries to the skin and underlying tissues caused by long periods of pressure on the skin. these wounds are complex and are difficult to prevent or manage. advice on how to prevent getting pressure ulcers include identifying patients at risk, reducing pressure, friction, shear forces, and assessing (measuring) compounding factors such as nutritional status. management should follow eight treatment strategies. these include accurately assessing the ulcer, relieving pressure, assessing pain and nutritional status, maintaining a damp wound environment, encouraging skin healing, evaluating the need for damaged tissue removal, and controlling infection.",0
"a human model of hemorrhage (excessive bleeding) provides the opportunity to investigate the underlying mechanisms that can help someone avoid the life-threatening condition of inadequate tissue oxygenation known as ""shock."" this is completed by experimentally reducing central blood volume. blood volume is progressively decreased to the point of critically low blood pressure. this test approach has shown differences in the bodily responses between individuals with high tolerances versus low tolerances to blood loss. high tolerance to hemorrhage is defined by maintaining body wide blood flow pressure and prevent decreased brain blood pressure. this is done by one of four ways. first, by protecting cardiac output with greater elevations in heart rate associated with greater cardiac vagal withdrawal and sympathetically mediated adrenergic stimulation. second, a greater increases in systemic peripheral vascular resistance (blood vessel resistance) associated with higher sympathetic nerve activation (fight-or-flight reaction) and levels of circulating vasopressor endocrine responses (responses from chemical messengers). third, an alternating blood flow between the brain and peripheral tissue with greater sympathetically mediated oscillatory patterns of systemic pressure and flow. lastly, by enhancing cardiac filling and cerebral perfusion pressure gradient (pressure driving oxygen to brain tissue) by optimizing the respiratory pump (muscles that help the lung extract and contract). when these compensatory responses are exhausted, an active vasodilation (enlargement of blood vessels) drops resistance to blood flow allowing for increased perfusion of peripheral tissue. when the body no is longer able to maintain systemic pressure and flow, a decreased heart rate leads to the initiation of decompensatory shock.",0
"when a patient has sudden or ongoing hand and/or finger pain after an injury, a hand therapist may place a pencil over and under the first bone of the finger (that starts at the base from the hand) that is causing the pain. the doctor will then ask the patient to flex and extend the fingers several times. putting the first knuckle (the joint where the finger connects with the hand) in a more flexed and extended position than the other knuckles will often take away the pain with active movement when the pencil is in place. the hand therapist will then build a relative motion splint (a piece of sturdy material to support injured bones and allow some movement) that will have the same effect of the pencil. these types of splints support initial movement and can be worn 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. most people can work with these splints on.",0
"objectives: both antidepressant medications and psychological therapy are common treatments for depression in postpartum women. antidepressant treatment may have a number of practical disadvantages, including a preference by women to avoid medication while breastfeeding. consequently, more information about the relative benefits of the two modalities in the perinatal period is helpful. in the treatment of depressive disorders there is some evidence that combination therapies (pharmacological plus psychological treatment) may be more efficacious than either form of mono-therapy in isolation. however, in the treatment of postnatal depression, such evidence is limited. method: forty five postpartum women with a dsm-iv diagnosis of depression were randomised to receive either: 1) cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt); 2) sertraline, or 3) a combination of both treatment modalities. psychometric measures were collected weekly for 12 weeks, with a follow-up at 24 weeks. results: symptoms of depression and anxiety were reduced to a significant degree following all three treatments. cbt mono-therapy was found to be superior to both sertraline mono-therapy and combination therapy after 12 weeks. the cbt mono-therapy group appeared to display the most rapid initial gains after treatment commencement. conclusions: in this sample, a specialised cbt program for postnatal depression was found to be superior as a mono-therapy compared to sertraline, a commonly prescribed ssri antidepressant. this is in contrast to previous studies which have found no detectable difference in the efficacies of drug and psychological treatment for postnatal depression. unlike some previous work, this study allowed a statistically independent evaluation of cbt mono-therapy for postnatal depression compared to both antidepressant and combination therapy. in line with previous studies in postpartum women, there was no detectable advantage of combining pharmacological and psychological treatments in the short term.",1
"fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3) mutations cause dwarfisms, including achondroplasia (ach) and thanatophoric dysplasia (td). the constitutive activation of fgfr3 disrupts the normal process of skeletal growth. bone-growth anomalies have been identified in skeletal ciliopathies, in which primary cilia (pc) function is disrupted. in human ach and td, the impact of fgfr3 mutations on pc in growth plate cartilage remains unknown. here we showed that in chondrocytes from human (ach, td) and mouse fgfr3y367c/+ cartilage, the constitutively active fgfr3 perturbed pc length and the sorting and trafficking of intraflagellar transport (ift) 20 to the pc. we demonstrated that inhibiting fgfr3 with fgfr inhibitor, pd173074, rescued both pc length and ift20 trafficking. we also studied the impact of rapamycin, an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) pathway. interestingly, mtor inhibition also rescued pc length and ift20 trafficking. together, we provide evidence that the growth plate defects ascribed to fgfr3-related dwarfisms are potentially due to loss of pc function, and these dwarfisms may represent a novel type of skeletal disorders with defective ciliogenesis.",1
"fibroblast growth factors (fgfs) and their receptors (fgfrs) play significant roles in vertebrate organ development. fgfr3 prevents cartilage formation and some mutations with continuously active fgfr3 result in achondroplasia, a common dwarfism in humans, but the molecular mechanisms remain elusive. in this study, the authors found that removing bmp type i receptor a (bmpr1a) from cartilage cells rescued the bone overgrowth observed in fgfr3 deficient mice by reducing differentiation of cartilage cells. consistently, using a cartilage cell differentiation assay system, the authors demonstrated that fgfr3 inhibited bmpr1a-mediated maturation of cartilage cells. furthermore, they showed that fgfr3 hyper-activation resulted in impaired bmp signaling in cartilage cells of mouse growth plates. the authors also found that fgfr3 inhibited bmp-2- or constitutively activated bmpr1-induced phosphate group addition of smads through a mechanism independent of its enzyme activity. they found that fgfr3 facilitates bmpr1a to through a common protein breakdown pathway called the ubiquitination pathway. smurf1 played a role in this protein breakdown pathway. they demonstrated that decreasing of bmp signaling by bmpr1 inhibitor dorsomorphin led to the retardation of cartilage cell maturation, which mimics the effect of fgf-2 on cartilage cells. bmp-2 treatment partially rescued the retarded growth of cultured bone rudiments from thanatophoric dysplasia type ii mice. their findings reveal that fgfr3 promotes the degradation of bmpr1a, and this plays an important role in the development of fgfr3-related bone growth impairment.",0
"options for managing pain after surgery are very important for patients having a hip replacement. this is because joint replacement surgery is reported to be one of the most painful surgical procedures. this study shows pain outcome until 4 weeks after surgery and evaluates factors that influence pain during followup after a hip replacement. this was a study that followed a group of patients over time. it included a total of 103 patients that had a hip replacement. pain following surgery was described using a numerical rating scale (nrs). demographic information and ways in which the surgery was done were correlated with the amount of pain after surgery. looking at pain scores following surgery showed a constant decrease in the first week after surgery (average nrs 3.1 on day 1 to average nrs 2.3 on day 8). after that, there was a continuous increase for 3 days (average nrs 2.6 on day 9 to average nrs 2.3 on day 12). afterwards, a continuous pain-level decrease was stated (continuous to a mean nrs 0.9 on day 29). no correlation was found between the potential factors of sex, age, body mass index, duration of surgery, asa score (used to measure fitness for surgery), and pain levels following the operation. however, a there was a significant correlation between pain levels before surgery and after. in conclusion, pain levels increased after the first week following surgery, for 3 days. this is most likely caused by the change to more extensive mobilization and physiotherapy in the rehabilitation unit. we did not find any significant association of several potential predictors with the intensity of pain following surgery. the only exception was the amount of pain before surgery. when managing pain, doctors need to account for these results in the future. this is needed to further increase patients' satisfaction following hip replacement and to adapt pain management programs.",0
"hyperkalemia is a condition where the potassium level in the blood is higher than normal. potassium is a very important mineral in the body. hyperkalemia is often seen in patients with ongoing kidney disease. hyperkalemia can cause serious problems with your heartbeat and an increased risk of death. doctors consider severe hyperkalemia a medical emergency and treat it immediately. they also give treatments to try to stop it from coming back. current treatments for ongoing hyperkalemia include avoiding things that can cause it to come back. doctors advise not to eat foods or take supplements that are high in potassium and to stop using medicines that are known to increase the potassium level. some of the most commonly uses medicines that are known to increase potassium levels are a class of drugs that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (raas blockers). the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (raas) is a hormone system that manages blood pressure and fluid balance in the body. often as the first step, doctors stop giving patients these medicines to prevent hyperkalemia from coming back. while stopping these medicines usually works well to lower the potassium level, patients miss out on the known kidney protection this class of drugs can give. newer medicines have now been developed that bind to potassium. these new potassium binders allow doctors to lower the potassium level in a different way. doctors may now be able to lower potassium levels and still keep their patients on the raas blockers for the kidney protection these medicines give. this research studies hyperkalemia and its effects. this work also shows the many (and new) ways of treating hyperkalemia and how the treatment can help the patients.",0
"pressure ulcer (pu) is a worldwide problem that is hard to heal because of its prolonged inflammatory response and impaired ecm deposition caused by local hypoxia and repeated ischemia/reperfusion. our previous study discovered that the non-fouling zwitterionic sulfated poly (sulfobetaine methacrylate) (sbma) hydrogel can improve pu healing with rapid ecm rebuilding. however, the mechanism of the sbma hydrogel in promoting ecm rebuilding is unclear. therefore, in this work, the impact of the sbma hydrogel on ecm reconstruction is comprehensively studied, and the underlying mechanism is intensively investigated in a rat pu model. the in vivo data demonstrate that compared to the peg hydrogel, the sbma hydrogel enhances the ecm remolding by the upregulation of fibronectin and laminin expression as well as the inhibition of mmp-2. further investigation reveals that the decreased mmp-2 expression of zwitterionic sbma hydrogel treatment is due to the activation of autophagy through the inhibited pi3k/akt/mtor signaling pathway and reduced inflammation. the association of autophagy with ecm remodeling may provide a way in guiding the design of biomaterial-based wound dressing for chronic wound repair.",1
"the role of subclinical intrauterine infection in preterm labor was evaluated prospectively in 40 patients and appropriate control subjects. the 24 preterm labor patients (60%) with a negative c-reactive protein value responded to tocolysis 95.8% of the time, with a mean delay of delivery of 35.5 days and a mean gestational age of 36.9 weeks. the 16 patients (40%) with a positive c-reactive protein value responded to tocolysis only 37.5% of the time, with a mean delay of delivery of 14.4 days and a mean gestational age of 33.2 weeks. pathologic evidence of chorioamnionitis was present in 32.9% of 310 preterm deliveries as compared to only 22.3% of 1631 term deliveries. the presence of subclinical infection must be considered in cases of preterm labor, especially among patients for whom tocolytic therapy is unsuccessful.",1
"hyperkalemia is a condition where the potassium level in the blood is higher than normal. potassium is a very important mineral (electrolyte) in the body. hyperkalemia can sometimes lead to death. although there are many guidelines, all doctors do not agree on the best ways to take care of patients with different types of hyperkalemia. types of hyperkalemia include acute (coming on rapidly), and chronic (long-lasting). this study discusses the serious issues and needs in the care of patients with hyperkalemia. real-world studies are needed to understand how many patients have hyperkalemia that are not under research. doctors need to improve the overall care of patients with hyperkalemia. this care includes knowing the type of hyperkalemia, how often to check the blood potassium levels, when to use the potassium-binder drugs that are taken by mouth, and when doctors can start the raas blocker drugs again. the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (raas) is a hormone system that manages blood pressure and fluid balance in the body. drugs that block the raas (raas blockers) have good effects on the cardiovascular system (heart and blood vessels). but the raas blockers can cause hyperkalemia. how often blood potassium levels are checked depends on the patient. doctors should consider checking the blood levels more often in patients with chronic kidney disease, diabetes, heart failure, or a history of hyperkalemia and in patients taking raas blockers. recent patient studies suggest that the newer potassium-binders (patiromer sorbitex calcium and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) may help using the raas blockers and overall good treatment. confidence in caring for patients with hyperkalemia may increase as primary care and internal medicine doctors learn more about the safety of the newer potassium-binders. more studies are required in order to know if strict low-potassium diets are needed in patients taking potassium-binders. each patient's blood potassium levels should be checked as needed in patients at increased risk for hyperkalemia. doing this, and using the newer potassium-binding drugs, may allow the best use of raas blockers and better overall care of patients with hyperkalemia.",0
"kidneys play an important role in monitoring acid-base and electrolyte balance, which is a requirement for many metabolic processes and organ functions in the human body. long-lasting kidney diseases threaten the regulatory functions, leading to changes in electrolyte and acid-base balance that can be life-threatening. we review the kidney's regulation of electrolyte and acid-base balance and disorders involving their imbalances. common, long-lasting kidney disorders are also discussed. the most recent and relevant treatments on the biology and treatment of these conditions have been included.",0
"coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), a breathing-related disease caused by a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2, has been an ongoing global pandemic. several vaccines have been developed to control the covid-19, but the potential effectiveness of the mucosal vaccine (vaccines given at moist, inner lining of some organs and body cavities, such as the nose, mouth, lungs, and stomach) remains to be documented. in this study, researchers constructed a lactic acide gene called l. plantarum lp18: rbd that uses information from the receptor-binding domain (rbd) (the part of the virus located on the spike protein which is involved in introducing a virus into host cells) of the sars-cov-2 spike protein by anchoring to the surface. researchers also evaluate the immune response in mice by the intranasal administration (a non-invasive route for drug delivery through the nose) of lp18:rbd. the results show that lp18:rbd significantly brought out iga antibodies (antibodies that play a crucial role in the immune function of mucous membranes) in the organs involved in breathing and in digesting food. these results show that lp18:rbd may create humoral immune responses (molecules that create antibodies against a specific antigen and involves substances found in the humors, or body fluids) and could be used as a mucosal vaccine against sars-cov-2 infection. this study is the first experiment that shows lp18:rbd could start an immune response within a living person or animal and suggests that mucosal vaccines could be a promising vaccine strategy to prevent the covid-19 pandemic.",0
"symmetrical leg swelling formed in the course of the years is a common and in most cases benign phenomenon that is mostly encountered in the aged population, especially in women. venous insufficiency of the lower limbs is the most common cause of symmetrical leg swelling among those over 50 years of age. diseases of the essential organs such as the heart, the liver and the kidneys are excluded during the initial stage. pitting edema occurs both in venous insufficiency and in right-sided heart failure. basic tests and drug history are usually sufficient to exclude a host of general causes of the edema.",1
"recent studies have shown that nitric oxide (no) is a central mediator in diseases occurring with thoracic aortic aneurysm (taa), such as marfan syndrome (mfs). the progressive dilation of the aorta in taa ultimately leads to aortic dissection. unfortunately, current medical treatments neither halt aortic enlargement nor prevent rupture, leaving surgical repair as the only effective treatment. there is therefore a pressing need for effective therapies to delay or even avoid the need for surgical repair in taa patients. here, we summarize the mechanisms through which no signalling dysregulation causes taa, particularly in mfs and discuss recent advances based on the identification of new mfs mediators related to pathway overactivation that represent potential disease biomarkers. likewise, we propose inos, sgc, and prkg1, whose pharmacological inhibition reverses aortopathy in mfs mice, as targets for therapeutic intervention in taa and candidates for clinical trials.",1
"evidence is put forward to suggest that myalgic encephalomyelitis, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome, may be associated with persistent viral infection. in turn, such infections are likely to impair the ability of the body to biosynthesise n-3 and n-6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids by inhibiting the delta-6 desaturation of the precursor essential fatty acids--namely, alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid. this would, in turn, impair the proper functioning of cell membranes, including cell signalling, and have an adverse effect on the biosynthesis of eicosanoids from the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid. these actions might offer an explanation for some of the symptoms and signs of myalgic encephalomyelitis. a potential therapeutic avenue could be offered by bypassing the inhibition of the enzyme delta-6-desaturase by treatment with virgin cold-pressed non-raffinated evening primrose oil, which would supply gamma-linolenic acid and lipophilic pentacyclic triterpenes, and with eicosapentaenoic acid. the gamma-linolenic acid can readily be converted into dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid and thence arachidonic acid, while triterpenes have important free radical scavenging, cyclo-oxygenase and neutrophil elastase inhibitory activities. furthermore, both arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid are, at relatively low concentrations, directly virucidal.",1
"there are several b vitamins: folic acid, b12 and b6 and b2. they are important in one carbon metabolism of protein and dna metabolism. here, one carbon unit is transferred from an amino acid (building blocks of proteins) by a b vitamin, tetrahydrofolate (thf), to form a new chemical, methylene-thf. methylene-thf is used in the synthesis of dna, rna, or in the metabolism of important amino acids (such as the reaction that changes one amino acid, homocysteine, to another amino acid, methionine). much of the methionine which is formed is made into s-adenosylmethionine (sam) and then used in the metabolism of dna, rna, hormones, neurotransmitters (nerve impulse chemicals), cell lipids (fats), proteins and others. because of these functions, interest in recent years has been growing particularly in the area of aging. the possibility that certain diseases associated with aging such as the loss of thinking, alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer and others, may be in part explained by inadequate intake or inadequate amounts in the body of these vitamins. homocysteine, an amino acid that is both needed to make methionine as well as made from methionine metabolism was shown recently to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, stroke and blood clots when its amount in blood is slightly elevated. facts now show association between increased blood levels of homocysteine and loss of brain function and alzheimer's disease. these associations could be due to harmful effects of homocysteine on the nervous system or on the decreased amount of sam in the brain. problems with methionine metabolism are also thought to increase depressive tendency in people.these problems with methionine and dna metabolism are also thought to be the link between the relationship seen between low levels of vitamin b folate and colorectal cancer. many factors(reasons) contribute to the fact that the amount of these vitamins in the elderly is inadequate. one factor is not having enough acid in the stomach (achlorhydria). this decreases the amount of vitamin b12 your stomach can absorb from food. other factors include socioeconomic and habits. we need more studies to prove that these vitamins have important functions in the causes of these diseases. we also need to prove iif these diseases can be prevented or lessened by proper nutrition starting at a younger age.",0
"background: a large number of studies have linked vitamin b6 to inflammation and cardiovascular disease in the general population. however, it remains uncertain whether vitamin b6 is associated with cardiovascular outcome independent of inflammation. methods: we measured plasma pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (plp), as an indicator of vitamin b6 status, at baseline in a population-based prospective cohort of 6249 participants of the prevention of renal and vascular end-stage disease (prevend) study who were free of cardiovascular disease. as indicators of low-grade systemic inflammation, we measured high-sensitivity c-reactive protein and glyca; results: median plasma plp was 37.2 (interquartile range, 25.1-57.0) nmol/l. during median follow-up for 8.3 (interquartile range, 7.8-8.9) years, 409 non-fatal and fatal cardiovascular events (composite outcome) occurred. in the overall cohort, log transformed plasma plp was associated with the composite outcome, independent of adjustment for age, sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index (bmi), estimated glomerular filtration rate (egfr), total cholesterol:high-density lipoprotein (hdl)-cholesterol ratio, and blood pressure (adjusted hazard ratio per increment of log plasma plp, 0.66; 95% confidence interval (ci), 0.47-0.93). however, adjustment for high-sensitivity c-reactive protein and glyca increased the hazard ratio by 9% and 12% respectively, to non-significant hazard ratios of 0.72 (95% confidence interval, 0.51-1.01) and 0.74 (95% confidence interval, 0.53-1.05). the association of plasma plp with cardiovascular risk was modified by gender (adjusted pinteraction = 0.04). when stratified according to gender, in women the prospective association with cardiovascular outcome was independent of age, smoking, alcohol consumption, high-sensitivity c-reactive protein, and glyca (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.50, 95% confidence interval, 0.27-0.94), while it was not in men (adjusted hazard, 0.99, 95% confidence interval, 0.65-1.51). conclusions: in this population-based cohort, plasma plp was associated with cardiovascular outcome, but this association was confounded by traditional risk factors and parameters of inflammation. notably, the association of low plasma plp with high risk of adverse cardiovascular outcome was modified by gender, with a stronger and independent association in women.",1
"the natural progress of parkinson's disease (a brain-related disorder affecting movement) is largely unknown because patients are usually examined during treatment. as parkinson's disease progresses, the effect of the long-lasting response to levodopa (common parkinsons's medication) remains unknown since it is measured indirectly in treated patients. we tried to describe the natural course of movement symptoms by measuring the off state when symptoms occur in patients never given treatment (drug-naïve) for parkinson's disease. for 2 years, we also explored how daily levodopa affects the progression of movement symptoms in the off state after treatment wears off. in this lengthy, observational study in sub-saharan africa, 30 patients with parkinson's disease (age at onset 58 ± 14 years, disease duration 7 ± 4 years) began levodopa therapy and were later measured with a specific disease scale for parkinson's. data were collected at start, 1-year, and 2-year follow-up. first-time levodopa intake improved movement symptoms. after 1 year, severity of symptoms of parkinson's disease was lower after overnight withdrawal of levodopa than without it at all. the lowered severity by levodopa was not altered by disease length. after 2 years, movement signs after overnight withdrawal of medication was still 30% milder than movement signs with no treatment ever. the no-symptom state after first-time levodopa was similar and related to the overnight typical-symptom state after 1 year. compared to the natural progression, levodopa reduces symptom severity via a 31% annual decline with some leeway due to disease duration. we calculated that the response to levodopa involved a possible 60-65% benefit of total motor activity, regardless of disease duration. while levodopa relates to movement fluctuations, the typical-symptom state after overnight levodopa withdrawal was less severe than without medication at all, regardless of disease duration. a yearly decline in symptom severity during the typical-symptom state also exists. we need more research to explain the mechanisms for the response to levodopa in parkinson's disease. understanding how parkinson's disease progresses and the response to levodopa may help create better treatments and better assess clinical trials for parkinson's disease.",0
"metabolic epilepsies arise in the context of rare inborn errors of metabolism (iem), notably glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome, succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency, nonketotic hyperglycinemia, and mitochondrial cytopathies. a common feature of these disorders is impaired bioenergetics, which through incompletely defined mechanisms result in a wide spectrum of neurological symptoms, such as epileptic seizures, developmental delay, and movement disorders. the ketogenic diet (kd) has been successfully utilized to treat such conditions to varying degrees. while the mechanisms underlying the clinical efficacy of the kd in iem remain unclear, it is likely that the proposed heterogeneous targets influenced by the kd work in concert to rectify or ameliorate the downstream negative consequences of genetic mutations affecting key metabolic enzymes and substrates-such as oxidative stress and cell death. these beneficial effects can be broadly grouped into restoration of impaired bioenergetics and synaptic dysfunction, improved redox homeostasis, anti-inflammatory, and epigenetic activity. hence, it is conceivable that the kd might prove useful in other metabolic disorders that present with epileptic seizures. at the same time, however, there are notable contraindications to kd use, such as fatty acid oxidation disorders. clearly, more research is needed to better characterize those metabolic epilepsies that would be amenable to ketogenic therapies, both experimentally and clinically. in the end, the expanded knowledge base will be critical to designing metabolism-based treatments that can afford greater clinical efficacy and tolerability compared to current kd approaches, and improved long-term outcomes for patients.",1
"gabapentin (gbp) is a nerve-related pain medication that is mainly removed from the body in urine, and is also processed by the kidneys. the objective of this study is to evaluate how gabapentin may interact with another medicine called cetirizine (ctz) that is used to temporarily relieve allergies. a clinical trial in patients with a shooting or burning pain caused by damage to the nervous system called neuropathic pain is conducted to understand the effect of cetirizine on how gabapentin is processed in the body. in this study, 12 patients are treated with either one dose of gabapentin (called treatment a) or with cetirizine for 5 days and gabapentin given on the last day of cetirizine (treatment b). blood samples are taken and the level of pain is measured up to 36 hours after gabapentin is taken. the interaction of gabapentin and cetirizine is analyzed. cetirizine treatment resulted a reduced time the body is exposed to the medication and reduced peak amount when compared with treatment a (one dose of gabapentin). in treatment b, the lower concentrations of gabapentin or gbp in the blood results in reduced pain. gbp clearance from the kidneys is similar between treatments a and b. gbp appears to bind less to some receptors or kidney target sites such as oct2 and attach more towards others such as hmate1 in certain human kidney cells. at certain concentrations, ctz interacts with transporters in the body that move materials across cells. in summary, cetirizine (ctz) reduces the exposure to gabapentin (gbp) and its effect on neuropathic pain. however, ctz × gbp interaction is not influenced by the transporters in the kidney.",0
"a littre's hernia (lh) is characterized by meckel's diverticulum (md; a pouch on the wall of the lower part of the small intestine present at birth) in any kind of hernia or bulging organ sac. diagnosing lh before surgery is difficult because it is rare and lacks distinguishing features on x-ray and exam. surgery is the best treatment for inflamed lh, a very rare condition with about 50 cases reported in scientific papers over the past 300 years. a 46-year-old white woman went to the emergency room after two days of stomach pain. physical exam showed an irreversible and painful lump near the belly button. stomach ct scan showed the tissue that covers the intestines and loop of the small intestine pushing out through the muscle that surrounds the belly button. lab tests were normal. after diagnosis of a hernia near the belly button cutting off blood supply, the patient had abdominal surgery. doctors opened the irreversible hernia sac and saw tissue that covers the intestines trapped and cut off from blood supply along with uninflamed md. parts of the tissue that covers the intestines that were trapped or cut off from blood supply and were removed. the patient recovered normally from surgery. md is the most common abnormality of the gi tract present at birth. diagnosing lh before surgery is difficult and surgery is the best treatment of inflamed lh. we conclude that lh is a very rare complication of md and is difficult to diagnose because it lacks distinguishing features on x-ray and exam. surgery is the best treatment for stomach wall hernias and inflamed md.",0
"obese youth diagnosed with type 2 diabetes by a doctor often have islet cell autoimmunity (in which immune cells attack healthy cells). we looked at the observable and biochemical differences, and treatment types of self-made protein positive (ab+) vs. self-made protein negative (ab-) youth at diagnosis and over time at a medical facility. we reviewed medical charts of 145 obese youth diagnosed with type 2 diabetes from january 2003 to july 2012. of these 145 youth, 70 patients were ab+ and 75 ab-. we compared the disease symptoms, physical qualities, lab findings, and treatment types of the two groups at diagnosis and during follow up to rate the changes in these things related to disease development. at the doctor, ab+ youth with a doctor's diagnosis of type 2 diabetes were younger, had higher rates of not enough carbohydrates to burn, higher hemoglobin a1c (hba1c - which indicates average blood sugar levels) and blood sugar levels, and lower insulin and signs of insulin production compared with the ab- group. the ab- group had a higher body mass index (bmi) score adjusted for weight and gender and risk factors for heart disease and metabolic disorders at diagnosis and did not change over time. treatment type had no effect on bmi in either group. we found that: (i) length of diabetes affected bmi score adjusted for weight and gender and diastolic blood pressure, (ii) changes in bmi score adjusted for weight and gender affected systolic blood pressure and alt (alanine transaminase; released into the blood when liver cells are damaged), and (iii) changes in hba1c affected lipid profile (panel of blood tests used to find abnormalities in lipids, such as cholesterol and triglycerides) and risk factors for heart disease and metabolic disorders independent of antibody (infection-fighting protein) status. regardless of antibody status and treatment type, obese and diabetic youth do not become less obese over time, with higher bmi affecting blood pressure and alt, and blood sugar levels affecting the lipid profile. controlling bmi and blood sugar levels are needed to lessen future large blood vessel problems regardless of antibody status.",0
"purpose: the study aimed to define the clinical, biochemical and genetic features of adult patients with osteopenia/osteoporosis and/or bone fragility and low serum alkaline phosphatase (salp). methods: twenty-two patients with at least two salp values below the reference range were retrospectively enrolled after exclusion of secondary causes. data about clinical features, mineral and bone markers, serum pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (plp), urine phosphoethanolamine (pea), lumbar and femur bone densitometry, and column x-ray were collected. peripheral blood dna of each participant was analyzed to detect alpl gene anomalies. results: pathogenic alpl variants (palpl) occurred in 23% and benign variants in 36% of patients (balpl), while nine patients harbored wild-type alleles (wtalpl). fragility fractures and dental anomalies were more frequent in patients harboring palpl and balpl than in wtalpl patients. of note, wtalpl patients comprised women treated with tamoxifen for hormone-sensitive breast cancer. mineral and bone markers were similar in the three groups. mean urine pea levels were significantly higher in patients harboring palpl than those detected in patients harboring balpl and wtalpl; by contrast, serum plp levels were similar in the three groups. a 6-points score, considering clinical and biochemical features, was predictive of palpl detection [p = 0.060, or 1.92 (95% ci 0.972, 3.794)], and more significantly of palpl or balpl [p = 0.025, or 14.33 (95% ci 1.401, 14.605)]. conclusion: in osteopenic/osteoporotic patients, single clinical or biochemical factors did not distinguish hypophosphatasemic patients harboring palpl or balpl from those harboring wtalpl. occurrence of multiple clinical and biochemical features is predictive of alpl anomalies, and, therefore, they should be carefully identified. tamoxifen emerged as a hypophosphatasemic drug.",1
"purpose: to evaluate the practical value of initial c-reactive protein (crp) in the diagnosis of bacterial infection in children. methods: the subjects comprised 11 children, six boys and five girls, aged 3 months through to 3 years (median age 16 months), whose initial crp levels were < 1.0 mg/dl despite bacterial infection. c-reactive protein was quantitated at the first medical examination by nephelometry. results: the diagnosis was urinary tract infection (n = 4), bacterial meningitis (n = 2), sepsis (n = 2), pneumonia (n = 2) and arthritis of the hip joint (n = 1). the crp levels were significantly elevated during the course of infection, ranging from 7.6 to 28.5 mg/dl. the bacterial etiology was non-specific. eight patients were examined within 12 h of onset, three exhibited negative crp values despite the duration of the insult over 12 h. six patients were tentatively diagnosed as having a bacterial infection, but the other five were not. each patient was treated, leading to a favorable outcome without any serious complications. conclusions: low levels of crp do not rule out the possibility of bacterial infection in children. the initial value of crp may be negative, even in patients with severe bacterial infection or even after 12 h from onset. the data suggest that pediatricians should consistently be aware of the possibility of bacterial infection even if the initial crp test result is negative and that serial crp measurements appear to be practical.",1
"neurodevelopmental diseases are increasingly recognized to be caused by ""de novo"" variants with the expanding use of next-generation sequencing. the apparent de novo variants may actually be low-level hereditary parental mosaic variants, which could increase the recurrence risk of disease by >50% and is thought to be an underappreciated cause of neurodevelopmental diseases. our study aimed to investigate the frequency of parental mosaicism in ""de novo"" neurodevelopmental diseases. a total of 237 patients (and parents) with neurodevelopmental diseases carrying apparent de novo pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were recruited consecutively. deep next-generation sequencing was performed on parental samples to identify parental mosaicism. fourteen parental disease-causing mosaicism variants (3.0%) in 11 genes were detected with alternate allele frequency (aaf) 0.22%-34%. three parents showed milder clinical phenotypes than their offspring with relatively high aaf (23.33%, 25%, 34% separately). one recurrent variant was identified prenatally. a review of cohort study on parental mosaicism in neurodevelopmental diseases was performed. our study highlights that identifying the parental mosaic disease-causing variants especially the low-level mosaicism will contribute to improving the accuracy of genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis for reproductive risks.",1
"edema is an accumulation of fluid in the interstitial space that occurs as the capillary filtration exceeds the limits of lymphatic drainage, producing noticeable clinical signs and symptoms. the rapid development of generalized pitting edema associated with systemic disease requires timely diagnosis and management. the chronic accumulation of edema in one or both lower extremities often indicates venous insufficiency, especially in the presence of dependent edema and hemosiderin deposition. skin care is crucial in preventing skin breakdown and venous ulcers. eczematous (stasis) dermatitis can be managed with emollients and topical steroid creams. patients who have had deep venous thrombosis should wear compression stockings to prevent postthrombotic syndrome. if clinical suspicion for deep venous thrombosis remains high after negative results are noted on duplex ultrasonography, further investigation may include magnetic resonance venography to rule out pelvic or thigh proximal venous thrombosis or compression. obstructive sleep apnea may cause bilateral leg edema even in the absence of pulmonary hypertension. brawny, nonpitting skin with edema characterizes lymphedema, which can present in one or both lower extremities. possible secondary causes of lymphedema include tumor, trauma, previous pelvic surgery, inguinal lymphadenectomy, and previous radiation therapy. use of pneumatic compression devices or compression stockings may be helpful in these cases.",1
"a large number of studies have linked vitamin b6 to inflammation and cardiovascular disease in the general population. it is not known if vitamin b6 is linked to future cardiovascular disease without inflammation. researchers measured the amount of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (plp) in the blood at the start of a prevention study in patients without cardiovascular disease. levels of plp in blood can show how much vitamin b6 is present in the body. low-level widespread inflammation in the body was measured by blood levels of high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hscrp) and glya. the blood level of plp was about 37.2 nmol/l. these patients were followed up for about 8 years. during this time, 409 cardiovascular diseases events occurred, some were fatal. in these patients, the amount of plp in the blood was linked to the cardiovascular events that occurred. this link did not depend on other risk factors like age, sex, smoking, drinking alcohol, body weight (bmi), kidney function (egfr), cholesterol levels, or blood pressure. but, the amount of hscrp and glya in the blood was linked to an increase in the risk of having these cardiovascular events occurring. also, this link of the amount of plp in the blood and the risk of getting cardiovascular disease was affected by gender. in women, the link between the amount of plp in the blood and getting cardiovascular disease did not depend on the other risk factors like age, smoking, drinking alcohol, or blood levels of hscrp and glya. in men, the link was not as independent of these other risk factors. in these patients, the level of plp in blood was linked to getting cardiovascular disease. this link was affected by the usual risk factors and measures of inflammation. the association of low blood levels of plp with high risk of harmful cardiovascular outcomes wasaffected by gender. this association was stronger and independent in women.",0
"this study added hormone prednisone to antihistamines, the drugs that are usually used to treat hives (itchy skin rash). adults with the rash that started no more than 24 hours ago participated in the study. patients with wheezing, raspy breathing, swelling or those who took antihistamines or hormones within 5 days before coming to the emergency room were not included in the study. diabetics and people with ulcers (open sores in the stomach) were not included too. all patients were asked to give their itch an ""itch score"" on a scale. patients then got a shot of an antihistamine diphenhydramine and were sent home. they took an antihistamine hydroxyzine every 4 to 8 hours for their itch. patients also took another pill every 12 hours for 4 days. for some that pill was the hormone prednisone, and for some it was a placebo (did not contain any drug). patients came back to evaluate their each score 2 days later. 5 days later the score was evaluated by phone. out of f43 patients, 24 got prednisone and 19 placebo. all had similar each scores at the beginning. after 2 and 5 days, those who had prednisone had lower itch scores and less rash. patients' age, sex, and substances that caused allergies did not effect the itch score. no patients had adverse reactions. adding prednisone improves antihistamine treatment of hives. when prednisone was added, the skin cleared faster and more completely. there were no side effects.",0
"muscle cramp is a temporary but intense, painful, uncontrollable muscle contraction that can occur for different reasons. the causes of and cures for exercise-related cramps remain unknown. however, some cases may be linked with disturbances of water and salt balance, while others may be from constant abnormal spinal reflex activity linked to fatigue of the affected muscles. evidence of lack of water comes largely from medical records from large industrial settings. however, it is also supported by one large treatment trial and trials with small groups of athletes. cramp is very unpredictable, making lab studies difficult, but experiments with electrical stimulation or intense voluntary contractions of small muscles held in a shortened position can cause cramp in many, but not all, individuals. these studies show that dehydration does no affect the stimulation amount needed to start cramping and confirm a role for spinal pathways, but their link to the spontaneous exercise-related cramps that occur is questionable. there is a long history of home remedies for treatment or prevention of cramps. some may reduce the chance of some forms of cramping and reduce its intensity and length, but none are consistently effective. there may be different types of cramp caused by different mechanisms; if so, finding a single strategy for prevention or treatment is unlikely to work.",0
"pimary progressive aphasia (ppa), a language and speech brain disorder, is linked with amyloid-β (aβ), a brain protein segment associated with alzheimer's disease. however, symptoms of ppa based on aβ presence is unclear. we assess the amount of aβ presence in patients with ppa and compare the symptoms of ppa patients with aβ presence of aβ-positive (a+) versus those without aβ (a-). we also classified aβ and tau type in ppa patients with this available information. we had 110 ppa patients (41 who can't understand words [svppa], 27 who can't speak but understand words [nfvppa], 32 who have trouble finding the right word [lvppa], and 10 unclassified [ucppa]) undergo aβ imaging at multiple centers. the extent of language impairment and brain damage were compared between tehe a+ and a- ppa subgroups. the proportion of aβ presence was highest in patients with lvppa (81.3%), then ucppa (60.0%), nfvppa (18.5%), and svppa (9.8%). the a+ ppa subgroup had brain damage mainly on the left side in the middle regions and had worse scores compared to the a- ppa subgroup. also, over 90% (13/14) patients with a+ ppa had tau, a brain protein associated with alzheimer's disease. our findings will help clinicians understand the patterns of language impairment and brain damage in ppa patients based on aβ presence. since most a+ ppa patients have tau, understanding the effect of alzheimer's disease markers on ppa may allow these patients to participate in clinical studies aimed for treating atypical alzheimer's disease.",0
"treating decubitus ulcers (bedsores) is a serious medical problem. in many cases, it is difficult to cure a pressure ulcer or bedsore, especially when it is deep and extensive. recovery is usually poor. treating bedsores requires new specialized dressings (e.g., ointments, gauze), which are important for healing. we aim to evaluate the success of active specialized medical dressings for treating bedsores. research included 40 patients - 18 (45% women) and 22 (55%) men, suffering from bedsores of various size and depth, in the lower back, lasting from 1.5 to 30 months. patients were randomly split to two groups (20 people each) and treated for 4 weeks with either atrauman ag, a dressing with silver, or gauze with paraffin (a waxy substance commonly used for coating and sealing candles and rubbers) from bactigras. measuring pressure ulcer healing was done by measuring the wound surface area. the results showed a decrease in average bedsore area in both treatment groups: in the first group by 60.2% and in the second group by 32.95%, which speaks in favour of dressings with silver as better treatments. using specialized dressings leads to a decrease in bedsore area, depending on the dressing type and substances contained within it. silver supports the healing properties of the dressing used.",0
"the first cardiac implantable electronic device (cied), the electronic pacemaker, maintains the pumping of blood in and out of the heart when heart beats are unusually slow. the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (icd) manages a heart rhythm that beats too fast or fibrillation (an irregular heart beat) and saves lives primarily through the use of high-energy shocks. the cardiac resynchronization therapy (crt) device send electrical signals to the lower chambers of the heart and restores the ability of the two parts of the heart to beat in sync in patients with heart failure. despite >50 years of pacing and 40 years of icd therapy, the lead pacemaker (device with wires that run between the part that generates pulses and the heart) remains the weakest link between the device and the patient.",0
"we aimed to summarize the characteristics, how well it works, and safety of vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (vmat-2) inhibitors, drugs that reduce dopamine (a chemical messenger released when your brain is expecting a reward), for treating tardive dyskinesia (td) - a movement disorder. we searched for published scientific studies, including studies that summarized other studies, used statistics to combine results from other studies, or randomly assigned participants to groups receiving td treatment or sugar pills that looked at how well treatments worked and safety of vmat-2 inhibitors (tetrabenazine, deutetrabenazine, and valbenazine) in patients with td. we used statistical methods to determine how well treatments work and safety results across multiple studies. we used statistical methods to combine results from two 12-week studies with deutetrabenazine 12-48 mg/day (413 patients) and four 4-6 week studies with valbenazine 12.5-100 mg/day (488 patients). no high-quality data were available for tetrabenazine for a similar analysis. results favored deutetrabenazine and valbenazine over sugar pills in scores on a rating scale that measures involuntary movements (aims). the percentage of patients who had 50% reduction in scores on the same rating scale (aims) favored deutetrabenazine and valbenazine over sugar pills. results were less consistent using another rating scale done by patients and doctors for deutetrabenazine and by doctors for valbenazine. in one study of deutetrabenazine and one study of valbenazine, the percentage of patients who had a 50% reduction in scores on the aims rating scale went up over time. effects of stopping valbenazine were studied, showing td symptoms returning to levels before stopping valbenazine within 4 weeks of stopping the drug. no increased unfavorable and unintended effects were observed in studies where participants continued to take the studied drug compared to sugar pills. we conclude that the 2 vmat-2 inhibitors, valbenazine and deutetrabenazine, work to treat td, both in the short- and long-term, without causing increased risk of depression or suicide in people with td. no studies comparing vmat-2 inhibitors or high-quality tetrabenazine data that could be compared across studies were available.",0
"objective: patients with generalized anxiety disorder (n=107) who had been long-term benzodiazepine users (average duration of use=8.5 years) were enrolled in a benzodiazepine discontinuation program that assessed the effectiveness of concomitant imipramine (180 mg/day) and buspirone (38 mg/day) compared to placebo in facilitating benzodiazepine discontinuation. method: after a benzodiazepine stabilization period taking either diazepam, lorazepam, or alprazolam, patients were treated for 4 weeks with imipramine, buspirone, or placebo under double-blind conditions while benzodiazepine intake was kept stable (treatment phase). patients then entered a 4-6 week benzodiazepine taper and a 5-week posttaper phase with imipramine, buspirone, and placebo treatment being continued until 3 weeks into the posttaper phase, at which time all patients were switched to placebo for 2 weeks. benzodiazepine plasma levels were assayed weekly. benzodiazepine-free status was assessed 3 and 12 months posttaper. results: study subjects were long-term benzodiazepine users with an average of three unsuccessful prior taper attempts. the success rate of the taper in this study was significantly higher for patients who received imipramine (82.6%), and nonsignificantly higher for patients who received buspirone (67.9%), than for patients who received placebo (37.5%). the imipramine effect remained highly significant even after the analysis adjusted for three other independent predictors of taper success: benzodiazepine dose, level of anxious symptoms at baseline, and duration of benzodiazepine therapy. conclusions: management of benzodiazepine discontinuation can be facilitated significantly by co-prescribing imipramine before and during the benzodiazepine taper. daily benzodiazepine dose, severity of baseline symptoms of anxiety and depression, and duration of benzodiazepine use were additional significant predictors of successful taper outcome.",1
"the causes of finger pain can usually be found by learning about the duration and severity of the problem and doing a physical examination. however, x-rays and lab tests are often used to identify the cause of the pain. most minor traumatic injuries that cause finger pain only need non-invasive (no surgery) therapy, such as resting followed by exercise. finger pain caused by an infection (germs that build in the body causing illness) usually require medicines that fight bacteria called antibiotics. a process called drainage that removes extra fluid from a wound is sometimes used with antibiotics. sometimes patients with finger pain from an infection will see a hand surgeon. limited or no blood flow to or through the tissues in the finger can cause finger pain, are signs of a true emergency, and require immediate attention to prevent more damage to the tissues. patients with nerve damage may have finger pain. carpal tunnel syndrome (pain or tingling in the hand or arm caused by a pinched wrist nerve) is a common example of pain caused by nerve damage. diseases that can cause your immune system to attack your joints, muscles, bones and organs (called systemic rheumatic diseases) can begin with finger pain. in addition, finger pain may be the first sign of a more serious illness, such as in hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (a rare disease with irritation around the bone and enlarged fingertips). reflex sympathetic dystrophy (a disease causing long-lasting pain in one or more limbs) is an example of when an injury in one part to the body causes pain in a different part of the body. certain infections, traumatic injuries, and blood flow problems that cause finger pain must be identified quickly to prevent long-term or more serious damage. in some cases, going to a hand surgeon, a rheumatologist (doctor who treats arthritis and other joint, muscle, and bone diseases), or a neurologist (brain and nerve doctor) is needed. progress in reducing pain and improving movement in the finger may come faster with the help of an occupational therapist, people who help patients with injuries, illnesses, and disabilities build or restore their abilities to do everyday tasks in life.",0
"c-reactive protein (crp) is a phylogenetically highly conserved plasma protein, with homologs in vertebrates and many invertebrates, that participates in the systemic response to inflammation. its plasma concentration increases during inflammatory states, a characteristic that has long been employed for clinical purposes. crp is a pattern recognition molecule, binding to specific molecular configurations that are typically exposed during cell death or found on the surfaces of pathogens. its rapid increase in synthesis within hours after tissue injury or infection suggests that it contributes to host defense and that it is part of the innate immune response. recently, an association between minor crp elevation and future major cardiovascular events has been recognized, leading to the recommendation by the centers for disease control and the american heart association that patients at intermediate risk of coronary heart disease might benefit from measurement of crp. this review will largely focus on our current understanding of the structure of crp, its ligands, the effector molecules with which it interacts, and its apparent functions.",1
"objective: to evaluate the efficacy and safety of antiviral antibody therapies and blood products for the treatment of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). design: living systematic review and network meta-analysis, with pairwise meta-analysis for outcomes with insufficient data. data sources: who covid-19 database, a comprehensive multilingual source of global covid-19 literature, and six chinese databases (up to 21 july 2021). study selection: trials randomising people with suspected, probable, or confirmed covid-19 to antiviral antibody therapies, blood products, or standard care or placebo. paired reviewers determined eligibility of trials independently and in duplicate. methods: after duplicate data abstraction, we performed random effects bayesian meta-analysis, including network meta-analysis for outcomes with sufficient data. we assessed risk of bias using a modification of the cochrane risk of bias 2.0 tool. the certainty of the evidence was assessed using the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (grade) approach. we meta-analysed interventions with ≥100 patients randomised or ≥20 events per treatment arm. results: as of 21 july 2021, we identified 47 trials evaluating convalescent plasma (21 trials), intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) (5 trials), umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (5 trials), bamlanivimab (4 trials), casirivimab-imdevimab (4 trials), bamlanivimab-etesevimab (2 trials), control plasma (2 trials), peripheral blood non-haematopoietic enriched stem cells (2 trials), sotrovimab (1 trial), anti-sars-cov-2 ivig (1 trial), therapeutic plasma exchange (1 trial), xav-19 polyclonal antibody (1 trial), ct-p59 monoclonal antibody (1 trial) and inm005 polyclonal antibody (1 trial) for the treatment of covid-19. patients with non-severe disease randomised to antiviral monoclonal antibodies had lower risk of hospitalisation than those who received placebo: casirivimab-imdevimab (odds ratio (or) 0.29 (95% ci 0.17 to 0.47); risk difference (rd) -4.2%; moderate certainty), bamlanivimab (or 0.24 (0.06 to 0.86); rd -4.1%; low certainty), bamlanivimab-etesevimab (or 0.31 (0.11 to 0.81); rd -3.8%; low certainty), and sotrovimab (or 0.17 (0.04 to 0.57); rd -4.8%; low certainty). they did not have an important impact on any other outcome. there was no notable difference between monoclonal antibodies. no other intervention had any meaningful effect on any outcome in patients with non-severe covid-19. no intervention, including antiviral antibodies, had an important impact on any outcome in patients with severe or critical covid-19, except casirivimab-imdevimab, which may reduce mortality in patients who are seronegative. conclusion: in patients with non-severe covid-19, casirivimab-imdevimab probably reduces hospitalisation; bamlanivimab-etesevimab, bamlanivimab, and sotrovimab may reduce hospitalisation. convalescent plasma, ivig, and other antibody and cellular interventions may not confer any meaningful benefit.",1
"pain felt in the arm that is caused by damaged nerves or a weakening nervous sytem is called neuropathic pain and can greatly impact movement and quality of life, even after a patient has surgery. this article focuses on the new therapies that may improve pain care, including new treatment plans that are available. this article examines new and upcoming therapies, such as spinal cord simulation (electrical treatment to the spinal cord), peripheral nerve simulation (electrical treatment to the nerves), and dorsal root ganglion spinal cord stimulation (electrical treatment to spine cells). as these therapies evolve, so too will their placement within pain care plans.",0
"parkinson's disease (pd) (a brain-related disease affecting movement) is the second most frequent brain-related disease and is linked to increased full-body inflammation. while the immune-related effects of dopamine, a chemical messenger, remain unknown, dopamine imitators treat parkinson's disease partly via immune-related effects. this therapeutic effect supports analysis of immune scores of patients with parkinson's disease receiving certain treatments. in this work, patients with parkinson's were in a two-year study comparing how levodopa (a parkinson's medication) alone and a levodopa/pramipexole (dopamine imitator) combo affects immune cell subtypes. patients with parkinson's have reduced blood levels of important regulatory cell subtypes. levodopa alone may promote a pro-inflammatory response in patients with parkinson's, but with pramipexole, it promotes a helpful immune environment.",0
"vitamin b6 is one of the most important molecules in the cells of living organisms. vitamin b6 dissolves in water. it is widely present in many foods, including meat, fish, nuts, beans, grains, fruits, and vegetables. vitamin b6 is present in many multivitamins for adults and children. it is added to foods, power bars, and powders. there are several active chemicals (vitamers) which fall under the types of vitamin b6. these vitamin b6 vitamers include pyridoxine alcohol, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine. other vitamin b6 vitamers include pyridoxal 5'phosphate (plp) and pyridoxamine 5'phosphate (pmp). the main vitamers of vitamin b6 are different in meats and plants. the main vitamer in plants, pyridoxine, is less bioavailable (the amount of the substance taken up by the living organism). pyridoxine is the most common form of vitamin b6 found in multivitamins. vitamin b6 is involved in over 100 processes in the body including carbohydrate (sugar) metabolism, amino acid (protein) metabolism, , and lipid (fat) metabolism. vitamin b6 is also involved in the critical functioning of cells. it plays a significant role in many important chemical reactions in the body. pyridoxine has a role in the development of the brain, immune function, and hemoglobin formation by helping produce important chemicals the body uses. during pregnancy, fetal brain development requires adequate b6, and this continues throughout infancy. the amount of vitamin b6 doctors recommend is made according to age and life stage. the highest recommended daily allowance is during pregnancy and breastfeeding.",0
"there have been reports of myocarditis (heart muscle inflammation) following vaccination of covid-19 (a viral respiratory disease). we checked all hospitalized military people in the isareli defense forces during the covid-19 vaccination operation (12/28/2021-3/7/2021) for diagnosed myocarditis. we found 7 cases of myocarditis with symptoms starting in the first week after the second dose of covid-19 pfizer-biontech vaccine. one case of myocarditis identified 10 days after the second vaccine dose was not included. these 8 cases were all the events of myocarditis diagnosed in military people during this time period. all patients were young and generally healthy. all had mild disease with no consequences. the frequency of myocarditis in the week after a second vaccine dose was 5.07/100,000 people vaccinated. due to the nature of this report, no causality could be identified. clinicians should know about the possibility of myocarditis after pfizer-biontech vaccination. true frequency rates should be further investigated.",0
"traumatic injury to the peripheral nerves often results in persistent discomfort. substance p has been implicated as a mediator of pain, and depletion of this neurotransmitter has been shown to reduce pain. subjects suffering from traumatic dysesthesia of the trigeminal nerve were treated with capsaicin, a substance p depleter with significant long-term effects. this form of therapy may be used individually or in combination with other pharmacologic interventions in the treatment of traumatic trigeminal dysesthesia.",1
"this study evaluated the short- and long-term outcome of 42 patients with distal type aortic dissection. distal type aortic dissection is when an injury occurs to the inner layer of the aorta (main artery of the body), and blood flows between the layers of the aortic wall. twenty-eight patients underwent intensive medical therapy within two weeks after the onset of pain (acute dissection). the remaining 14 patients had chronic dissection, meaning they were treated after more than 2 weeks had passed since pain onset (started). the goals of treatment were to control blood pressure and to attain a negative (no detected) c-reactive protein test result. c-reactive protein is a type of protein found in the blood that increases during times of internal inflammation (redness and swelling from infection-fighting). hospital survival rate in the patients with acute dissection was 96% (27/28). there were several complications that occurred in-hospital during treatment. these complications include changes in mental status, kidney dysfunction, bradycardia (low heart rate), low blood pressure, and liver dysfunction. all of these complications were managed medically. three of these patients underwent surgical therapy in the chronic phase and were discharged without issue. fifteen of the 24 medically treated patients were discharged with negative c-reactive protein tests. spontaneous resolution of a dissection was demonstrated by x-rays in 8 cases. nearly all of the 24 medically treated patients had five-year survival rates. hospital survival rate in the patients with chronic dissection was 100%. strict control of blood pressure and evaluation of the dissection by x-rays and c-reactive protein tests provide acceptable outcomes of patients with acute distal dissection. these measures eliminate the need for emergency surgical intervention.",0
"wound pressure injuries have various names over the last few years. in the past, they were known as pressure ulvers, decubitus ulcers, or bed sores. now, they are known as ""pressure injuries"". pressure injuries are the breakdown of skin due to some forms of constant pressure. this can be from a bone coming in contact with an external surface like skin which leads to pressure injury. these wounds are the destriction of normal structure and function of skin and nearby tissue through various physical processes and causes. healing the wound is affected by factors like infection, other long-lasting diseases like diabetes, aging, nutrient shortages like vitamin c, medications like steroids, and low blood flow to the wound during periods of reduced oxygen and cold temperature. pressure ulcers come from extended, repeated pressure to the skin, nearby tissue, muscle, and bone. in pressure ulcers, the outside pressure is greater than blood vessel closing pressure.",0
"taking care of pain after knee replacement and and hip replacement is critical because it determines the how the patient recovers after surgery. ways of controlling pain that are not effective causes many additional problems after surgery and hinders successful recovery. in recent years, changing from opioids after knee and hip replacement to using multiple pain medicines at once has increasingly become an alternative. this is because of the many side effects of opioids. as a result, the use of non-opioid treatments and techniques such as peripheral nerve block, which directly numbs a large nerve, and local anesthetic have become more favorable. non-opioid treatments include acetaminophen (tylenol®), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2) inhibitors, gabapentinoids (such as lyrica or neurontin), and ketamine. this paper aims to summarize literature about the effectiveness of non-opioid treatments as part of a multi-pronged pain management plan after knee and hip replacement. we reviewed the scientific research on pain management to improve recovery following surgery. we did this to provide evidence-based information with respect to this pain management. the scientific papers we chose were taken from several electronic databases. we found 27 articles that met our standards for being included in this review. evidence in scientific literature shows that non-opioid pain treatments such as acetaminophen, nsaids, cox-2 inhibitors, gabapentinoids, ketamine, peripheral nerve blocks, and local anesthesia benefit patients after knee and hip replacement. however, further quality research trials are needed to be more sure. in conclusion, certain scientific research papers support the use of non-opioid treatments as part of a multi-pronged pain medication plan for effective pain management after knee and hip replacement.",0
"fever after heart surgery in children may be due to bacterial infection. the fever may also be caused by a noninfectious origin like systemic (full-body) inflammatory (infection-fighting) response syndrome (sirs). a marker to distinguish bacterial from nonbacterial fever in these conditions is important. the aim of this study was to evaluate, in the period after heart surgery, whether measurement of c-reactive protein (crp) and its change over time (crp velocity) can help detect bacterial infection. c-reactive protein is a type of protein found in the blood that increases during times of internal inflammation (redness and swelling from infection-fighting). children who underwent heart surgery with bypass (diverted blood flow) were tested for serum (blood) levels of crp at several points up to 5 days after surgery and/or when they had a fever. evidence was compared among three patient groups. the groups include: patients with fever with proven bacterial infection (fwi group), febrile (near-fever) patients without bacterial infection (fni group), and patients without fever (nf group). in all, 121 children were enrolled in the study, 31 in the fwi group, 42 in the fni group, and 48 patients in the nf group. ages ranged from 4 days to 17.8 years. there was no significant difference among the groups in mean crp level before surgery, 1 hour, and 18 hours after. a highly significant interaction was found in the change in crp over time by the fwi group compared with the fni group. mean crp velocity was significantly higher in the infectious group than in the fever-only group. specific crp velocity could positively predict bacterial infection with 95.2% specificity (accuracy). serial (consistent) measurements of crp/crp velocity after heart surgery in children may assist clinicians in differentiating (identifying) post-operation fever due to bacterial infection from fever due to noninfectious origin.",0
"increase plasma, or blood, homocysteine has been identified as a risk factor for hypertension (high blood pressure). homocysteine is a chemical your body produces to help make proteins. an identified genetic variation or gene type within the human population is a major determinant of hyperhomocysteinemia. hyperhomocysteinemia is a condition with excess homocysteine in the blood. the condition can result in endothelial dysfunction, or a heart disease where the blood vessels narrow instead of opening. angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors are a type of drug commonly used to treat high blood pressure. ace inhibitors appear to fix the endothelial (or blood vessel lining) dysfunction and allow blood vessels to open. the presence of the genetic variation in specific bodily locations that metabolize or digest drugs, such as enzymes and receptors, may influence how well a drug works. the goal of this study was to investigate if short-term blood pressure control by an ace inhibitor (benazepril) is effected by the identified genetic variation. a total of 444 hypertensive patients, aged 27 to 65 years, without any anti hypertensive therapy within 2 weeks were included. all patients were treated with benazepril with a single, daily dose of 10 mg for 15 consecutive days. blood pressures were measured prior to the study beginning (baseline) and on the 16th day of treatment. the unique genetic variation has three unique ""versions"" or genotypes, known as cc, ct, or tt. among the patients, the frequency of the genetic variation genotype cc, ct, and tt was 24.3%, 51.8%, and 23.9%, respectively. in a statistical analysis, several blood pressure measurements were higher in patients with the tt genotype than those with the ct or cc genotype. the authors further divided all patients into three groups based on where their diastolic blood pressure response (deltadbp) fell within a population scale. diastolic blood pressure is the lowest pressure when the heart is relaxed. patients with the highest deltadbp had the highest chance of having the tt genotype. however, baseline systolic blood pressure (when the heart is contracting) was not significantly associated with the unique genetic variation. this study suggests that the unique genetic variation altered baseline dbp by short-term treatment of ace inhibitor in hypertensive patients.",0
"low levels of blood phosphate, a high-energy molecule, or hypophosphatasia (hpp) is a from-birth disease caused by disease-causing variations in alpl (the gene for alkaline phosphatase or a protein that influences phosphate levels). low levels of alkaline phosphatase (alp) are a marker of hpp. little is known about the amount of hpp in scandinavia. the diverse symptoms make identification challenging. the study aimed to investigate the amount of alpl variants and physical and biochemical markers among adults with hormonal diagnoses and persistant low alp levels. we reviewed a database of alp measurements from 26,121 individuals to identify adults over 18 years with persistently low levels of alp. alpl gene testing, biological tests, and assessment of symptoms by a questionnaire among included patients were performed. among 24 patients, thirteen (54.2%) had a disease-causing variant in alpl and mild symptoms of hpp, of which musculoskeletal pain was the most frequent. a specific gene mutation that altered a protein segment was found in six subjects. a similar gene mutation and deletion of a gene segment was detected by genetic tests. tests showed no differences in alp, bone-specific alp, and pyridoxal phosphate (plp) or active vitamin b6 between patients with an alpl mutation and no genetic diseases. patients with an alpl mutation had much higher plp levels than healthy patients. we saw normal alp activity in some patients with mild hpp. we also saw slightly increased plp in two subjects with no gene diseases and four healthy patients. among 51 with persistent low alp levels, fifteen (29.4%) had anti-bone-breakdown treatment. two patients with unrecognized hpp were treated with anti-bone-breakdown drugs and did not show side effects from treatment. disease-causing mutations in alpl are common in patients with hormonal diagnoses and low alp. regarding detection, gene testing is needed to identify mild hpp due to diverse biochemical findings. anti-bone-breakdown treatment is frequent reason for low alp levels and treatment effects in adults with an alpl mutation and bone breakdown remain unclear and need further studies.",0
"pathogenic variants in the voltage-gated sodium channel gene (scn1a) are amongst the most common genetic causes of childhood epilepsies. there is considerable heterogeneity in both the types of causative variants and associated phenotypes; a recent expansion of the phenotypic spectrum of scn1a associated epilepsies now includes an early onset severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy with regression and a hyperkinetic movement disorder. herein, we report a female with a developmental and degenerative epileptic-dyskinetic encephalopathy, distinct and more severe than classic dravet syndrome. clinical diagnostics indicated a paternally inherited c.5053g>t; p. a1685s variant of uncertain significance in scn1a. whole-exome sequencing detected a second de novo mosaic (18%) c.2345g>a; p. t782 i likely pathogenic variant in scn1a (maternal allele). biophysical characterization of both mutant channels in a heterologous expression system identified gain-of-function effects in both, with a milder shift in fast inactivation of the p. a1685s channels; and a more severe persistent sodium current in the p. t782i. using computational models, we show that large persistent sodium currents induce hyper-excitability in individual cortical neurons, thus relating the severe phenotype to the empirically quantified sodium channel dysfunction. these findings further broaden the phenotypic spectrum of scn1a associated epilepsies and highlight the importance of testing for mosaicism in epileptic encephalopathies. detailed biophysical evaluation and computational modelling further highlight the role of gain-of-function variants in the pathophysiology of the most severe phenotypes associated with scn1a.",1
"sickle cell disease (scd) is a hematologic disorder with complex pathophysiology that includes chronic hemolysis, vaso-occlusion and inflammation. increased leukocyte-erythrocyte-endothelial interactions, due to upregulated expression of adhesion molecules and activated endothelium, are thought to play a primary role in initiation and progression of scd vaso-occlusive crisis and end-organ damage. several new pathophysiology-based therapeutic options for scd are being developed, chiefly targeting the inflammatory pathways. omega-3 fatty acids are polyunsaturated fatty acids that are known to have effects on diverse physiological processes. eicosapentaenoic acid (epa) and docosahexaenoic acid (dha) are the principal biologically active omega-3 fatty acids. the therapeutic effects of dha and epa on chronic inflammatory disorders and cardiovascular diseases are well recognized. the therapeutic effects of omega-3 fatty acids are attributed to their anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic eicosanoids, and the novel class of epa and dha derived lipid mediators: resolvins, protectins and maresins. blood cell membranes of patients with scd have abnormal fatty acids composition characterized by high ratio of pro-inflammatory arachidonic acid (aa) to anti-inflammatory dha and epa (high omega-6/omega-3 ratio). in addition, experimental and clinical studies provide evidence that treatment with dha does confer improvement in rheological properties of sickle rbc, inflammation and hemolysis. the clinical studies have shown improvements in voc rate, markers of inflammation, adhesion, and hemolysis. in toto, the results of studies on the therapeutic effects of omega-3 fatty acids in scd provide good body of evidence that omega-3 fatty acids could be a safe and effective treatment for scd.",1
"background: existing guidelines for repeat screening and treatment monitoring intervals regarding the use of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (dxa) scans are conflicting or lacking. the choosing wisely campaign recommends against repeating dxa scans within 2 years of initial screening. it is unclear how frequently physicians order repeat scans and what clinical factors contribute to their use. objective: to estimate cumulative incidence and predictors of repeat dxa for screening or treatment monitoring in a regional health system. design: retrospective longitudinal cohort study participants: a total of 5992 women aged 40-84 years who received initial dxa screening from 2006 to 2011 within a regional health system in sacramento, ca. main measures: two- and five-year cumulative incidence and hazard rations (hr) of repeat dxa by initial screening result (classified into three groups: low or high risk of progression to osteoporosis, or osteoporosis) and whether women were prescribed osteoporosis drugs after initial dxa. key results: among women not treated after initial dxa, 2-year cumulative incidence for low-risk, high-risk, and osteoporotic women was 8.0%, 13.8%, and 19.6%, respectively, increasing to 42.9%, 60.4%, and 57.4% by 5 years after initial screening. for treated women, median time to repeat dxa was over 3 years for all groups. relative to women with low-risk initial dxa, high-risk initial dxa significantly predicted repeat screening for untreated women [adjusted hr 1.67 (95% ci 1.40-2.00)] but not within the treated group [hr 1.09 (95% ci 0.91-1.30)]. conclusions: repeat dxa screening was common in women both at low and high risk of progression to osteoporosis, with a substantial proportion of women receiving repeat scans within 2 years of initial screening. conversely, only 60% of those at high-risk of progression to osteoporosis were re-screened within 5 years. interventions are needed to help clinicians make higher-value decisions regarding repeat use of dxa scans.",1
"at the start of the covid-19 pandemic, the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) designed, provides rapid test for detecting sars-cov-2 virus that causes the disease. the tests target different parts of the virus in case some parts of the virus change (mutate). parts of the test that target two specific parts of the virus may show false positive results -- identify people that do not have the virus as having it. we report the results of the cdc analysis of the false positive tests.. one part of the test that targeted one part of the virus was tainted with the material similar to that part when the test was produced, which caused false positive results. in another component of the test, some chemicals interacted with each other and caused false positive results. we conclude that the first batch of cdc rapid tests had problems with the design of the test and manufacturing. we found that the tests that were stored longer gave more false positive results. after our study, cdc improved quality control and procedures for checking accuracy of the tests.",0
"selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) are a recently developed type of drugs that works better as an antidepressant than a placebo, a type of substance that looks like a real pill but is not the real medicine. in clinical studies, all ssris showed that they have similar effectiveness as standard antidepressants that are older types of medicines. however, because of the small patient numbers in most studies that compare ssris with other antidepressants, no definite statements on how the effectiveness compares between the two types of drugs can be made. in these studies, it is simply possible to state that no significant differences based on data analysis are identified between ssris and the other type of antidepressants they are being compared to. importantly, differences in medical features and measures exist between the ssris, including differences in the time it takes for the amount of the drug in the body to be reduced to half its starting amount between fluoxetine (a type of antidepressant also called prozac) and other ssris. the findings from these existing studies may lead to other effects, including how two or more drugs react to one another which must be considered when patients are switched to treatment with an earlier antidepressant. the structure of clinical studies differs between fluvoxamine, which includes inpatients and outpatients, and other ssris which mainly take place in outpatient settings. fluvoxamine is associated with a high frequency of nausea (37%), although this may be the result from patients starting with a high dose that are often used in early trials instead of the standard dose. additionally, fluoxetine doses of 20mg may be enough to produce a satisfactory antidepressant response, and this ssri may be particularly useful in patients with chronic retarded depression, a depression disorder where symptoms include slow movement and toneless speech. more clinical data are needed before the effectiveness of sertraline and citalopram (two other ssris) relative to standard antidepressants can be clearly defined. early data suggests that ssris are effective in the treatment of panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd), eating (e.g. anorexia and bulimia) and personality disorders (e.g. anger, impulsiveness) and substance abuse (e.g. alcoholism). there are encouraging early results with fluvoxamine in the treatment of panic disorder and ocd, and with fluoxetine in the treatment of bulimia, personality disorders and alcohol abuse. patients are able to handle the side effects of ssris better than tricyclic antidepressants and, unlike the tricyclics, ssris are not associated with adverse effects of anticholinergic drugs that treat a number of health problems, sedation, damage to the heart, or weight gain. ssris are associated with a high count of nausea, particularly if high doses are used at the start of treatment. however, the frequency of nausea appears to decrease as treatment is continued.",0
"pressure injury (pi) is used to describe skin damage not caused by underlying diseases. pi affects strength of the skin. pi is produced by prolonged pressure or friction between a hard internal and external surface. treatment can be challenging when there is no solution with usual clinical care. the use of autologous platelet-rich plasma (aprp) gel is a possible therapeutic (medical) option for chronic pressure injuries. aprp uses injections of the patient's own platelets (blood cells) to increase healing rates. the case of a patient with chronic pi who has been treated with aprp is presented, achieving resolution (healing) of the lesion (wound).",0
"hypovolemic shock is a spectrum of reactions. in the early stages of hypovolemic shock, there is subtle pathophysiologic tissue insults. in the late stages of hypovolemic shock, there is multi-system organ dysfunction. hypovolemic shock is due to volume loss with blood vessels or blood vascular system. timely detection of shock is important. early interventions (treatments) decrease the chance of death. intervention delays can make the same interventions ineffective. detection can be limited by monitoring, parameters, and vital signs that are used in the intensive care unit (icu). most parameters barely change during the early stages. when the signs finally become abnormal, hypovolemic shock has already occurred. the compensatory reserve (cr) is a parameter. it is a new model for assessing body function. cr represents all of the mechanisms or ways the body compensates for internal conditions that dysregulate blood flow to vital organs during hypovolemia. when these mechanisms are overwhelmed, unstable blood pressure, and circulatory failure will follow. previous studies involving cr measurements have shown its use in detecting central blood volume loss before blood pressure parameters and vital signs changed. cr measurements have also been used in clinical studies involving patients with traumatic injuries or bleeding. the results from these clinical studies have been promising. cr measurements can be made at the bedside. they also provide a real-time assessment of blood flow. there is a need for rapid diagnostics when treating critically ill patients. cr measurements would complement parameters that are currently being used. the aim of this article is to introduce a conceptual framework where the cr represents a new approach to monitoring critically ill patients. within this framework, the authors present evidence to support the how the use of the cr could potentially improve the outcomes of icu patients. cr could improve alerting doctors to impending hypovolemic shock before its onset.",0
"background: perphenazine is an old phenothiazine antipsychotic with a potency similar to haloperidol. it has been used for many years and is popular in the northern european countries and japan. objectives: to examine the clinical effects and safety of perphenazine for those with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses. authors' conclusions: although perphenazine has been used in randomised trials for more than 50 years, incomplete reporting and the variety of comparators used make it impossible to draw clear conclusions. all data for the main outcomes in this review were of very low quality evidence. at best we can say that perphenazine showed similar effects and adverse events as several of the other antipsychotic drugs. since perphenazine is a relatively inexpensive and frequently used compound, further trials are justified to clarify the properties of this classical antipsychotic drug.",1
"this report presents a thorough review of the literature on common chronic pain conditions of the hand. it briefly presents common conditions with their biological background, diagnosis, and common options to treat and manage pain. the report also shows and compares the latest literature available for injection methods to treat these diagnoses and compares the available evidence. hand pain is a common condition occuring in 9.7% of men and 21.6% of women and can cause significant illness and disability. it is also costly to the individuals and the healthcare system, totaling in $4 billion dollars in 2003. injection therapy (a treatment that involves inserting a needle into the skin to deliver medicine and reduce pain) is an option when other non-surgical treatments fail. osteoarthritis (the wearing down of flexible tissue at the end of bones) is the most common chronic hand pain condition and affects about 16% of the population. there is disagreement on whether steroid injections are helpful to osteoarthritis. injections of hyaluronic acid (a natural lubricant that can relieve pain) appear to provide significant relief of pain and may increase movement. more studies of hyaluronic acid are required before deciding how well it works. similarly, steroid injection to reduce a ganglion cyst (a swelling or bump on the wrist joint) may have little benefit. injection therapy provides only short-term relief for carpal tunnel syndrome (pinched nerves in the wrist). while severe cases of hand pain may still require surgery, injection therapy may be an additional treatment step before surgery. similar treatments under us-guidance are effective for a condition called trigger finger where the finger gets locked in a bent position. when the cause of the pain is inflammation (the body's response to injury or infection often causing swelling, pain, or redness), corticosteroid or steroid injections provide significant pain relief and increased movement. corticosteroid injections do not, however, change the course of disease. other conditions such as gout (a type of arthritis that causes sudden pain or swelling, often in the big toe) and de-quervain tenosynovitis (pain in the tendons in the thumb) may get some benefit from corticosteroid injections. botox injections show encouraging results for raynaud's phenomenon (spasms caused by slow blood flow in the fingers and other extremities), but more studies are needed to determine safety and how well the injections work. chronic hand pain is a common and serious condition, can cause significant illness and disability, and interferes with independence and the activities of daily living. careful, non-invasive treatment remains the first line of treatment; however, when first-line treatments fail, steroid injections can usually provide benefit. in some cases, hyaluronic acid or botox may also be helpful. us-guidance is expanding in hand injections and provides safer, more effective injections. hand surgery remains the alternative for pain that is not responding to multiple treatments.",0
"some studies reported that genomic rna of sars-cov-2 can absorb a few host mirnas that regulate immune-related genes and then deprive their function. in this perspective, we conjecture that the absorption of the sars-cov-2 genome to host mirnas is not a coincidence, which may be an indispensable approach leading to viral survival and development in host. in our study, we collected five datasets of mirnas that were predicted to interact with the genome of sars-cov-2. the targets of these mirnas in the five groups were consistently enriched immune-related pathways and virus-infectious diseases. interestingly, the five datasets shared no one mirna but their targets shared 168 genes. the signaling pathway enrichment of 168 shared targets implied an unbalanced immune response that the most of interleukin signaling pathways and none of the interferon signaling pathways were significantly different. protein-protein interaction (ppi) network using the shared targets showed that ppi pairs, including il6-il6r, were related to the process of sars-cov-2 infection and pathogenesis. in addition, we found that sars-cov-2 absorption to host mirna could benefit two popular mutant strains for more infectivity and pathogenicity. conclusively, our results suggest that genomic rna absorption to host mirnas may be a vital approach by which sars-cov-2 disturbs the host immune system and infects host cells.",1
"autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is a common inherited kidney disorder that causes many cysts (growths) and is caused by changes in either the pkd1 or pkd2 genes. these genes are used to make the proteins polycystin-1 (pc1) and polycystin-2 (pc2), which regulate cells growth, cell movement, and interaction with other cells. in experiments with mice, when the pkd1 or pkd2 genes are less sensitive to other cells or make too many proteins, it may lead to cysts forming in the kidneys. this suggests that the number of pc1 and pc2 proteins needs to be stable within a brief time period to prevent the formation of cysts. in this study, researchers show that more cells and proteins from pc2 is a common feature of pkd1 changes, in part because of an increase in pkd2. however, this data also suggests that more effective protein folding, which is when a protein changes from a long chain to a functional shape, contributes to more levels of pc2 proteins. researchers show that the unfolded protein response is active in the kidneys without pkd1 and in pkd1 mutant (changed) cells. this effect is in addition to increases in the number of an endoplasmic reticulum protein, called grp94. the endoplasmic reticulum helps create and package proteins in cells. grp94 is found to physically interact with pc2, and reducing or slowing grp94 can lead to a decrease in pc2, suggesting that grp94 serves as its chaperone (plays a part in the folding of itself as a protein). also, grp94 is acetylated (modified structurally) and attaches to histone deacetylase 6 (hdac6), an enzyme that can control several important proteins and activate other proteins. slowing or stopping hdac6 decreases pc2 proteins, suggesting that hdac6 and grp94 work together to regulate pc2 levels. lastly, researchers show that the slowing of grp94 prevents the formation of cysts in laboratory tests. together, these data uncover a new hdac6-grp94-related point that likely participates in maintaining higher pc2 levels in pkd1 mutant cells.",0
"corona virus disease 2019, or covid-19 (a viral, respiratory illness), has become a global health issue. the goal of this study was to investigate the characteristics and outcomes of patients with covid-19 undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation (being helped to breathe by a machine). this study also aimed to identify factors associated with death. ninety four critically ill covid-19 patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation were included in this study. the studied variable of interest was death of the patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation and factors associated with death during intensive care unit stay. seventy nine out of 94 patients with covid-19 who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation didn't survive. ninety four percent of patients who had type 2 diabetes mellitus did not survive. this is compared to 72% of patients who didn't have type 2 diabetes mellitus. similarly, 48 out of 51 patients with a positive c-reactive protein value didn't survive in comparison to 31 out of 43 patients with a negative c-reactive protein. c-reactive protein is a type of protein found in the blood that increases during times of internal inflammation (redness and swelling from infection-fighting). the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and a positive c-reactive protein value were strongly associated with death. patients with a sequential organ failure assessment score, a ranking system to determine patient's organ function, of >8 at icu admission and peak d-dimer (protein fragment from dissolved blood clotting) level of ≥ 2 during icu stay didn't show significant association with death. these findings need further exploration in larger studies.",0
"herpes zoster is an acute, painful, herpes skin disease caused by varicella-zoster virus, which may cause viral meningitis. pregabalin has been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of pain in patients with herpes zoster. however, it has the side effects of neurotoxicity. we describe a 68-year-old female patient with herpes zoster, and she was treated with pregabalin. the patient presented with stuttering and frequent blepharospasm after 3 days of pregabalin treatment. pregabalin was discontinued, the symptoms of stuttering and frequent blepharospasm completely resolved without any special treatment after one week. in this case, the etiology of stuttering and frequent blepharospasm may be related to pregabalin. clinicians should be alert to the rare symptoms associated with the use of pregabalin.",1
"pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (plp), the bioactive form of vitamin b6, reportedly functions as a prosthetic group for >4% of classified enzymatic activities of the cell. it is therefore not surprising that alterations of vitamin b6 metabolism have been associated with multiple human diseases. as a striking example, mutations in the gene coding for antiquitin, an evolutionary old aldehyde dehydrogenase, result in pyridoxine-dependent seizures, owing to the accumulation of a metabolic intermediate that inactivates plp. in addition, plp is required for the catabolism of homocysteine by transsulfuration. hence, reduced circulating levels of b6 vitamers (including plp as well as its major precursor pyridoxine) are frequently paralleled by hyperhomocysteinemia, a condition that has been associated with an increased risk for multiple cardiovascular diseases. during the past 30 years, an intense wave of clinical investigation has attempted to dissect the putative links between vitamin b6 and cancer. thus, high circulating levels of vitamin b6, as such or as they reflected reduced amounts of circulating homocysteine, have been associated with improved disease outcome in patients bearing a wide range of hematological and solid neoplasms. more recently, the proficiency of vitamin b6 metabolism has been shown to modulate the adaptive response of tumor cells to a plethora of physical and chemical stress conditions. moreover, elevated levels of pyridoxal kinase (pdxk), the enzyme that converts pyridoxine and other vitamin b6 precursors into plp, have been shown to constitute a good, therapy-independent prognostic marker in patients affected by non-small cell lung carcinoma (nsclc). here, we will discuss the clinical relevance of vitamin b6 metabolism as a prognostic factor in cancer patients.",1
"autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is an inherited disease that causes many cysts (growths) usually in the kidneys, and is an important cause of end-stage kidney disease, for which there is no proven therapy. changes in the pkd1 gene (which creates an active kidney protein) are the main causes of this disease. the disease begins before birth and develops slowly, but it is not known whether the development and growth of cysts is an ongoing process during adult life. when the pkd1 gene is not active in mice within 13 days after birth, this results in many cysts in the kidneys within 3 weeks. however, inactivation (turning off) of pkd1 at day 14 or later results in cysts only after 5 months. researchers find that cell growth and development is not higher in samples of cysts than in comparison groups. however, the sudden change of pkd1 becoming inactive matched a stopping point of kidney growth that is not previously recognized and matched significant changes in how the gene functions. these findings suggest that the effects of inactivating the pkd1 gene are like a switch that signals the end of the end-stage kidney process. these studies show that pkd1 regulates changes in both developing kidneys and in adult kidneys, but the process of inactivation are defined by the stage of the organ's development. these results have important connections to the understanding of the disease and treatment approaches.",0
"how the pediatric or child patients with uncontrolled seizures are able to handle gabapentin (a nerve-related pain medication) and the processes of absorbing, distributing, using, and removing it is studied. in this study, 13 pediatric patients (less the 21 years old) with an average age of about 9 years with uncontrolled partial seizures are included. patients received gabapentin orally (by mouth) until doses are changed for each patient. blood samples are obtained just before the dose and over 8 hours after gabapentin is given during fasting, when all foods have been completely digested. blood concentrations of gabapentin is measured by blood tests. absorption, distribution, use, and removal of gabapentin in the body is analyzed. data from 9 patients are able to be used for analysis. the maximum concentration of the drug and the time it takes to reach maximum concentration are estimated. five patients experience moderate (4 patients) to severe (1 patient) aggressive behavior, and another gained weight on gabapentin. in conclusion, the data in this study suggests that how the body processes gabapentin can vary a lot among pediatric patients. in this study, patients with uncontrolled partial seizures were able to handle gabapentin well up to 6 months of therapy.",0
"rapid diagnostic tests can support other covid-q9 tests. rapid covid tests could be refrigerated or stored at room temperature under 30 degrees c (86 fahrenheit) we tested the accuracy of eleven rapid covid tests that were stored and used at different temperatures. the tests were stored for a short or long time at recommended temperatures or at either 2-4 degrees c (35-39 fahrenheit) or at 37 degrees c (98-99 fahrenheit). the tests were stored for a long-term at recommended temperatures and then at the high temperature (37c) for 10 minutes. for five out of 11 rapid tests, the accuracy was reduced ten-fold. after 3 weeks of storage at high temperature (37 c), eight of the 11 rapid tests were ten-fold less accurate. two out of six rapid tests had false positive results at low temperatures (2-4 degrees c). in summary, high temperatures reduced how well the test identified people who had covid-19 and low temperatures caused false positive results, showing people who did not have covid-19 as having it. the false negative test results allow people who have the virus transmit it to others. due to the false-positive results healthy people will be quarantined. storing the rapid tests at recommended temperatures is important during the pandemic.",0
"polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufas) are involved both in immune system monitoring or regulation and infection-fighting processes such as inflammation. in particular, within the pufas category, omega-3 (ω-3) may reduce inflammation, whereas omega-6 (ω-6) pufas are generally considered to have an inflammatory effect. recent evidence shows an imbalance in the ω-3:ω-6 ratio with an increased intake of ω-6, as a result of the shift towards a westernized diet. in important age groups such as infants, toddlers and young children, as well as pregnant and milk-giving women or fish allergic patients, ω-3 intake may be improper. this article aims to discuss the potential beneficial effects of pufas on child-related food allergy prevention and treatment, both at pre-birth and post-birth ages. data from preclinical studies with pufas supplementation show encouraging effects in reducing allergic response. medical study results are still conflicting about the best timing and amounts of supplementation and which individuals are most likely to benefit. therefore, it is still not possible to draw firm conclusions. regarding food-allergic children, it is still argued whether pufas could slow disease worsening or not, since consistent data are lacking. in conclusion, more data on the effects of ω-3 pufas supplementation alone or in combination with other nutrients are needed, both in the general and food allergic population.",0
"it has been suggested that screening all patients with diabetes diagnosed in later life for islet cell antibodies (ica) would help predict insulin dependence. we have surveyed the case notes of 55 patients (22 male; ages 37-88 years) who were found to be ica positive over a 9-year screening period to assess what contribution knowledge of ica status made to their management. forty-two patients had been put on insulin (half within 6 months of diagnosis and the rest after up to 6 years). of the 13 patients not on insulin, six were on diet alone and seven on oral hypoglycaemic agents after a median follow-up of 3 years. in 37 of the 42 patients, insulin treatment was started for clinical rather than immunological reasons (diabetic ketoacidosis, ketonuria, weight loss and/or severe symptoms). five patients were started on insulin because of ica status when there was no compelling reason on clinical grounds. knowledge that seven non-insulin-treated patients were ica positive made doctors reluctant to discharge them from clinic. the data suggest that routine ica estimation in this age group is unnecessary, as the decision to treat with insulin is best made on clinical grounds, and ica estimation can lead to unwarranted insulin treatment, or anxiety in patients and doctors who are aware of a positive result.",1
"over 10 weeks, we compared the anti-anxiety drug characteristics of the nonbenzodiazepine buspirone with the benzodiazepine lorazepam and sugar pills in 125 patients outside the hospital with generalized anxiety disorder based on the third edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders. after a 3- to 7-day period for the body to eliminate drugs in the system, patients were randomly given 5 mg buspirone 3 times a day (58 patients), 1 mg lorazepam 3 times a day (57 patients), or sugar pills (10 patients) for four weeks. the study also included a 2-week period when drug amounts were slowly decreased and a 4-week period when all patients took sugar pills to measure the consistency of improvements in anxiety symptoms. doctors estimated severity of anxiety symptoms at the beginning of the study and weekly using common questionnaires. patients taking lorazepam showed slightly greater improvement in symptoms than those taking buspirone on one of the questionnaires during the whole treatment (weeks 0-4) and when drug amounts were slowly decreased (weeks 5,6), though not significantly. after patients stopped taking the studied drugs, the 4-week period when patients took sugar pills showed patients who took buspirone showed consistent improvements in anxiety symptoms, while patients who took lorazepam showed worse symptoms at weeks 7-10. both buspirone and lorazepam worked better than sugar pills to improve anxiety symptoms during treatment and when drug amounts were slowly decreased. however, patients who took sugar pills showed improvements in anxiety symptoms when all patients took sugar pills, especially in one questionnaire, so differences between sugar pills and drugs became smaller at the end of the study.",0
"we studied effects on breathing and behavior of the benzodiazepine receptor (bzr; a molecule that receives signals for a cell) inverse agonist (a drug that binds to the same receptor as an agonist or stimulating molecule but causes an opposite response) ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-cce) alone and with the anxiety-reducing drugs of buspirone, lorazepam, flumazenil, and sr 95195 in monkeys. for the breathing-related studies, one group of monkeys breathed air or 5% co2 mixed in air; breaths per minute and amount of gas breathed were measured. for the behavior studies, another group of monkeys responded to food given every thirty seconds. the increased breathing effects of beta-cce in both air and 5% co2 were increased by previously taking the drugs of 5-hydroxytryptamine1a (5-ht1a), partial agonist buspirone (0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg) and a weak bzr inverse agonist, sr 95195 (10.0 mg/kg). taking buspirone (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) at the same time also increased effects of beta-cce under the food schedule. the bzr agonist lorazepam (3.0 mg/kg) and bzr antagonist flumazenil (1.0 mg/kg) reduced the effects of beta-cce on breaths per minute and amount of gas breathed especially under the 5% co2 condition. lorazepam (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) and flumazenil (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) reduced the effects of beta-cce on behavior responding on the food schedule. these latter results shows that effects on breathing and behavior of beta-cce in monkeys are at least due to effects at bzrs. the results also suggest that benzodiazepine and 5-ht1a sites activated at the same time cause an effect greater than their individual effects or that beta-cce and buspirone work similarly independent of the receptor where bzr inverse antagonists work.",0
"background: glucose-transporter-1 deficiency syndrome (glut1-ds), due to slc2a1 gene mutation, is characterized by early-onset seizures, which are often drug-resistant, developmental delay, and hypotonia. hemiplegic migraine (hm) is a rare form of migraine, defined by headache associated with transient hemiplegia, and can be caused by mutations in either cacna1a, atp1a2, or scn1a. paroxysmal movements, other transient neurological disorders, or hemiplegic events can occur in glut1-ds patients with a mild phenotype. case: we report on a girl with glut1-ds, due to slc2a1 mutation, with a mild phenotype. in early childhood, she developed epilepsy and mild cognitive impairment, balance disorders, and clumsiness. at the age of 9, the patient reported a first hemiplegic episode, which regressed spontaneously. over the next 3 years, two similar episodes occurred, accompanied by headache. therefore, in the hypothesis of hm, genetic testing was performed and cacna1a mutation was identified. the treatment with lamotrigine avoided the recurrence of hm episodes. discussion: to our knowledge, among the several cases of glut1-ds with hm symptoms described in the literature, genetic testing was only performed in two of them, which eventually proved to be negative. in all other cases, no other genes except for slc2a1 were examined. consequently, our patient would be the first description of glut1-ds with hm due to cacna1a mutation. we would emphasize the importance of performing specific genetic testing in patients with glut1-ds with symptoms evocative of hm, which may allow clinicians to use specific pharmacotherapy.",1
"pain and a loss of feeling in your thumb, index finger, middle finger, and part of your ring finger may be a sign of carpal tunnel syndrome. this syndrome and the pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness in your hand that result from it are caused by pressure on the median nerve as it travels through the carpal tunnel. guidelines published in the may 2019 issue of jospt make recommendations, based on best practices from the published literature, for evaluating, diagnosing, and treating carpal tunnel syndrome. for you as a patient, these guidelines outline the best rehabilitation treatment options based on the scientific research. ultimately, the best care is a combination of the leading science, the clinical expertise of your health care provider, and your input as the patient. these guidelines help inform the first step in that process. practical advice: physical therapists are well trained to assess and evaluate people with carpal tunnel syndrome. although some patients (anywhere from 28% to 62%) recover without treatment, others (from 32% to 58%) get worse. a key to nonsurgical treatment shown to help those with carpal tunnel syndrome is the use of a night brace; a night brace should hold your wrist in a neutral position and only be worn for short-term symptom relief. if you have mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome, stretching exercises and the night brace can help, as can manual therapy of your cervical spine and upper extremity performed by a therapist. education on the proper setup of your computer, especially the mouse, and how hard you strike the keyboard may also help control your symptoms of pain and loss of feeling. the literature review for these guidelines found that low-level laser therapy, thermal ultrasound, iontophoresis, and magnets provided no consistent benefit in treating carpal tunnel syndrome. if nonsurgical treatment does not help, you may need surgery. your physical therapist can help guide your recovery, decreasing your symptoms.",1
"islet cell antibodies (ica) continue to serve as the basis of the principal serological test for definition of active autoimmunity of beta-cells. its disadvantages are the need for human pancreatic tissue and difficulty in obtaining quantitative results. in the past decade biochemically-defined beta-cell toxins were described, leading to the development of sensitive and specific autoantibody assays, to predict insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm). we examined the value of combined biochemically-based serological assays, such as autoantibodies to insulin (iaa), glutamic acid decarboxylase (gada) and ica512 (ica512a) to replace the traditional ica assay. blood samples of 114 newly diagnosed iddm patients, aged 12 +/- 5 yrs (range 2 months-29 years) were tested for ica (indirect immunofluorescence), iaa, gada and ica512a (radiobinding assay). the latter 2 assays were performed using recombinant human [35s]-labeled antigen produced by in vitro transcription/translation. we found that fewer sera scored positive for ica and/or iaa (80.7%, 92/114) than for 1 or more of iaa, gad, or ica512 (88.6%, 101/114). we conclude that combined testing for iaa, gad and ica512 can replace the traditional ica/iaa test to predict iddm and is helpful in the differential diagnosis of insulin-dependent and noninsulin-dependent diabetes.",1
"time-restricted feeding (trf) is a form of intermittent fasting that involves having a longer daily fasting period. preliminary studies report that trf improves cardiometabolic health in rodents and humans. here, we performed the first study to determine how trf affects gene expression, circulating hormones, and diurnal patterns in cardiometabolic risk factors in humans. eleven overweight adults participated in a 4-day randomized crossover study where they ate between 8 am and 2 pm (early trf (etrf)) and between 8 am and 8 pm (control schedule). participants underwent continuous glucose monitoring, and blood was drawn to assess cardiometabolic risk factors, hormones, and gene expression in whole blood cells. relative to the control schedule, etrf decreased mean 24-hour glucose levels by 4 ± 1 mg/dl (p = 0.0003) and glycemic excursions by 12 ± 3 mg/dl (p = 0.001). in the morning before breakfast, etrf increased ketones, cholesterol, and the expression of the stress response and aging gene sirt1 and the autophagy gene lc3a (all p < 0.04), while in the evening, it tended to increase brain-derived neurotropic factor (bndf; p = 0.10) and also increased the expression of mtor (p = 0.007), a major nutrient-sensing protein that regulates cell growth. etrf also altered the diurnal patterns in cortisol and the expression of several circadian clock genes (p < 0.05). etrf improves 24-hour glucose levels, alters lipid metabolism and circadian clock gene expression, and may also increase autophagy and have anti-aging effects in humans.",1
"most adults with persistently low serum (blood) alkaline phosphatase values have a mutation in the alpl gene that encodes it. these adults also most likely have elevated alkaline phosphatase substrate values in serum and urine. alkaline phosphatase can indicate bone health. these adults may suffer from the adult form of hypophosphatasia, an inherited disorder that affects bone and tooth development. the aim of this study was to determine what proportion of adults with hypophosphatasemia (low serum alkaline phosphatase) also have alpl gene mutations or elevated alkaline phosphatase (alp) substrates. some adults with hypophosphatasemia share observable or radiographic (seen through x-ray) features with the adult form of hypophosphatasia (hpp). in hpp, alpl mutations cause persistent hypophosphatasemia and alp substrate (protein) accumulation in plasma (pyridoxal-5-phosphate (plp)) and urine (phosphoethanolamine (pea)). analyses of compounds from biological samples, including serum alp activity, bone-specific alp, plasma plp, and urine pea, were performed in adults with persistent hypophosphatasemia. analysis to determine alpl mutations were performed. variations of the gene alpl were classified as pathogenic (p), likely pathogenic (lp), variants of uncertain significance (vus), likely benign (lb), and benign (b). pathogenic mutations often make a person more susceptible to disease. benign mutations do not affect human health. p and lp variants were further grouped as ""positive alpl variants"" and lb and b grouped as ""negative alpl variants."" a total of 50 subjects completed all mutational and biochemical analyses. sixteen percent carried only negative alpl variants. of the remaining 42 subjects, 67% were heterozygous for a p variant, 19% for an lp variant, and 14% for a vus. biochemical results were associated with the inverse (opposite) relationship between alp and its substrates. subjects harboring positive alpl variants had lower alp and bsap and higher plp and pea values. approximately half of all subjects harboring positive alpl variants or alpl vus showed elevations in plasma plp. most also showed elevations in urine pea. adults with persistent hypophosphatasemia often have alpl mutations and have elevated alp substrates. these adults may fall within the spectrum of the adult form of hypophosphatasia. clinicians should note long-lasting hypophosphatasia in patients and be cautious in giving them anit-bone-breakdown drugs.",0
"background: depression is the single largest contributor to non-fatal health loss worldwide. second-generation antidepressants are the first-line option for pharmacological management of depression. optimising their use is crucial in reducing the burden of depression; however, debate about their dose dependency and their optimal target dose is ongoing. we have aimed to summarise the currently available best evidence to inform this clinical question. findings: 28 554 records were identified through our search (24 524 published and 4030 unpublished records). 561 published and 121 unpublished full-text records were assessed for eligibility, and 77 studies were included (19 364 participants; mean age 42·5 years, sd 11·0; 7156 [60·9%] of 11 749 reported were women). for ssris (99 treatment groups), the dose-efficacy curve showed a gradual increase up to doses between 20 mg and 40 mg fluoxetine equivalents, and a flat to decreasing trend through the higher licensed doses up to 80 mg fluoxetine equivalents. dropouts due to adverse effects increased steeply through the examined range. the relationship between the dose and dropouts for any reason indicated optimal acceptability for the ssris in the lower licensed range between 20 mg and 40 mg fluoxetine equivalents. venlafaxine (16 treatment groups) had an initially increasing dose-efficacy relationship up to around 75-150 mg, followed by a more modest increase, whereas for mirtazapine (11 treatment groups) efficacy increased up to a dose of about 30 mg and then decreased. both venlafaxine and mirtazapine showed optimal acceptability in the lower range of their licensed dose. these results were robust to several sensitivity analyses. interpretation: for the most commonly used second-generation antidepressants, the lower range of the licensed dose achieves the optimal balance between efficacy, tolerability, and acceptability in the acute treatment of major depression.",1
"may-thurner syndrome (mts) is a clinical condition characterized by the compression of the left iliac vein by the right iliac artery. this condition predisposes the patient to deep venous thrombosis (dvt). we present the case of a 30-year﻿-old female who arrived at the emergency department of our facility with progressive left leg swelling for four weeks, with low-risk probability for dvt. examination revealed left leg swelling with pitting edema extending up to the knee. her calf muscle was tender to palpation. dorsalis pedis, anterior tibial, and posterior tibial pulsations were fairly palpable due to the edema; however, the rest of her pulsations were appropriately felt. therefore, the provisional diagnosis of possible dvt was made, and further investigations were requested. we present this case intending to highlight the clinical presentation of may-thurner syndrome, its diagnosis, and treatment.",1
"a new coronavirus, covid-19 (a viral respiratory disease), is causing global death and lockdown burdens. a faulty immune system is a known risk factor for all viral influenza infections. certain foods improve the immune system's ability to prevent and control harmful viral infections, while physical activity improves such protective benefits. exercise improves general and antibody-related immune systems through immediate, temporary, and long-term changes to physical activity in a proportional relationship. prevention of non-infectious disease by certain foods can lead to protection against breathing-related viral infections and covid-19. certain foods and supplements in popular diets have immune-boosting molecules. foods with antiviral properties include fruits, vegetables, fermented foods, probiotics, olive oil, fish, nuts and seeds, herbs, roots, fungi, amino acids, and protein units. regular moderate exercise may reduce viral risk and improve sleep quality during quarantine, along with appropriate diet and foods. lifestyle and appropriate diet may offer further antiviral approaches for public health.",0
"the objective of this study was to perform population pharmacokinetic (pk) analysis of gabapentin in healthy korean subjects and to investigate the possible effect of genetic polymorphisms (1236c > t, 2677g > t/a, and 3435c > t) of abcb1 gene on pk parameters of gabapentin. data were collected from bioequivalence studies, in which 173 subjects orally received three different doses of gabapentin (300, 400, and 800 mg). only data from reference formulation were used. population pharmacokinetics (pks) of gabapentin was estimated using a nonlinear mixed-effects model (nonmem). gabapentin showed considerable inter-individual variability (from 5.2- to 8.7-fold) in pk parameters. serum concentration of gabapentin was well fitted by a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and lag time. an inhibitory emax model was applied to describe the effect of dose on bioavailability. the oral clearance was estimated to be 11.1 l/h. the volume of distribution was characterized as 81.0 l. the absorption rate constant was estimated at 0.860 h-1, and the lag time was predicted at 0.311 h. oral bioavailability was estimated to be 68.8% at dose of 300 mg, 62.7% at dose of 400 mg, and 47.1% at dose of 800 mg. the creatinine clearance significantly influenced on the oral clearance (p < 0.005) and abcb1 2677g > t/a genotypes significantly influenced on the absorption rate constant (p < 0.05) of gabapentin. however, abcb1 1236c > t and 3435c > t genotypes showed no significant effect on gabapentin pk parameters. the results of the present study indicate that the oral bioavailability of gabapentin is decreased when its dosage is increased. in addition, abcb1 2677g > t/a polymorphism can explain the substantial inter-individual variability in the absorption of gabapentin.",1
"evidence for a link between omega-6/omega-3 (n-6/n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acid (pufa) ratio and obesity in humans is inconsistent, likely due to differences in diet or metabolism of pufas between different groups. since chronic (long-lasting) inflammation (infection-fighting processes) is central to obesity and inflammatory pathways are regulated by pufas, the objective of this study was to examine whether gene types in the nfkb1 gene, a regulator of the inflammatory response, modify the link between the n-6/n-3 ratio (from diet and blood) and anthropometric traits (human body proportions) in a multiethnic/multiracial group of young adults. participants' (n = 898) diet pufa intake was measured using a food frequency questionnaire and blood pufa levels. nine gene mutations in nfkb1 were found. significant links were found between racial/ethnic groups and plasma n-6/n-3 ratio for body mass index (bmi) and waist circumference (wc). significant links were also found between racial/ethnic groups and three nfkb1 gene types for bmi and wc. significant link were found between two nfkb1 genotypes and blood n-6/n-3 ratio for bmi and wc. our findings suggest that anthropometric traits may be influenced by a special combination of n-6/n-3 ratio, racial/ethnic background, and nfkb1 gene ty[es.",0
"we reported removal of 242 objects that shouldn't be eaten which were stuck in the mouth, throat, esophagus, stomach, and upper part of the small intestine. thirty-nine objects that shouldn't be eaten were located in the throat, 181 in the esophagus, 19 in the stomach, and 3 in the small intestine. a flexible, telescoping tube with a camera was used 211 times (87.2%) to treat these objects, while the stiff, inflexible tube with a camera was used 12 times (5.0%). two hundred thirty-nine objects that shouldn't be eaten (98.8%) were successfully removed by putting a long, thin tube directly into the body. 0.4% of people had surgery to remove the object that shouldn't be eaten. nobody had an illness or died. twenty-five percent of the cases required people to be put in a sleep-like state with a breathing tube. coins in the esophagus are removed quickly if they are in the uppermost or mid esophagus, and within 12 hours if in the lower esophagus. if coins makes it to the stomach, they are usually passed easily. meat that gets stuck and blocks the esophagus is an urgent problem, and the blockage should be removed within hours. sharp and pointed objects can be hard to remove. practicing with a similar object is very important. button batteries in the esophagus are an emergency and should be removed immediately. if button batteries make it to the stomach, they are usually passed easily. a new kind of flexible, telescoping tube with a camera has become the tool to treat objects that shouldn't be eaten in most specialized medical centers and community hospitals.",0
"achondroplasia is a human bone growth impairment and is the most common form of inherited disproportionate short stature. achondroplasia tends to run in families, an affected parent has a 50% chance of passing it to their child. most people with achondroplasia have a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3) gene. characteristics of achodroplasia can be easily identified from physical exams and x-rays; they include disproportionate short stature with limb shortening, large head with prominence of forehead, underdevelopment of the middle part of the face and a short stubby hands with a separation betweem the middle and ring fingers. the majority of people with achondroplasia have normal intelligence, but many social and medical complications may compromise a full and productive life. some of them have serious health consequences related to hydrocephalus, craniocervical junction compression, or upper-airway obstruction. in this article, we discuss a number of treatments from surgical limb lengthening and growth hormone treatment, to future treatments, including therapy using a bone formation stimulator called c-type natriuretic peptide. the discussion is a comparative study of the complications and drawbacks of various experiments using numerous strategies.",0
"pallister-hall syndrome (phs) is a rare, single-gene, malformation syndrome that includes central polydactyly, hypothalamic hamartoma, bifid epiglottis, endocrine dysfunction, and other anomalies. the syndrome has variable clinical manifestations and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. we sought to determine whether psychiatric disorders and/or neuropsychological impairment were characteristic of phs. we prospectively conducted systematic neuropsychiatric evaluations with 19 phs subjects ranging in age from 7 to 75 years. the evaluation included detailed clinical interviews, clinician-rated and self-report instruments, and a battery of neuropsychological tests. seven of 14 adult phs subjects met diagnostic criteria for at least one dsm-iv axis i disorder. three additional subjects demonstrated developmental delays and/or neuropsychological deficits on formal neuropsychological testing. however, we found no characteristic psychiatric phenotype associated with phs, and the frequency of each of the diagnoses observed in these subjects was not different from that expected in this size sample. the overall frequency of psychiatric findings among all patients with phs cannot be compared to point prevalence estimates of psychiatric disease in the general population because of biased ascertainment. this limitation is inherent to the study of behavioral phenotypes in rare disorders. the general issue of psychiatric evaluation of rare genetic syndromes is discussed in light of this negative result.",1
"thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (tts) is a rare condition of blood clots in the veins and arteries and low blood platelet counts. tts has been reported in some people after they receive the astrazeneca and janssen/johnson & johnson vaccines. these vaccines provide immunity or resistance to the coronavirus, which causes covid-19 (a viral, respiratory disease). the objective of this study is to describe the clinical traits and outcomes of patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (cvst) (blood clot in the brain) after receiving the coronavirus vaccine among people with and without tts. this study uses data from patients who have cvst within 28 days of vaccination in march-june 2021. data came from 81 hospitals in 19 countries. existing data from patients with cvst between 2015 and 2018 are used to compare. clinical traits and death are described for adults with (1) cvst in the case of coronavirus vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, (2) cvst after coronavirus vaccination not meeting all parts for tts, and (3) cvst unrelated to the coronavirus vaccination. patients are classified as having tts (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome) if they have new thrombocytopenia (low blood platelets) without recent exposure to heparin, a medicine that prevents blood clots. clinical traits and deaths are the main measures in this study. of the 116 patients with cvst after being vaccinated, 78 (67.2%) have tts. of those, 76 people had been vaccinated with astrazeneca and 38 (32.8%) have no indication of tts. the comparison group included 207 patients with cvst before the covid-19 pandemic. a total of 63 out of 78 (81%) are female with an average age of 45, 30 out of of 38 (79%) are female with an average age of 55, and 145 of 207 (70.0%) patients are female and have an average age of 42 years. thromboembolism, which is a blood clot in the vein that has been dislodged from another part of the body, occurred in 25 out of 70 patients (36%) in the tts group, 2 out of 35 (6%) in the no tts group, and 10 out of 206 (4.9%) in the comparison group. deaths in the hospital are at 47% in the tts group, 5% in the no tts group, and 3.9% in the comparison group. the rate of deaths is 61% among patients with tts diagnosed before the condition got the attention of scientists and 42% among patients diagnosed later. in this study of patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, a detailed clinical description and high death rate is observed in patients who have thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome after vaccination.",0
"mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3) cause achondroplasia (ach), the most common form of dwarfism in humans and related chondrodysplasia syndromes that include hypochondroplasia (hch), severe achondroplasia with developmental delay and acanthosis nigricans (saddan), and thanatophoric dysplasia (td). the mutations are passed on nonsex chromosomes and causes the child that inherits the mutation from an affected parent to have a 50% chance to be affected. fgfr3 is expressed in cartilage cells and mature bone-forming cells where it functions to regulate bone growth. analysis of the mutations in fgfr3 revealed increased signaling through a combination of mechanisms that include stabilization of the receptor, enhanced binding of two receptors to each other, and enhanced enzyme activity of the receptor. paradoxically, increased fgfr3 signaling profoundly suppresses cell multiplication and maturation of growth plate cartilage cells resulting in decreased growth region size, reduced volume of the ends of long bones, and resulting decreased bone elongation. in this review, authors discuss the molecular mechanisms that regulate growth region cartilage cells, development of achondroplasia (ach), and therapeutic approaches that are being evaluated to improve bone growth in people with ach and related conditions.",0
"background: the biodegradable and biocompatible nature of pectin-based films is of particular interest in wound dressing applications, due to its non-toxicity, ph-sensitivity and gelling activity. an approach to improve the mechanical properties, the release profile of bioactive compounds as well as the performance in wet environments of pectin-based films is mixing with other biopolymers. objective: to prepare hydrocolloid films based on crosslinked pectin / starch blend loaded with bioactive extracts from leaves of g. tinctoria and u. molinae with controlled release of bioactive compounds and healing property. methods: the hydrocolloid films were characterized by ftir, sem, and tga-ftir techniques and their tensile properties, water uptake, and polyphenolic release profile in aqueous media were evaluated. the dermal anti inflammatory activity of the hydrocolloid films was assessed by the mouse ear inflammation test. the wound healing property of the loaded hydrocolloid films was explored in a rat model and in a clinical trial (sacrum pressure ulcer). results: the films showed an adequate water-uptake capacity between 100-160%. the release of active compounds from the hydrocolloid films followed the korsmeyer-peppas equation. the mechanical properties of hydrocolloid films were not affected by the plant extracts within the concentration range used. the incorporation of the bioactive extracts in the polysaccharide films inhibited the topical edematous response by about 50%. the topical application of the loaded hydrocolloid film on the pressure ulcer is completely closed after 17 days without showing any adverse reaction. conclusion: a novel hydrocolloid matrix was produced from crosslinked starch-pectin, which exhibited suitable chemical-physical properties to be used as a carrier of plant extracts with wound healing properties.",1
"background: no clinical trials have been specifically designed to compare medical treatments after surgery in parkinson's disease (pd). objective: study's objective was to compare the efficacy and safety of levodopa versus dopamine agonist monotherapy after deep brain stimulation (dbs) in pd. methods: thirty-five surgical candidates were randomly assigned to receive postoperative monotherapy with either levodopa or dopamine agonist in a randomized, single-blind study. all patients were reevaluated in short- (3 months), mid- (6 months), and long-term (2.5 years) follow-up after surgery. the primary outcome measure was the change in the non-motor symptoms scale (nmss) 3 months after surgery. secondary outcome measures were the percentage of patients maintaining monotherapy, change in motor symptoms, and specific non-motor symptoms (nms). analysis was performed primarily in the intention-to-treat population. results: randomization did not significantly affect the primary outcome (difference in nmss between treatment groups was 4.88 [95% confidence interval: -11.78-21.53, p = 0.566]). in short- and mid-term follow-up, monotherapy was safe and feasible in more than half of patients (60% in short- and 51.5% in mid-term follow-up), but it was more often possible for patients on levodopa. the ability to maintain dopamine agonist monotherapy was related to optimal contact location. in the long term, levodopa monotherapy was feasible only in a minority of patients (34.2%), whereas dopamine agonist monotherapy was not tolerated due to worsening of motor conditions or occurrence of impulse control disorders. conclusions: this trial provides evidence for simplifying pharmacological treatment after functional neurosurgery for pd. the reduction in dopamine receptor agonists should be attempted while monitoring for occurrence of nmss, such as apathy and sleep disturbances.",1
"vaccines are needed to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), which is a breathing-related viral illness. vaccines also protect those at high risk for issues. this randomized, controlled trial was performed at 99 centers across the united states. people at high risk for sars-cov-2, or covid-19, infection or its effects were randomly split in a 1:1 ratio to get two injections of the new vaccine or inactive placebo 28 days apart. the key measure was prevention of covid-19 illness with onset at least 14 days after the second injection in participants who had not been infected with sars-cov-2 prior. the trial had 30,420 volunteers randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the vaccine or inactive placebo (15,210 participants in each group). more than 96& of participants got both injections. 2.2% had evidence (antibody and/or molecular testing) of sars-cov-2 infection at the start. 185 participants in the inactive placebo group showed symptoms of covid-19., while11 participants in the vaccine group showed symptoms of covid-19. effectiveness was similar for key secondary analyses like analysis 14 days after the first dose, analysis with participants who had evidence of sars-cov-2 infection at the start, and analysis in participants 65 years or older. severe covid-19 occured in 30 participants, with one death. all 30 were in the inactive placebo group. moderate, temporary body reactions after vaccination occured more often in the vaccine group. serious, harmful events were rare, and the frequency was similar in the two groups. the vaccine showed 94.1% success at preventing covid-19, including severe disease. aside from temporary local and full-body reactions, no safety concerns were found.",0
"hypophosphatasia (hpp) is the inborn-error-of-metabolism that features low serum alkaline phosphatase (alp) activity (hypophosphatasemia) caused by loss-of-function mutation(s) of the gene that encodes the tissue-nonspecific isoenzyme of alp (tnsalp). autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant inheritance from among >300 tnsalp (alpl) mutations largely explains hpp's remarkably broad-ranging severity. tnsalp is a cell-surface homodimeric phosphohydrolase richly expressed in the skeleton, liver, kidney, and developing teeth. in hpp, tnsalp substrates accumulate extracellularly. among them is inorganic pyrophosphate (ppi), a potent inhibitor of mineralization. superabundance of extracellular ppi explains the hard tissue complications of hpp that feature premature loss of deciduous teeth and often rickets or osteomalacia as well as calcific arthropathies in some affected adults. in infants with severe hpp, blocked entry of minerals into the skeleton can cause hypercalcemia, and insufficient hydrolysis of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (plp), the major circulating form of vitamin b6, can cause pyridoxine-dependent seizures. elevated circulating plp is a sensitive and specific biochemical marker for hpp. also, the tnsalp substrate phosphoethanolamine (pea) is usually elevated in serum and urine in hpp, though less reliably for diagnosis. pathognomonic radiographic changes occur in pediatric hpp when the skeletal disease is severe. tnsalp mutation analysis is essential for recurrence risk assessment for hpp in future pregnancies and for prenatal diagnosis. hpp was the final rickets/osteomalacia to have a medical treatment. now, significant successes using asfotase alfa, a mineral-targeted recombinant tnsalp, are published concerning severely affected newborns, infants, and children. asfotase alfa was approved by regulatory agencies multinationally in 2015 typically for pediatric-onset hpp.",1
"objectives: we aimed to evaluate the impact of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mabs) treatment and to determine whether the mabs selective pressure could facilitate the proliferation of virus variants with spike protein mutations that might attenuate mab effectiveness. patients and methods: we therefore evaluated the impact of mabs on the nasopharyngeal (np) viral load and virus quasispecies of mab-treated patients using single molecule real time sequencing (pacific biosciences). the mabs used were: bamlanivimab alone (4 patients), bamlanivimab/etesevimab (23 patients), and casirivimab/imdevimab (5 patients). results: the np sars-cov-2 viral load of mab-treated patients decreased from 8.2 log10 copies/ml before administration to 4.3 log10 copies/ml 7 days after administration. five immunocompromised patients given bamlanivimab/etesevimab were found to have mabs activity-reducing spike mutations. two patients harbored sars-cov-2 variants with a q493r spike mutation 7 days after administration, as did a third patient 14 days after administration. the fourth patient harbored a variant with a q493k spike mutation 7 days post-treatment, and the fifth patient had a variant with a e484k spike mutation on day 21. the emergence of the spike mutation was accompanied by stabilization or rebound of the np viral load in 3/5 patients. conclusion: two-m ab therapy can drive the selection of resistant sars-cov-2 variants in immunocompromised patients. patients given mabs should be closely monitored and measures to limit virus spread reinforced.",1
"background: several medications commonly used to treat generalized anxiety disorder (gad) have been designated ""potentially inappropriate"" for use in patients aged > or =65 years because their risks may outweigh their potential benefits. the actual extent of use of these agents in clinical practice is unknown, however. methods: using a database with information from encounters with general practitioners (gp) in germany, we identified all patients, aged > or =65 years, with any gp office visits or dispensed prescriptions with a diagnosis of gad (icd-10 diagnosis code f41.1) between 10/1/2003 and 9/30/2004 (""gad patients""). among gad-related medications (including benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants [tcas], selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine, hydroxyzine, buspirone, pregabalin, and trifluoperazine), long-acting benzodiazepines, selected short-acting benzodiazepines at relatively high dosages, selected tcas, and hydroxyzine were designated ""potentially inappropriate"" for use in patients aged > or = 65 years, based on published criteria. results: a total of 975 elderly patients with gad were identified. mean age was 75 years, and 72% were women; 29% had diagnoses of comorbid depression. forty percent of study subjects received potentially inappropriate agents - most commonly, bromazepam (10% of all subjects), diazepam (9%), doxepin (7%), amitriptyline (5%), and lorazepam (5%). twenty-three percent of study subjects received long-acting benzodiazepines, 10% received short-acting benzodiazepines at relatively high doses, and 12% received tcas designated as potentially inappropriate. conclusion: gps in germany often prescribe medications that have been designated as potentially inappropriate to their elderly patients with gad - especially those with comorbid depressive disorders. further research is needed to ascertain whether there are specific subgoups of elderly patients with gad for whom the benefits of these medications outweigh their risks.",1
"many disorders (but mostly ones that are inherited) can be detected early by looking at dried blood spot samples of newborns across the population. phenylketonuria is an inherited disorder that can cause many issues with the brain. this disorder was the original example of how newborn screening can result in big improvements for health outcomes. after improved lab tests for hypothyroidism (a gland disorder) and cystic fibrosis (cf), an inherited disorder that causes lung infections, these diseases were added to newborn screening programs. current testing for cf usually relies on a combination of testing for genetic mutations that cause cf and testing for an enzyme that is reduced by cf. combined testing for about 25 genetic mutations relating to metabolism is a relatively recent addition to newborn screening. the addition of many disorders all at once has led to some reconsideration of the way newborn screening is usually done. this is because it is easy to include tests for disorders that are very rare or don’t have good treatments. newborn screening for many other disorders have been developed, but these aren’t applied as evenly or are consider to be still under development. this article focuses on newborn screening practices in australasia.",0
"even though there are newer drugs to prevent nausea and vomiting after surgery, current guidelines recommend the drug perphenazine. a multi-process way to prevent nausea and vomiting in high-risk patients requires using more than two drugs. we aimed to rate the success and safety of perphenazine in prevention of nausea and vomiting in adults and children. we looked at eleven studies published between 1965 and 1999 with a total of 2081 people. perphenazine 0.07 mg kg and 5 mg prevented nausea and vomiting in children and adults, respectively. we saw no big differences compared to newer drugs like ondansetron, dexamethasone or droperidol in studies with limited results. side effects were not well reported. short-term sedation occurred in three studies. studies show that perphenazine prevents nausea and vomiting in children and adults without serious side effects compared to sham treatment.",0
"there are reports of inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting and infection) of the heart muscle, also called myocarditis, after vaccination for covid-19 (a viral lung infection). researchers reviewed all hospitalized military personnel in the isareli defense forces during the period of the covid-19 vaccination (12/28/2021-3/7/2021) for confirmed cases of myocarditis. researchers found 7 cases of myocarditis with symptoms starting in the first week after the second dose of covid-19 pfizer-biontech vaccine. one case of myocarditis diagnosed 10 days after the second dose of the vaccine is not included. these 8 cases are all events of myocarditis diagnosed in military personnel during this time period. all patients are young and generally healthy. all have a mild case of the disease with no long-lasting effects. the number of myocarditis in the week following a second dose of the vaccine is 5.07 out of 100,000 people vaccinated. due to the nature of this report, no deaths can be established. medical providers should be aware of the possibility of myocarditis following pfizer vaccination. the true number of occurrence of myocarditis among people receiving the vaccine should be further investigated.",0
"physical therapy (pt) is often given to patients that had knee replacement after after leaving the hospital. pt after leaving the hospital is thought to be helpful, especially for patients with high risk of bad outcomes. these are patients with persistent pain that impairs function, even though the surgery seemed to go well. research teams have done 3 large-scale trials across different health care facilities, designed specifically for patients at risk of poor outcome following knee replacement. all 3 trials checked for poor outcome risk using different methods and looked at different ways for physical therapists to try to help. despite the variety of types of physical therapy and how they were given, all trials found no effects of the enhanced treatment compared with usual care. in all cases, usual care required a lower amount of physical therapy compared with the enhanced interventions. this article expresses our opinions on recent research. it compares and contrasts the 3 trials, guesses what could explain the findings that there were no effects, and proposes areas for future studies that could help the people at high risk of bad outcomes.",0
"the study's introduction states that the maturity onset diabetes of the young (mody) is a rare form of single-gene-causing diabetes. being clinically and genetically diverse, it is often misdiagnosed as type 1 or type 2 diabetes, leading to inappropriate therapy. mody is caused by a single gene mutation. thirteen genes, defining 13 types, have been identified to cause mody. a correct diagnosis is important for the right therapy, recovery, and genetic counselling. the study's material and methods include twenty-nine unrelated child patients clinically suspected of having mody diabetes analysed with dna sequencing. as the results in this study, we identified different types in mody genes in 22 out of 29 patients (75.9%). using two genetic tests termed ngs and mlpa, we detected both small mutation types and large gene deletions in patients. most patients had a different type in the gck gene (11/22), followed by hnf1b (5/22). the rest of the different types were found in the neurod1 and hnf1a genes. we identified one novel gene type in the gck gene. the applied genetic tests excluded the suspected diagnosis of mody in two patients and revealed subtypes in other genes possibly linked with the patient's clinical physical characteristics. in conclusion, in our group of mody patients, most gene types were found in the gck gene, followed by changes in hnf1b, neurod1, and hnf1a genes. the combined genetic tests presented a comprehensive way to analyze patients with possible mody diabetes and provided a successful diagnosis of mody subtypes.",0
"there are multiple available agents and modalities for controlling pain perioperatively during total joint arthroplasty to improve the patient experience, and their unique mechanisms and applications should be considered for use preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively, keeping in mind that each has differing efficacy and side-effect profiles. preoperative pain control or preemptive analgesia using anti-inflammatory drugs and opioid analgesics appears to be effective in reducing postoperative pain, although the recommended timing and type of agents are unclear. with regard to intraoperative anesthetic choice and pain control, spinal anesthesia appears to have fewer systemic risks than general anesthesia, and periarticular injections of local anesthetic agents, regardless of technique, and with or without the addition of sympathetic modulators, opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) or corticosteroids, have been shown to improve pain scores postoperatively and to overall carry a low risk profile. when considering postoperative pain control, there are several modalities including cryotherapy, peripheral nerve blockade, and parenteral and enteral medication options including acetaminophen, cyclooxygenase inhibitors, neuromodulators, tramadol, ketamine, and opioid patches, but there is no clearly preferred medication regimen and individual patient risk profiles must be considered when choosing appropriate pain management agents. multimodal pain management can decrease opioid usage, improve pain scores, increase patient satisfaction, and enhance early recovery. the ideal preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative pain medication regimen remains unclear, and an individualized approach to perioperative pain management is recommended. despite this, good results are demonstrated with the existing variations in pain management protocols in the literature. treatment of severe postoperative pain in a multimodal fashion carries the risk for serious side effects, including respiratory depression, mental status changes influencing safe gait mechanics, hypotension, renal and hepatic dysfunction, hematologic variations, gastrointestinal considerations including gastric ulcers, constipation or ileus, nausea or vomiting, infection at injection sites, and peripheral nerve injury with peripheral blockade.",1
"purpose of review: a summary of management and current research in achondroplasia (omim 100800). the most common nonlethal skeletal dysplasia, achondroplasia presents a distinct clinical picture evident at birth. substantial information is available concerning the natural history of this dwarfing disorder. diagnosis is made by clinical findings and radiographic features. characteristic features include short limbs, a relatively large head with frontal bossing and midface hypoplasia, trident hands, muscular hypotonia, and thoracolumbar kyphosis. children commonly have recurrent ear infections, delayed motor milestones, and eventually develop bowed legs and lumbar lordosis. people with achondroplasia are generally of normal intelligence. recent findings: the genetic cause of achondroplasia was discovered in 1994. subsequent research efforts are designed to better characterize the underlying possible biochemical mechanisms responsible for the clinical findings of achondroplasia as well as to develop possible new therapies and/or improve intervention. summary: establishing a diagnosis of achondroplasia allows families and clinicians to provide anticipatory care for affected children. although the primary features of achondroplasia affect the skeleton, a multidisciplinary approach to care for children with achondroplasia helps families and clinicians understand the clinical findings and the natural history of achondroplasia in order to improve the outcome for each patient.",1
"fluoxetine (flx) has a unique pharmacokinetic profile. its major metabolite, norfluoxetine (nflx), possesses flx's antidepressant efficacy and a half-life of 7 to 15 days, suggesting the possibility of nonstandard dosing strategies. this study examined the tolerability of a weekly dose and its equivalence to daily dosing of flx for the continuation phase of treatment for major depressive disorder (mdd). one hundred fourteen subjects initially received open-label treatment with 20 mg of flx daily for 7 weeks. subsequently, 70 subjects with a score on the hamilton rating scale for depression (ham-d) of 12 or less were randomly assigned in a double-blind design to one of three treatment groups: 20 mg flx daily (n = 21), 60 mg flx weekly (n = 28), or placebo (n = 21) and were followed for 7 weeks. ham-d scores and blood levels of flx and nflx were analyzed using a repeated-measures analysis of variance. during the double-blind phase, blood levels for both flx and nflx differed across the treatment groups, yet no statistically significant difference in ham-d scores was observed. there was no difference in the dropout rate across the groups. subjects could not correctly identify the treatment group into which they were assigned. weekly dosing of flx seems to be well tolerated and possibly as effective as daily dosing in maintaining the therapeutic response in subjects with mdd.",1
"this review focused on the use of plant based foods for enhancing the immunity of all aged groups against covid-19. in humans, coronaviruses are included in the spectrum of viruses that cause the common cold and, recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars). emerging infectious diseases, such as sars present a major threat to public health. the novel coronavirus has spread rapidly to multiple countries and has been declared a pandemic by the world health organization. covid-19 is usually caused a virus to which most probably the people with low immunity response are being effected. plant based foods increased the intestinal beneficial bacteria which are helpful and makes up of 85% of the immune system. by the use of plenty of water, minerals like magnesium and zinc, micronutrients, herbs, food rich in vitamins c, d & e and better life style one can promote the health and can overcome this infection. various studies investigated that a powerful antioxidant glutathione and a bioflavonoid quercetin may prevent various infections including covid-19. in conclusion, the plant based foods play a vital role to enhance the immunity of people to control of covid-19.",1
"we rated the effectiveness and effects of gradual or fast withdrawal of clobazam (a benzodiazepine which helps treat anxiety) in treating generalized anxiety disorder compared to lorazepam and buspirone, other anxiety-treating drugs. 128 patients with generalized anxiety disorder based on the third edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders participated in the study and received treatment for three weeks. we divided patients into 4 groups: 32 patients taking clobazam, quickly withdrawn and replaced with sugar pills; group 2: 29 patients taking clobazam, gradually withdrawn over 3 weeks and replaced with sugar pills; group 3: 33 patients taking lorazepam, gradually withdrawn over 3 weeks and replaced with sugar pills; group 4: 34 patients taking buspirone, quickly withdrawn and replaced with sugar pills. the amount taken was increased gradually during the first week of treatment. at the end of this time, the patients took either 30 mg clobazam, 30 mg buspirone, or 3 mg lorazepam every day. after the first week, a common questionnaire measuring severity of anxiety symptoms showed improvement in people taking clobazam and lorazepam but not in people taking buspirone. all the drugs worked equally well after three weeks of treatment. the anti-anxiety effects lasted after withdrawal of the studied drug in the 4 groups, with no signs of anxiety symptoms returning or withdrawal symptoms. we found no relevant difference in safety between the 4 groups. drowsiness in patients taking clobazam and lorazepam and nausea and headache in patients taking buspirone were the main side effects reported. we conclude that clobazam, like lorazepam, improved anxiety more quickly than buspirone; after 3 weeks of treatment, effectiveness of the 3 drugs was similar and lasted after patients stopped taking the drugs.",0
"in december 2020, the food and drug administration (fda) issued emergency use authorizations (euas) for pfizer-biontech and moderna covid-19 vaccines, and in february 2021, fda issued an eua for the janssen (johnson & johnson) covid-19 vaccine. after each eua, the advisory committee on immunization practices (acip) issued interim recommendations for vaccine use; currently pfizer-biontech is authorized and recommended for persons aged ≥12 years and moderna and janssen for persons aged ≥18 years (1-3). both pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines, administered as 2-dose series, are mrna-based covid-19 vaccines, whereas the janssen covid-19 vaccine, administered as a single dose, is a recombinant replication-incompetent adenovirus-vector vaccine. as of july 22, 2021, 187 million persons in the united states had received at least 1 dose of covid-19 vaccine (4); close monitoring of safety surveillance has demonstrated that serious adverse events after covid-19 vaccination are rare (5,6). three medical conditions have been reported in temporal association with receipt of covid-19 vaccines. two of these (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome [tts], a rare syndrome characterized by venous or arterial thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, and guillain-barré syndrome [gbs], a rare autoimmune neurologic disorder characterized by ascending weakness and paralysis) have been reported after janssen covid-19 vaccination. one (myocarditis, cardiac inflammation) has been reported after pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccination or moderna covid-19 vaccination, particularly after the second dose; these were reviewed together and will hereafter be referred to as mrna covid-19 vaccination. acip has met three times to review the data associated with these reports of serious adverse events and has comprehensively assessed the benefits and risks associated with receipt of these vaccines. during the most recent meeting in july 2021, acip determined that, overall, the benefits of covid-19 vaccination in preventing covid-19 morbidity and mortality outweigh the risks for these rare serious adverse events in adults aged ≥18 years; this balance of benefits and risks varied by age and sex. acip continues to recommend covid-19 vaccination in all persons aged ≥12 years. cdc and fda continue to closely monitor reports of serious adverse events and will present any additional data to acip for consideration. information regarding risks and how they vary by age and sex and type of vaccine should be disseminated to providers, vaccine recipients, and the public.",1
"hiatal hernias, in which the stomach bulges into the chest, are common clinical findings. hiatal hernias can lead to unwanted symptoms, trapped or twisted intestines, and reduced blood flow to certain body parts. this review examines the latest works on identifying and managing these stomach bulges into the chest. no-symptom stomach or organ bulges into the chest acquire symptoms and need repair at a rate of 1% per year. watchful waiting is appropriate for these no-symptom organ bulges into the chest. hiatal hernias with unwanted symptoms and stomach acid reflux into throat need special, anti-reflux surgery. key surgery steps include: cutting out the bulging sac, 3 cm of the lower esophagus, closing the site with mesh, and an anti-acid reflux operation. repairs not possible with common surgery may need stitching and opening of the stomach instead. hiatal hernias are common. when organ bulges lead to awful symptoms or stomach acid reflux, surgery is needed. a small incision surgery is safe and has improved outcomes.",0
"this research studies factors that may predict painful blood vessel blockages (voc-vaso-occlusive crises) in sickle cell disease (scd) patients in cameroon. researchers found out facts about the population, signs and symptoms, and their blood. genetic testing was done for 40 mutations in 17 pain-relating genes, three fetal hemoglobin areas on genes, two genes related to kidney disease, and the hba1/hba2 (alpha-globin)genes. models were performed to predict outcomes. a total of 436 patients that had not taken hydroxycarbamide or opioids were studied. half the patients were younger than 16 years old and half were older. female sex, body mass index, hb/hbf (hemoglobin/fetal hemoglobin), blood transfusions, higher white blood cell count, and consultations or hospitalisations are significantly linked with blood vessel blockages (vaso-occlusive crises (voc)). three pain-related gene variants (mutations) are linked to voc. five pain-related gene variants are linked to the amount of hospitalisations/consultations. these gene variants are specific mutations in comt, faah, oprm1, adrb2, and ugt2b7 genes. a specific mutation in the hba1/hba2 genes are linked to increased voc. specific gene variants on the bcl11a gene and the hbs1l-myb gene increase hbf and are linked to decreased hospitalisation. the apol1 g1/g2 genes (related to kidney disease) are linked to increased hospitalisation. this first study from an african country has provided evidence supporting the possible development of a genetic risk model for pain in sickle cell disease.",0
"this study is conducted to evaluate the effect of age, age-related changes in renal or kidney function, and gender on the single-dose pharmacokinetics (or drug activity) of orally (by mouth) administered gabapentin (gbp). the body's process of absorbing, distributing, using, and removing a single oral dose (by mouth) of gabapentin is studied in 36 healthy patients (18 men and 18 women) aged 20-78 years. blood and urine samples are continuously collected for 48 hours after the dose of gabapentin. the amount of gabapentin in plasma (or blood) and urine samples are measured, and other tests are done to understand how the body processes gabapentin. all patients are able to handle the drug well, with only mild symptoms reported. no change in the highest (peak) gabapentin amount, the time at which the highest gabapentin amount occurred, or apparent volume of distribution (the ability of various drugs to distribute through the body fluids) with age was noted. a major decline in clearance of gabapentin that is taken orally, the rate of removal from the body, and clearing it through the kidneys with increasing age is observed. the decline of oral clearance and rate of removal of gabapentin from the body can be explained by the decline in clearance by the kidneys. the only measure that is very different between genders is the highest (peak) gabapentin amount, which is approximately 25% higher for women than for men, consistent with gender differences in body size. in conclusion, the results of this study suggest that changes in kidney function are responsible for age-related changes in how the body processes gabapentin. giving a lesser dose of gabapentin may be required in elderly patients who have weaker kidney functions. how the body processes gabapentin is similar in men and women.",0
"tardive dyskinesia (td) is a common movement disorder in many people taking antipsychotics. studying treatment of td can be difficult, because the symptoms can change based on changes to how much or what kind of antipsychotics are used, and by the range of normal disease progression. many drugs made to treat td have been studied with different levels of success. most recently, the vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (vmat2) inhibitors, drugs that reduce dopamine (a chemical messenger released when your brain is expecting a reward), valbenazine and deutetrabenazine, were studied in td in large human trials, and were shown to work in this group. in this article, we will look at different treatments of td, including changing the drug causing td, vmat2 inhibitors, other non-vmat2-inhibiting drugs, and non-drug options.",0
"checking all people with diabetes detected later in life for islet cell antibodies (ica; proteins made against insulin-producing cells) may help predict dependence on insulin. we read doctor notes of 55 patients (22 male; ages 37-88 years) who were found to be ica positive (with ica) over a 9-year checking period to determine what role ica status made to their treatment. forty-two patients had been put on insulin (half within 6 months of diagnosis and half after up to 6 years). of the 13 patients not on insulin, six were on health diet and seven were on oral (by mouth) medication after about 3 years. in 37 of the 42 patients, insulin treatment was started due to observable symptoms (high levels of blood acids called ketones, high levels of ketones in urine, weight loss, and/or serious symptoms) rather than issues related to the body's defense system. five patients were started on insulin due to ica status where no observable symptoms existed. doctors were hesitant to send home 7 non-insulin-treated, ica-positive patients. the data suggest that regularly estimating ica in this age group is not needed, as the decision to treat with insulin should be based on observable symptoms, and icf estimation can cause unneeded insulin treatment, or anxiety in patients and doctors due to a positive result.",0
"the coronavirus are a wide group of viruses among that the sars-cov-2 is included (family coronaviridae, subfamily coronavirinae, genus betacoronavirus and subgenus sarbecovirus). its main structural proteins are the membrane (m), the envelope (e), the nucleocapsid (n) and spike (s). the immune response to sars-cov-2 involves the cellular and the humoral sides, with neutralizing antibodies fundamentally directed against the s antigen. although the seroprevalence data are frequently assumed as protection markers, no necessarily they are. in spain, it is estimated that, to assure the herd immunity, at least four-fifths of the population should be immunoprotected. due the high fatality rate of covid-19, the acquisition of the protection only by the natural infection it not assumable and other measures as the mass immunization are required. currently, there are several vaccine prototypes (including life virus, viral vectors, peptides and proteins and nucleic acid) in different phase of clinical evaluation. foreseeably, some of these news vaccines would be soon commercially available. in this text, aspects related to these issues are reviewed.",1
"lactobacilli is a type of probiotic (good bacteria) found in the digestive system and can be consumed to improve gut health. when lactobacilli is given through a spray in the nose in mice, it can help regulate the natural immune or infection-fighting response in the lungs and fight lung infections. lactobacilli bacteria that comes from plants is tested to see how it impacts the immune systems of the cells in the lungs and if it can reduce the ability of the coronavirus (a virus causing covid-19 - a lung infection) from entering the cells. two types of lactobacilli bacteria that come from plants, called mpl16 and crl506, are tested to understand their influence on the production of cells that are part of the immune response and the development of proteins. additionally, these two types of bacteria increase the resistance of certain cells in the lungs called calu-3 against the coronavirus. the lactobacilli mpl16 bacteria started these beneficial effects more efficiently than the crl1506. no lactobacilli bacteria from the tested plants can change the resistance of calu-3 cells to coronavirus infection. as of now, the possible benefits of good bacteria (probiotics) on the immune system against the coronavirus and covid-19 have been pulled from studies of other viruses. it is believed that this study is the first to show the ability of lactobacilli to positively influence the replication of the new coronavirus. further studies and experiments with animals with the coronavirus are necessary to identify specific types of lactobacilli from plants for the prevention or treatment of covid-19.",0
"buspirone hydrochloride (hcl)1 is a new anxiety-reducing drug with a unique chemical structure. the mechanism of action for this anxiety-reducing drug is unknown. unlike other anxiety-reducing drugs like benzodiazepines, buspirone lacks hypnotic, seizure-reducing, and muscle relaxant traits. thus, the drug treats anxiety specifically. as shown in a few studies, 15 to 30 mg/day of buspirone improves anxiety symptoms similarly to other common anxiety-reducing drugs. like anxiety-reducing diazepam, buspirone helps patients with mixed anxiety/depression. however, the number of patients studied is small. in many studies, the anxiety-reducing effect manifests after 1 to 2 weeks, so motivating patients to comply may be needed. sedation is less frequent with buspirone than with other anxiety-reducing drugs. other side effects are minor and infrequent. in healthy volunteers, buspirone does not affect movement or thought. it also appears to not strengthen the effects of alcohol. buspirone may have limited potential for abuse and dependence. thus, while more use will better define its effects, buspirone rarely leads to sedation and is a useful a treatment option for anxiety. buspirone may become the preferred treatment for patients who demand daytime alertness.",0
"polycystic kidney disease (pkd) is a genetic disorder that causes abnormal growth and formation of kidney epithelial cells, which are important cells for kidney function, and growth of many cysts (swellings) filled with fluid within the kidneys. previous studies show that, when compared to epithelial cells, there is an increase in cell signaling called notch signaling that allows direct cell to cell communication. this notch signaling contributes to the growth and division of cystic cells (cells that cluster together and form a cyst). quinomycin a is a type of antibiotic (bacteria-fighting medication), has previously shown to target the notch signaling process, and slow or stop tumor growth in cancer. in this study, researchers show that quinomycin a decreases cell development and cyst growth of cyst epithelial cells taken from humans with inherited pkd and analyzed in a lab. treatment with quinomycin a reduces kidney weight to body weight ratio and decreases the size of the kidney cysts and the development of fibrous tissues that can impact the lungs. also, there is a reduced number of proteins that develop from the notch pathway. quinomycin a treatments also normalized the length of cilia, hairlike vibrating structures found in large numbers on the surface of cyst epithelial cells. this is the first study to demonstrate that quinomycin a effectively slows or stops polycystic kidney disease (pkd) progression and suggests that quinomycin a is a possible therapy for pkd patients.",0
"""inborn errors of metabolism,"" or inherited disorders in which the body cannot properly turn food into energy, first seen by a doctor 100 years ago, were important support for the idea that people have different chemical and biological makeups. phenylketonuria (pku), a disorder inherited from both parents, was discovered in 1934 by a doctor. it causes intellectual disability from damage to the brain caused by too much phenylalanine in the blood. observable pku symptoms vary due to nurture, where normal foods contain l-phenylalanine, and in nature, where many changes happen in the gene for phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) that controls the l-phenylalanine hydroxylase protein, which helps convert phenylalanine into energy. the pah protein converts phenylalanine, one molecule, to tyrosine, another molecule. through checks for conditions that affect newborns, pku is one of the first inherited diseases to be prevented in the community with successful treatments. successful treatments caused a change in thinking about inherited disease. the history of pku provides a lot of information including a way to grasp how complicated the disease is and where observable symptoms depend on both gene location and makeup; what the human pah gene tells us about the genetics and evolution of humans; and how our understanding of pku is helped by a database on where gene changes happen. observable pku symptoms have no ""simple"" or single explanation; every patient is different and will be treated at an individual level. pku knowledge shows that genes play a role in both disease and health.",0
"diagnostic criteria for diabetes in children have not been established with nearly the rigor as that employed in adults. recently revised american diabetes association (ada) criteria allowed utilization of hemoglobin a(1c) (hba1c) ≥ 6.5 % for diagnosis of diabetes. a recent series of pediatric studies appear to show that hba1c has lower sensitivity than fasting plasma glucose (fpg) or oral glucose tolerance test (ogtt). however, fpg and ogtt have themselves never been validated in children. studies to validate diagnostic thresholds in children appear unlikely to take place. thus, accepting the major ada diagnostic criteria appears to be the best course of action for the pediatric community. one area in which correlation studies between hba1c and fpg or ogtt might shed light is in the definition of criteria for intervention in 'pre-diabetes,' as the diabetes prevention program trial did not use hba1c. however, such treatment, and the exact diagnostic thresholds at which it should be initiated in children, remains unproven.",1
"introduction: treatment of decubitus ulcers is a grave medical problem. in many cases, it is difficult to cure a pressure ulcer, especially when it is deep and extensive, and prognosis is usually unfavourable. treatment of decubitus ulcers requires new specialist dressings, which play an important role in the healing process. aim: to evaluate therapeutic efficacy of active specialist medical dressings in the treatment of decubitus. material and methods: research involved 40 patients - 18 (45%) women and 22 (55%) men, suffering from decubitus ulcers of different size and depth, localized in the sacral region, lasting from 1.5 to 30 months. patients were randomly assigned to two research groups (20 people each), were treated for 4 weeks with 2 different specialist dressings. atrauman ag, which contains silver ions, was used in the first group, while paraffin gauze of bactigras type was used in the second group. an assessment of pressure ulcers' healing progress was done with a planimetric method, which evaluates the wound surface area. results: the analysis results showed a significant statistical decrease in an average decubitus ulcer surface area in both research groups: in the first group by 60.2% (p = 0.001), and in the second group by 32.95% (p < 0.001), which speaks in favour of dressings with silver ions as having better therapeutic effectiveness. conclusions: using specialist dressings results in a significant decrease in the decubitus ulcer surface area, depending on the type of dressing and active substances contained within, while silver ions support curative effectiveness of the dressing used.",1
"autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (adpkd) is an inherited condition that causes multiple cysts (growths), usually in the liver, and is the leading genetic cause of kidney failure. researchers have shown that slowing or stopping the gene mir-17~92 that is involved in cell growth and development is a possible new therapy to help people with adpkd. however, mir-17~92 is a cluster of many cysts that influence micrornas (mirnas), which are rna molecules that regulate genes and how genes make proteins. how these mirna families contribute to the development and progression of adpkd is unknown. in this study, researchers work to identify drugs that will focus on the mirna. researchers designed drugs called anti-mirs to individually stop or slow different types of mirnas from functioning in a genetic model. treatment with anti-mirs against the mir-17 family reduced cyst development, kidney-weight-to-body-weight ratio and size of the cyst. in contrast, treatment with anti-mirs against the mir-18, 19, or 25 families did not affect cyst growth. the anti-mir-17 treatment is associated with extending the lifespan of energy from certain cells, stopping or slowing cell growth often found in tumors, and stopping or slowing inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) associated with cysts. these results argue against functional cooperation between the various mirna (mir-17~92) cluster families in promoting cyst growth, and instead point to the mir-17 family as the main therapeutic target for adpkd.",0
"we look at a possible new treatment to add to standard treatment for glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer. based on mouse studies, several recent studies showed that radiation of the part of the brain where brain cells are made reduces growth of some glioblastomas in humans, suggesting this part of the brain might play a role in fueling brain tumors. more studies showed cells from the part of the brain where brain cells are made move outward toward a glioblastoma. certain molecule signaling causes this cell movement. because many mental health drugs block molecule signaling, such as fluphenazine, or perphenazine, we suggest adding one of these drugs to the current standard treatment of surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiation to possibly increase survival time by cutting off fuel to the glioblastoma.",0
"recent studies have shown that nitric oxide (no) is a key mediator (regulator) in diseases occurring with thoracic aortic aneurysm (taa), such as marfan syndrome (mfs). thoracic aortic aneurysm is characterized by an abnormal bulge in the blood vessel. the progressive dilation, or widening, of the aorta (the largest human artery) in taa ultimately leads to aortic dissection. this is a tear in the inner layer of the blood artery. unfortunately, current medical treatments neither halt aortic enlargement nor prevent rupture. this leaves surgical repair as the only effective treatment. there is a need for effective therapies to delay or even avoid the need for surgical repair in taa patients. this paper summarizes the ways no signaling dysregulation (or dysfunction) causes taa, particularly in mfs. additionally, this paper will discuss recent advances on the identification of new mfs mediators that represent potential biomarkers. biomarkers are measurable, biological substances that can indicate disease in a patient. the authors propose several biological substances as targets for therapeutic intervention in taa and candidates for clinical trials.",0
"insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm) is associated with the formation of autoantibodies against different antigens in the islets of langerhans, so-called islet cell antibodies (ica). the expression of a major autoantigen, the beta-cell specific enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (gad), is glucose-dependent in vitro and correlated to insulin release in vitro. in this study the expression of islet autoantigens was examined in vivo and the relationship between beta-cell function and islet cell surface antibody (icsa) reactivity was tested. rats were fed for 10 days with glipizide or diazoxide, in order to stimulate or inhibit insulin release, respectively. frozen sections of pancreata were incubated with ten ica-positive iddm sera and analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence. two sera with a ""beta-cell restricted"" staining, five with an ""all-islet cell"" staining and three with a ""mixed"" pattern were employed. in all three groups, the highest end-point titres were obtained when pancreata of rats treated with glipizide were used. intermediate titres were seen in control animals and the lowest titres were observed on pancreata from diazoxide-treated rats, regardless of the serum used. in contrast to these observations, no correlation between icsa reactivity and islet cell activity could be demonstrated. conflicting results concerning icsa in previous reports and our failure to show a glucose regulation of icsa reactivity, indicate that icsa is a phenomenon with a low degree of specificity.",1
"background: the humoral immune response after primary immunisation with a sars-cov-2 vector vaccine (astrazeneca azd1222, chadox1 ncov-19, vaxzevria) followed by an mrna vaccine boost (pfizer/biontech, bnt162b2; moderna, m-1273) was examined and compared with the antibody response after homologous vaccination schemes (azd1222/azd1222 or bnt162b2/bnt162b2). methods: sera from 59 vaccinees were tested for anti-sars-cov-2 immunoglobulin g (igg) and virus-neutralising antibodies (vna) with three igg assays based on (parts of) the sars-cov-2 spike (s)-protein as antigen, an igg immunoblot (additionally contains the sars-cov-2 nucleoprotein (np) as an antigen), a surrogate neutralisation test (svnt), and a vero-cell-based virus-neutralisation test (cvnt) with the b.1.1.7 variant of concern (voc; alpha) as antigen. investigation was done before and after heterologous (n = 30 and 42) or homologous booster vaccination (azd1222/azd1222, n = 8/9; bnt162b2/bnt162b2, n = 8/8). after the second immunisation, a subgroup of 26 age- and gender-matched sera (azd1222/mrna, n = 9; azd1222/azd1222, n = 9; bnt162b2/bnt162b2, n = 8) was also tested for vna against voc b.1.617.2 (delta) in the cvnt. the strength of igg binding to separate sars-cov-2 antigens was measured by avidity. results: after the first vaccination, the prevalence of igg directed against the (trimeric) sars-cov-2 s-protein and its receptor binding domain (rbd) varied from 55-95% (azd1222) to 100% (bnt162b2), depending on the vaccine regimen and the sars-cov-2 antigen used. the booster vaccination resulted in 100% seroconversion and the occurrence of highly avid igg, which is directed against the s-protein subunit 1 and the rbd, as well as vna against voc b.1.1.7, while anti-np iggs were not detected. the results of the three anti-sars-cov-2 igg tests showed an excellent correlation to the vna titres against this voc. the agreement of cvnt and svnt results was good. however, the svnt seems to overestimate non- and weak b.1.1.7-neutralising titres. the anti-sars-cov-2 igg concentrations and the b.1.1.7-neutralising titres were significantly higher after heterologous vaccination compared to the homologous azd1222 scheme. if voc b.1.617.2 was used as antigen, significantly lower vna titres were measured in the cvnt, and three (33.3%) vector vaccine recipients had a vna titre < 1:10. conclusions: heterologous sars-cov-2 vaccination leads to a strong antibody response with anti-sars-cov-2 igg concentrations and vna titres at a level comparable to that of a homologous bnt162b2 vaccination scheme. irrespective of the chosen immunisation regime, highly avid igg antibodies can be detected just 2 weeks after the second vaccine dose indicating the development of a robust humoral immunity. the reduction in the vna titre against voc b.1.617.2 observed in the subgroup of 26 individuals is remarkable and confirms the immune escape of the delta variant.",1
"hyperkalemia (high blood potassium) is common in those with long-lasting kidney disease. it is linked to higher risk of death and a harmful, irregular heart beat. severe high blood potassium is serious, requires immediate treatment, and should be actively prevented. current treatment for high blood potassium includes eliminating potassium in diets, supplements, and medications known to raise potassium. medication that blocks kidney-related monitoring of blood pressure and electrolyte balance are usually removed by clinicians to prevent the return of high blood potassium. while removing kidney-related medication helps, patients do not receive the kidney-protecting benefits of the medication. new potassium binders have greatly influenced high blood potassium monitoring. they allow the continued use of helpful kidney-related medication that may promote high blood potassium. this article reviews the effects of high blood potassium and its treatment.",0
"pressure ulcers (skin sores) are a common and serious problem. pressure ulcers mainly occur among elderly persons who are confined to bed or chair. additional reasons pressure ulcers develop include cerebrovascular accident (damage to the brain and its blood vessels) or impaired nutritional intake (poor diet). additionally, reasons include urinary or fecal incontinence (lack of control on bladder or bowels), hypoalbuminemia (low blood albumin - a protein in the blood), and previous fracture. implementation of preventive measures significantly reduce pressure ulcer incidence (frequency). the measures include in-depth assessment of mobility, relieving pressure on the injured area, and evaluating nutritional status and urinary incontinence. if the pressure ulcer is a partial thickness (stage ii) wound, the factors causing the injury are probably friction or moisture. if the ulcer is full thickness (stage iii and iv), it is secondary to (caused by) pressure or shearing forces. the wound becoming infected is the most common complication in the management approach. osteomyelitis, or a bone infection, is not an uncommon occurrence. it must be ruled out in all full thickness pressure ulcers. removal of dead tissue by surgery is necessary prior to further treatment and assessments (measurements). taking antibiotics (which fight bacteria) is used if there is evidence of infection. topical (applied on skin) medicines may be used to prevent or treat infection. however, these medicines must be used carefully to avoid adverse effects (bad side effects) like wound toxicity, allergic reaction, and development of resistant pathogens, or harmful foreign organisms. proper use of air- and water-tight medical wrappings increase patient comfort, enhance healing, decrease the possibility of infection, save time, and reduce costs. a patient presenting an ulcer that does not improve or, because of its size, will take a great deal of time to heal should be evaluated for surgical closure.",0
"sickle cell disease (scd) is a monogenic disease characterized by multisystem morbidity and highly variable clinical course. inter-individual variability in hemoglobin f (hbf) levels is one of the main modifiers that account for the clinical heterogeneity in scd. hbf levels are affected by, among other factors, single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) at the bcl11a gene and the hbs1l-myb intergenic region and xmn1 gene. our aim was to investigate hbf-enhancer haplotypes at these loci to obtain a first overview of the genetic situation of scd patients in egypt and its impact on the severity of the disease. the study included 100 scd patients and 100 matched controls. genotyping of bcl11a (rs1886868 c/t), hbs1l-myb (rs9389268 a/g) and xmn1 γg158 (rs7842144 c/t) snps showed no statistically significant difference between scd patients and controls except for the hetero-mutant genotypes of bcl11a which was significantly higher in scd patients compared with controls. baseline hbf levels were significantly higher in those with co-inheritance of polymorphic genotypes of bcl11a + hsb1l-myb and bcl11a + xmn1. steady-state hbf levels, used as an indicator of disease severity, were significantly higher in scd-sβ patients having the polymorphic genotypes of hsb1l-myb. fold change of hbf in both patient groups did not differ between those harboring the wild and the polymorphic genotypes of the studied snps. in conclusion, bcl11a, hsb1l, and xmn1 genetic polymorphisms had no positive impact on baseline hbf levels solely but had if coexisted. discovery of the molecular mechanisms controlling hbf production could provide a more effective strategy for hbf induction.",1
"tuberous sclerosis complex (tsc) is caused by mutations in either tsc1 or tsc2 genes and affects multiple organs, including kidney, lung, and brain. in the kidney, tsc presents with the enlargement of benign tumors (angiomyolipomata) and cysts, which eventually leads to kidney failure. the factors promoting cyst formation and tumor growth in tsc are incompletely understood. here, we report that mice with principal cell-specific inactivation of tsc1 develop numerous cortical cysts, which are overwhelmingly composed of hyperproliferating a-intercalated (a-ic) cells. rna sequencing and confirmatory expression studies demonstrated robust expression of forkhead transcription factor 1 (foxi1) and its downstream targets, apical h+-atpase and cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase 2 (caii), in cyst epithelia in tsc1 knockout (ko) mice but not in pkd1 mutant mice. in addition, the electrogenic 2cl-/h+ exchanger (clc-5) is significantly up-regulated and shows remarkable colocalization with h+-atpase on the apical membrane of cyst epithelia in tsc1 ko mice. deletion of foxi1, which is vital to intercalated cells viability and h+-atpase expression, completely abrogated the cyst burden in tsc1 ko mice, as indicated by mri images and histological analysis in kidneys of foxi1/tsc1 double-knockout (dko) mice. deletion of caii, which is critical to h+-atpase activation, caused significant reduction in cyst burden and increased life expectancy in caii/tsc1 dko mice vs. tsc1 ko mice. we propose that intercalated cells and their acid/base/electrolyte transport machinery (h+-atpase/caii/clc-5) are critical to cystogenesis, and their inhibition or inactivation is associated with significant protection against cyst generation and/or enlargement in tsc.",1
"brain-related development (neurodevelopment) diseases are increasingly recognized to be caused by new gene mutations (de novo variants) with the use of state-of-the-art gene labeling. these de novo variants may actually be inherited, which could increase the reapparance risk of disease by >50% and is thought to be an underappreciated cause of neurodevelopment diseases. our study aimed to find the amount of inheritance in ""de novo"" neurodevelopmental diseases. a total of 237 patients (and parents) with neurodevelopmental diseases carrying apparent de novo disease-causing (pathogenic) or likely pathogenic variants were included. gene labeling was performed on parental samples to identify parental gene make-up. fourteen parental disease-causing gene types (3.0%) in 11 genes were detected with the amount of gene types ranging from 0.22%-34%. three parents showed milder disease-related physical attributes than their offspring with relatively high amounts of gene types (23.33%, 25%, 34% separately). one reoccuring gene type was identified before birth. a review of group study on gene inheritance in neurodevelopmental diseases was performed. our study highlights that identifying the inherited disease-causing gene types will contribute to improving the accuracy of genetic treatment and before-birth diagnosis for reproductive risks.",0
"objects that shouldn't be found in the ear, nose, and throat can be removed in the emergency room, especially if the information the patient provides lines up with an object that shouldn't be in the body and the patient is calm and agreeable with the exam and efforts to remove the object. tips for success include painkillers, the ability to see the object, keeping the patient's head still, skill and experience of the doctor, and removing the object with the least number of tries. it is very important to realize the risks involved with certain objects (button batteries or sharp objects) and when to call a specialist to help ensure safe, successful removal of objects to the ear, nose, and throat.",0
"occipital neuralgia is the pain in the occipital nerves, the nerves that run from the top of the spinal cord up in the back of the head. it is considered a type of headaches, but some doctors suggest pain in the nerves in the back of the head is a different problem. occipital neuralgia is a continuing, sharp, stabbing pain in the upper neck, back of the head, and behind the ears. it can also extend to the front of the head. the doctors decide the patients have the disease if the pain in the back of the patients' heads comes and goes. most patients have pain on one side of their head, but the pain could also be on both sides and extend to the front of the head and face. when the doctors examine the patients, the patients' skin over the nerves in the back of the head may be tender. drugs like lidocaine can block the feeling of pain in these nerves. drugs that reduce inflammation, such as steroids may be added to keep the signs from happening. other treatments like botulinum toxin that blocks the nerve signals and radiofrequency ablation that uses radio waves to shrink tissues may be promising but need to be studied more. surgeons may permanently relieve the pressure on the nerve by removing a small muscle between the neck vertebra at the base of the head, but this treatment is risky.",0
"the human heart is a pivotal organ in the circulatory system, and it beats more than 2 billion times during normal life. this functioning of the heart depends on the cardiac conduction system, which includes impulse generators (e.g., sino-atrial node) and the impulse propagating (his-purkinje) system. the sinoatrial node acts as the natural pacemaker of the heart. the cells present in the sinus node have innate automaticity, which starts the electrical activity in the heart. this innate electrical potential moves from the sinoatrial node to the atrioventricular node and finally into the his-purkinje system. this movement of electric potential in an orderly manner controls the rhythmic contraction of the heart's chambers. the failure of this intrinsic electrical conduction in the heart can result in different arrhythmic problems. several diseases and conditions affect the conduction system by involving impulse generation, impulse propagation, or both. acquired conditions such as myocardial infarction, age-related degeneration, procedural complications, and drug toxicity are the major causes of the native conduction system malfunction. the current standard of care for symptomatic bradyarrhythmias due to conduction system diseases is the implantation of a cardiac implantable electronic device. these pacing devices provide an external electrical stimulus that leads to depolarization of myocytes and helps maintain the electrical excitability of the heart tissue. this process leads to excitation-contraction coupling resulting in the contraction of myocardial tissue.",1
"in patients with advanced, long-standing (chronic) kidney disease (ckd), the kidney function continues to decline. this decrease in kidney function leads to an greater risk of hyperkalemia. hyperkalemia is a condition where the potassium level in the blood is higher than normal. potassium is a very important mineral in the body. hyperkalemia is a important problem that happens mostly in people with long-lasting kidney disease. some drugs can also cause an additional risk of hyperkalemia, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease (ckd). one such class of drugs, is the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (raas blockers). the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (raas) is a hormone system that manages blood pressure and fluid balance in the body. when hyperkalemia develops, doctors often advise patients to go on a diet that is lower in potassium. this study talks about the things that stop patients from following a low potassium diet. the paper also discusses what the effect of following a strict diet can have on poor patient outcomes. facts are showing that a diet that includes foods high in potassium is good for your health. these same foods may be good for your health because they also contain other vitamins, minerals, and fiber. these benefits include lowering your blood pressure. the benefits also include lowering the risks for heart disease, blood vessel disease , and stroke. foods high in potassium may also prevent chronic kidney disease (ckd) from getting worse. high-potassium foods may also decrease the risk of death in patients with ckd. newer drugs, patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, bind and get rid of excess potassium from the body. the use of these drugs may allow for renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor (raas blocker) therapy in patients with ckd and hyperkalemia. doctors using these drugs together may make it possible for patients with ckd and hyperkalemia to have more freedom with their diets. this treatment approach may give patients the health benefits of a high-potassium diet without the increased risk for hyperkalemia. further studies are needed.",0
"doctors saw an elderly male patient who after heart surgery had pitting edema in both legs, a condition where excess fluid builds up in part of the body and pressing into the swollen area leaves a pit or indentation. the man also had painful leg joints after a 1-month history of periodic changes in joint stiffness. his family doctor had prescribed a combination of diuretics, medicines that help remove salt and water from the body; however, pitting edema in his lower legs continued. he was diagnosed with worsening of congestive heart failure (inefficient heart pumping) because of a previous heart surgery and transferred to the hospital. on admission to the hospital, doctors closely observed the patient's condition and noticed that his body temperature increased to 100.4 f (38.0 c) every evening. additionally, his ankle joints felt feverish and were swollen. therefore, doctors suspected arthritis in at least five joints (polyarthritis) as a potential cause, although doctors first thought it was rheumatoid arthritis (ra - a long-lasting arthritis from immune cells attacking healthy cells). testing did not support a rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis; therefore, doctors concluded the association of remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema (rs3pe) syndrome with his condition. rs3pe is a rare disease with swollen joints and pitting edema. after daily treatment with a steroid medication called prednisolone, the edema symptom greatly improved. the concept of rs3pe syndrome could explain such as an impressive clinical result. doctors encounter patients with pitting edema of unknown cause in daily clinical practice. in particular, heart specialists (cardiologists) usually tend to prescribe diuretics for patients with pitting edema in their legs. cardiologists should consider rs3pe syndrome as a differential (potential) diagnosis, for patients with pitting edema in one location in their limbs. this report cautions prescribing diuretics for localized pitting edema.",0
"we aimed to investigate the terms used to refer to cognitive and fatigue related side effects and their prevalence in phase iii add-on clinical trials of anti-epileptic drugs (aeds). we extracted data from publicly available fda documents as well as the published literature. target drug doses were then calculated as drug loads and divided into three categories (low, average, high). the odds ratio of developing the side effects was calculated for each drug load, and the presence of a dose-response effect was also assessed. we found that the cognitive terms used across trials were very variable, and data on discontinuation rates were limited. placebo rates for cognitive side effects ranged from 0 to 10.6% while those for fatigue ranged from 2.5 to 37.7%. keeping in mind the variable placebo rates and terminology, the majority of aeds exhibited a clear dose response effect and significant odds ratios at high doses except brivaracetam and zonisamide for the cognitive side effects and tiagabine, topiramate, and zonisamide for the fatigue side effects. due to their clinical relevance and impact on quality of life, new trials should make data related to the prevalence and discontinuation rates of these side effects publicly available. given the clear dose response effect, physicians should consider aiming for lower drug loads and adjusting doses to improve tolerability.",1
"background and objective: despite the introduction of newer antiemetics in the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (ponv), perphenazine is recommended in current guidelines, as the concept of multimodal management of ponv in high-risk patients requires more than two drugs to be combined. the aim of this quantitative systematic review was to assess the efficacy and safety of perphenazine in the prophylaxis of ponv in adults and children. results: eleven trials published between 1965 and 1999 including a total of 2081 participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were further analysed. in children, perphenazine 0.07 mg kg was effective in preventing vomiting (rr, 0.31; 95% ci, 0.18-0.54), whereas in adults, a dose of about 5 mg was effective for the prevention of ponv (rr, 0.50; 95% ci, 0.37-0.67). when compared with established newer drugs, for example, ondansetron, dexamethasone or droperidol, no significant differences were observed in the pooled analysis with limited data. reporting of adverse events was poor. transient sedation was reported in three eligible trials (rr, 0.9; 95% ci, 0.40-2.05). conclusion: there is evidence that perphenazine is effective in the prevention of ponv in children and adults without serious adverse effects compared with placebo.",1
"may-thurner syndrome (mts) is a clinical condition where the left iliac vein located in the abdomen that goes into the left leg is compressed by the right iliac artery which is a vein that goes into the right leg. having this condition makes it easier for the patient to develop deep venous thrombosis (dvt), a serious condition where a blood clot forms in the vein. researchers present the case of a 30-year﻿-old female who arrived at the emergency room with gradual left leg swelling for four weeks, with low-risk for developing dvt. an exam revealed left leg swelling with pitting edema up to the knee, a condition where excess fluid builds up in one part of the body and pressing into the swollen area leaves a pit or indentation. her calf muscle was tender to light touch. veins in the foot, in the leg called the anterior tibial, and in the lower leg can be fairly felt due to the edema; however, the rest of her pulses were appropriately felt. therefore, the early diagnosis of possible dvt was made, and further investigations were requested. researchers present this case intending to highlight the clinical signs and symptoms of may-thurner syndrome, its diagnosis, and treatment.",0
"drug activity data of gabapentin (gbp) in community-dwelling elderly patients show a great effect of advanced age on gvp drug activity due to altered kidney function. however, there are no data in elderly nursing home (nh) patients to measure gabapentin absorption and elimination. we characterize the drug activity of gbp in elderly nursing home patients that are on gbp therapy. this is a drug actvity study in elderly nursing home patients (≥60 years) given gbp for long-term pain or epilepsy (brain disorder causing seizures) from seven nursing homes. a mathematical model showed the data and clearance (cl) was linked with estimated kidney filtration rate. the gbp clearance in elderly nursing home patients was 2.93 liters/hour. after adjusting for kidney filtration, gbp clearance was not affected by age, sex, body weight, or associated diseases. no effects of body size, age, and sex were detected on amount of distribution. functional or active gbp amount is linked to dose amount. analysis suggests certain mathematical models successfully tracked the trend and variation in gabapentin amount over time. in this analysis, certain measures seem similar between elderly and young adults.",0
"a study investigated the effects of gabapentinoids, drugs often used to prevent and control seizures. the tested drugs include gabapentin, pregabalin and gastroretentive gabapentin. the study evaluated the effects of the drugs on simulated driving performance, sedation (relaxation) and cognitive function (thinking ability). the study was conducted in 32 healthy volunteers. driving attentiveness, sleepiness, and cognition were evaluated prior to treatment within participants. blood samples were collected during each treatment. subjects receiving gastroretentive gabapentin showed less change in variation (differences) in lateral (side) lane position, less tremors (shaking), and fewer vision disturbances compared with gabapentin. statistically significant decreases in one card learning test (a test used to test short term memory) performance was observed after treatment with gastroretentive gabapentin. the study concluded gastroretentive gabapentin reduced driving impairment and showed lower scores on key neurotoxicity (abnormal nervous system function) measures. further studies in patients with postherpetic neuralgia (nerve-related pain from shingles) are needed.",0
"we studied how the immune system responds to pfizer or moderna booster after astrazeneca covid-19 vaccination. we compared these cross-vaccine boosters to using the same boosters as the original vaccine: astrazeneca or pfizer. we tested the blood of 59 vaccinated people for its ability to neutralize the sars-cov-2 virus and for the chemicals the body produced to fight the virus. the blood was tested before and after the booster vaccine was given. after the first vaccine, chemicals against the parts of the virus that damage human cells ranged from 55-95% for astrazeneca to 100% for pfizer. after the boosters, the blood developed highly effective chemicals that block the parts of the virus that damage human cells. vaccination with different boosters caused the blood to produce more anti-covid-19 chemicals that boosting with the same astrazeneca vaccine. boosting with different vaccines strongly protects against covid-19 at about the same level as boosting with the same original pfizer vaccine. all vaccines caused the blood to develop strong protection 2 weeks after the second vaccine dose. the protection against the delta variant of covid-19 was not as strong in the 26 people in whom it was measured.",0
"herpes zoster (shingles) is an immediate, painful, skin disease involved with reactivating the chickenpox virus. it may cause viral meningitis (inflamation of the brain and spine). pregabalin, common nerve pain medication, helps treat pain from herpes zoster. however, pregabalin can be toxic to the nervous system. we describe a 68-year-old female with herpes zoster and treated with pregabalin. the patient had stuttering and frequent eye twitching after 3 days of using pregabalin. pregabalin use was stopped. the symptoms of stuttering and eye twitching completely stopped without any special treatment after one week. in this case, the cause of stuttering and eye twitching may be linked to pregabalin. clinicians should be alert to the rare symptoms linked with pregabalin use.",0
"we present here a potential new treatment adjunct for glioblastoma. building on murine studies, a series of papers appeared recently showing that therapeutic irradiation of the ipsilateral subventricular zone (svz) retards growth of more peripherally growing cortical glioblastomas in humans, suggesting a tumor trophic function for the svz. further studies showed that svz cells migrate out towards a peripheral glioblastoma. dopamine signaling through d3 subtype receptor indirectly drives this centrifugal migration in humans. since psychiatry has several drugs with good d3 blocking attributes, such as fluphenazine, or perphenazine, we suggest that adding one of these d3 blocking drugs to current standard treatment of resection followed by temozolomide and irradiation might prolong survival by depriving glioblastoma of the trophic functions previously subserved by dopaminergic signaling on svz cells.",1
"the study's importance is based on the fact that endocrine therapy-induced alopecia (eia) (hair loss or thinning from hormonal therapy) has been mentioned but not measured. the study's objective is to describe eia thoroughly in patients with breast cancer. the study's design is a study of 112 patients with breast cancer, diagnosed with eia from january 1, 2009 to december 31, 2016. the patients were examined at a skin center in a large, specialized hospital and professional cancer center. the study's main variables included common hospital measures, hair-loss- or hair-thinning-related quality of life (qol), and reaction to minoxidil (hair regrowth medication) of eia in patients with breast cancer. we used data from the hairdex questionnaire (a questionnaire for disease-specific quality of life measurements) to measure the impact of hair loss or thinning (alopecia) on patients qol. higher scores indicate lower qol (0-100 score). the success of minoxidil was measured at 3 or 6 months by an investigator unaware of the treatment groups through standard photographs of the scalp. 112 female patients with breast cancer were included. their median age was 60 years with a range from 34-90 years. 104 patients (93%) had standard photographs. of these, 59 patients (53%) had images from special hair and scalp evaluations at the start. 46 patients (41%) were measured for response to minoxidil. alopecia was linked to aromatase inhibitors in 75 patients (67%) and tamoxifen (estrogen-influencing medication) in 37 (33%). severity was low in 96 of 104 patients (92%). the pattern was similar to common, receding hair loss. the most common scalp and hair-related feature at the start were peach fuzz and mid- and thick, long hairs on the scalp. qol was negatively reported, especially in the emotional part of life. after treatment with minoxidil on the skin, medium or noticeable improvement in hair loss and thinning was seen in 37 of 46 patients (80%). in conclusion, hormonal therapies are linked with commonly-seen hair loss and thinning, similar to agents that actively cause alopecia. despite mostly mild alopecia, qol was negatively impacted for patients.",0
"we report 5 cases of common alopecia (hair loss or thinning) in female patients undergoing hormonal anticancer therapy to prevent reoccuring breast cancer after surgery. three patients showed alopecia common to males with receding hairlines in the front. two patients showed alopecia common to females without receding hairlines. the patient history showed that common alopecia of the patients developed after full recovery of complete hair loss of the scalp due to prior, severe chemotherapy (cancer treatment). all of the secondary hormonal anticancer drugs used in patients are antiestrogenic agents (which influence levels of estrogen, a female sex hormone). these agents include aromatase inhibitors or selective estrogen receptor modulators. considering the effect of hormones on hair follicles in the front scalp, the estrogen-hormone imbalance caused by the drugs was thought to be the reason for visible alopecia in patients. in general, alopecia that develops during severe chemotherapy (cancer therapy) is known to physicians and patients. however, the identification of alopecia during hormonal anticancer therapy in breast cancer patients seems to be overlooked.",0
"objectives: the novel coronavirus infection (covid-19) conveys a serious threat globally to health and economy because of a lack of vaccines and specific treatments. a common factor for conditions that predispose for serious progress is a low-grade inflammation, e.g., as seen in metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and heart failure, to which micronutrient deficiencies may contribute. the aim of the present article was to explore the usefulness of early micronutrient intervention, with focus on zinc, selenium, and vitamin d, to relieve escalation of covid-19. methods: we conducted an online search for articles published in the period 2010-2020 on zinc, selenium, and vitamin d, and corona and related virus infections. results: there were a few studies providing direct evidence on associations between zinc, selenium, and vitamin d, and covid-19. adequate supply of zinc, selenium, and vitamin d is essential for resistance to other viral infections, immune function, and reduced inflammation. hence, it is suggested that nutrition intervention securing an adequate status might protect against the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome - coronavirus-2) and mitigate the course of covid-19. conclusion: we recommended initiation of adequate supplementation in high-risk areas and/or soon after the time of suspected infection with sars-cov-2. subjects in high-risk groups should have high priority as regards this nutritive adjuvant therapy, which should be started prior to administration of specific and supportive medical measures.",1
"the global pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) and its threat to humans have drawn worldwide attention. the acute and long-term effects of sars-cov-2 on the nervous system pose major public health challenges. patients with sars-cov-2 present diverse symptoms of the central nervous system. exploring the mechanism of coronavirus damage to the nervous system is essential for reducing the long-term neurological complications of covid-19. despite rapid progress in characterizing sars-cov-2, the long-term effects of covid-19 on the brain remain unclear. the possible mechanisms of sars-cov-2 injury to the central nervous system include: 1) direct injury of nerve cells, 2) activation of the immune system and inflammatory cytokines caused by systemic infection, 3) a high affinity of the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein for the angiotensin-converting enzyme ace2, 4) cerebrovascular disease caused by hypoxia and coagulation dysfunction, and 5) a systemic inflammatory response that promotes cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative diseases. although we do not fully understand the mechanism by which sars-cov-2 causes nerve injury, we hope to provide a framework by reviewing the clinical manifestations, complications, and possible mechanisms of neurological damage caused by sars-cov-2. with hope, this will facilitate the early identification, diagnosis, and treatment of possible neurological sequelae, which could contribute toward improving patient prognosis and preventing transmission.",1
"both antidepressant medications and psychological therapy are common treatments for depression in women after childbirth (postpartum depression-ppd). antidepressant treatment may have a number of practical disadvantages. women may prefer to avoid medication while breastfeeding. more information about the benefits of these two ways of treating ppd in the perinatal period (time around pregnancy and childbirth) is helpful. in treating of depression, there is some evidence that combining both therapies (medications plus psychological treatment) may be more successful than either treatment alone. however, in the treatment of postnatal depression, such evidence is limited. researchers did a study in 45 postpartum women with depression. the treatments were assigned randomly. they received either cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt), sertraline (an antidepressant drug), or a combination of both. psychological measurements were collected weekly for 12 weeks, with a follow-up at 24 weeks. symptoms of depression and anxiety were reduced to a significant degree following all three treatments. cbt alone was found to be superior to both sertraline alone and combination therapy after 12 weeks. the cbt therapy group appeared to show the most rapid initial gains after treatment began. in this study, a special cbt program for postnatal depression was found to be superior as a single therapy when compared to sertraline, a commonly prescribed antidepressant. this is in disagreement with other studies that found no difference noted in the outcomes between the drug and the psychological treatment for postnatal depression. unlike some previous work, this study had an independent analysis of cbt single therapy for postnatal depression as compared to both antidepressant and combination therapy. like previous studies in postpartum women, there was no advantage noticed by combining drug and psychological treatments in the short term.",0
"background: arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (amc) is characterised by deforemed, rigid joints at birth in two or more body areas. amc exhibits wide physical attributes and genetic types. our goals were to improve the genetic identification rates of amc, to test the added value of whole gene labeling compared with targeted gene labeling and to identify new genes in 315 unrelated undiagnosed amc families. several gene-related tools were used including gene mapping of disease-related genes in various groups, first in targeted gene labeling and then whole gene labeling. gene sequencing was performed to identify or verify gene variants. we achieved disease gene identification in 52.7% of amc patients including nine recently identified genes (cntnap1, magel2, adgrg6, adcy6, gldn, lgi4, lmod3, unc50 and scn1a). moreover, we identified disease-causing variants in asxl3 and stac3, expanding the physical attributes linked with these genes. the most frequent cause of amc was linked to skeletal muscle (40%) followed by brain (22%). the most frequent mode of inheritance is from both parents (66.3% of patients). in irregular patients born to non-related parents (n=60), new, inherited or sex chromosome linked types were observed in 30 of them (50%). in conclusion, new genes recently identified in amc represent 21% of causing genes in our group. a high amount of new gene types were observed, indicating that genes plays a prominent part in this developmental disease. our data showed the added value of whole gene labeling when compared with targeted gene labeling due to the larger medical variance of some disease genes than expected and the identification of new genes.",0
"some covid-19 patients suffer complications from anti-viral immune responses which can lead to both a dangerous cytokine storm and development of blood-borne factors that render severe thrombotic events more likely. the precise immune response profile is likely, therefore, to determine and predict patient outcomes and also represents a target for intervention. anti-viral t cell exhaustion in the early stages is associated with disease progression. dysregulation of t cell functions, which precedes cytokine storm development and neutrophil expansion in alveolar tissues heralds damaging pathology. t cell function, cytokine production and factors that attract neutrophils to the lung can be modified through targeting molecules that can modulate t cell responses. manipulating t cell responses by targeting the pi3k/akt/mtor pathway could provide the means to control the immune response in covid-19 patients. during the initial anti-viral response, t cell effector function can be enhanced by delaying anti-viral exhaustion through inhibiting pi3k and akt. additionally, immune dysregulation can be addressed by enhancing immune suppressor functions by targeting downstream mtor, an important intracellular modulator of cellular metabolism. targeting this signalling pathway also has potential to prevent formation of thrombi due to its role in platelet activation. furthermore, this signalling pathway is essential for sars-cov-2 virus replication in host cells and its inhibition could, therefore, reduce viral load. the ultimate goal is to identify targets that can quickly control the immune response in covid-19 patients to improve patient outcome. targeting different levels of the pi3k/akt/mtor signalling pathway could potentially achieve this during each stage of the disease.",1
"several drugs can cause heart problems. it is important to monitor and evaluate risks of traditional drugs. we study if taking hydroxyzine, a drug that relieves anxiety and also itch caused by allergies, is associated with fast, chaotic heartbeats. we reviewed data from a drug safety database and the basic studies of hydroxyzine interactions with human cells. the drug safety data had 59 reports between december 1955 and august 2016 that linked fast chaotic heartbeats to hydroxyzine use. some people took too much of the drug (overdose). all other cases had medical problems or were taking other drugs along with hydroxyzine. people who have heart problems and take drugs that can cause irregular heartbeat are at the greatest risk of complications due to hydroxyzine. studies show hydroxyzine can effect some heart functions. hydroxyzine should be listed as drug with ""conditional risk of torsade de pointes"". hydroxyzine use in patients who are at risk for heart problems should be limited.",0
"the world health organization declared the new coronavirus, named as sars-cov-2, as a global pandemic in early 2020 after the respiratory viral disease spread to over 180 countries, leading to tens of thousands of cases and many deaths in a few months. thus, this paper aims to summarize the evidence for links between nutrition and boosting the immune system in the fight against the disease caused by sars-cov-2. this review measures the impact of vitamin and mineral supplements on the body's defense mechanisms against sars-cov-2. there is a strong link between consuming biological ingredients like vitamins c-e and minerals like zinc, and a reduction in the effects of coronavirus infection. these biological ingredients can come from nutrient-rich foods or vitamin supplements. also, these biological molecules may help boost the immune response, healing response, and recovery time. thus, eating healthy foods rich in vitamins c-e with zinc and other helpful molecules could boost the immune system and protect the body from serious infections.",0
"researchers tested the idea that there are 2 distinct phenotypes (observable traits or characteristics) of parkinson tremor based on differences among people in how the resting tremor (a tremor when the muscle is relaxed) responds to dopamine medication. researchers also investigated whether this pattern is specific to tremor by comparing differences in the dopamine response of the tremor to that of bradykinesia (slowness of movement). in the study, we performed a levodopa (a drug that enters the brain and helps replace missing dopamine) challenge (when a drug is used to confirm a diagnosis of parkinson's disease if the patient's symptoms improve while taking the medication) in 76 patients with parkinson tremor. clinical scores using a tool that evaluates the severity of parkinson's disease are collected in stages of ""off"" (when symptoms return) and ""on"" (when patient feels energetic and can move) during a standard dopamine challenge. in both sessions, resting tremor intensity was measured using accelerometry (a device that records motion and non-motion) both during rest and while doing another mental task at the same time. bradykinesia is measured using a speeded keyboard test. the distribution (the movement of a drug to and from the blood and different tissues of the body) of dopamine-responsiveness for resting tremor and bradykinesia is calculated. in 41 patients, a dopamine challenge is repeated after about 6 months. the dopamine response of resting tremor, but not bradykinesia, significantly departed from normal in the body. an analysis of brain activity revealed 3 clusters: dopamine-responsive, intermediate, and dopamine-resistant tremor. a repeated levodopa challenge after 6 months confirmed these clusters. patients with dopamine-responsive tremor have greater disease severity and tend to have a higher amount of dyskinesia (involuntary and uncontrollable movements). in conclusion, parkinson resting tremor can be divided into 3 partially overlapping characteristics based on dopamine response. these tremor characteristics may be connected with different underlying functional changes that come with parkinson's disease, requiring a different treatment approach.",0
"degradation of striatal dopamine in parkinson's disease (pd) may initially be supplemented by increased cognitive control mediated by cholinergic mechanisms. shift to cognitive control of walking can be quantified by prefrontal cortex activation. levodopa improves certain aspects of gait and worsens others, and cholinergic augmentation influence on gait and prefrontal cortex activity remains unclear. this study examined dopaminergic and cholinergic influence on gait and prefrontal cortex activity while walking in pd. a single-site, randomized, double-blind crossover trial examined effects of levodopa and donepezil in pd. twenty pd participants were randomized, and 19 completed the trial. participants were randomized to either levodopa + donepezil (5 mg) or levodopa + placebo treatments, with 2 weeks with treatment and a 2-week washout. the primary outcome was change in prefrontal cortex activity while walking, and secondary outcomes were change in gait and dual-task performance and attention. levodopa decreased prefrontal cortex activity compared with off medication (effect size, -0.51), whereas the addition of donepezil reversed this decrease. gait speed and stride length under single- and dual-task conditions improved with combined donepezil and levodopa compared with off medication (effect size, 1 for gait speed and 0.75 for stride length). dual-task reaction time was quicker with levodopa compared with off medication (effect size, -0.87), and accuracy improved with combined donepezil and levodopa (effect size, 0.47). cholinergic therapy, specifically donepezil 5 mg/day for 2 weeks, can alter prefrontal cortex activity when walking and improve secondary cognitive task accuracy and gait in pd. further studies will investigate whether higher prefrontal cortex activity while walking is associated with gait changes.",1
"we report on three infants born with hands born with hand defects and defects of the pituitary gland, which regulates body functions and growth through chemical substances called hormones. two of the newborns had hypothalamic tumors (noncancerous growths in the base of their brains). the brain of the third newborn was not examined. in one case, the disease runs in the family. the mother's sister died at the age of 17. she had extra fingers, extremely small tongue, and flat nose. the mother of the second newborn had very low levels of estriol, a hormone made during pregnancy that is used to measure the unborn baby's health. when this baby was born, brain imaging was normal, but the levels of hormones that regulate growth and development were low. treatment with growth and other hormones was started. at 11.5 months the baby started having seizures. a new brain imaging showed a mass in the lower part of the brain. surgery to remove this mass at 12 months was the first successful treatment of this disorder. the third newborn had a split in the flap that protects the windpipe, lack of hormones that regulate growth and development, and abnormal hands. brain imaging at birth did not show a mass in the lower part of the brain. this child died from complications of a brain mass that was not showing in the image. these three babies were conceived between march 10th and april 17th in three different years in three neighboring counties of vermont. close locations and possible other phs cases in one of these families suggest inheritance and environment might interact.",0
"introduction: postoperative pain management options are of great importance for patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty, as joint replacement surgery is reported to be one of the most painful surgical procedures. this study demonstrates pain outcome until 4 weeks postoperatively and evaluates factors influencing pain in the postoperative course after total hip arthroplasty. materials and methods: a total of 103 patients were included in this prospective cohort trial and underwent total hip arthroplasty. postoperative pain was described using a numerical rating scale (nrs); demographic data and perioperative parameters were correlated with postoperative pain. results: evaluation of pain scores in the postoperative course showed a constant decrease in the first postoperative week (mean nrs 3.1 on day 1 to mean nrs 2.3 on day 8) and, then, a perpetual increase for 3 days (mean nrs 2.6 on day 9 to mean nrs 2.3 on day 12). afterwards, a continuous pain-level decrease was stated (continuous to a mean nrs 0.9 on day 29). no correlation was found between the potential influencing factors sex, age, body mass index, duration of surgery, asa score, and postoperative pain levels, but a high significant correlation could be stated for preoperative pain levels and postoperative pain intensity (pain while moving p < 0.02 to p < 0.05 depending on the time period ""week 1 postoperatively"", ""week 2-4"", or ""week 1-4""; pain while resting p < 0.001, in all the measured time intervals, respectively). conclusion: increasing pain levels after the first week postoperatively, for 3 days, are most likely to be caused by the change to more extensive mobilization and physiotherapy in the rehabilitation unit. no significant influence or correlation on the intensity of postoperative pain could be found while evaluating potential predictors except preoperative pain levels. pain management has to take these findings into account in the future to further increase patients' satisfaction in the postoperative course after total hip arthroplasty and to adapt pain management programs.",1
"causes of finger pain are usually recognizable by past characteristics and findings from a physical checkup. however, radiographs (images created usually by x-rays) and other lab tests are usually required to support the identification. most minor causes of finger pain need only mild treatment, like restraining the finger from moving and exercise. causes of finger pain from bacteria include cellulitis (a bacterial skin infection), tendinitis (an irritation of the tendon), paronychia (a bacterial nail infection), felon (a bacterial fingertip infection), and emboli (a blood vessel blockage). these causes generally require antibacterials alomg with or without fluid drainage of the finger. some patients with finger pain from bacteria should be sent to a hand surgeon. causes of finger pain related to blood vessels represent real emergencies that depend on quick treatment. when any nerve damage leads to finger pain, a pinched nerve in the wrist is usually the most common. full-body autoimmune diseases (diseases in which infection-preventing cells attack healthy cells), which may cause joint pain or irritation in the blood vessels, might start with finger pain. also, finger pain may be the first sign of a serious full-body illness, as in hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy, a rare disease with irritation around the bone and joints and enlarged fingertips. reflex sympathetic dystrophy (a disease causing long-lasting limb pain) is an example of pain felt in an area away from its source, possibly by nerve signaling issues. some bacteria-related, injury-related, and blood vessel-related causes of finger pain must be checked quickly to avoid serious harm. depending on the cause, help from a hand surgeon, rheumatologist (a doctor who treats musculoskeletal issues), or neurologist (a doctor who treats nerve-related issues) may be needed. recovery may be quickened with occupational therapists that help patients perform everyday activities.",0
"upper extremity neuropathic pain states greatly impact patient functionality and quality of life, despite appropriate surgical intervention. this article focuses on the advanced therapies that may improve pain care, including advanced treatment strategies that are available. the article also surveys therapies on the immediate horizon, such as spinal cord stimulation, peripheral nerve stimulation, and dorsal root ganglion spinal cord stimulation. as these therapies evolve, so too will their placement within the pain care algorithm grounded by a foundation of evidence to improve patient safety and management of patients with difficult neuropathic pain.",1
"islet cell antibodies (ica; proteins made against insulin-producing cells) are a marker of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm). ica are detected in 60-80% of the patients with iddm at the onset of the disease. the presence of ica in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (niddm) indicates that the patients are likely to develop iddm. however, as ica are measured by the indirect immunofluorescent method, the reliability of the ica assay is not high in some institutes. use of the pancreas tissue having high antigenicity is recommended as one solution for a reliable assay. standardization of the ica assay is under way with the use of an ica positive standard sera as 80 jdf units. anti-glutamate decarboxylase (gad) antibody assays using a radioimmunoassay (ria) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) have recently been developed. the significance of anti-gad antibodies is comparable to that of ica. since the anti-gad assay is reproducible and easy to perform, it should be used widely in parallel with the ica assay.",1
"chronic throat clearing or a feeling of 'something' at the back of the oropharynx or nasopharynx is a common cause for referral to otorhinolaryngology services. while treatment of an underlying causative condition might be expected to improve these symptoms, in many cases a clear underlying cause is not found. currently, there is no recognized treatment which is effective against these troublesome symptoms. this observational study investigated the effectiveness of a regime of sipping ice cold carbonated water to try to break the vicious cycle of throat clearing. seventy-two patients with these symptoms who had previously been advised to use the regime were contacted with a postal questionnaire. sixty-three per cent of patients documented an improvement in their symptom severity score. the most severely and most frequently affected patients had the greatest benefit. we conclude that the suggested regime can be effective in breaking the vicious cycle of persistent throat-clearing.",1
"we aim to describe the spectrum of detected gene mutations in patients with epilepsy (brain disorder with seizures) in clinical practice of brain physicians specializing in epilepsy with an analysis of identified epileptic diseases, the characteristics of seizures, the timing of a genetic diagnosis, options and treatment effectiveness. the study included 100 patients (40 boys, 60 girls) with epilepsy and/or epileptic encephalopathy (epilepsy that leads to brain damage) and a gene mutation identified. the average age was 6.9â±5.1 years. through remote access, epilepsy specialists filled out a specially designed data table containing information from patient history. the results show there are patients with a wide range of gene mutations, the leading of which is a mutation in the specific gene called scn1a (15%). the main method (85%) of detection remains the gene labeling of the last group in the â«hereditary epilepsyâ panel, groups of genes linked with epilepsy. years pass from the start of the disease to the genetic diagnosis (average number is 3 years). in most cases, patients with severe (52% have epileptic encephalopathy, 88% have growth disorders) and drug-resistant (average amount of anti-epileptic drugs - 3.8â±2.2, multi-treatment - 70%) diseases have undergone genetic testing. in the treatment of these patients, epilepsy specialists are increasingly (52%) using alternative methods: steroids, ketogenic (low-carb) diet and others. the lack of seizures was observed only in 46% of patients. in conclusion, in the practice of epilepsy specialists, patients with a wide range of gene mutations are found. as a rule, these are patients with severe, treatment-resistant epileptic diseases.",0
"background and objective: anastrozole is a well-established active pharmaceutical ingredient (api) used for the treatment of hormone-sensitive breast cancer (bc) in postmenopausal women. however, treatment with the only available oral formulation is often associated with concentration-dependent serious side effects such as hot flashes, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, nausea, diarrhea, headache, and others. in contrast, a sustained-release system for the local application of anastrozole should minimize these serious adverse drug reactions. methods: anastrozole-in-adhesive transdermal drug delivery systems (tdds) were developed offering efficient loading, avoidance of inhomogeneity or crystallization of the drug, the desired controlled release kinetics, storage stability, easy handling, mechanical stability, and sufficient stickiness on the skin. in vitro continuous anastrozole release profiles were studied in franz diffusion cells. in vivo, consecutive drug plasma kinetics from the final anastrozole transdermal system was tested in beagle dogs. for drug analysis, a specific validated liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry method using fragment ion detection was developed and validated. results: after efficient drug loading, a linear and sustained 65% drug release from the tdds over 48 h was obtained. in vivo data showed a favorable anastrozole plasma concentration-time course, avoiding side effect-associated peak concentrations as obtained after oral administration but matching therapeutic plasma levels up to 72 h. conclusion: these results provide the basis for establishing the transdermal application of anastrozole with improved pharmacokinetics and drug safety as novel therapeutic approach and promising option to treat human bc by decreasing the high burden of unwanted side effects.",1
"this work explored the use of video viewing of the voice box with a small device to identify and treat throat foreign bodies (fbs) or substances. 1572 total patients with throat foreign substances at the department of otolarynology of nanjing drum tower hospital were analysed. time from foreign substance consumption to hospital admission, age, sex, duration of admission, and site of blockage were measured. the most common foreign substance was fish bones, seen in 91.98% of patients. among all 1572 foreign substances, 1004 (63.87%) were removed by video throat treatment with a small device without issues. a shorter hospital stay was linked to higher identification rate by video viewing of the voice box with a small device. the identification rate of sharp foreign substances was higher than that of non-sharp ones. the most common sites of throat foreign substances were areas near the tonsil and bottom of the tongue and throat. video viewing of the voice box with a small device is powerful for identifying and treating throat foreign substances. it allows identification of rare locations of foreign substances and stubborn ones.",0
"this review addresses the pathophysiology and treatment of hemorrhagic shock - a condition produced by rapid and significant loss of intravascular volume, which may lead sequentially to hemodynamic instability, decreases in oxygen delivery, decreased tissue perfusion, cellular hypoxia, organ damage, and death. hemorrhagic shock can be rapidly fatal. the primary goals are to stop the bleeding and to restore circulating blood volume. resuscitation may well depend on the estimated severity of hemorrhage. it now appears that patients with moderate hypotension from bleeding may benefit by delaying massive fluid resuscitation until they reach a definitive care facility. on the other hand, the use of intravenous fluids, crystalloids or colloids, and blood products can be life saving in those patients who are in severe hemorrhagic shock. the optimal method of resuscitation has not been clearly established. a hemoglobin level of 7-8 g/dl appears to be an appropriate threshold for transfusion in critically ill patients with no evidence of tissue hypoxia. however, maintaining a higher hemoglobin level of 10 g/dl is a reasonable goal in actively bleeding patients, the elderly, or individuals who are at risk for myocardial infarction. moreover, hemoglobin concentration should not be the only therapeutic guide in actively bleeding patients. instead, therapy should be aimed at restoring intravascular volume and adequate hemodynamic parameters.",1
"pallister-hall syndrome was first identified in unearthed human remains. the first two bodies had unusual features including a brain mass, missing anus, a sixth finger in the center, and death after birth. as more cases were found, it became clear that phs is not such a rare disorder. shortly after, it was recognized that the disease runs in the families due to changes in the gene called gli3. other problems can be caused by changes in the same gene gli3. different changes in the different parts of the gene cause different problems.",0
"the most important causes of chronic cough were (most to least): cough variant asthma (cva), inflammation of the nose (rhinitis) and/or sinuses (sinusitis), gastroesophageal reflux (gerc), medicine related, inflammation of airways (eosinophilic bronchitis -eb), allergies, and unknown cause. other lung and heart diseases caused chronic cough in a small number of patients nighttime cough occurred the most in cva than the other diseases. cva was associated with nose allergy (atopic rhinitis) which changed with the seasons and increased in autumn. gerc was associated with daytime cough, cough with eating, and with reflux. productive cough occurred more in rhinnitis and/or sinusitis. there were more patients with cva and gerc in this study than in the study before in another city. but there were less patients with eb and allergic cough in this study. the most common causes of chronic cough in this study were cva, rhinitis and/or sinusitis, gerc, medicine related, eb, and allergy related. this was different from studies done before in other cities. the range of signs and symptoms of chronic cough are important in order to find out the causes.",0
"hiatus hernia refers to when the upper part of the stomach pushes up through the diaphragm into the chest. the most common type (type 1 or sliding hiatus hernia), looseness of the ligament that attaches the esophagus to the diaphragm, causes the part of the stomach that is closest to the esophagus to push up. sliding hiatus hernia is easily diagnosed by a swallowing test during x-ray, a flexible tube with a light and camera attached, or an esophagus test when more than 2 cm along an axis. however, the movement of the junction between the esophagus and stomach doesn't allow for dependable detection of smaller abnormalities using a flexible tube with a light and camera attached or x-ray. detecting lesser separation between the esophagus and the diaphragm can only be done reliably with a high-resolution esophagus test, which allows a real time location of the parts of the junction between the esophagus and stomach without misrepresentation due to movement.",0
"objective: although continuing antidepressant treatment after patients have responded to medication has been shown to greatly reduce the risk of relapse, this risk is not eliminated. a number of theories have been proposed to account for this apparent loss of efficacy. a common initial approach to managing relapse is to increase the dose of antidepressant. we prospectively evaluated the likelihood of response to increasing the fluoxetine doses in patients relapsing during a long-term efficacy study of two fluoxetine dosing regimens. method: patients meeting the dsm-iv criteria for major depressive disorder with modified hamd17 scores > or =18 and cgi-severity scores > or =4 were treated for 13 weeks with open-label 20 mg/day fluoxetine in a multicenter us study. responders (n = 501) were randomized to 20 mg fluoxetine daily, placebo, or 90 mg enteric-coated fluoxetine weekly for 25 weeks of double-blind continuation treatment. if the patients relapsed during the continuation phase, they were offered a 25-week optional rescue treatment phase during which the study medication dose was increased as follows: (1) patients on placebo had treatment with fluoxetine 20 mg/day reinitiated, (2) patients on fluoxetine 20 mg/day had their dose increased to 40 mg/day, and (3) patients on a 90-mg weekly dose had their dose increased to 90 mg twice a week. the results of the rescue phase for the latter two groups who relapsed while on continuation treatment with fluoxetine are reported. response was defined as a 50% reduction in the modified hamd17 score since time of relapse and a cgi-severity score < or =2. additional efficacy analyses included hamd and cgi-severity changes from baseline to endpoint. safety measures included assessment of treatment-emergent adverse events, vital signs, and laboratory measures. results: overall, patients relapsing during the continuation treatment responded to an increased dose (57% of the 40-mg-daily group and 72% of the enteric-coated 90-mg-twice-weekly group). mean modified hamd17 scores decreased from a mean of approximately 20 to below 8 and were maintained for up to 6 months in the responders. thirty-five percent of patients either did not respond or initially responded but again relapsed after augmentation of medication. conclusions: the patients relapsing after initially responding to fluoxetine can benefit from an increase in fluoxetine dose. these results also generally support increasing dose as a first-line treatment strategy for a patient who has relapsed while taking a previously effective dose of an antidepressant. increasing enteric-coated fluoxetine 90 mg once weekly to twice weekly appeared to be as well-tolerated and effective in restoring response as increasing a daily fluoxetine dose from 20 to 40 mg.",1
"gabapentin is a nerve-related pain drug, which in humans is cleared from the body solely by the kidneys and is not attached to proteins in plasma (the liquid part of blood). because the clearance of gabapentin depends on the kidneys, how the body processes gabapentin is investigated in patients who do not make enough urine and who are on dialysis, a process of cleaning the blood of a person whose kidneys are not working normally. plasma samples are collected over an 8-day period after a single oral (by mouth) dose of gabapentin is given. plasma samples before and after being filtered, as well as dialysis fluid, are collected during dialysis sessions performed 2, 4, and 7 days after receiving the gabapentin dose. an average maximum amount of gabapentin in plasma is achieved at 4.7 hours after the dose. the time it takes for the concentration of the gabapentin in the plasma to be reduced by half on non-dialysis days averages 132 hours. about 35% of gabapentin dose is recovered in dialysis fluid, and the average clearance of gabapentin in dialysis was 142 milliliters per minute. the time it takes for the concentration of the gabapentin in the plasma to be reduced by half during dialysis is about 4 hours. gabapentin concentrations in the plasma increased about 30% during the first 2 hours after dialysis as a result of the drug being sent to other parts of the body. it is recommended that patients with end-stage kidney disease who are on dialysis receive a starting 300-mg to 400-mg gabapentin dose. plasma gabapentin concentrations can remain stable by giving 200 to 300 mg of gabapentin after every 4 hours of dialysis.",0
"cardiac implantable electronic devices (cieds) provide lifesaving therapy for the treatment of bradyarrhythmias, ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and advanced systolic heart failure. all pacemakers have 2 basic functions: (1) to pace and (2) to sense intrinsic electrical activity of the heart. most pacemakers are programmed to inhibit pacing when they sense native electrical activity and only pace in the absence of intrinsic electrical activity. more specifically, pacemakers can be programmed to set which chamber or chambers will pace, which chamber or chambers will sense intrinsic electrical activity, how the pacemaker will respond to sensed electrical activity (ie, inhibit pacing), and if rate-adaptive pacing will be used.",1
"introduction: pallister-hall syndrome (phs) is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by polydactyly, bifid or shortened epiglottis, visceral anomalies, hypothalamic hamartoma often combined with hypopituitarism. phs is characterized by significant variability in the expression of clinical symptoms. the clinical course ranges from mild with a good prognosis to severe and which can lead to death during the neonatal period. case report: two-years-old girl with facial dysmorphia, skeletal malformations of hand and feet and growth hormone deficiency. phs was diagnosed on the basis of the presented symptoms and genetic tests. summary: skeletal malformations, such as polydactyly or oligodactyly, are a markers which can be associated with endocrinological disorders. quick and correct diagnosis would help in planning treatment during childhood and giving family counseling, including prenatal advice regarding the next pregnancy of the child's mother.",1
"the most frequent type of dwarfism, achondroplasia (ach), is caused by mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3) gene. mutations in the fgfr3 result in bone growth impairments of variable severity including hypochondroplasia (hch), thanatophoric dysplasia types i (tdi) and ii (tdii and severe achondroplasia with developmental delay and acanthosis nigricans (saddan). to explore the molecular mechanisms that result in the different bone growth impairments and with varying severity, the authors investigated the properties of mutated versions of fgfr3. first, the authors checked for addition of a phosphate group to fgfr3. attachement of phosphate groups can change the properites of the receptor and where it is located in the cell. they found that different parts of the receptor had phosphate groups depending on the type of mutation. second, the authors looked for how long the phosphate groups were present in the mutated fgfr3 receptor. _ _ generally, the mutated proteins showed longer presence of the phosphate group on fgfr3. third, the authors investigated where in the cell the mutated proteins were located. image analysis of the cells showed that mutated fgfr3 was in the part of the cell where proteins are made. based on these data, the authors conclude that sustained presence of the phosphate group of fgfr3 causes bone growth impairment and the severity depends on the proportion of the mutated fgfr3 present in the region of the cell involved in synthesizing proteins. fgfr3 signaling, activates another protein called stat1 and causes cartilage cells to stop dividing and dying. phospholipase gamma (plcgamma) mediates the activation of stat1 by fgfr3. _ _ _ the authors conclude that a fgfr3 and two proteins, plcgamma and stat1 are responsible for cell death of cartiliage cells.",0
"potassium is mainly an ion (an atom or molecule that carries an electrical charge) within a body of water within cells. a protein pump in cells called the sodium-potassium pump regulates and moves sodium and potassium in and out of cells. in the kidneys, the filtering and moving of potassium takes place at the glomerulus, a cluster of tiny blood cells. potassium is reabsorbed at the proximal convoluted tubule (in a filtering unit called the nephron that is part of the kidneys) and the thick ascending loop of henle (a part of the nephron in the kidneys). potassium is released at the distal convoluted tubule (a portion of the kidney nephron that functions in both absorption and secretion or release). a hormone called aldosterone increases the release of potassium. potassium is also released through protein channels that allow potassium molecules to pass through the cells and cell boundaries. potassium disorders are related to cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heart beats). hypokalemia occurs when there are low potassium levels in the blood and results in weakness, fatigue, and muscle twitching.",0
"genetic and clinical studies have linked variation in a specific dna sequence for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr), a certain protein, with high blood pressure. some evidence shows that treatment with riboflavin (a molecule that attaches to mthfr) can lower blood pressure (bp) in patients with high blood pressure and an altered dna sequence for mthfr called 677tt. we tested the impact of this altered dna sequence on bp through adulthood. we believed that riboflavin would affect the genetic risk of high blood pressure. patients were recruited from the republic of ireland and northern ireland in 2008-2012. the altered dna sequence of mthfr 677tt was found in 12% of adults. from 18 to 70 years, this altered dna sequence, or genotype, was linked with increased risk of high blood pressure after adjusting for blood pressure medication use, age, sex, body mass, alcohol, total cholesterol, and other factors. low or no riboflavin (seen in 30.2% and 30.0% of participants, respectively) worsened the genetic risk of high blood pressure. patients with a certain genotype along with no riboflavin had a 3-fold increased risk compared to patients with the standard genotype along with normal riboflavin. up to 65 years, we saw poorer bp control rates on anti-high-bp treatment in participants with a certain dna sequence for mthfr compared to those without this altered dna sequence. a specific gentoype for mthfr is linked with higher bp regardless of homocysteine, a molecule that mthfr acts on, and biases adults to increased risk of high bp and poorer bp control with anti-high-bp treatment. better riboflavin amount is linked with reduced genetic risk. riboflavin treatment may thus give an individualized approach to prevent high bp in adults with a certain genotype for mthfr. still, this needs confirmation in a trial in adults without high bp.",0
"pregabalin, a drug often used to treat nerve damage, abuse has become an emerging concern. the current study aimed to investigate nervous system (brain and spinal cord) damage caused by prolonged high-dose of pregabalin. this dose is similar to that used by addicts. additionally, the study aimed to evaluate the effect of alpha tocopherol, a type of vitamin e, as a possible agent to help side effects. the study evaluated the brain neurotransmitters; dopamine, glutamate, and norepinephrine. neurotransmitters are chemical messengers in the body. the study also assessed (measured) the expression of the cell death-related markers bax, bcl2, and caspase 3. additional tests evaluating three mitogen-activated protein kinases (mapks) was completed. mapks are involved in biological pathways that direct cell response to mitogens, or things that induce cell division. the study also evaluated oxidative stress which is an imbalance between production and accumulation of harmful oxygen reactive species. evaluations of the degenerated cortical neurons, nerve cells within the brain, were also preformed. pregabalin in high doses (150 mg/kg/day and 300 mg/kg/day) disrupted the signaling for cellular processes, reversed ratios of proteins needed for cell cycles, and induced oxidative stress. it also diminished the release of neurotransmitters and increased the count of degenerated neurons. alpha tocopherol treatment significantly reduced the harmful effects induced by pregabalin. alpha tocopherol plays a role in reducing negative side effects induced by pregabalin. it also normalizes neurotransmitter levels, positively effects signaling pathways for cell function, and improves cortical (brain) structure changes. these reasons make alpha tocopherol a promising therapeutic option in patients undergoing prolonged pregabalin therapy.",0
"background: although physical exercise (pe) is recommended for individuals with type 1 diabetes (dm1), participation in exercise is challenging because it increases the risk of severe hypoglycemia and the available therapeutic options to prevent it frequently result in hyperglycemia. there is no clear recommendation about the best timing for exercise. the aim of this study was to compare the risk of hypoglycemia after morning or afternoon exercise sessions up to 36 hours postworkout. methods: this randomized crossover study enrolled subjects with dm1, older than 18 years of age, on sensor-augmented insulin pump (sap) therapy. participants underwent 2 moderate-intensity exercise sessions; 1 in the morning and 1 in the afternoon, separated by a 7 to 14 day wash-out period. continuous glucose monitoring (cgm) data were collected 24 hours before, during and 36 hours after each session. results: thirty-five subjects (mean age 30.31 ± 12.66 years) participated in the study. the rate of hypoglycemia was significantly lower following morning versus afternoon exercise sessions (5.6 vs 10.7 events per patient, incidence rate ratio, 0.52; 95% ci, 0.43-0.63; p < .0001). most hypoglycemic events occurred 15-24 hours after the session. on days following morning exercise sessions, there were 20% more cgm readings in near-euglycemic range (70-200 mg/dl) than on days prior to morning exercise (p = .003). conclusions: morning exercise confers a lower risk of late-onset hypoglycemia than afternoon exercise and improves metabolic control on the subsequent day.",1
"background: although bone mineral density (bmd) testing to screen for osteoporosis (bmd t score, −2.50 or lower) is recommended for women 65 years of age or older, there are few data to guide decisions about the interval between bmd tests. methods: we studied 4957 women, 67 years of age or older, with normal bmd (t score at the femoral neck and total hip, −1.00 or higher) or osteopenia (t score, −1.01 to −2.49) and with no history of hip or clinical vertebral fracture or of treatment for osteoporosis, followed prospectively for up to 15 years. the bmd testing interval was defined as the estimated time for 10% of women to make the transition to osteoporosis before having a hip or clinical vertebral fracture, with adjustment for estrogen use and clinical risk factors. transitions from normal bmd and from three subgroups of osteopenia (mild, moderate, and advanced) were analyzed with the use of parametric cumulative incidence models. incident hip and clinical vertebral fractures and initiation of treatment with bisphosphonates, calcitonin, or raloxifene were treated as competing risks. results: the estimated bmd testing interval was 16.8 years (95% confidence interval [ci], 11.5 to 24.6) for women with normal bmd, 17.3 years (95% ci, 13.9 to 21.5) for women with mild osteopenia, 4.7 years (95% ci, 4.2 to 5.2) for women with moderate osteopenia, and 1.1 years (95% ci, 1.0 to 1.3) for women with advanced osteopenia. conclusions: our data indicate that osteoporosis would develop in less than 10% of older, post-menopausal women during rescreening intervals of approximately 15 years for women with normal bone density or mild osteopenia, 5 years for women with moderate osteopenia, and 1 year for women with advanced osteopenia.",1
"the ongoing global pandemic is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), also known covid-19 (a viral, breathing-related disease). it has threatened public health and drawn worldwide attention. the short- and long-term effects of covid-19 on the nervous system pose major public health challenges. patients with covid-19 present a wide range of symptoms of the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). it is essential to better understand how covid-19 affects the nervous system. increasing current understanding will reduce the long-term effects covid-19 may cause within the brain. despite rapid progress in better understanding how covid-19 hurts the human body, the long-term effects of the virus on the brain are still unclear. there are several possible ways covid-19 affects the central nervous system. one of these ways is by potentially hurting nerve cells. second, the virus may cause body-wide inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) that may activate the immune system. third, covid-19 may be highly attracted to a specific pathway into cells and can then rapidly distribute throughout the body. fourth, the virus may cause disease by decreasing oxygen and increase blood clotting within the body. and lastly, covid-19 may cause body-wide inflammation that decreases brain function. despite not fully understanding how covid-19 causes nerve injury, the authors hoped to provide a review of clinical reports, documented human health effects, and potential pathways of covid-19-caused brain damage. the aim of this paper was to assist in early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of covid-19-caused brain damage. additionally, the authors hope this can help predict covid-19 related effects before they occur and decrease viral spread in general.",0
"there is evidence that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), a severe breathing-related virus, can infect various body organs, like heart cells. this review focuses on the effects of sars-cov-2 in the heart after direct infection that can cause myocarditis (heart muscle inflammation) and possible treatments. the main points are: (1) viral entry: sars-cov-2 uses specific cell parts to attach to heart cells. thus, different blockers of specific cell parts may help with sars-cov-2-infected heart cells. (2) viral replication: sars-cov-2 uses a specific molecule for replication. drugs acting against a specific form of viral replication for heart cells can be effective. (3) cell degradation and transport molecules: sars-cov-2 alters cell degradation to block virus removal and promote virus replication by making transport molecules as replication sites. (4) immune response: patient immune response is altered to evade paitent cell attacks against sars-cov-2 and increased inflammation by impairing immune cells. efficiency of immune-system-suppressing therapy must be explained. (5) intentional cell death: sars-cov-2 blocks intentional cell death in early stages and causes cell death in later stages. (6) energy metabolism: sars-cov-2 infection leads to damaged energy metabolism that leads to a decrease in energy and reactive chemical production.

"we analyzed the short-term and long-term outcome of 42 patients with distal type aortic dissection. twenty-eight patients underwent intensive medical therapy within two weeks after the onset of pain (acute dissection). the remaining 14 patients had chronic dissection. the goals of medical treatment were to control blood pressure and to attain a negative c-reactive protein test result. hospital survival rate in the patients with acute dissection was 96% (27/28). in-hospital complications included changes in mental status, renal dysfunction, bradycardia, orthostatic hypotension, and liver dysfunction, all of which were managed medically. three of these patients underwent surgical therapy in the chronic phase and were discharged uneventfully. fifteen (62.5%) of the 24 medically treated patients were discharged with negative c-reactive protein tests. spontaneous resolution of a dissection was demonstrated by radiological examinations in 8 cases. five-year survival rates in 24 medically treated patients was 93%. hospital survival rate in the patients with chronic dissection was 100% (14/14). the rigorous control of blood pressure in the acute phase, and subsequent meticulous evaluation of the dissection by radiological tests and c-reactive protein test provides acceptable short-term and long-term outcomes of patients with acute distal dissection without the need for emergency surgical intervention.",1
"we looked at how helpful routine lab testing is for finding underlying causes in older men diagnosed with osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become weak and brittle). most men with and without osteoporosis had one or more abnormal lab measurement. few single lab abnormalities were more common in men with osteoporosis. routine lab testing in older men with osteoporosis may not be helpful. we aim to rate how useful recommended lab testing is to find underlying causes of osteoporosis in older men by looking at the number of older men with lab abnormalities with and without osteoporosis during a specific period. we studied 1,572 men 65 years old and older who has bone mineral density (bmd) testing and many other lab measurements. we checked for links of any lab abnormalities with osteoporosis and the number of men with osteoporosis needed to test to find one more lab abnormality compared to testing men without osteoporosis. we found that about 60% of men with and without osteoporosis had one or more lab abnormality. among lab tests, only not enough vitamin d and high alkaline phosphatase (suggesting damage to liver or bone disorder) were more likely in men with osteoporosis. too much cortisol (stress hormone) and overactive thyroid (metabolism-regulating hormone) were rare and not meaningfully more common in men with osteoporosis. no men with osteoporosis had high levels of calcium in the urine. though most of these older men had one or more lab abnormality, few often-recommended tests were more common in men with osteoporosis than in those without. except for possibly vitamin d and alkaline phosphatase, usefulness of routine lab testing to find possible underlying causes in older men with osteoporosis seems low. results may not apply to younger men or to older men thought to have osteoporosis from underlying causes.",0
"hyperinflammation and cytokine storm has been noted as a poor prognostic factor in patients with severe pneumonia related to coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). in covid-19, pathogenic myeloid cell overactivation is found to be a vital mediator of damage to tissues, hypercoagulability, and the cytokine storm. these cytokines unselectively infiltrate various tissues, such as the lungs and heart, and nervous system. this cytokine storm can hence cause multi-organ dysfunction and life-threatening complications. mavrilimumab is a monoclonal antibody (mab) that may be helpful in some cases with covid-19. during an inflammation, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf) release is crucial to driving both innate and adaptive immune responses. the gm-csf immune response is triggered when an antigen attaches to the host cell and induces the signaling pathway. mavrilimumab antagonizes the action of gm-csf and decreases the hyperinflammation associated with pneumonia in covid-19, therefore strengthening the rationale that mavrilimumab when added to the standard protocol of treatment could improve the clinical outcomes in covid-19 patients, specifically those patients with pneumonia. with this review paper, we aim to demonstrate the inhibitory effect of mavrilimumab on cytokine storms in patients with covid-19 by reviewing published clinical trials and emphasize the importance of extensive future trials.",1

"as of january 20, 2021, a total of 24,135,690 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) and 400,306 associated deaths had been reported in the united states (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_casesper100klast7days). on december 18, 2020, the food and drug administration (fda) issued an emergency use authorization (eua) for moderna covid-19 vaccine administered as 2 doses, 1 month apart to prevent covid-19. on december 19, 2020, the advisory committee on immunization practices (acip) issued an interim recommendation for use of moderna covid-19 vaccine (1). as of january 10, 2021, a reported 4,041,396 first doses of moderna covid-19 vaccine had been administered in the united states, and reports of 1,266 (0.03%) adverse events after receipt of moderna covid-19 vaccine were submitted to the vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers). among these, 108 case reports were identified for further review as possible cases of severe allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis. anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction that occurs rarely after vaccination, with onset typically within minutes to hours (2). among these case reports, 10 cases were determined to be anaphylaxis (a rate of 2.5 anaphylaxis cases per million moderna covid-19 vaccine doses administered), including nine in persons with a documented history of allergies or allergic reactions, five of whom had a previous history of anaphylaxis. the median interval from vaccine receipt to symptom onset was 7.5 minutes (range = 1-45 minutes). among eight persons with follow-up information available, all had recovered or been discharged home. among the remaining case reports that were determined not to be anaphylaxis, 47 were assessed to be nonanaphylaxis allergic reactions, and 47 were considered nonallergic adverse events. for four case reports, investigators have been unable to obtain sufficient information to assess the likelihood of anaphylaxis. this report summarizes the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of case reports of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and nonanaphylaxis allergic reactions, after receipt of the first dose of moderna covid-19 vaccine during december 21, 2020-january 10, 2021, in the united states. cdc has issued updated interim clinical considerations for use of mrna covid-19 vaccines currently authorized in the united states (3) and interim considerations for preparing for the potential management of anaphylaxis (4).",1
"fluoxetine is a type of antidepressant that is also called prozac. twenty-five patients with a diagnosis of panic disorder, a type of anxiety with unexpected events of intense fear, who either did or did not have agoraphobia (an intense fear of open spaces or leaving the home) are treated openly with fluoxetine for up to 12 months. for most patients, treatment is started at 5 mg/day to minimize side effects that is connected with starting the medication at a higher dose. nineteen (76%) experienced small to major improvement in panic attacks. four (16%) were unable to handle fluoxetine because of side effects. starting treatment of panic disorder with low doses of fluoxetine may increase its acceptability and allow more patients to benefit from fluoxetine.",0
"gabapentin is an antiseizure drug, which in man is cleared just by kidney removal and is not bound to blood proteins. because gabapentin clearance is dependent on kidney function, the drug activity of gabapentin was investigated in patients unable to make urine and maintained on artifical kidney machines or hemodialysis. we took blood samples over an 8-day period after treatment of single 400-mg swallowed doses of gabapentin. blood and kidney solution samples were obtained during treatment sessions performed 2, 4, and 7 days after dosing. an average maximum gabapentin blood level of 6.0 micrograms/ml was measured at 4.7 hours after the dose. the time for half of gabapentin to clear on non-hemodialysis days was 132 hours. around 35% of the gabapentin dose was recovered in the fluid of the artificial kidney machine. the average hemodialysis clearance of gabapentin was 142 ml/min; around 93% of the standard dialyzer clearance. the time for half of gabapentin to clear during hemodialysis was around 4 hours. blood gabapentin levels increased around 30% during the first 2 hours after hemodialysis due to drug redistribution in the body. it is recommended that patients with kidney failure and on hemodialysis get an initial 300-mg to 400-mg gabapentin starting dose. blood gabapentin levels can be maintained by giving 200 to 300 mg of gabapentin after every 4 hours of hemodialysis.",0
"the aim of newborn screening is to detect newborns with serious, treatable disorders so as to facilitate appropriate interventions to avoid or ameliorate adverse outcomes. mass biochemical testing of newborn babies was pioneered in the 1960s with the introduction of screening for phenylketonuria, a rare inborn error of metabolism, tested by using a dried blood spot sample. the next disorder introduced into screening programs was congenital hypothyroidism and a few more much rarer disorders were gradually included. two recent advances have greatly changed the pace: modification of tandem mass spectrometry and dna extraction and analysis from newborn screening dried blood spot. these two technologies make the future possibilities of newborn screening seem almost unlimited. newborn screening tests are usually carried out on a dried blood spot sample, for which there are special analytical considerations. dried blood spot calibrators and controls, prepared on the same lot number of filter paper, are needed. methods have a co-efficient of variation of about 10% due to the increased variability of a dried filter paper sample compared with other biochemical samples. the haematocrit is an additional variable not able to be measured. also of importance is obtaining a balance between the sensitivity and specificity of each assay. fixing cut-off points for action needs consideration of what is an acceptable percentage of the population to recall for further testing. few assays are 100% discriminatory. programs in australasia currently screen for at least 30 disorders. detection of these requires not only the assay of a primary marker but often determination of a ratio of that marker with another, or possibly an alternative assay, for example a dna mutation. the most important disorders screened for are described briefly: phenylketonuria, primary congenital hypothyroidism, cystic fibrosis, the galactosaemias, medium-chain acyl-coa dehydrogenase deficiency, glutaryl-coa dehydrogenase deficiency and congenital adrenal hyperplasia, together with several other disorders detectable by tandem mass spectrometry. newborn screening deals with rare disorders and benefit cannot be shown easily without very large pilot studies. there have been randomised controlled trials of screening for cystic fibrosis, and now several studies are beginning to establish the benefit of tandem mass spectrometry screening for disorders of fatty acid and amino acid metabolism. two things will influence the new directions for newborn screening: the development of effective treatments for hitherto untreatable disorders, and advancing technology, enabling new testing strategies to be developed. there are novel treatments on the horizon for many discrete disorders. susceptibility testing has recently been considered for newborn screening application, but is more controversial. newborn screening has entered a new and exciting phase, with an explosion of new treatments, new technologies, and, possibly in the future, new preventive strategies.",1
"patients with end-stage renal disease (esrd) on regular, ongoing (maintenance) dialysis have a high risk of developing hyperkalemia. hyperkalemia is defined as a potassium level in the blood that is higher than normal. currently, the main treatments of hyperkalemia in patients with esrd are dialysis, eating a diet low in potassium, and avoiding medicines that increase the risk of hyperkalemia. in this paper, we focus on the issues and problems associated with the treatment of hyperkalemia in patients on maintenance dialysis. we present a case to illustrate these issues. we also discuss potential treatments, other than dialysis, for these patients. newer drugs , such as patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate bind to potassium. these potassium-binding drugs may reduce the need for the very strict dialysis diet. because the dialysis diet is very strict, there may be problems getting enough nutrition for patients with esrd. these potassium-binding drugs may also reduce the risk of potentially life-threatening hyperkalemia.",0
"for background, anastrozole is an important drug ingredient for treatment of hormone-sensitive breast cancer (bc) in women who have finished their last period. however, treatment with the only available drug taken by mouth is linked with serious side effects that worsen with greater doses. these side effects include hot flashes, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, nausea, diarrhea, headache, and others. in contrast, a steady release of anastrozole could minimize these serious side effects from the drug. anastrozole administered by a patch on the skin was created for efficient administration, avoiding drug crystals in the body, desired drug release, storage ease, easy handling, stability, and stickiness on the skin. continuous anastrozole treatment was studied in cells designed to measure the success of oils, creams, and gels. drug reactions in blood from the final anastrozole treatment on skin was tested in beagle dogs. to analyze the drug, a specific filtration method was created and verified. after enough drug exposure, a sustained 65% drug release from the skin treatment over 48 hours was obtained. data in living animals showed good anastrozole blood concentration overtime, avoiding the worst of side effects linked with treatment by mouth but matching its helpful blood levels up to 72 hours. in conclusion, applying anastrozole by skin shows improved drug reactions and safety. the treatment is a promising option to treat human bc by reducing unwanted side effects.",0
"diets low in carbs and proteins and high in fat quicken the creation of liver ketone bodies (kb) (particles made from fat breakdown). kb are used for energy creation in certain body parts. the creation and use of kb from fat breakdown are monitored both at the cellular and multi-cellular level. the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (pparα) is a major regulator of the creation of kb made from fat breakdown. it combines diet signals to the start up of cellular systems monitoring fat breakdown and kb creation. new factors, like sleep-wake patterns and cellular signals, may strongly influence this metabolic monitoring. however, kb are not just energy particles but also signaling particles. β-hydroxybutyrate (a particle made from fat breakdown) blocks some cellular processes. this creates a connection between products of liver fat breakdown and changes in gene expression without changes to the dna sequence. ketogenic diets (kd) or low-carb diets are used to treat different forms of infatile epilepsy, a disorder in babies that disturbs brain and nerve activity and causes seizures. infantile epilepsy is also caused by flaws in gene expression. however, researchers are now focusing on using kd in other diseases, such as cancer, nerve-related and metabolic disorders. more evidence is needed to use kd diets to treat diseases.",0
"46 year old male with past medical history of schizoaffective disorder and chronic lower back pain, was admitted for management of worsening depression and anxiety. he was started on gabapentin, 300mg twice daily for his back pain and anxiety symptoms. his only other medication was hydrocodone. over next few days, he started developing worsening bilateral lower extremity edema. he did not have any cardiovascular related symptoms. physical exam was only significant for 3+ pitting edema with all laboratory values and imaging being unremarkable. gabapentin was discontinued and his lower extremity swelling improved over subsequent days. incidence of pedal edema with gabapentin use is approximately 7 to 7.5% with all studies being in elderly patients receiving doses above 1200 mg/day. this case illustrates that lower doses of gabapentin can also cause this adverse effect. it is important to recognize this adverse effect because gabapentin is used in conditions like diabetic neuropathy, which is associated with multiple co-morbidities that can give rise to bilateral leg swelling. presence of gabapentin induced leg swelling can thus confound the clinical picture.",1
"basal insulin secretion was compared in nine islet-cell antibody positive, non-diabetic first-degree relatives of children with type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus and nine normal control subjects matched for age, sex and weight. acute insulin responses to a 25 g intravenous glucose tolerance test were similar in the two groups (243 (198-229) vs 329 (285-380) mu.l-1 x 10 min-1, mean (+/- se), p = 0.25). fasting plasma insulin was assayed in venous samples taken at one min intervals for 2 h. time series analysis was used to demonstrate oscillatory patterns in plasma insulin. autocorrelation showed that regular oscillatory activity was generally absent in the islet-cell antibody-positive group, whereas a regular 13 min cycle was shown in control subjects (p less than 0.0001). fourier transformation did, however, show a 13 min spectral peak in the islet-cell antibody positive group, consistent with intermittent pulsatility. we conclude that overall oscillatory patterns of basal insulin secretion are altered in islet-cell antibody positive subjects even when the acute insulin response is within the normal range.",1
"specialists who treat diseases in the joints, muscles, and bones, called rheumatologists, are increasingly aware of swollen joints (synovitis) with pitting edema, a condition where excess fluid builds up in one part of the body and pressing into the swollen area leaves a pit or indentation. the remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema (rs3pe) syndrome is a rare disease with swollen joints and pitting edema. rs3pe has been reported with a number of conditions that include polymyalgia rheumatica (a disorder that causes muscle pain and stiffness, mainly in the shoulders and hips), rheumatoid arthritis (arthritis whereby immune cells attack healthy cells), an immune system disorder that causes dry eyes and mouth called sjögren's syndrome, and a type of arthritis linked to psoriasis (a skin disease causing red, itchy scaly patches). synovitis with pitting edema is now being increasingly seen in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), a chronic disease where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells and tissues. researchers report a patient who presented with edema (swelling) of hands and feet and was diagnosed eventually with definite lupus. with imaging tools, fluid build up in the joints and inflammation (redness and swelling from fighting an infection) of the top layer of tendons (tenosynovitis) were confirmed to be associated with the otherwise-unexplained edema in the limbs.",0
"postpartum depression (ppd) is common, disabling, and treatable. the strongest risk factor is a history of mood or anxiety disorder, especially having active symptoms during pregnancy. as ppd is one of the most common complications of childbirth, it is vital to identify best treatments for optimal maternal, infant, and family outcomes. new understanding of ppd pathophysiology and emerging therapeutics offer the potential for new ways to add to current medications, somatic treatments, and evidence-based psychotherapy. the benefits and potential harms of treatment, including during breastfeeding, are presented.",1
"importance: hand osteoarthritis is a musculoskeletal problem that is associated with hand pain, stiffness, functional limitation, decreased grip strength, and reduced quality of life. objective: to evaluate the effectiveness of nighttime orthoses on the second or third finger of the dominant hand in controlling pain in women with symptomatic osteoarthritis (oa) in the interphalangeal joint. design: randomized controlled trial. setting: outpatient clinic. participants: fifty-two women with symptomatic oa and presence of heberden's and bouchard's nodes, allocated randomly to the intervention group or the control group. intervention: the intervention group used a nighttime orthosis on the second or third finger of the dominant hand. both groups participated in an educational session. outcomes and measures: the following parameters were measured: pain (numerical rating scale, australian/canadian osteoarthritis hand index), grip and pinch strength, function (cochin hand functional scale), and manual performance (moberg pick up test). results: the intervention group showed a statistically significant improvement in pain (p < .001) and hand function. the improvement in pain correlated with cochin hand functional scale scores and the absence of bouchard's nodes in the third finger, which are predictors of the best prognosis for treatment with a nighttime orthosis. conclusions and relevance: this study demonstrates that nighttime orthoses are effective in reducing pain and lead to improvement in hand function in women with hand oa. they are therefore specifically recommended for nonpharmacological treatment of hand oa. what this article adds: orthoses can be considered, together with manual exercises and joint protection, as an intervention to reduce symptoms and improve hand function in people with hand oa. this study is an important step in empowering occupational therapists to determine appropriate and effective intervention for clients with oa.",1
"this review focuses on the use of plant based foods for increasing the immunity of all age groups against covid-19 (a viral, breathing-related illness). in humans, coronaviruses, which cause covid-19, are included in the type of viruses that cause the common cold and, recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars), which can cause fever, cough, and breathing problems. new infectious diseases, such as sars, present a major threat to public health. the new coronavirus has quickly spread to many countries and has been declared a pandemic by the world health organization. people with a low or weakened immune response are probably most effected by covid-19. plant based foods increase the good bacteria in the stomach which are helpful and make up of 85% of the immune system. drinking plenty of water, consuming minerals like magnesium and zinc, vitamins, herbs, food with a lot of vitamins c, d & e, and a healthy life style can promote health and can fight this infection. different research studies find that a powerful antioxidant (a vitamin or mineral that can repair cells) called glutathione and a plant-based vitamin called quercetin may prevent infections, including covid-19. in conclusion, plant based foods play a key role in strengthening the immunity of people to control covid-19.",0
"hyperkalemia (high blood potassium) is an electrolyte issue with possibly life-threatening effects. no agreement exists for treating high blood potassium. guidelines vary based on postassium level and management of immediate or long-lasting high blood potassium. this review identifies many issues and needs regarding high blood potassium. real-world studies are needed to better understand the real-world widespreadness of high blood potassium. improving treatment of high blood potassium, including classification, potassium monitoring, and specific medication use, is necessary. while monitoring blood potassium should be individualized, increased monitoring should be considered for those with chronic kidney disease, diabetes, heart failure, history of high blood potassium, or enzyme-based therapy which blocks kidney-related monitoring of blood pressure and electrolytes. new potassium binders (patiromer sorbitex calcium and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) may help renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor (raasi) therapy, which blocks kidney-related monitoring of blood pressure and electrolytes. improving understanding of these newer potassium binders may increase confidence in helping those with high blood potassium. the availability of newer k+ binders needs more research to determine if more strict dietary k+ restrictions are needed for patients. personalized blood potassium monitoring in those with high risk of high blood potassium and new potassium-binding agents may improve certain kidney-related, enzyme-based therapies and management of high blood potassium.",0
"background: myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (me/cfs) is characterized by unexplained persistent fatigue (long-lasting tiredness). me/cfs is commonly accompanied by cognitive dysfunction, sleeping disturbances, orthostatic intolerance (inability to stand up quickly), fever, lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes), and irritable bowel syndrome (ibs - colon disorder that leads to belly pain, gas, diarrhea, and constipation). the extent to which the stomach microbiome (gut bacteria) and inflammation (redness and swelling from infection-fighting) are associated (linked) with me/cfs is unknown. this study evaluated 50 me/cfs patients and 50 healthy controls. analysis revealed associations between ibs co-morbidity, body mass index, fecal (poop) bacterial composition, and bacterial metabolic pathways. no associated was found between me/cfs status and plasma (blood) immune molecules. ibs co-morbidity (co-diagnosis) was the most strongly associated endpoint with me/cfs status. me/cfs subgroups, defined by ibs status, could be distinguished from control subjects with high predictive accuracy. bacterial taxa (bacterial groups) predictive of me/cfs patients with ibs were distinct from taxa associated with me/cfs patients without ibs. two bacteria, alistipes and faecalibacterium, emerged as the top biomarkers of me/cfs with ibs. two bacteria, bacteroides and bacteroides vulgatus, were the top biomarkers of me/cfs without ibs. decreased metabolic pathways associated with unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and increased atrazine (herbicide) degradation pathways were independent of ibs co-morbidity. increased vitamin b6 biosynthesis/salvage and pyrimidine ribonucleoside (dna building blocks) degradation were the top metabolic pathways in me/cfs without ibs. these pathways were also top in the total me/cfs cohort. in me/cfs subgroups, symptom severity measures were correlated with the abundance of distinct bacterial taxa and metabolic pathways. independent of ibs, me/cfs is associated with gut microbiome imbalance and distinct bacterial metabolic disturbances. these factors may influence disease severity. these findings indicate that gut microbial imbalance features associated with me/cfs may be hidden by ibs. these findings may enable more accurate diagnosis and improve therapeutic (treatment) strategies in me/cfs subgroups.",0
"certain precise measuring tools can measure specific, self-made proteins that tag four major markers of autoimmune diabetes (diabetes from the body mistakenly destroying its own cells). however, analysis of these many self-made markers increases costs and time for measurements. we aim to show a quick, low-cost approach for detecting these four self-made markers to check for antibody-related autoimmunity in diabetics. with this new measuring tool, which is called a multi-autoantigen radioimmunoassay (maa), we measured 830 blood samples, 476 of known and 354 of unknown diabetes type. these samples came from type 1 and type 2 diabetics, slow-progressing type 2 diabetics, prediabetics, individuals at risk to develop autoimmune diabetes, siblings of type 1 diabetics, gluten-sensitive patients, and healthy patients. all blood reacting with one or more of the four self-made markers by other tools also reacts with maa, along with eight more, type 1 diabetics whose blood did not react with other tools. also, maa shows high accuracy for disease detection and no detection after analysing 140 unknown blood samples from type 1 diabetics and healthy patients. maa is the first to measure multiple self-made tagging proteins. this new tool appears appropriate for checking if a person's cells mistakenly attack their own diabetes-regulating cells.",0
"fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3) gain-of-function mutations cause dwarfisms, including achondroplasia (ach) and thanatophoric dysplasia (td). the continuously active state of fgfr3 disrupts normal process of bone growth. bone-growth abnormalities have been identified in which primary cilia (pc) function is disrupted. primary cilia are long protrusions on cells that act as an antenna and are important during development. in human ach and td, the impact of fgfr3 mutations on pc in growth plate cartilage remains unknown. here, the authors showed that in cartilage cells from ach and td patients and mice with fgfr3 mutation, the fgfr3 is overactive and it perturbed pc length and formation. they demonstrated that inhibiting fgfr3, using a drug inhibitor, rescued both pc length and formation. the authors also studied the impact of a drug inhibitor of a signaling pathway. interestingly, the drug also rescued pc length and formation. together, we provide evidence that the growth plate defects ascribed to fgfr3-related dwarfisms are potentially due to loss of pc function, and these dwarfisms may represent a novel type of bone growth disorders with defective cilia formation.",0
"overactive thyroid is when too much thyroid hormone produced, when too much stored thyroid hormone released, or when there are internal or external thyroid hormone sources outside the thyroid. the most common causes of too much thyroid hormone made are graves disease, a disease in which infection-preventing cells attack healthy cells and results in an overactive thyroid, or when one or more glandular growths make extra thyroid hormone. the most common causes of too much thyroid hormone released is thyroid inflammation, although the signs are the same as other causes. overactive thyroid can be treated with drugs that block the formation of thyroid hormone, radiation therapy, or surgery to remove the thyroid. radiation therapy is the most widely used treatment in the united states. the choice of treatment depends on the diagnosis, reasons not to use a particular method, how serious the overactive thyroid is, and what the patient wants.",0
"although knee replacement surgery is very common and usually turns out well, amount of function after varies widely. most patients have some physical therapy (pt) after knee replacement, but pt practice varies. we don’t know which amounts and kinds of pt are associated with which outcomes. research has shown that exercise is associated with better outcomes, but studies have not looked at whether this has made its way into clinical practice. we looked at the content, amount, and progression of usual pt services after knee replacement. we also examined associations of specific details of pt after surgery with how much function patients had after 6 months. we collected pt data from patients who were having knee replacement surgery on one side and participating in a clinical trial of a phone-based coaching program. we reviewed pt records from final sessions to find how much patients used the pt and what exercises were done. we used statistical methods to see which parts of pt treatment were associated with 6-month outcomes. in all, we looked at 112 records from 30 pt sites. the types and amounts of exercises, and how they progressed, varied widely. exercises that used weights or other resistance were use more than body-weight exercises (on average 21 versus 13). progression of exercises was used on average 0 times for exercises with resistance and 1 time for exercises that just used body weight. climbing stairs faster was associated with more pt sessions and the use and progression of body-weight exercises. the evidence suggests that treatments backed by studies are not used as much as they should be and the amount of pt may not be enough to create the best possible outcomes.",0
"the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic has raised concerns about the detrimental effects of antibodies. antibody-dependent enhancement (ade) of infection is one of the biggest concerns in terms of not only the antibody reaction to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) upon reinfection with the virus but also the reaction to covid-19 vaccines. in this study, we evaluated ade of infection by using covid-19 convalescent-phase plasma and bhk cells expressing human fcγ receptors (fcγrs). we found that fcγriia and fcγriiia mediated modest ade of infection against sars-cov-2. although ade of infection was observed in monocyte-derived macrophages infected with sars-cov-2, including its variants, proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression was not upregulated in macrophages. sars-cov-2 infection thus produces antibodies that elicit ade of infection, but these antibodies do not contribute to excess cytokine production by macrophages. importance viruses infect cells mainly via specific receptors at the cell surface. antibody-dependent enhancement (ade) of infection is an alternative mechanism of infection for viruses to infect immune cells that is mediated by antibodies and igg receptors (fcγrs). because ade of infection contributes to the pathogenesis of some viruses, such as dengue virus and feline coronavirus, it is important to evaluate the precise mechanism of ade and its contribution to the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2. here, using convalescent-phase plasma from covid-19 patients, we found that two types of fcγrs, fcγriia and fcγriiia, mediate ade of sars-cov-2 infection. although ade of infection was observed for sars-cov-2 and its recent variants, proinflammatory cytokine production in monocyte-derived macrophages was not upregulated. these observations suggest that sars-cov-2 infection produces antibodies that elicit ade of infection, but these antibodies may not be involved in aberrant cytokine release by macrophages during sars-cov-2 infection.",1
"researchers studied the causes of chronic cough using specific rules for making the diagnosis. a total of 194 patients with chronic cough for at least 3 weeks and normal chest x-rays were included from an outpatient clinic in china. the causes of chronic cough were studied using well established rules. the diagnostic tests included: medical history, physical exam, lung function tests, sputum cell counts, esophagus acid test, cat scan of sinuses or chest, and looking into the nose or lungs with the endoscope. the final diagnosis of the cause of chronic cough was made based on all of these tests plus how patients responded to treatment. the cause of chronic cough was found in about 95% of patients. about 83% had one cause, about 17% hadmore than one cause. the 5 most important causes of cough were: eosinophilc bronchitis (inflammation of the airways), inflammation of the nose (rhinitis) and/or sinuses (sinusitis), cough variant asthma, allergic cough (atopic cough), and gastroesophageal reflux. in this study in china, the types and amount of occurrences of the causes of chronic cough is different from studies done before in western countries. eosinophilic bronchitis and atopic cough are important causes of chronic cough. researchers changed the diagnostic rules for this reason.",0
"prompt and accurate detection of sars-cov-2, the virus that causes covid-19, has been important during public health responses for containing the spread of covid-19, including in hospital settings (1-3). in vitro diagnostic nucleic acid amplification tests (naat), such as real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) can be expensive, have relatively long turnaround times, and require experienced laboratory personnel.* antigen detection tests can be rapidly and more easily performed and are less expensive. the performance† of antigen detection tests, compared with that of naats, is an area of interest for the rapid diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infection. the quidel sofia 2 sars antigen fluorescent immunoassay (fia) (quidel corporation) received food and drug administration emergency use authorization for use in symptomatic patients within 5 days of symptom onset (4). the reported test positive percentage agreement§ between this test and an rt-pcr test result is 96.7% (95% confidence interval [ci] = 83.3%-99.4%), and the negative percentage agreement is 100.0% (95% ci = 97.9%-100.0%) in symptomatic patients.¶ however, performance in asymptomatic persons in a university setting has shown lower sensitivity (5); assessment of performance in a clinical setting is ongoing. data collected during june 30-august 31, 2020, were analyzed to compare antigen test performance with that of rt-pcr in a hospital setting. among 1,732 paired samples from asymptomatic patients, the antigen test sensitivity was 60.5%, and specificity was 99.5% when compared with rt-pcr. among 307 symptomatic persons, sensitivity and specificity were 72.1% and 98.7%, respectively. health care providers must remain aware of the lower sensitivity of this test among asymptomatic and symptomatic persons and consider confirmatory naat testing in high-prevalence settings because a false-negative result might lead to failures in infection control and prevention practices and cause delays in diagnosis, isolation, and treatment.",1
"we studied inappropriate use of drugs in elderly patients in the emergency departments. we also find out what causes inappropriate use of drugs and if it is sometimes done for a good reason. we studied visits to emergency departments in 1992-2000. drugs that are dangerous for elderly and should be used with caution were listed by dr. beers in 1997. drugs from the beers' list were given about 16 million times (over a tenth of emergency visits by elderly) from 1992 to 2000. six drugs accounted for the majority of inappropriate use: promethazine, meperidine, propoxyphene, hydroxyzine, diphenhydramine, and diazepam. there were almost no indications that the use of these drugs was potentially appropriate. for example, less than half of patients that got diphenhydramine and less than 10th that got hydroxyzine had allergies. elderly patients often get inappropriate drugs in the emergency room. potentially appropriate uses do not account for the given drugs. although the list of inappropriate drugs was published in 1997, it has not changed how the drugs are given.",0
"polyuria-polydipsia syndrome consists of the three main effects: central or nephrogenic (kidney-related) diabetes insipidus (constantly-urinating) and primary polydipsia (great thirst). reliable differences between these diagnoses is needed as treatment differs greatly, with the wrong treatment potentially leading to serious side effects. past identification measures using the classical water deprivation test had several pitfalls and clinicians were often left with uncertainity regarding the diagnosis. with the creation of copeptin, a stable and reliable surrogate marker for arginine vasopressin (blood vessel constriction), diagnosis of the polyuria-polydipsia syndrome has been newly evaluated. whereas unstimulated basal copeptin (specific protein) measurement reliably identifies nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, two new tests using stimulated copeptin cutoffs showed a high identification accuracy in differentiating central diabetes insipidus from primary polydipsia. for the hypertonic (very salty) saline infusion test, water-sucking stimulation via a high salt amount is used. this makes the test highly reliable and superior to the classical water deprivation test, but also requires close watch and the availability of rapid sodium measurements to guarantee the test's safety. alternatively, arginine infusion (adding a specific protein in) can be used to stimulate copeptin release, opening the doors for an even shorter and safer diagnostic test. the test protocols of the two tests are provided and a new copeptin-based diagnostic method is proposed to reliably identify between the different entities. furthermore, the role of copeptin as a predictive marker for the development of diabetes insipidus following surgeries in the sellar region (an area of the head) is described.",0
"pressure ulcers, or bedsores, decubitus ulcers and pressure injuries are restricted areas of injury to the skin or underlying body tissue, or both. dressings (ointment or gauze to cover wounds) are widely used to treat pressure ulcers and promote healing. there are many varied dressings to choose from. skin-level agents also have been used as alternatives to dressings for healing. a clear and current overview of all the evidence is required to help make decisions regarding using dressings or skin-level agents to treat pressure ulcers. this review would ideally help those with pressure ulcers and health professionals choose treatments. this review is a study which assesses the probability of complete ulcer healing associated with alternative dressings and skin-level treatments. we included 51 studies (2947 participants) in this review and analyzed the treatments solely to measure the probability of complete healing. the study included 21 different treatments (13 dressings, 6 skin-level treatments, and 2 additional linking treatments). it included data from 39 studies in 2127 participants, of whom 783 had completely healed wounds. we judged the study network to be scattered. overall, there were few participants, with few events, both for number of treatments and mixed treatment analysis. most studies were small or very small. the effect of this sparseness is low reliability in the evidence. this, along with the (mainly) high risk of bias (or prejudice) in the studies, means we judged the majority of evidence to be low or very low quality. we have no confidence in the results regarding the rank order of treatments in this review (very low-quality evidence), but we report a summary of results for some comparisons of treatments compared with standard gauze. we present here only results from evidence we did not consdier to be very low quality, but the reported results should be interpreted while knowing of the very low quality regarding the whole study network. it is not clear if treatments with special protein-breakdown dressings increase the probability of pressure ulcer healing compared with standard gauze. 102 more people were healed with special protein-breakdown dressings per 1000 people than those with standard gauze alone. it is unclear if any of the other treatments examined increase the probability of healing compared with standard gauze (low-quality evidence). some showed metrics consistent with a clinically important benefit and harm. others had a high risk of bias and unreliability. a large analysis of data from 39 studies (examining 21 dressings and skin-level agents for pressure ulcers) is scattered. the evidence is also of low or very low quality (due to risk of bias and unreliability). therefore, we are unable to determine which dressings or skin-level agents are best to heal pressure ulcers. it is unclear whether the treatments are more effective than standard gauze. more research is needed to tell if certain dressings or skin-level agents improve the chance of healing for pressure ulcers. this analysis is uninformative regarding which treatments may best be included in a large trial. it may that research is focused on prevention, leaving clinicians to decide which treatment to use based on wound symptoms, clinical experience, patient preference and cost.",0
"objective: to evaluate the effectiveness of topical pentoxifylline (ptx) on pressure ulcer (pu) healing in critically ill patients. method: in this randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, patients with category i or ii pus were randomly assigned to receive either topical ptx 5% or a placebo twice daily for 14 days. changes in pu characteristics (category and size) were assessed. the category of the pu was determined by the stirling pressure ulcer severity scale (two-digit) at baseline (day zero), day seven and day 14 of treatment. pu length and width was measured with a disposable ruler and expressed as cm2. results: a total of 112 adult patients were enrolled in the study. median pu size and score at day zero were 32 (10.00-69.33)cm2 and 1(1.00-2.00) respectively. in the ptx group, the mean differences (95% confidence interval, ci) of all pu scores and sizes decreased significantly across the intervals (day seven versus day zero, day 14 versus day zero, and day 14 versus day seven), compared with the placebo group conclusion: the severity and size of pus improved significantly in patients who received topical ptx 5% ointment twice a day for 14 days compared with those in the placebo group. topical ptx may be considered as a potential option in the treatment of categories i and ii pus in critically ill patients.",1
"higher blood levels of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (plp) have been linked to lower risk of colorectal cancer (crc). the level of plp in the blood is a sign of the level of vitamin b6 in the blood. this could be explained by inflammation, including types of vitamin b6 metabolism. researchers measured chemicals that are signs (biomarkers) of the amount of vitamin b6 in blood. they studied these 3 biomarkers in relation to the risk of crc. this large study was done in sweden and compared 613 participants with crc to people without crc. the participants were followed from 1985 to 2009. from the start of the study to the time of the crc diagnosis was about 8 years. the biomarkers measured in the blood were plp, pyridoxal, pyridoxic acid (pa), 3-hydroxykynurenine (hk), and xanthurenic acids (xas) researchers calculated the risks of crc and biomarkers for vitamin b6 status, inflammation, and oxidative stress. oxidative stress occurs when the level of free radicals is too high compared to the level of antioxidants in the body. these biomarkers included plp, hk:xa, and par (pa: (plp + pyridoxal)). higher blood plp levels were linked to lower crc risk for many participants. plp sufficiency (enough) compared to deficiency (not enough) was also linked to lower crc risk. the calculated biomarkers, hk: xa and par were both associated with an increased risk for getting crc. for hk:xa and par, this risk was mainly seen in participants with less than 10.5 years of follow-up between blood samples taken at the start of the study and the crc diagnosis. vitamin b6 deficiency (blood plp) is associated with a clear increase in crc risk. the other biomarkers studied (showing vitamin b6 status and vitamin b6-associated oxidative stress and inflammation), may play a role in cancer development rather than starting it.",0
"pectin-based films are wrapping that is made from pectin, a substance extracted from ripe fruits. pectin-based films are biodegradable and biocompatible. additionally, the films are non-toxic, are ph (acid-base) sensitive, and have gelling activity. these qualities make the films of interest in wound dressing. in order to improve how the films responsd to stress and strain, specifically how the material holds up when wet, other biopolymers could be mixed with the pectin-based films. biopolymers are substances that are found within living organisms, just like pectin is found in fruit. the aim of this study was the prepare hydrocolloid (gel-forming) films using a pectin and starch blend with extracts from two different leaves. the film was made to have a controlled release of bioactive compounds and healing properties. bioactive compounds are components of food that influence biological or cellular activity within humans or animals that eat them. the hydrocolloid films were tested for their tensile strength (resistance to tension breakage), water uptake, and polyphenolic release profile in wet environments. polyphenols are compounds with various biological properties, including anti-inflammatory (anti-swelling and -redness from an infection) and antioxidant. the skin anti-inflammatory activity of the hydrocolloid films was assessed (measured) by a test evaluating inflammation on a mouse ear. the wound healing property of the hydrocolloid films was explored in a rat model. the wound healing property was also explored in a human clinical trial looking at lower back pressure ulcers (skin sores). the films showed an adequate water-uptake capacity between 100-160%. the release of active compounds from the hydrocolloid films followed the korsmeyer-peppas equation, which implies that release of healing properties was controlled over time. the mechanical properties of the hydrocolloid films, or how they respond to stress, were not affected by the plant extracts. addition of the same bioactive extracts in a carbohydrate-based film significantly decreased the topical edematous response or the accumulation of watery fluid. applying the loaded hydrocolloid film on the pressure ulcer completely closed the wound after 17 days without any negative side effects. the study concluded that a novel (new) hydrocolloid mixture was produced from starch and pectin. this mixture showed suitable chemical-physical properties to act as a carrier of plant extracts with wound healing properties.",0
"ste20 (sterile 20)/sps-1 related proline/alanine-rich kinase (spak) and oxidative stress-response kinase-1 (osr1) activate the renal cation cotransporters na(+) -k(+) -2cl(-) cotransporter (nkcc2) and na(+) -cl(-) cotransporter (ncc) via phosphorylation. knockout mouse models suggest that osr1 mainly activates nkcc2, while spak mainly activates ncc, with possible cross-compensation. we tested the hypothesis that disrupting both kinases causes severe polyuria and salt-wasting by generating spak/osr1 double knockout (dko) mice. dko mice displayed lower systolic blood pressure compared with spak knockout (spak-ko) mice, but displayed no severe phenotype even after dietary salt restriction. phosphorylation of nkcc2 at spak/osr1-dependent sites was lower than in spak-ko mice, but still significantly greater than in wild type mice. in the renal medulla, there was significant phosphorylation of nkcc2 at spak/osr1-dependent sites despite a complete absence of spak and osr1, suggesting the existence of an alternative activating kinase. the distal convoluted tubule has been proposed to sense plasma [k(+) ], with ncc activation serving as the primary effector pathway that modulates k(+) secretion, by metering sodium delivery to the collecting duct. abundance of phosphorylated ncc (pncc) is dramatically lower in spak-ko mice than in wild type mice, and the additional disruption of osr1 further reduced pncc. spak-ko and kidney-specific osr1 single knockout mice maintained plasma [k(+) ] following dietary potassium restriction, but dko mice developed severe hypokalaemia. unlike mice lacking spak or osr1 alone, dko mice displayed an inability to phosphorylate ncc under these conditions. these data suggest that spak and osr1 are essential components of the effector pathway that maintains plasma [k(+) ].",1
"development of a human model of hemorrhage has provided a unique opportunity to investigate the underlying physiology that defines the individual capacity to avoid the life-threatening clinical condition of inadequate tissue oxygenation known as “shock.” the experimental approach of progressively reducing central blood volume to the point of hemodynamic decompensation with the use of lower body negative pressure has revealed stark distinctions in the physiological compensatory responses between individuals with high compared with low tolerances to blood loss. high tolerance to hemorrhage is defined by a capacity to maintain systemic perfusion pressure and reduce the rate of cerebral hypoperfusion by: (1) protecting cardiac output with greater elevations in heart rate associated with greater cardiac vagal withdrawal and sympathetically mediated adrenergic stimulation; (2) greater increases in systemic peripheral vascular resistance associated with higher sympathetic nerve activation and levels of circulating vasopressor endocrine responses; (3) alternating blood flow between the brain and peripheral tissue with greater sympathetically mediated oscillatory patterns of systemic pressure and flow; and (4) enhancing cardiac filling and cerebral perfusion pressure gradient by optimizing the respiratory pump. when the capacity for these compensatory responses is exhausted, an active vasodilation drops resistance to blood flow allowing for increased perfusion of peripheral tissue. when cardiac filling is no longer adequate to maintain systemic pressure and flow, a reflex-mediated pronounced bradycardia leads to the initiation of decompensatory shock.",1
"the local, systemic, and referred causes of finger pain are generally recognizable by historical features and physical examination findings, although radiographs and laboratory evaluation are often required to support the diagnostic impression. most minor traumatic causes of finger pain require only conservative management, including immobilization followed by exercise. infectious causes of finger pain include cellulitis, tendinitis, paronychia, felon, and infectious emboli, which generally require antibiotics with or without drainage. certain patients with finger pain resulting from infection should be referred to a hand surgeon. vascular and ischemic causes of finger pain represent true emergencies, because tissue viability is dependent on prompt intervention. whereas any sensory neuropathy may present with finger pain, carpal tunnel syndrome is among the most common. systemic rheumatic disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis or vasculitis, may begin with finger pain. in addition, such pain may be the first manifestation of a serious systemic illness, as in hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy. reflex sympathetic dystrophy is an example of referred pain, presumably by way of neural mechanisms. certain infectious, traumatic, and ischemic causes of finger pain must be diagnosed promptly to avoid significant morbidity; depending upon the cause of the symptoms, referral to a hand surgeon, rheumatologist, or neurologist may be appropriate. symptomatic and functional improvement may also be hastened by the input of an occupational therapist.",1
