Acupuncture has been used for asthma; this review searched randomised trials using needle acupuncture. Twelve trials met inclusion criteria. Evidence quality was poor and results inconsistent; thus there is not enough evidence to recommend acupuncture for asthma.,technical
Randomised controlled trials examined antibiotics for sore throat. Antibiotics shortened symptom duration and reduced relapse but had side effects. The benefit was small; most sore throats resolve without antibiotics.,technical
Trials compared different suture materials for repairing perineal tears after childbirth. Studies compared absorbable vs non absorbable sutures and various techniques. The review found little difference in pain or healing; more research is needed.,technical
Thirty-eight studies assessed acupuncture and related therapies for smoking cessation. Most were small and poorly reported. There was little evidence of long-term benefit compared with sham or other interventions.,technical
Randomised studies compared home births and birth centres to hospital labour wards. Alternative settings had fewer interventions and similar perinatal mortality but data quality was limited. Women reported greater satisfaction with home-like environments.,technical
"Trials tested prophylactic antibiotics applied to the respiratory tract for patients on mechanical ventilation. Some studies showed reduced colonisation and pneumonia, but concerns exist about antibiotic resistance and study quality.",technical
"Trials of antiplatelet therapy after ischaemic stroke evaluated early aspirin, dipyridamole and other agents. Results showed modest reductions in recurrent stroke but increased bleeding risk. Large trials are needed to clarify benefits and harms.",technical
Studies of the biophysical profile (BPP) as part of antenatal fetal assessment compared BPP with other tests. Evidence was insufficient to support routine use of BPP because of poor trial quality and conflicting results.,technical
"Randomised controlled trials of drugs for urinary schistosomiasis evaluated praziquantel, metrifonate and other agents. Praziquantel was effective and well tolerated. Evidence on other drugs was weaker and limited.",technical
"Many people have difficulty taking prescribed medicines. Trials examined reminders, packaging aids, and pharmacy-based interventions to improve adherence. Interventions led to small improvements in taking medications but evidence quality was moderate.",plain
Trials of antihypertensive drugs in older adults tested different medicines and doses. Results showed that drug treatment reduced stroke and death compared with no treatment. Side effects were common but benefits outweighed risks.,plain
"People who have had a stroke often receive antiplatelet drugs. Trials of aspirin and other agents tested whether starting treatment early prevents further strokes. Results showed benefits, though the risk of bleeding increased.",plain
"The biophysical profile (BPP) combines ultrasound and fetal heart rate monitoring to assess baby health. Evidence from trials was weak and inconsistent; no strong evidence supports routine BPP, and counting fetal movements may be sufficient.",plain
"Trials of drugs for urinary schistosomiasis compared praziquantel and metrifonate. They found praziquantel worked well, while evidence for other drugs was limited and side effects were problematic.",plain
Antenatal abdominal decompression was studied in a few small trials. The results were inconclusive and provide no clear evidence that the procedure benefits mothers or babies.,plain
Trials compared absorbable stitches with other materials for repairing tears after childbirth. Results suggested absorbable stitches caused less pain and did not need removal; differences were small and evidence quality low.,plain
Trials of acupuncture and similar therapies for quitting smoking found only moderate evidence. Any benefits were short-term and long-term quit rates were not significantly improved compared with sham treatments.,plain
Randomised trials compared giving birth at home or in birth centres with hospital care. Home-like settings had fewer interventions and similar outcomes. More research is needed to confirm these findings.,plain
"Trials tested antiseptic and antibiotic solutions for patients on mechanical ventilation. Results showed some reduction in pneumonia, but evidence quality was low and the benefits uncertain.",plain

Acupuncture has been used for asthma; this review searched randomised trials using needle acupuncture. Twelve trials met inclusion criteria. Evidence quality was poor and results inconsistent; thus there is not enough evidence to recommend acupuncture for asthma.,technical
Randomised controlled trials examined antibiotics for sore throat. Antibiotics shortened symptom duration and reduced relapse but had side effects. The benefit was small; most sore throats resolve without antibiotics.,technical
Trials compared different suture materials for repairing perineal tears after childbirth. Studies compared absorbable vs non absorbable sutures and various techniques. The review found little difference in pain or healing; more research is needed.,technical
Thirty-eight studies assessed acupuncture and related therapies for smoking cessation. Most were small and poorly reported. There was little evidence of long-term benefit compared with sham or other interventions.,technical
Randomised studies compared home births and birth centres to hospital labour wards. Alternative settings had fewer interventions and similar perinatal mortality but data quality was limited. Women reported greater satisfaction with home-like environments.,technical

"Trials tested prophylactic antibiotics applied to the respiratory tract for patients on mechanical ventilation. Some studies showed reduced colonisation and pneumonia, but concerns exist about antibiotic resistance and study quality.",technical
"Trials of antiplatelet therapy after ischaemic stroke evaluated early aspirin, dipyridamole and other agents. Results showed modest reductions in recurrent stroke but increased bleeding risk. Large trials are needed to clarify benefits and harms.",technical
Studies of the biophysical profile (BPP) as part of antenatal fetal assessment compared BPP with other tests. Evidence was insufficient to support routine use of BPP because of poor trial quality and conflicting results.,technical
"Randomised controlled trials of drugs for urinary schistosomiasis evaluated praziquantel, metrifonate and other agents. Praziquantel was effective and well tolerated. Evidence on other drugs was weaker and limited.",technical
"Many people have difficulty taking prescribed medicines. Trials examined reminders, packaging aids, and pharmacy-based interventions to improve adherence. Interventions led to small improvements in taking medications but evidence quality was moderate.",plain
Trials of antihypertensive drugs in older adults tested different medicines and doses. Results showed that drug treatment reduced stroke and death compared with no treatment. Side effects were common but benefits outweighed risks.,plain
"People who have had a stroke often receive antiplatelet drugs. Trials of aspirin and other agents tested whether starting treatment early prevents further strokes. Results showed benefits, though the risk of bleeding increased.",plain
"The biophysical profile (BPP) combines ultrasound and fetal heart rate monitoring to assess baby health. Evidence from trials was weak and inconsistent; no strong evidence supports routine BPP, and counting fetal movements may be sufficient.",plain
"Trials of drugs for urinary schistosomiasis compared praziquantel and metrifonate. They found praziquantel worked well, while evidence for other drugs was limited and side effects were problematic.",plain
Antenatal abdominal decompression was studied in a few small trials. The results were inconclusive and provide no clear evidence that the procedure benefits mothers or babies.,plain
Trials compared absorbable stitches with other materials for repairing tears after childbirth. Results suggested absorbable stitches caused less pain and did not need removal; differences were small and evidence quality low.,plain
Trials of acupuncture and similar therapies for quitting smoking found only moderate evidence. Any benefits were short-term and long-term quit rates were not significantly improved compared with sham treatments.,plain
Randomised trials compared giving birth at home or in birth centres with hospital care. Home-like settings had fewer interventions and similar outcomes. More research is needed to confirm these findings.,plain
"Trials tested antiseptic and antibiotic solutions for patients on mechanical ventilation. Results showed some reduction in pneumonia, but evidence quality was low and the benefits uncertain.",plain
Acupuncture has been used for asthma; this review searched randomised trials using needle acupuncture. Twelve trials met inclusion criteria. Evidence quality was poor and results inconsistent; thus there is not enough evidence to recommend acupuncture for asthma.,technical
Randomised controlled trials examined antibiotics for sore throat. Antibiotics shortened symptom duration and reduced relapse but had side effects. The benefit was small; most sore throats resolve without antibiotics.,technical
Trials compared different suture materials for repairing perineal tears after childbirth. Studies compared absorbable vs non absorbable sutures and various techniques. The review found little difference in pain or healing; more research is needed.,technical
