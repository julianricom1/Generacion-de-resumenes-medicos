0,"Background
This review is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 2005, Issue 4 (and last updated in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 2013 issue 8), on local anaesthetic blockade (LASB) of the sympathetic chain to treat people with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy of LASB for the treatment of pain in CRPS and to evaluate the incidence of adverse effects of the procedure. 
Search methods
For this update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2015, Issue 9), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), LILACS (Birme), conference abstracts of the World Congresses of the International Association for the Study of Pain, and various clinical trial registers up to September 2015. We also searched bibliographies from retrieved articles for additional studies. 
Selection criteria
We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effect of sympathetic blockade with local anaesthetics in children or adults with CRPS compared to placebo, no treatment, or alternative treatments. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The outcomes of interest were reduction in pain intensity, the proportion who achieved moderate or substantial pain relief, the duration of pain relief, and the presence of adverse effects in each treatment arm. We assessed the evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) and created a 'Summary of findings' table. 
Main results
We included an additional four studies (N = 154) in this update. For this update, we excluded studies that did not follow up patients for more than 48 hours. As a result, we excluded four studies from the previous review in this update. Overall we included 12 studies (N = 461), all of which we judged to be at high or unclear risk of bias. Overall, the quality of evidence was low to very low, downgraded due to limitations, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness, or a combination of these. 
Two small studies compared LASB to placebo/sham (N = 32). They did not demonstrate significant short‐term benefit for LASB for pain intensity (moderate quality evidence). 
One small study (N = 36) at high risk of bias compared thoracic sympathetic block with corticosteroid and local anaesthetic versus injection of the same agents into the subcutaneous space, reporting statistically significant and clinically important differences in pain intensity at one‐year follow‐up but not at short term follow‐up (very low quality evidence). 
Of two studies that investigated LASB as an addition to rehabilitation treatment, the only study that reported pain outcomes demonstrated no additional benefit from LASB (very low quality evidence). 
Eight small randomised studies compared sympathetic blockade to various other active interventions. Most studies found no difference in pain outcomes between sympathetic block versus other active treatments (low to very low quality evidence). 
One small study compared ultrasound‐guided LASB with non‐guided LASB and found no clinically important difference in pain outcomes (very low quality evidence). 
Six studies reported adverse events, all with minor effects reported.
Authors' conclusions
This update's results are similar to the previous versions of this systematic review, and the main conclusions are unchanged. There remains a scarcity of published evidence and a lack of high quality evidence to support or refute the use of local anaesthetic sympathetic blockade for CRPS. From the existing evidence, it is not possible to draw firm conclusions regarding the efficacy or safety of this intervention, but the limited data available do not suggest that LASB is effective for reducing pain in CRPS.","Local anaesthetic sympathetic blockade for complex regional pain syndrome
Background 
Local anaesthetic sympathetic blockade (LASB) is a common treatment for complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). It involves blocking the activity of sympathetic nerves alongside the spine. The sympathetic nervous system mainly controls unconscious actions such as heart rate, blood flow, and perspiration. The injection of a local anaesthetic drug around the nerves temporarily blocks the function of the nerves. This updated review aimed to summarise the available evidence regarding whether LASB is effective at reducing pain in CRPS, how long any pain relief might last, and whether LASB is safe. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
In September 2015, we found a limited number of small trials, all of which had design flaws. We did not find evidence that LASB was better than placebo in reducing pain, or that it provided additional pain relief when added to rehabilitation. While a number of small studies compared LASB to other treatments, most did not find that LASB was better. One small study found that injecting the thoracic (upper back) sympathetic nerves with local anaesthetic and steroid was better than injecting the same drugs just under the skin at one‐year follow‐up, but the study may have been prone to bias. Only six studies reported on the type and amount of side effects. These studies reported only minor side effects, but since some studies did not report this information we can draw no firm conclusions about the safety of LASB. The evidence was mostly of low or very low quality. 
Overall, the evidence is limited, conflicting, and of low quality. While we cannot draw strong conclusions, the existing evidence is not encouraging.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Local Anesthetic Nerve Blocks for Complex Regional Pain Syndrome

## What was this review about?

Researchers updated an earlier review to see if blocking certain nerves with local anesthetic medicine helps reduce pain in people with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). CRPS is a condition that causes ongoing pain, usually in an arm or leg.

## What did the researchers do?

They searched medical databases through September 2015 for studies that tested local anesthetic sympathetic blockade (LASB) — a procedure where doctors inject numbing medicine near specific nerves to block pain signals. They looked for studies that compared this treatment to:
- Fake injections (placebo)
- No treatment
- Other treatments

## What did they find?

The researchers found 12 studies with 461 people total. However, all studies had problems with how they were designed or conducted, making the results less reliable.

Key findings:
- **Compared to fake injections**: Two small studies with 32 people showed the nerve blocks did not significantly reduce pain in the short term
- **Compared to other treatments**: Most studies found no difference between nerve blocks and other active treatments
- **Added to physical therapy**: One study found no extra benefit from adding nerve blocks to rehabilitation
- **Side effects**: Six studies reported only minor side effects

## What does this mean?

There is not enough good-quality evidence to know whether local anesthetic nerve blocks work for CRPS pain. The limited information available suggests these blocks may not be effective. More high-quality research is needed before doctors can know if this treatment truly helps people with CRPS.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

Purpose
- To see if numbing medicine blocks to the sympathetic nerves (local anesthetic sympathetic blockade, or LASB) help reduce pain in people with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), and to check for side effects.

Who was studied
- Children and adults with CRPS.
- Evidence came from 12 randomized studies with 461 people.

What was done
- Researchers compared LASB to:
  - Placebo or sham (fake) procedures
  - No block or other active treatments
  - Adding LASB to rehab therapy
  - Ultrasound-guided vs non-guided LASB
- Only studies with follow-up longer than 48 hours were included.

What outcomes were measured
- Pain intensity
- How many people got moderate or strong pain relief
- How long pain relief lasted
- Side effects

Key findings
- Two small studies (32 people) found no short-term pain benefit from LASB compared with placebo/sham.
- One small, lower-quality study (36 people) reported less pain at 1 year when steroids plus anesthetic were injected near the thoracic sympathetic nerves compared to injections under the skin, but not at short-term follow-up.
- Adding LASB to rehab did not improve pain in the one study that measured it.
- In eight small studies comparing LASB to other active treatments, most found no difference in pain.
- Ultrasound guidance vs no guidance made no meaningful difference in pain.
- Side effects were reported in six studies and were minor.

Quality of the evidence
- Overall low to very low quality.
- Many studies were small and had design problems, making results uncertain.

Bottom line
- There is not enough high-quality evidence to show that LASB reduces pain in CRPS.
- Current limited data do not suggest that LASB is effective for pain relief in CRPS.
- Reported side effects were minor, but safety and benefit remain uncertain due to low-quality evidence."
1,"Background
This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in September 2014. The most common primary brain tumours in adults are gliomas. Gliomas span a spectrum from low to high grade and are graded pathologically on a scale of one to four according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. High‐grade glioma (HGG) carries a poor prognosis. Grade IV glioma is known as glioblastoma and carries a median survival in treated patients of about 15 months. Glioblastomas are rich in blood vessels (i.e. highly vascular) and also rich in a protein known as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that promotes new blood vessel formation (the process of angiogenesis). Anti‐angiogenic agents inhibit the process of new blood vessel formation and promote regression of existing vessels. Several anti‐angiogenic agents have been investigated in clinical trials, both in newly diagnosed and recurrent HGG, showing preliminary promising results. This review was undertaken to report on the benefits and harms associated with the use of anti‐angiogenic agents in the treatment of HGGs. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of anti‐angiogenic therapy in people with high‐grade glioma (HGG). The intervention can be used in two broad groups: at first diagnosis as part of 'adjuvant' therapy, or in the setting of recurrent disease. 
Search methods
We conducted updated searches to identify published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 9), MEDLINE and Embase to October 2018. We handsearched proceedings of relevant oncology conferences up to 2018. We also searched trial registries for ongoing studies. 
Selection criteria
RCTs evaluating the use of anti‐angiogenic therapy to treat HGG versus the same therapy without anti‐angiogenic therapy. 
Data collection and analysis
Review authors screened the search results and reviewed the abstracts of potentially relevant articles before retrieving the full text of eligible articles. 
Main results
After a comprehensive literature search, we identified 11 eligible RCTs (3743 participants), of which 7 were included in the original review (2987 participants). There was significant design heterogeneity in the included studies, especially in the response assessment criteria used. All eligible studies were restricted to glioblastomas and there were no eligible studies evaluating other HGGs. Ten studies were available as fully published peer‐reviewed manuscripts, and one study was available in abstract form. The overall risk of bias in included studies was low. This risk was based upon low rates of selection bias, detection bias, attrition bias and reporting bias. The 11 studies included in this review did not show an improvement in overall survival with the addition of anti‐angiogenic therapy (pooled hazard ratio (HR) of 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.02; P = 0.16; 11 studies, 3743 participants; high‐certainty evidence). However, pooled analysis from 10 studies (3595 participants) showed improvement in progression‐free survival with the addition of anti‐angiogenic therapy (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.79; P < 0.00001; high‐certainty evidence). 
We carried out additional analyses of overall survival and progression‐free survival according to treatment setting and for anti‐angiogenic therapy combined with chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone. Pooled analysis of overall survival in either the adjuvant or recurrent setting did not show an improvement (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.02; P = 0.12; 8 studies, 2833 participants; high‐certainty evidence and HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.16; P = 0.90; 3 studies, 910 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence, respectively). Pooled analysis of overall survival for anti‐angiogenic therapy combined with chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy also did not clearly show an improvement (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.00; P = 0.05; 11 studies, 3506 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The progression‐free survival in the subgroups all showed findings that demonstrated improvements in progression‐free survival with the addition of anti‐angiogenic therapy. Pooled analysis of progression‐free survival in both the adjuvant and recurrent setting showed an improvement (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.82; P < 0.00001; 8 studies, 2833 participants; high‐certainty evidence and HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.76; P < 0.00001; 2 studies, 762 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence, respectively). Pooled analysis of progression‐free survival for anti‐angiogenic therapy combined with chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone showed an improvement (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.77; P < 0.00001; 10 studies, 3464 participants). Similar to trials of anti‐angiogenic therapies in other solid tumours, adverse events related to this class of therapy included hypertension and proteinuria, poor wound healing, and the potential for thromboembolic events, although generally, the rate of grade 3 and 4 adverse events was low (< 14.1%) and in keeping with the literature. The impact of anti‐angiogenic therapy on quality of life varied between studies. 
Authors' conclusions
The use of anti‐angiogenic therapy does not significantly improve overall survival in newly diagnosed people with glioblastoma. Thus, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of anti‐angiogenic therapy for people with newly diagnosed glioblastoma at this time. Overall there is a lack of evidence of a survival advantage for anti‐angiogenic therapy over chemotherapy in recurrent glioblastoma. When considering the combination anti‐angiogenic therapy with chemotherapy compared with the same chemotherapy alone, there may possibly be a small improvement in overall survival. While there is strong evidence that bevacizumab (an anti‐angiogenic drug) prolongs progression‐free survival in newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma, the impact of this on quality of life and net clinical benefit for patients remains unclear. Not addressed here is whether subsets of people with glioblastoma may benefit from anti‐angiogenic therapies, nor their utility in other HGG histologies.","Drugs that target blood vessels in malignant brain tumours
Background The commonest primary brain tumours of adults are gliomas which comprise about two‐fifths of all primary brain tumours. Gliomas span a spectrum from low to high grade, and are graded pathologically on a scale of one to four, according to a classification by the World Health Organization (WHO) that was last updated in 2016. High‐grade glioma, including glioblastoma, are difficult to treat and carry a poor prognosis. 
These tumours produce a protein that promotes the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) to help them grow. Drugs have been developed to reduce the formation of new blood vessels and slow tumour growth. Bevacizumab, cediranib and cilengitide are anti‐angiogenic drugs that directly or indirectly target blood vessel formation and have been studied in glioblastoma in randomised clinical trials.  
Study characteristics After a comprehensive search up to October 2018, we identified 11 eligible randomised clinical trials (totaling 3743 participants). All eligible studies were restricted to glioblastomas; there were no eligible studies that included other brain tumour types. The largest trials were conducted in newly diagnosed people with glioblastoma, treated with anti‐angiogenic therapy. Overall, the trials included in this systematic review did not show improvement in overall survival with the use of anti‐angiogenic therapy. Overall, the clinical trials in bevacizumab‐treated glioblastoma did prolong the time until tumour growth (progression‐free survival).  Key results Anti‐angiogenic therapy does not significantly prolong life in newly diagnosed people with glioblastoma. In recurrent glioblastoma although there is no evidence of prolonging life over chemotherapy, when anti‐angiogenic therapies are used in combination with certain chemotherapy regimes there may be a small improvement in survival. Anti‐angiogenic agents delay tumour progression on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans but is commonly associated with side effects, such as high blood pressure and protein in the urine.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Anti-Angiogenic Drugs for High-Grade Brain Tumors

## What was studied?

Researchers reviewed studies on drugs that block blood vessel growth (called anti-angiogenic drugs) for treating aggressive brain tumors called high-grade gliomas. These tumors grow quickly and have many blood vessels. The most common type is glioblastoma, which typically allows patients to live about 15 months with standard treatment.

## Why is this important?

These brain tumors have many blood vessels and produce a protein that helps new blood vessels form. Scientists thought that drugs blocking blood vessel growth might help shrink tumors or slow their growth.

## What did researchers do?

They searched medical databases through October 2018 and found 11 studies involving 3,743 people with glioblastoma. All participants received either standard treatment alone or standard treatment plus anti-angiogenic drugs. The researchers looked at how long people lived and how long before their tumors got worse.

## What did they find?

**How long people lived:** Adding anti-angiogenic drugs did not help people live longer overall. This was true whether the drugs were given:
- Right after initial diagnosis
- When tumors came back
- Combined with chemotherapy

**Tumor growth:** The drugs did slow tumor growth. People taking anti-angiogenic drugs went longer before their tumors got worse compared to those not taking these drugs.

**Side effects:** These drugs caused some expected side effects including high blood pressure, protein in urine, slower wound healing, and blood clots. However, serious side effects occurred in fewer than 15% of patients.

**Quality of life:** Results varied between studies.

## What does this mean?

Anti-angiogenic drugs can slow tumor growth but don't help people live longer. Because of this, there isn't enough evidence to recommend these drugs for newly diagnosed glioblastoma. The benefit of slowing tumor growth is unclear if it doesn't improve how long or how well people live.",0,Plano,"Plain-Language Summary: Anti-angiogenic therapy for glioblastoma

What was studied
- Goal: To see if anti-angiogenic medicines help adults with glioblastoma live longer and stay stable longer, and to check side effects.
- Anti-angiogenic drugs work by blocking new blood vessel growth to the tumor. One example is bevacizumab.

Who was included
- Adults with glioblastoma (a fast-growing brain tumor).
- 11 randomized controlled trials with 3743 people.
- Trials included people at first diagnosis and people whose tumor had come back.
- Only glioblastoma was studied (not other high-grade gliomas).

What treatments were compared
- Usual treatment (such as chemotherapy) with or without an anti-angiogenic drug.

How the review was done
- Researchers searched medical databases and trial registries up to October 2018.
- They combined results from the eligible trials.

Main results
- Overall survival (how long people lived): No clear improvement when adding anti-angiogenic therapy, whether at first diagnosis or after the tumor returned.
- Time before the tumor grows again (progression-free survival): Improved when anti-angiogenic therapy was added, both at first diagnosis and at recurrence.
- When anti-angiogenic drugs were added to chemotherapy, there may be a small improvement in overall survival, but the evidence is weak.
- Quality of life: Mixed results across studies.

Safety
- Common side effects of this drug class: high blood pressure, protein in urine, poor wound healing, and blood clots.
- Serious side effects (grade 3–4) were generally uncommon (less than about 14%).

What this means
- Adding anti-angiogenic therapy helps delay tumor growth but has not been shown to help people live longer overall.
- For newly diagnosed glioblastoma, there is not enough evidence to support routine use.
- For recurrent glioblastoma, there is no clear survival benefit over chemotherapy alone.
- Bevacizumab can delay tumor growth, but its overall impact on day-to-day life is unclear.

Limits to know
- Only glioblastoma was studied.
- It is unknown if certain subgroups benefit more."
2,"Background
Implant overdentures are one of the most common treatment options used to rehabilitate edentulous patients. Attachment systems are used to anchor the overdentures to implants. The plethora of attachment systems available dictates a need for clinicians to understand their prosthodontic and patient‐related outcomes. 
Objectives
To compare different attachment systems for maxillary and mandibular implant overdentures by assessing prosthodontic success, prosthodontic maintenance, patient preference, patient satisfaction/quality of life and costs. 
Search methods
Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 24 January 2018); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 12) in the Cochrane Library (searched 24 January 2018); MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 24 January 2018); and Embase Ovid (1980 to 24 January 2018). The US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials on 24 January 2018. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cross‐over trials on maxillary or mandibular implant overdentures with different attachment systems with at least 1 year follow‐up. 
Data collection and analysis
Four review authors extracted data independently and assessed risk of bias for each included trial. Several corresponding authors were subsequently contacted to obtain missing information. Fixed‐effect meta‐analysis was used to combine the outcomes with risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence and create 'Summary of findings' tables. 
Main results
We identified six RCTs with a total of 294 mandibular overdentures (including one cross‐over trial). No trials on maxillary overdentures were eligible. Due to the poor reporting of the outcomes across the included trials, only limited analyses between mandibular overdenture attachment systems were possible. 
Comparing ball and bar attachments, upon pooling the data regarding short‐term prosthodontic success, we identified substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 97%) with inconsistency in the direction of effect, which was unexplained by clinical or methodological differences between the studies, and accordingly we did not perform meta‐analyses for this outcome. Short‐term re‐treatment (repair of attachment system) was higher with ball attachments (RR 3.11, 95% CI 1.68 to 5.75; 130 participants; 2 studies; very low‐quality evidence), and there was no difference between both attachment systems in short‐term re‐treatment (replacement of attachment system) (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.38 to 3.71; 130 participants; 2 studies; very low‐quality evidence). It is uncertain whether there is a difference in short‐term prosthodontic success when ball attachments are compared with bar attachments. 
Comparing ball and magnet attachments, there was no difference between them in medium‐term prosthodontic success (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.10; 69 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence), or in medium‐term re‐treatment (repair of attachment system) (RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 4.72; 69 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence). However, after 5 years, prosthodontic maintenance costs were higher when magnet attachments were used (MD ‐247.37 EUR, 95% CI ‐346.32 to ‐148.42; 69 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence). It is uncertain whether there is a difference in medium‐term prosthodontic success when ball attachments are compared with magnet attachments. 
One trial provided data for ball versus telescopic attachments and reported no difference in prosthodontic maintenance between the two systems in short‐term patrix replacement (RR 6.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 41.96; 22 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence), matrix activation (RR 11.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 177.72; 22 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence), matrix replacement (RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.71 to 4.31; 22 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence), or in relining of the implant overdenture (RR 2.33, 95% CI 0.81 to 6.76; 22 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence). It is uncertain whether there is a difference in short‐term prosthodontic maintenance when ball attachments are compared with telescopic attachments. 
In the only cross‐over trial included, patient preference between different attachment systems was assessed after only 3 months and not for the entire trial period of 10 years. 
Authors' conclusions
For mandibular overdentures, there is insufficient evidence to determine the relative effectiveness of different attachment systems on prosthodontic success, prosthodontic maintenance, patient satisfaction, patient preference or costs. In the short term, there is some evidence that is insufficient to show a difference and where there was no evidence was reported. It was not possible to determine any preferred attachment system for mandibular overdentures. 
For maxillary overdentures, there is no evidence (with no trials identified) to determine the relative effectiveness of different attachment systems on prosthodontic success, prosthodontic maintenance, patient satisfaction, patient preference or costs. 
Further RCTs on edentulous cohorts must pay attention to trial design specifically using the same number of implants of the same implant system, but with different attachment systems clearly identified in control and test groups. Trials should also determine the longevity of different attachment systems and patient preferences. Trials on the current array of computer‐aided designed/computer‐assisted manufactured (CAD/CAM) bar attachment systems are encouraged.","Attachments for implant dentures
Review question 
The aim of this review was to assess different attachments used for upper or lower jaw implant dentures with respect to their success, wear and tear, patient satisfaction, patient preference and cost. 
Background 
For adults with complete tooth loss, the modern approach is implant dentures with attachment systems connecting the implants to the undersurface of the dentures. It is important to do the review as the choice of the number of implants and the design of the attachments influences prosthesis success, the amount of wear and tear, patient satisfaction, preference and costs. 
Study characteristics 
Authors from Cochrane Oral Health carried out this review and the evidence is up to date to 24 January 2018. A total of six trials on adults with complete tooth loss were included with a total of 294 lower jaw dentures (anchored by one or more implants). The review looked at different attachment systems on the same implant systems. The six trials did not each evaluate the same attachment systems. There were no eligible trials with upper jaw implant dentures. 
Key results 
There is insufficient evidence to determine any significant differences between lower jaw implant denture attachment systems and an absence of evidence for upper jaw implant denture attachment systems. Further randomised controlled trials on people with complete tooth loss wearing dentures must pay specific attention to trial design using the same implant system and the same number of implants, but different attachment systems to determine their longevity and patient preferences. 
Quality of the evidence 
We judged the quality of the evidence to be very low. In all the included trials there were relatively few participants and few events, and there were serious limitations in the trial designs with data missing or not all outcomes reported.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Different Attachment Systems for Implant-Supported Dentures

## What was this review about?

When people have lost all their teeth, one treatment option is to have dental implants placed in their jaw. These implants can support a removable denture (called an ""implant overdenture""). Different types of connectors, called ""attachment systems,"" can be used to snap or clip the denture onto the implants. Researchers wanted to find out which attachment system works best.

## What did the researchers look for?

The researchers searched for studies comparing different attachment systems. They wanted to know:
- How well the attachments work over time
- How often the attachments need repairs or replacement
- Which attachments patients prefer
- How satisfied patients are
- How much the attachments cost

## What did they find?

The researchers found 6 studies involving 294 people with lower jaw dentures. They found **no studies** about upper jaw dentures.

The studies compared three main types of attachments:
- **Ball attachments** (round connectors)
- **Bar attachments** (a bar connecting the implants)
- **Magnet attachments** (using magnetic force)
- **Telescopic attachments** (crown-like connectors)

### Key Findings:

**Ball vs. Bar attachments:**
- Ball attachments needed more repairs in the short term (1-3 years)
- Both types needed similar numbers of replacements
- It's unclear which works better overall

**Ball vs. Magnet attachments:**
- Both worked similarly over 3-5 years
- Magnet attachments cost more to maintain after 5 years

**Ball vs. Telescopic attachments:**
- Both needed similar amounts of maintenance

## What does this mean?

The researchers could not determine which attachment system is best because:
- There weren't enough high-quality studies
- The studies didn't measure or report results consistently
- No studies looked at upper jaw dentures

## What's needed next?

Better-designed studies are needed that:
- Use the same number and type of implants
- Follow patients for longer periods
- Clearly measure what patients prefer
- Test newer computer-designed attachment systems

**Bottom line:** There isn't enough evidence yet to recommend one attachment system over another for implant-supported dentures.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the study

What was the goal?
- To compare different ways to attach lower and upper implant overdentures to dental implants. The team looked at how well they work, how often they need repairs, what patients prefer, quality of life, and costs.

Who was studied?
- Adults with no natural teeth using implant overdentures.
- 6 randomized studies with 294 lower (mandibular) overdentures were found.
- No studies on upper (maxillary) overdentures were eligible.

What attachments were compared?
- Ball
- Bar
- Magnet
- Telescopic (cone)

What outcomes were checked?
- Prosthodontic success (how well the denture attachment works)
- Maintenance and repairs (how often parts need fixing or replacing)
- Patient preference and satisfaction/quality of life
- Costs
- Safety: not reported

Time frames
- Studies had at least 1 year of follow-up.
- Some “short-term” results (about 1 year), some “medium-term,” and one cost report at 5 years.
- One crossover study checked patient preference after only 3 months.

Key findings (evidence quality was very low)
- Ball vs Bar (lower jaw):
  - Short-term repairs: Ball attachments needed more repairs of the attachment parts than Bar (higher re-treatment for repair).
  - Replacements: No clear difference.
  - Overall success: Unclear due to conflicting results.

- Ball vs Magnet (lower jaw):
  - Medium-term success and repairs: No clear difference.
  - Costs at 5 years: Magnet attachments cost more to maintain than Ball.

- Ball vs Telescopic (lower jaw):
  - Short-term maintenance: No clear differences in part replacements, adjustments, or relining.

- Patient preference:
  - Assessed in one study after 3 months only; not enough to judge long-term preference.

Upper jaw (maxillary) overdentures
- No eligible trials. No conclusions can be made.

Safety
- Safety outcomes were not reported.

Bottom line
- For lower jaw overdentures, there isn’t enough good-quality evidence to say which attachment system is best for success, repairs, patient satisfaction, preference, or cost.
- For upper jaw overdentures, there is no evidence.
- More high-quality, long-term trials are needed, using the same number and type of implants and clearly defined attachment systems."
3,"Background
Pit and fissure sealants are plastic materials that are used to seal deep pits and fissures on the occlusal surfaces of teeth, where decay occurs most often in children and adolescents. Deep pits and fissures can retain food debris and bacteria, making them difficult to clean, thereby causing them to be more susceptible to dental caries. The application of a pit and fissure sealant, a non‐invasive preventive approach, can prevent dental caries by forming a protective barrier that reduces food entrapment and bacterial growth. Though moderate‐certainty evidence shows that sealants are effective in preventing caries in permanent teeth, the effectiveness of applying pit and fissure sealants to primary teeth has yet to be established. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effects of sealants compared to no sealant or a different sealant in preventing pit and fissure caries on the occlusal surfaces of primary molars in children and to report the adverse effects and the retention of different types of sealants. 
Search methods
An information specialist searched four bibliographic databases up to 11 February 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished and ongoing studies. Review authors scanned the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews for further studies. 
Selection criteria
We included parallel‐group and split‐mouth randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a sealant with no sealant, or different types of sealants, for the prevention of caries in primary molars, with no restriction on follow‐up duration. We included studies in which co‐interventions such as oral health preventive measures, oral health education or tooth brushing demonstrations were used, provided that the same adjunct was used with the intervention and comparator. We excluded studies with complex interventions for the prevention of dental caries in primary teeth such as preventive resin restorations, or studies that used sealants in cavitated carious lesions. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. We presented outcomes for the development of new carious lesions on occlusal surfaces of primary molars as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where studies were similar in clinical and methodological characteristics, we planned to pool effect estimates using a random‐effects model where appropriate. We used GRADE methodology to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included nine studies that randomised 1120 children who ranged in age from 18 months to eight years at the start of the study. One study compared fluoride‐releasing resin‐based sealant with no sealant (139 tooth pairs in 90 children); two studies compared glass ionomer‐based sealant with no sealant (619 children); two studies compared glass ionomer‐based sealant with resin‐based sealant (278 tooth pairs in 200 children); two studies compared fluoride‐releasing resin‐based sealant with resin‐based sealant (113 tooth pairs in 69 children); one study compared composite with fluoride‐releasing resin‐based sealant (40 tooth pairs in 40 children); and one study compared autopolymerised sealant with light polymerised sealant (52 tooth pairs in 52 children). 
Three studies evaluated the effects of sealants versus no sealant and provided data for our primary outcome. Due to differences in study design such as age of participants and duration of follow‐up, we elected not to pool the data. At 24 months, there was insufficient evidence of a difference in the development of new caries lesions for the fluoride‐releasing sealants or no treatment groups (Becker Balagtas odds ratio (BB OR) 0.76, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.42; 1 study, 85 children, 255 tooth surfaces). For glass ionomer‐based sealants, the evidence was equivocal; one study found insufficient evidence of a difference at follow‐up between 12 and 30 months (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.49; 449 children), while another with 12‐month follow‐up found a large, beneficial effect of sealants (OR 0.03, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.15; 107 children). We judged the certainty of the evidence to be low, downgrading two levels in total for study limitations, imprecision and inconsistency. 
We included six trials randomising 411 children that directly compared different sealant materials, four of which (221 children) provided data for our primary outcome. Differences in age of the participants and duration of follow‐up precluded pooling of the data. The incidence of development of new caries lesions was typically low across the different sealant types evaluated. We judged the certainty of the evidence to be low or very low for the outcome of caries incidence. 
Only one study assessed and reported adverse events, the nature of which was gag reflex while placing the sealant material. 
Authors' conclusions
The certainty of the evidence for the comparisons and outcomes in this review was low or very low, reflecting the fragility and uncertainty of the evidence base. The volume of evidence for this review was limited, which typically included small studies where the number of events was low. The majority of studies in this review were of split‐mouth design, an efficient study design for this research question; however, there were often shortcomings in the analysis and reporting of results that made synthesising the evidence difficult. An important omission from the included studies was the reporting of adverse events. Given the importance of prevention for maintaining good oral health, there exists an important evidence gap pertaining to the caries‐preventive effect and retention of sealants in the primary dentition, which should be addressed through robust RCTs.","Sealants for preventing tooth decay in baby teeth
Review question 
Can putting sealants over the biting surfaces of baby teeth in the back of the mouth prevent tooth decay forming in them? 
Background 
Tooth decay is one of the most common diseases of childhood that can affect the overall well‐being of the child. The most commonly affected teeth are the back teeth whose biting surfaces are not flat and have grooves (pits and fissures) that can retain food debris and bacteria, leading to formation of cavities (decay). In addition, the opening of these grooves is so small that a toothbrush bristle cannot enter them completely, making them difficult to clean. Sealing the grooves is one of the ways to prevent decay in back teeth. Sealant acts as a protective barrier to food and bacteria, thus preventing their harmful action on tooth surfaces. 
Study characteristics 
We included nine studies that involved 1120 children (aged 18 months to eight years). The studies used a variety of dental sealants to prevent tooth decay in baby teeth. We assessed most studies as being at high risk of bias overall, because the dental professionals who were measuring the outcomes could see whether a sealant had been placed, and also differentiated between sealant materials. 
Key results 
Three studies compared sealants with no sealants, and six studies compared different materials or processes to seal the tooth surface. As there were important differences in the design of the studies in terms of the sealant types, the age of the children at the start of the trial and the length of follow‐up, we were unable to pool the data. Only one trial assessed and reported side effects, the nature of which was gag reflex while placing the sealant material. 
Quality of evidence 
We found low‐quality evidence regarding the effectiveness of sealants in preventing tooth decay on biting surfaces of back baby teeth in children. Hence, we are unable to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of sealants compared to no sealant or a different sealant in preventing development of decay on baby teeth in children. More well‐conducted studies with long follow‐up times are needed. 
How up‐to‐date is the evidence? 
The review includes studies available from a search of the literature up to 11 February 2021.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Testing Tooth Sealants on Baby Teeth

## What was this study about?

Researchers reviewed studies to see if plastic coatings called ""sealants"" help prevent cavities in children's baby teeth (also called primary teeth). These sealants are painted onto the chewing surfaces of back teeth to protect the grooves where cavities often form.

## Who was studied?

The review looked at 9 studies involving 1,120 children between 18 months and 8 years old. These children received either:
- Sealants compared to no sealants
- Different types of sealants compared to each other

## What did researchers find?

The evidence was limited and unclear:

**Sealants vs. No Sealants:**
- Three studies tested whether sealants prevent cavities better than no treatment
- Results were mixed – one study found sealants might help, while others found little difference
- The studies were too different from each other to combine their results

**Comparing Different Sealant Types:**
- Six studies compared different sealant materials to each other
- Cavities were uncommon across all sealant types tested
- No clear winner emerged among the different materials

**Safety:**
- Only one study mentioned side effects – some children gagged while the sealant was being applied
- Most studies didn't report whether any problems occurred

## What does this mean?

The researchers couldn't determine whether sealants definitely prevent cavities in baby teeth because:
- The studies were small
- The studies used different methods
- There weren't enough cavities to compare results clearly

More research with larger, better-designed studies is needed to understand if sealants work well on baby teeth.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the research

What was the goal?
- To find out if putting sealants on baby molars (back teeth) helps prevent tooth decay in the grooves on the chewing surface.
- To compare different types of sealants with each other or with no sealant.
- To look for side effects and how well sealants stay on the teeth over time.

Who was studied?
- 9 randomized studies with 1,120 children.
- Children were 18 months to 8 years old at the start.

What was done?
- Sealants placed on primary (baby) molars were compared to:
  - No sealant
  - Different types of sealants (resin-based, fluoride-releasing resin, glass ionomer, composite, autopolymerized vs light-cured)
- Some studies also gave the same basic oral health education to all groups.

What outcomes were measured?
- New cavities in the pits and fissures of baby molars.
- Side effects.
- Sealant retention (how well the sealant stayed on).

What did the studies find?
- 3 studies compared sealants to no sealant:
  - Results were mixed and could not be combined due to differences in ages and follow-up time.
  - One study up to 24 months found no clear difference with fluoride-releasing resin sealant.
  - For glass ionomer sealants, one study (12 months) suggested fewer cavities with sealant; another (12–30 months) showed no clear difference.
- 6 studies compared different sealant types:
  - Few new cavities were seen overall, and differences between materials were unclear.
- Only one study reported side effects: some children had a gag reflex during placement.
- Reporting on how well sealants stayed on baby teeth was limited.

How strong is the evidence?
- Overall certainty was low to very low.
- Studies were small, had few cavity events, and often used designs that made results hard to combine.

How long were children followed?
- Follow-up ranged from 12 to 30 months, depending on the study.

Safety
- Very limited safety reporting; only gagging during placement was noted in one study.

What does this mean?
- We do not have strong, clear evidence that sealants prevent cavities in baby molars or that one type of sealant is better than another.
- More high-quality, well-reported trials are needed.

4,"Background
This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review first published in 2008. Scoliosis surgery is often associated with substantial blood loss and potentially detrimental effects in children. Antifibrinolytic agents are often used to reduce perioperative blood loss. Clinical trials have evaluated their efficacy in children undergoing surgical correction of scoliosis, but no systematic review has been published. This review was first published in 2008 and was updated in 2016. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of aprotinin, tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid in reducing blood loss and transfusion requirements in children undergoing surgery for correction of idiopathic or secondary scoliosis. 
Search methods
We ran the search for the previous review in June 2007. For this updated version, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1946 to August week 1 2015), Embase (1947 to 2015 week 38), Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (1982 to 14 August 2015), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE; 2015, Issue 2) and reference lists of reviews and retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials in any language. We also checked the clinical trial registry at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov on 8 October 2015. 
Selection criteria
We included blinded and unblinded randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effects of antifibrinolytics on perioperative blood loss in children 18 years of age or younger and undergoing scoliosis surgery. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data. The primary outcome was total blood loss (intraoperative and postoperative combined). Secondary efficacy outcomes were the number of participants receiving blood transfusion (both autologous and allogeneic) or receiving allogeneic blood transfusion alone, and the total amount of blood transfused. Safety outcomes included the number of deaths, the number of participants reporting any adverse event or a serious adverse event, withdrawals due to adverse events and the number of participants experiencing a specific adverse event (i.e. renal insufficiency, hypersensitivity or thrombosis). We assessed methodological risk of bias for each included study and employed the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of the evidence. 
Main results
We included three new studies (201 participants) in this updated review, for a total of nine studies (455 participants). All but one study employed placebo as the control group intervention. For the primary outcome, antifibrinolytic drugs decreased the amount of perioperative blood loss by 427 mL (95% confidence interval (CI) 251 to 603 mL), for a reduction of over 20% versus placebo. We rated the quality of evidence for our primary outcome as low on the basis of unclear risk of bias for several domains in most studies and the small total number of participants. 
For secondary outcomes, fewer participants receiving antifibrinolytic drugs received transfusion (allogeneic or autologous) versus those receiving placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.65, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.85, number needed to treat to prevent one additional harmful outcome (NNTp) 5; very low‐quality evidence). Only two studies specifically evaluated the number of participants transfused with only allogeneic blood (risk difference (RD) ‐0.15, 95% CI ‐0.26 to ‐0.03, NNTp 7; very low‐quality evidence). Antifibrinolytic drugs decreased the volume of blood transfused by 327 mL (95% CI ‐186 to ‐469 mL; low‐quality evidence). 
No study reported deaths in active or control groups. Data were insufficient to allow performance of meta‐analysis for any safety outcome. No studies adequately described their methods in assessing safety. The only adverse event of note occurred in one study, when three participants in the placebo group developed postoperative deep vein thrombosis. 
Authors' conclusions
Since the last published version of this review (2008), we have found three new studies. Additional evidence shows that antifibrinolytics reduce the requirement for both autologous and allogeneic blood transfusion. Limited evidence of low to very low quality supports the use of antifibrinolytic drugs for reducing blood loss and decreasing the risk, and volume, of transfusion in children undergoing scoliosis surgery. Evidence is insufficient to support the use of a particular agent, although tranexamic acid may be preferred, given its widespread availability. The optimal dose regimen for any of these three agents has not been established. Although adverse events appear to occur infrequently, evidence is insufficient to confirm the safety of these agents, particularly for rare but potentially catastrophic events. No long‐term safety data are available.","Antifibrinolytic agents to reduce blood loss in the surgical correction of scoliosis (abnormal curvatures of the spine) in children 
Background 
Scoliosis is a curving of the spine beyond that which is normal. Surgery may be needed to correct scoliosis and is often carried out when the child is young. Substantial bleeding may occur during surgery and can lead to serious complications, such as multiple organ failure. Many methods are used to reduce blood loss, including drugs that modify clotting pathways in the body. Medications known as antifibrinolytic drugs can reduce bleeding by preventing the breakdown of a blood clot. This review is an update of a review published in 2008, which looked at how well these drugs work, and how safe they are. 
Search date 
This review is an update of a review that we first published in 2008. Our latest search for articles took place in August 2015. 
Study characteristics 
The antifibrinolytic drugs evaluated in this systematic review were aprotinin, tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid. We found nine studies that enrolled a total of 455 participants, aged 18 years or younger, who received either antifibrinolytic drugs or a placebo. 
Total enrolment in each study ranged from 36 participants to 80 participants. Two of the studies evaluated aprotinin, four tranexamic acid and four aminocaproic acid. One study compared aminocaproic acid with tranexamic acid. The other studies administered placebo to the control group. Studies that evaluated aprotinin and aminocaproic acid used high doses (when reported). Of the studies that evaluated tranexamic acid, two used high doses, one used low doses and one did not describe the dose given. Five studies evaluated idiopathic scoliosis (scoliosis with no known cause), and four evaluated both idiopathic scoliosis and scoliosis that occurred as the result of another disease, such as cerebral palsy. 
Of the nine included studies, five reported how long patients were assessed. Follow‐up ranged from one to 10 days after surgery, or lasted for the participant's length of stay in the hospital. 
Study funding sources 
Two studies received grants from organizations of healthcare professionals, and one was sponsored by a pharmaceutical company. The remaining studies did not report sources of funding. 
Key results 
Antifibrinolytic drugs reduced the amount of blood lost during, or immediately after, surgery, by 427 millilitres (mL) (more than a 20% reduction in blood loss) and the amount of blood transfused during the same period by 327 mL. The number of children who received transfusions, either through blood from a donor or through a combination of blood from a donor and their own saved blood, was also significantly decreased. We assessed the quality of the evidence for all of these findings as low or very low because of the small numbers of participants, some concerns about study designs and imprecision in study findings. 
No children included in any studies died, and very few adverse events were reported, although three children receiving placebo in one study developed a clot. However, these studies may not have adequately looked for adverse events, or study authors might not have reported them fully. Also, the number of children evaluated was too small and the time of follow‐up too short to allow review authors to draw any conclusions about their safety. 
Conclusion 
This systematic review showed that antifibrinolytic drugs reduce blood loss and decrease the number of children receiving blood transfusions and the amount of blood transfused, but the evidence supporting any of these findings is not very strong. The safety of antifibrinolytic drugs remains unclear.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Medications to Reduce Bleeding During Spine Surgery in Children

## What was studied?
Researchers reviewed studies about medications called antifibrinolytics (including aprotinin, tranexamic acid, and aminocaproic acid) that help blood clot. These medications are sometimes given to children having surgery to straighten their spine (scoliosis surgery) to reduce bleeding during and after the operation.

## Why is this important?
Spine straightening surgery in children often causes significant bleeding, which may require blood transfusions. Reducing blood loss could help avoid transfusions and make surgery safer.

## What did researchers find?
The review included 9 studies with 455 children (18 years old or younger) having scoliosis surgery. Most studies compared these medications to an inactive placebo.

**Key findings:**
- Children receiving these medications lost about 427 mL less blood (roughly 2 cups) during and after surgery compared to those receiving placebo
- Fewer children needed blood transfusions when given these medications (about 1 in 5 children avoided transfusion)
- Children receiving these medications needed about 327 mL less transfused blood (roughly 1.5 cups)
- No deaths occurred in any of the studies
- Side effects appeared uncommon, though one study reported blood clots in 3 children who received placebo

## What are the limitations?
- The total number of children studied was small
- The quality of evidence was low to very low
- Studies didn't thoroughly track side effects
- No information exists about long-term safety
- The best dose hasn't been determined

## Bottom line
These medications appear to reduce bleeding and transfusion needs during spine surgery in children, but more research is needed to confirm safety.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the review

What was studied
- This review looked at medicines called antifibrinolytics (aprotinin, tranexamic acid, and aminocaproic acid). These medicines help slow the breakdown of blood clots.
- Goal: To see if these medicines reduce blood loss and the need for blood transfusions in children having scoliosis surgery, and to check their safety.

Who was included
- Children and teens age 18 or younger having surgery to correct scoliosis (idiopathic or secondary).

What was compared
- Antifibrinolytic medicine given around the time of surgery versus a placebo (no active medicine).

What outcomes were measured
- Main outcome: Total blood loss during and after surgery.
- Other outcomes: How many children needed a blood transfusion, how much blood was transfused, and safety (deaths, any side effects, serious side effects, kidney problems, allergic reactions, or blood clots).

How the review was done
- This is an update of a 2008 review, with another update in 2016.
- Databases were searched up to October 2015.
- 9 randomized controlled trials with 455 children were included.

Key results
- Blood loss: Children who received an antifibrinolytic lost about 427 mL less blood on average (a bit over 20% less) than those who got placebo. Evidence quality: low.
- Need for any transfusion: Fewer children needed a transfusion with antifibrinolytics. About 1 out of every 5 children treated avoided a transfusion compared with placebo. Evidence quality: very low.
- Amount of blood transfused: Children who received antifibrinolytics needed about 327 mL less transfused blood. Evidence quality: low.

Safety
- No deaths were reported.
- Safety reporting was limited and not consistent across studies.
- One study reported 3 cases of blood clots in the placebo group.
- There is not enough evidence to confirm overall safety, especially for rare but serious events. No long-term safety data.

Take-home messages
- Antifibrinolytic medicines can reduce blood loss and lower the chance and amount of blood transfusion in children having scoliosis surgery.
- The quality of the evidence is low to very low, so results should be interpreted with caution.
- No single medicine or best dose could be recommended based on current evidence. Tranexamic acid may be favored because it is widely available.
- More high-quality studies with good safety tracking and long-term follow-up are needed.

Timeframe
- Evidence includes studies available up to October 2015 and reflects review updates in 2008 and 2016."
5,"Background
Smoking bans have been implemented in a variety of settings, as well as being part of policy in many jurisdictions to protect the public and employees from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke (SHS). They also offer the potential to influence social norms and the smoking behaviour of those populations they affect. Since the first version of this review in 2010, more countries have introduced national smoking legislation banning indoor smoking. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of legislative smoking bans on (1) morbidity and mortality from exposure to secondhand smoke, and (2) smoking prevalence and tobacco consumption. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and reference lists of included studies. We also checked websites of various organisations. Date of most recent search; February 2015. 
Selection criteria
We considered studies that reported legislative smoking bans affecting populations. The minimum standard was having an indoor smoking ban explicitly in the study and a minimum of six months follow‐up for measures of smoking behaviour. Our search included a broad range of research designs including: randomized controlled trials, quasi‐experimental studies (i.e. non‐randomized controlled studies), controlled before‐and‐after studies, interrupted time series as defined by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group, and uncontrolled pre‐ and post‐ban data. 
Data collection and analysis
One author extracted characteristics and content of the interventions, participants, outcomes and methods of the included studies and a second author checked the details. We extracted health and smoking behaviour outcomes. We did not attempt a meta‐analysis due to the heterogeneity in design and content of the studies included. We evaluated the studies using qualitative narrative synthesis. 
Main results
There are 77 studies included in this updated review. We retained 12 studies from the original review and identified 65 new studies. Evidence from 21 countries is provided in this update, an increase of eight countries from the original review. The nature of the intervention precludes randomized controlled trials. Thirty‐six studies used an interrupted time series study design, 23 studies use a controlled before‐and‐after design and 18 studies are before‐and‐after studies with no control group; six of these studies use a cohort design. Seventy‐two studies reported health outcomes, including cardiovascular (44), respiratory (21), and perinatal outcomes (7). Eleven studies reported national mortality rates for smoking‐related diseases. A number of the studies report multiple health outcomes. There is consistent evidence of a positive impact of national smoking bans on improving cardiovascular health outcomes, and reducing mortality for associated smoking‐related illnesses. Effects on respiratory and perinatal health were less consistent. We found 24 studies evaluating the impact of national smoke‐free legislation on smoking behaviour. Evidence of an impact of legislative bans on smoking prevalence and tobacco consumption is inconsistent, with some studies not detecting additional long‐term change in existing trends in prevalence. 
Authors' conclusions
Since the first version of this review was published, the current evidence provides more robust support for the previous conclusions that the introduction of a legislative smoking ban does lead to improved health outcomes through reduction in SHS for countries and their populations. The clearest evidence is observed in reduced admissions for acute coronary syndrome. There is evidence of reduced mortality from smoking‐related illnesses at a national level. There is inconsistent evidence of an impact on respiratory and perinatal health outcomes, and on smoking prevalence and tobacco consumption.","Does legislation to ban smoking reduce exposure to secondhand smoke and smoking behaviour?
Since the first national legislation banning indoor smoking in all public places was introduced in 2004, there has been an increase in the number of countries, states and regions adopting similar smoke‐free legislation banning smoking in public places and work places since this review was first published. The main reason is to protect nonsmokers from the harmful health effects of exposure to secondhand smoke. Another reason is to provide a supportive environment for people who want to quit smoking. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that investigated the effect of introducing a ban on any measures of health, or on smoking behaviour (up to February 2015). Since the previous version of this review had shown clear evidence that introducing legislation to ban smoking in public places does reduce exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) in those places, we did not include studies that only reported exposure to SHS. We included 77 studies from 21 countries in this updated review. Studies of health outcomes typically used data from hospitals to look for changes in rates of admissions, discharges or deaths. Most studies looked at illnesses related to the cardiovascular system (heart or blood vessels), such as heart attacks and strokes. Studies also looked at effects on respiratory health, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g. bronchitis), asthma and lung function. Seven studies looked at the health of newborn children. Eleven studies reported death rates. The best‐quality studies collected data at multiple time points before and after the introduction of a ban in order to adjust for existing time trends. Some studies could compare events rates in areas with and without bans, or where bans were introduced at different times. 
Key results 
There is evidence that countries and their populations benefit from improved health after introducing smoking bans, importantly to do with the heart and blood vessels. We found evidence of reduced deaths. The impact of bans on respiratory health, on the health of newborn children, and on reducing the number of smokers and their cigarette use is not as clear, with some studies not detecting any reduction. 
Quality of the evidence 
Legislative bans have not been evaluated by randomized trials, and the quality of the evidence from the types of studies contributing to this review is lower. Changes in health outcomes could be due to other things, such as change in healthcare practices. However, many of the studies used methods of analysis that could control for underlying trends, and increase our confidence that any changes are caused by the introduction of bans.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Do Smoking Bans in Public Places Improve Health?

## What was studied?
Researchers looked at laws that ban smoking indoors in public places. These laws are meant to protect people from breathing in secondhand smoke (smoke from other people's cigarettes). The researchers wanted to know if these bans:
- Improved people's health
- Changed how many people smoke

## What did the researchers do?
They reviewed 77 studies from 21 countries that looked at what happened after smoking bans were put in place. The studies tracked people for at least 6 months after the bans started. The researchers looked at:
- Heart and lung health
- Health of newborn babies
- Deaths from smoking-related illnesses
- Whether fewer people smoked after the bans

## What did they find?
**Health improvements:**
- Heart health got better after smoking bans. Fewer people went to the hospital for heart problems.
- Fewer people died from smoking-related diseases.
- Results for lung health and newborn baby health were mixed—some studies showed improvement, others didn't.

**Smoking behavior:**
- Results were mixed on whether the bans caused fewer people to smoke or use less tobacco. Some studies found no change in smoking rates.

## What does this mean?
Smoking bans in public places appear to improve health, especially heart health. This happens because people breathe in less secondhand smoke. However, these laws may not necessarily cause people to quit smoking or smoke less.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What is this study about?
- Researchers reviewed many studies to see how indoor smoking bans (laws that stop smoking inside public places and workplaces) affect health and smoking habits.

Who was studied?
- People living in countries or regions that passed indoor smoking bans. The review covered 77 studies from 21 countries.

What was done?
- The team compared health and smoking measures before and after these laws. Each included study followed people for at least 6 months.

What outcomes were checked?
- Health: heart problems, breathing problems, outcomes around birth, and deaths from illnesses linked to smoking.
- Smoking behavior: how many people smoke and how much tobacco they use.

When did this happen?
- The researchers searched for studies up to February 2015. The studies used data collected over time, before and after the bans.

Main findings
- Heart health: Strong and consistent improvements after smoking bans. Hospital admissions for acute coronary events went down.
- Deaths: Fewer deaths from illnesses linked to smoking at the national level after bans.
- Breathing and birth outcomes: Results were mixed; some studies showed benefits, others did not.
- Smoking behavior: Mixed results. Some places saw drops in smoking or tobacco use, while others showed little change beyond existing trends.

Safety
- These are public laws, not medical treatments. No safety concerns for participants were reported in the studies.

Study notes
- No randomized trials were possible for this kind of law. Most studies compared trends over time or compared places with and without bans.

Bottom line
- Indoor smoking bans improve public health by reducing exposure to secondhand smoke, especially for heart-related health and deaths linked to smoking. Effects on breathing, birth outcomes, and smoking rates vary by study and place."
6,"Background
The term ""strabismus"" describes misalignment of the eyes. One or both eyes may deviate inward, outward, upward, or downward. Dissociated vertical deviation (DVD) is a well‐recognized type of upward drifting of one or both eyes, which can occur in children or adults. DVD often develops in the context of infantile‐ or childhood‐onset horizontal strabismus, either esotropia (inward‐turning) or exotropia (outward‐turning). For some individuals, DVD remains controlled and can only be detected during clinical testing. For others, DVD becomes spontaneously ""manifest"" and the eye drifts up of its own accord. Spontaneously manifest DVD can be difficult to control and often causes psychosocial concerns. Traditionally, DVD has been thought to be asymptomatic, although some individuals have double vision. More recently it has been suggested that individuals with DVD may also suffer from eyestrain. Treatment for DVD may be sought either due to psychosocial concerns or because of these symptoms. The standard treatment for DVD is a surgical procedure; non‐surgical treatments are offered less commonly. Although there are many studies evaluating different management options for the correction of DVD, a lack of clarity remains regarding which treatments are most effective. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to determine the effectiveness and safety of various surgical and non‐surgical interventions in randomized controlled trials of participants with DVD. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2015, Issue 8), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to August 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2015), PubMed (1948 to August 2015), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (1982 to August 2015), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled‐trials.com) (last searched 3 February 2014), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 3 August 2015. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of surgical and non‐surgical interventions for the correction of DVD. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently completed eligibility screening, data abstraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and grading of the evidence. 
Main results
We found four RCTs eligible for inclusion in this review (248 eyes of 151 participants between the ages of 6 months to 22 years). All trials were assessed as having unclear risk of bias overall due to insufficient reporting of study methods. One trial was conducted in Canada and compared anteriorization of the inferior oblique muscle with resection versus anteriorization of the inferior oblique muscle alone; one in the USA compared superior rectus recession with posterior fixation suture versus superior rectus recession alone; and two in the Czech Republic compared anteriorization of the inferior oblique muscle versus myectomy of the inferior oblique muscle. 
Only one trial reported data that allowed analysis of the primary outcome for this review, the proportion of participants with treatment success. The difference between inferior oblique anteriorization plus resection versus inferior oblique anteriorization alone was uncertain when measured at least four months postoperatively (risk ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 0.60 to 2.11, 30 participants, very low‐quality evidence). Three trials measured the magnitude of hyperdeviation, but did not provide sufficient data for analysis. All four trials reported a relatively low rate of adverse events; hypotropia, limited elevation, and need for repeat surgery were reported as adverse events associated with some of the surgical interventions. No trials reported any other secondary outcome specified for our review. 
Authors' conclusions
The four trials included in this review assessed the effectiveness of five different surgical procedures for the treatment of DVD. Nevertheless, insufficient reporting of study methods and data led to methodological concerns that undermine the conclusions of all studies. There is a pressing need for carefully executed RCTs of treatment for DVD in order to improve the evidence for the optimal management of this condition.","Treatment for eyes that drift upwards
Review question  The aim of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of surgical and non‐surgical treatments for dissociated vertical deviation. 
Background  Eye misalignment (strabismus) is the drifting of one or both eyes, which can be inward, outward, upward, or downward. This review evaluated the treatment for a specific type of upward drifting of one or both eyes known as dissociated vertical deviation (DVD). DVD can occur in both children and adults. For some people, DVD is controlled and is only detectable during testing. In others, DVD happens all of a sudden as the eye drifts up of its accord. It can be hard for the person to gain control of the eye, which can cause distress to the person in social situations. The condition also may cause double vision or eyestrain. 
Surgery is the common treatment for DVD. Treatments that do not involve surgery are uncommon. There is limited evidence about the effectiveness of treatments (either surgical or non‐surgical) for DVD. 
Study characteristics  We conducted the search for studies on 3 August 2015. We found four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of surgical treatment for DVD. We found no studies evaluating non‐surgical treatments. One trial was conducted in Canada and compared a surgical repositioning procedure (anteriorization of the inferior oblique muscle) with or without resection; one in the USA compared surgical weakening of an eye muscle (superior rectus recession) with or without augmentation with a fixation suture; and two in the Czech Republic compared anteriorization of the inferior oblique muscle versus removal of a piece of the inferior oblique muscle (myectomy). 
Key results  Only one of the RCTs examined what we wanted to know: the proportion of participants who had surgical success. There was insufficient information available to determine the differences between any of the surgical procedures with respect to surgical success or any other outcome relevant to our review. The most common adverse events from the surgical procedures were downward drifting of the eye after surgery (hypotropia), limited upward movement of the eye, and need for repeat surgery. 
Quality of the evidence  All four of the included studies had flaws in design, execution, or both that weaken their conclusions. There is a need for well‐designed, rigorously conducted RCTs of treatments for DVD to provide more reliable evidence for the management of this condition.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Treatments for Eyes That Drift Upward

## What is this review about?

Some people have a condition where one or both eyes drift upward on their own. This is called dissociated vertical deviation, or DVD for short. It often happens in people who already have eyes that turn inward or outward. For some people, the upward drifting is mild and only shows up during eye exams. For others, it happens often and can be noticeable to others, which may cause embarrassment or social concerns. Some people also experience double vision or eye strain.

## What treatments are available?

The most common treatment is eye muscle surgery. Doctors can also offer non-surgical treatments, though these are less common. However, it's unclear which treatments work best.

## What did researchers want to find out?

Researchers wanted to know which treatments for DVD work best and are safest. They looked for studies that tested different treatments by randomly assigning people to receive one treatment or another.

## What did they find?

Researchers found 4 studies with 151 people (248 eyes total) between 6 months and 22 years old. All studies tested different types of eye muscle surgeries:
- Moving and shortening an eye muscle versus just moving it
- Moving a muscle with a special stitch versus moving it without the stitch
- Two studies comparing different ways to treat one of the eye muscles

## What were the results?

The studies didn't provide enough clear information to determine which treatment works best. Only one study reported results in a way that could be properly analyzed, and those results were uncertain. Some side effects were reported, including the eye drifting too far down, trouble moving the eye upward, and needing a second surgery.

## What does this mean?

Better research studies are needed to find out which treatments work best for people whose eyes drift upward.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the research

What is this about
- Dissociated vertical deviation (DVD) is when one eye drifts upward on its own. It can happen in children or adults and may cause social concerns, eyestrain, or sometimes double vision.
- This review looked for the best treatments, especially surgery, and checked how safe they are.

Who was studied
- 4 randomized controlled trials (the strongest type of study)
- 151 people (248 eyes), ages 6 months to 22 years
- Studies took place in Canada, the USA, and the Czech Republic

Treatments tested
All trials studied surgeries for DVD:
- Moving the lower eye muscle forward (inferior oblique anteriorization) with or without removing a small part (resection)
- Weakening the upper eye muscle (superior rectus recession) with or without an extra stitch to limit movement (posterior fixation)
- Moving the lower eye muscle forward versus removing part of it (myectomy)

How outcomes were measured
- Main outcome: how many people had treatment success
- Other outcomes: how much the eye drift improved, need for more surgery, and side effects
- One trial reported success at least 4 months after surgery

Key results
- Only one trial reported clear success rates. It found no clear difference between moving the lower muscle forward with resection versus without resection. The evidence quality was very low.
- Three trials measured how much the upward drift changed, but did not provide enough data to analyze.
- Overall, the studies were small and did not report methods clearly, so confidence in the results is low.

Safety
- Reported side effects were uncommon but included:
  - Eye drifting downward (hypotropia)
  - Limited ability to look up
  - Need for repeat surgery

Timeline
- Medical databases were searched up to August 3, 2015.
- At least one study reported results 4 months or more after surgery.

What this means
- Several surgical options are used for DVD, but we do not yet know which is best.
- Better, well-reported trials are needed to guide care."

This Cochrane Review update aims to assess the effects of engaging community‐based workers, such as primary‐care workers and teachers, to help people with mental disorders or distress. The review focused on studies from low‐ and middle‐income countries and found 95 studies for inclusion (including 23 from the previous review).  
Key messages 
Primary health professionals, lay health workers, teachers, and other community workers may be able to help people with mental health issues if they are trained. However, more evidence is needed.  
What was studied in the review? 
In low‐ and middle‐income countries, many people with mental illness do not receive the care they need because of stigma and difficulty accessing services. One solution is to offer services through ‘primary‐level workers’. These are people who are not mental health specialists but who receive some mental health training, including primary health professionals (e.g. doctors, nurses); lay health workers; community volunteers; and other community members (e.g. teachers, social workers). Primary‐level workers deliver these services alone or in collaboration with specialists. 
What are the main results of the review? 
95 relevant trials from 30 low‐ or middle‐income countries were found. 
The review authors searched for evidence about the effects of these strategies on the number of people who had mental health problems, the number who recovered, their symptom severity, quality of life, day‐to‐day functioning, use of health services, and negative effects of treatment. All results were measured one to six months after treatment completion, except in group 5, in which results were measured immediately after treatment completion. When results are not presented, this is because there was no evidence, or because the evidence was very uncertain. Evidence of the results below is of low to moderate certainty. 
1. Adults with depression and anxiety 
Treatments from lay health workers compared to usual care:
a. may increase recovery;
b. may reduce the number of people with depression/anxiety; 
c. may improve quality of life;
d. may slightly improve day‐to‐day functioning; and
e. may reduce risk of suicidal thoughts/attempts.
Treatments from primary‐level workers in collaboration with mental health specialists compared to usual care: 
a. may increase recovery;
b. may reduce the number of people with depression/anxiety although the range for the actual effect indicates they may have little or no effect; 
c. may slightly reduce symptoms;
d. may slightly improve quality of life;
e. probably have little to no effect on day‐to‐day functioning; and
f. may reduce referral to mental health specialists.
2. Women with depression related to pregnancy and childbirth 
Treatments from lay health workers compared to usual care:
a. may increase recovery;
b. probably slightly reduce symptoms of depression;
c. may slightly improve day‐to‐day functioning; 
d. may have little to no effect on risk of death.
3. Adults in humanitarian settings with post‐traumatic stress or depression and anxiety 
Treatments from lay health workers compared to usual care:
a. may slightly reduce depression symptoms; and
b. probably slightly improve quality of life.
Treatments from primary health professionals compared to usual care:
a. may reduce the number of adults with post‐traumatic stress and depression.
4. Adults with alcohol or substance use problems  
Treatments from lay health workers compared to usual care:
a. may increase recovery from harmful/hazardous alcohol use although the range for the actual effect indicates they may have little or no effect; 
b. probably slightly reduce the risk of harmful/hazardous alcohol use;
c. may have little to no effect on day‐to‐day functioning; and
d. may have little to no effect on the number of people who use methamphetamine;
Treatments from primary health and community professionals compared to usual care:
a. probably have little to no effect on recovery from harmful/hazardous alcohol use;
b. probably slightly reduce risk of harmful/hazardous alcohol and substance use; and
c. probably have little to no effect on quality of life.
5. Adults with severe mental disorders (e.g. schizophrenia) 
Treatments from lay health workers compared to mental specialists alone:
a. may have little to no effect on caregiver burden.
Treatments from primary health professionals alone or in collaboration with mental health specialists: 
a. may improve day‐to‐day functioning.
6. Adults with dementia and their carers 
Treatments from lay and professional health workers, compared to usual care:
a. may have little to no effect on the severity of behavioural symptoms in dementia patients; and 
b. may reduce carers' mental distress.
7. Children in humanitarian settings with post‐traumatic stress or depression and anxiety 
Treatments from lay health workers, compared to usual or no care:
a. may have little to no effect on post‐traumatic stress symptoms;
b. probably have little to no effect on depressive symptoms nor on day‐to‐day functioning; and 
c. may make little or no difference in risk of adverse events.
Treatments from community professionals (teachers and social workers) compared to no care: 
a. may have little to no effect on depressive symptoms; and
b. may make little or no difference in adverse events.
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
Originally published in November 2013, this update includes studies published up to 20 June 2019.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Community Health Workers Helping People with Mental Health Problems in Low-Income Countries

## What was this study about?

Researchers reviewed studies to see if community health workers can effectively help people with mental health problems in low- and middle-income countries. These workers include nurses, community volunteers, and other non-specialists who receive training to provide mental health support.

## Why is this important?

Many low- and middle-income countries don't have enough mental health specialists like psychiatrists or psychologists. Training community workers to provide basic mental health care could help fill this gap.

## What did the researchers do?

They reviewed 95 studies from 30 countries that tested whether community workers could help people with mental health issues. The studies looked at different conditions including:
- Depression and anxiety
- Depression after childbirth
- Stress after traumatic events
- Alcohol and drug problems
- Serious mental illnesses
- Dementia

## What did they find?

**For adults with depression or anxiety:**
- Community volunteers may help more people recover
- Team-based care (workers plus doctors) may also improve recovery
- Both approaches may reduce symptoms and improve quality of life

**For women with depression after childbirth:**
- Community volunteers may help more women recover and reduce symptoms

**For people affected by trauma:**
- Community workers may reduce depression symptoms and improve quality of life

**For people with alcohol problems:**
- Community workers may help reduce risky drinking

**For families caring for people with dementia:**
- Support from trained workers may reduce stress for caregivers

**For children with trauma or depression:**
- The benefits were less clear

## What does this mean?

Training community health workers to provide mental health support shows promise for helping people in countries with limited mental health services. This approach may help more people get the care they need.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the clinical trial review

What was studied
- Goal: To see if mental health care led by primary-level workers helps people in low- and middle-income countries, compared to usual care.
- Who are primary-level workers: 
  - Lay health workers (LHWs): trained community members without formal clinical degrees
  - Primary health professionals (PHPs): nurses, general doctors, or similar
  - Community professionals (CPs): non-health workers trained to support care
- Types of problems studied: common mental health symptoms, stress after trauma, perinatal low mood, harmful alcohol/substance use, severe mental health symptoms, dementia (and carers), and child mental health symptoms.
- What was measured: recovery, symptom change, quality of life, daily functioning, use of health services, and safety (serious harms).
- Timing: Main results were checked 1–6 months after care ended.

About the evidence
- 95 randomized trials from 30 low- and middle-income countries (search to June 20, 2019).
- Certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Some studies had risks of bias.

Key findings by group

Adults with common mental health symptoms
- Lay worker care may help more people recover, reduce how many still have symptoms, lower symptom levels, and improve quality of life and functioning.
- Collaborative-care models (team-based with supervision) may increase recovery and slightly improve symptoms and quality of life; effect on functioning was small.

Women with low mood during pregnancy or after birth
- Lay worker care may help more women recover, slightly lower symptoms, and slightly improve functioning.

Adults after trauma or in humanitarian settings
- Lay worker care may slightly lower low-mood symptoms and slightly improve quality of life.
- Primary health professional care may reduce how many screen positive for post-trauma or low mood in one study; other effects were unclear.

Adults with harmful or hazardous alcohol or substance use
- Lay worker care may slightly lower risky alcohol use; effects on recovery and functioning were small or unclear.
- Care led by primary/community professionals probably slightly reduces risky use; effects on recovery and quality of life were small.

People with severe mental health symptoms
- Primary health professional or collaborative-care models may reduce disability (better daily functioning) at short-term checks.
- Lay worker support for caregivers showed little-to-no change in caregiver burden in one study.

Adults with dementia and their carers
- Carer programs led by primary or lay workers may reduce carer distress. Effects on patient behavior were small.

Children with post-trauma or common mental health symptoms
- Lay or community-led programs generally showed little-to-no change in symptoms or functioning in the short term.

Safety
- Serious harms were rare and usually similar to usual care. Some lay worker programs may lower thoughts or attempts of self-harm. Many studies did not report safety in detail.

What this means
- Care led by trained non-specialists and primary health staff can help in several areas, especially common mental health symptoms and perinatal low mood. Team-based collaborative care can also help.
- Benefits are often modest and vary by setting and problem type.
- More high-quality studies with good safety reporting are needed.

Timeframe
- Results mainly reflect outcomes 1–6 months after treatment. Longer-term effects are less clear."
8,"Background
Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia are becoming increasingly common with the aging of most populations. The majority of individuals with dementia will first present for care and assessment in primary care settings. There is a need for brief dementia screening instruments that can accurately detect dementia in primary care settings. The Mini‐Cog is a brief, cognitive screening test that is frequently used to evaluate cognition in older adults in various settings. 
Objectives
To determine the accuracy of the Mini‐Cog for detecting dementia in a primary care setting. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Register of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies, MEDLINE, Embase and four other databases, initially to September 2012. Since then, four updates to the search were performed using the same search methods, and the most recent was January 2017. We used citation tracking (using the databases' ‘related articles’ feature, where available) as an additional search method and contacted authors of eligible studies for unpublished data. 
Selection criteria
We only included studies that evaluated the Mini‐Cog as an index test for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia or related forms of dementia when compared to a reference standard using validated criteria for dementia. We only included studies that were conducted in primary care populations. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted and described information on the characteristics of the study participants and study setting. Using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS‐2) criteria we evaluated the quality of studies, and we assessed risk of bias and applicability of each study for each domain in QUADAS‐2. Two review authors independently extracted information on the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives and entered the data into Review Manager 5 (RevMan 5). We then used RevMan 5 to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and 95% confidence intervals. We summarized the sensitivity and specificity of the Mini‐Cog in the individual studies in forest plots and also plotted them in a receiver operating characteristic plot. We also created a 'Risk of bias' and applicability concerns graph to summarize information related to the quality of included studies. 
Main results
There were a total of four studies that met our inclusion criteria, including a total of 1517 total participants. The sensitivity of the Mini‐Cog varied between 0.76 to 1.00 in studies while the specificity varied between 0.27 to 0.85. The included studies displayed significant heterogeneity in both methodologies and clinical populations, which did not allow for a meta‐analysis to be completed. Only one study (Holsinger 2012) was found to be at low risk of bias on all methodological domains. The results of this study reported that the sensitivity of the Mini‐Cog was 0.76 and the specificity was 0.73. We found the quality of all other included studies to be low due to a high risk of bias with methodological limitations primarily in their selection of participants. 
Authors' conclusions
There is a limited number of studies evaluating the accuracy of the Mini‐Cog for the diagnosis of dementia in primary care settings. Given the small number of studies, the wide range in estimates of the accuracy of the Mini‐Cog, and methodological limitations identified in most of the studies, at the present time there is insufficient evidence to recommend that the Mini‐Cog be used as a screening test for dementia in primary care. Further studies are required to determine the accuracy of Mini‐Cog in primary care and whether this tool has sufficient diagnostic test accuracy to be useful as a screening test in this setting.","How accurate is the mini‐cog test when used to assess dementia in general practice?
Background and rationale for review 
In most parts of the world there are increasing numbers of older adults, and memory complaints and conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia are becoming increasingly common as a result. Most individuals with memory difficulties will first seek out care or be identified in the healthcare system through their primary care health care providers, which may include family physicians or nurses. Therefore, there is a need for tools that could identify individuals who may have dementia or significant memory problems. These tools should also be able to rule out dementia in those individuals with memory complaints who do not have dementia or significant memory problems. Such tools in primary care must be relatively easy to use, quick to administer, and accurate so as to be feasible to use in primary care while at the same time not overdiagnose or underdiagnose dementia. The Mini‐Cog, a brief cognitive screening tool, has been suggested as a possible screening test for dementia in primary care as it has been reported to be accurate and relatively easy to administer in primary care settings. The Mini‐Cog consists of a memory task that involves recall of three words and an evaluation of a clock drawing task. 
Study characteristics 
We searched electronic databases for articles evaluating the Mini‐Cog and this evidence is current as of January 2017. The purpose of our review was to compare the accuracy of the Mini‐Cog for detecting dementia of any type in primary care settings when compared to in‐depth evaluation conducted by dementia specialists. We included studies that evaluated individuals with any potential severity of dementia and regardless of whether previous cognitive testing had been completed prior to the Mini‐Cog. Overall, our review identified four studies conducted in primary care settings that compared the accuracy of the Mini‐Cog to detailed assessment of dementia by dementia specialists. 
Quality of the evidence 
Of the four studies included in the review, all except one study had limitations in how the Mini‐Cog was evaluated, which may have led to an overestimation of the accuracy of the Mini‐Cog in the remaining studies. Notably, the most problematic issue in study quality related to how participants were selected to participate in research studies, which may have further contributed to an overestimation of the accuracy of the Mini‐Cog in most of the studies included in our review. 
Key findings 
The results of the highest‐quality study Holsinger 2012 found that the Mini‐Cog had a sensitivity of 76%, indicating that the Mini‐Cog failed to detect up to 24% of individuals who have dementia (e.g. false negatives). In this same study, the specificity of the Mini‐Cog was 73% indicating that up to 27% of individuals may be incorrectly identified as having dementia on the Mini‐Cog when these individuals do not actually have an underlying dementia (e.g. false positives). We conclude that at the present time there is not enough evidence to support the routine use of the Mini‐Cog as a screening test for dementia in primary care and additional studies are required before concluding that the Mini‐Cog is useful in this setting.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Testing a Quick Memory Test for Dementia in Doctor's Offices

## What was this study about?

As people live longer, more are developing memory and thinking problems, including dementia. Most people first see their regular doctor when they notice these problems. Doctors need quick, accurate tests to identify who might have dementia. Researchers reviewed studies about a test called the Mini-Cog to see how well it works in regular doctor's offices.

## What is the Mini-Cog?

The Mini-Cog is a short test that checks memory and thinking skills in older adults. It can be given quickly during a regular doctor's visit.

## What did the researchers do?

The research team searched medical databases through January 2017 for studies that:
- Tested the Mini-Cog in primary care settings (regular doctor's offices)
- Compared the Mini-Cog results to more thorough dementia evaluations
- Included a total of 1,517 people across 4 studies

They checked how accurate the Mini-Cog was at correctly identifying people with and without dementia.

## What did they find?

- The Mini-Cog's accuracy varied widely across the four studies
- The test correctly identified between 76% and 100% of people who had dementia
- The test correctly identified between 27% and 85% of people who did not have dementia
- Only one study was high quality; the others had problems with how participants were selected
- The studies were too different from each other to combine their results

## What does this mean?

There isn't enough evidence yet to recommend using the Mini-Cog as a screening test in doctor's offices. More high-quality studies are needed to determine if this test is accurate enough to be useful for identifying dementia in primary care settings.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What was studied
- Researchers looked at how well a short memory and thinking test called the Mini-Cog works in doctor’s offices to find possible dementia.

Who was included
- This was a review of 4 studies done in primary care clinics.
- Together, the studies included 1,517 adults.

What the test is
- The Mini-Cog is a quick screening tool used with older adults to check thinking and memory.

How the review was done
- Researchers searched several medical databases for studies up to January 2017.
- They checked study quality and looked at how often the Mini-Cog gave correct results.

Main findings
- Accuracy varied a lot between studies.
- Sensitivity (how often the test correctly flagged people who had dementia) ranged from 76% to 100%.
- Specificity (how often the test correctly reassured people who did not have dementia) ranged from 27% to 85%.
- Only one study was judged high quality; in that study, sensitivity was 76% and specificity was 73%.
- Because the studies were very different, the results could not be combined.

Safety
- The Mini-Cog is brief and low risk.
- However, incorrect results can happen:
  - False alarms may cause worry and extra testing.
  - Missed cases may delay further evaluation.

Timing
- Evidence included research published up to January 2017.

Bottom line
- There are few good-quality studies from primary care.
- Right now, there is not enough strong evidence to recommend the Mini-Cog as a stand-alone screening test in primary care.
- More high-quality research in primary care settings is needed."
9,"Background
Two major determinants of cardiovascular disease (CVD) are a sedentary lifestyle and stress. Qigong involves physical exercise, mind regulation and breathing control to restore the flow of Qi (a pivotal life energy). As it is thought to help reduce stress and involves exercise, qigong may be an effective strategy for the primary prevention of CVD. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness of qigong for the primary prevention of CVD.
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (November 2014, Issue 10 of 12); MEDLINE (Ovid) (1946 to 2014 October week 4); EMBASE Classic + EMBASE (Ovid) (1947 to 2014 November 4); Web of Science Core Collection (1970 to 31 October 2014); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Health Technology Assessment Database and Health Economics Evaluations Database (November 2014, Issue 4 of 4). We searched several Asian databases (inception to July 2013) and the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) (inception to December 2013), as well as trial registers and reference lists of reviews and articles; we also approached experts in the field and applied no language restrictions in our search. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials lasting at least three months involving healthy adults or those at high risk of CVD. Trials examined any type of qigong, and comparison groups provided no intervention or minimal intervention. Outcomes of interest included clinical CVD events and major CVD risk factors. We did not include trials that involved multi‐factorial lifestyle interventions or weight loss. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion. Two review authors extracted data from included studies and assessed the risk of bias. 
Main results
We identified 11 completed trials (1369 participants) and one ongoing trial. Trials were heterogeneous in participants recruited, qigong duration and length of follow‐up periods. We were unable to ascertain the risk of bias in nine trials published in Chinese, as insufficient methodological details were reported and we were unable to contact the study authors to clarify this. 
We performed no meta‐analyses, as trials were small and were at significant risk of bias. Clinical events were detailed in subsequent reports of two trials when statistically significant effects of qigong were seen for all‐cause mortality, stroke mortality and stroke incidence at 20 to 30 years after completion of the trials. However, these trials were designed to examine outcomes in the short term, and it is not clear whether qigong was practised during extended periods of follow‐up; therefore effects cannot be attributed to the intervention. None of the included studies reported other non‐fatal CVD events. 
Six trials provided data that could be used to examine the effects of qigong on blood pressure. Reductions in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were seen in three and two trials, respectively. Three trials examined the effects of qigong on blood lipids when favourable effects were seen in one trial for total cholesterol, low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides, and two trials showed favourable effects on high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The only trial considered at low risk of selection and detection bias did not demonstrate statistically significant effects on CVD risk factors with qigong, but this study was small and was underpowered. None of the included studies reported incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D), adverse events, quality of life or costs. 
Authors' conclusions
Currently, very limited evidence is available on the effectiveness of qigong for the primary prevention of CVD. Most of the trials included in this review are likely to be at high risk of bias, so we have very low confidence in the validity of the results. Publication of the ongoing trial will add to the limited evidence base, but further trials of high methodological quality with sufficient sample size and follow‐up are needed to be incorporated in an update of this review before the effectiveness of qigong for CVD prevention can be established.","Qigong to prevent cardiovascular disease
Review question 
This review assessed the effectiveness of qigong interventions for reducing cardiovascular events and cardiovascular risk factors among healthy adults and those at high risk of cardiovascular disease. 
Background 
Cardiovascular disease is a global health burden. However, by changing several modifiable behaviours, such as by increasing exercise levels and by promoting relaxation to reduce stress, it is thought that cardiovascular risk can be reduced. Qigong originated in China and involves physical exercise, mind regulation and breathing control to restore Qi (the life energy force that flows around the body). Qigong might reduce stress and increase exercise levels. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to November 2014. We included trials with interventions lasting at least three months. 
Results and conclusion 
We found 11 completed trials (1369 participants). These trials showed variation in participants recruited, duration of qigong and follow‐up of the interventions. For two trials that were followed up for many years after trial completion, results showed that qigong had a beneficial effect on all‐cause mortality, stroke mortality and stroke incidence, but it is not clear whether this effect can be attributed to qigong, as it is uncertain whether qigong was practised during the years after the trials ended. Some beneficial effects of qigong on blood pressure and blood lipid levels were observed, but these results were based on only a small number of studies with small sample size that were at significant risk of bias. Therefore, additional large, high‐quality, long‐term trials are needed before we will be able to determine whether qigong is beneficial for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Qigong for Heart Health Prevention

## What was this study about?

Researchers wanted to find out if qigong could help prevent heart disease and stroke in healthy people or those at risk. Qigong is a traditional Chinese practice that combines gentle physical movements, breathing exercises, and mental focus.

## Why is this important?

Heart disease and stroke are major health problems. Not getting enough exercise and experiencing stress can increase the risk of these conditions. Since qigong involves both physical activity and stress reduction, researchers thought it might help prevent heart problems.

## What did the researchers do?

They searched medical databases for studies that:
- Tested qigong in healthy adults or people at risk for heart disease
- Lasted at least 3 months
- Compared qigong to doing nothing or minimal activity
- Measured heart-related outcomes like blood pressure and cholesterol

## What did they find?

The researchers found 11 completed studies with 1,369 participants total. However, there were significant limitations:
- The studies varied widely in how they were conducted
- Most studies had quality issues that made the results unreliable
- The studies were too small and too different to combine their results

Some studies showed improvements in:
- Blood pressure (in some but not all studies)
- Cholesterol levels (in some studies)

Two studies reported fewer deaths and strokes 20-30 years later, but these results are questionable because it's unclear if participants continued practicing qigong during those years.

## What's missing?

The studies did not report:
- Heart attacks or other major heart events
- Side effects
- Quality of life
- Costs

## Bottom line

Currently, there is not enough reliable evidence to know whether qigong prevents heart disease. Better quality studies with more participants and longer follow-up periods are needed before researchers can determine if qigong is effective for heart disease prevention.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What was studied
- Researchers reviewed clinical trials to see if qigong can help prevent heart and blood vessel disease.

Who was included
- Healthy adults or people at higher risk for heart disease.
- 11 completed trials with 1,369 participants; at least 3 months long. One trial is still ongoing.

What was done
- People practiced different types of qigong.
- Comparison groups had no program or a very minimal one.

What outcomes were measured
- Major heart and stroke events.
- Risk factors: blood pressure and blood fats (cholesterol and triglycerides).
- Also looked for type 2 diabetes, side effects, quality of life, and costs.

Main findings
- Trials were small and very different from each other, so results could not be combined.
- Two trials later reported fewer deaths and strokes 20–30 years after the original studies, but it isn’t clear if people kept doing qigong. We can’t link these long-term results to qigong.
- Blood pressure: 6 trials reported data; some showed lower systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure, others did not.
- Blood fats: 3 trials reported data; one showed lower total, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides; two showed higher HDL. Results were mixed.
- A higher-quality small trial found no clear benefits on risk factors.
- No trials reported type 2 diabetes, side effects, quality of life, or costs.

Safety
- No side effects were reported, but many trials did not track or report safety.

Study quality and limits
- Most trials had a high risk of bias and were too small. This makes the evidence very uncertain.

Bottom line
- There is very limited and low-quality evidence on qigong for preventing heart disease. We don’t know if it helps.
- Larger, well-designed trials with better reporting are needed.

Timeline
- Evidence was gathered from medical databases up to late 2014.
- One trial is still ongoing and may add new information."
10,"Background
Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly lethal disease with few effective treatment options. Over the past few decades, many anti‐cancer therapies have been tested in the locally advanced and metastatic setting, with mixed results. This review attempts to synthesise all the randomised data available to help better inform patient and clinician decision‐making when dealing with this difficult disease. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of chemotherapy, radiotherapy or both for first‐line treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer. Our primary outcome was overall survival, while secondary outcomes include progression‐free survival, grade 3/4 adverse events, therapy response and quality of life. 
Search methods
We searched for published and unpublished studies in CENTRAL (searched 14 June 2017), Embase (1980 to 14 June 2017), MEDLINE (1946 to 14 June 2017) and CANCERLIT (1999 to 2002) databases. We also handsearched all relevant conference abstracts published up until 14 June 2017. 
Selection criteria
All randomised studies assessing overall survival outcomes in patients with advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy, alone or in combination, were the eligible treatments. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently analysed studies, and a third settled any disputes. We extracted data on overall survival (OS), progression‐free survival (PFS), response rates, adverse events (AEs) and quality of life (QoL), and we assessed risk of bias for each study. 
Main results
We included 42 studies addressing chemotherapy in 9463 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. We did not identify any eligible studies on radiotherapy. 
We did not find any benefit for chemotherapy over best supportive care. However, two identified studies did not have sufficient data to be included in the analysis, and many of the chemotherapy regimens studied were outdated. 
Compared to gemcitabine alone, participants receiving 5FU had worse OS (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.27, moderate‐quality evidence), PFS (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.92) and QoL. On the other hand, two studies showed FOLFIRINOX was better than gemcitabine for OS (HR 0.51 95% CI 0.43 to 0.60, moderate‐quality evidence), PFS (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.57) and response rates (RR 3.38, 95% CI 2.01 to 5.65), but it increased the rate of side effects. The studies evaluating CO‐101, ZD9331 and exatecan did not show benefit or harm when compared with gemcitabine alone. 
Giving gemcitabine at a fixed dose rate improved OS (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.94, high‐quality evidence) but increased the rate of side effects when compared with bolus dosing. 
When comparing gemcitabine combinations to gemcitabine alone, gemcitabine plus platinum improved PFS (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.95) and response rates (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.98) but not OS (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.08, low‐quality evidence). The rate of side effects increased. Gemcitabine plus fluoropyrimidine improved OS (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.95), PFS (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.87) and response rates (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.47, high‐quality evidence), but it also increased side effects. Gemcitabine plus topoisomerase inhibitor did not improve survival outcomes but did increase toxicity. One study demonstrated that gemcitabine plus nab‐paclitaxel improved OS (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.84, high‐quality evidence), PFS (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.82) and response rates (RR 3.29, 95% CI 2.24 to 4.84) but increased side effects. Gemcitabine‐containing multi‐drug combinations (GEMOXEL or cisplatin/epirubicin/5FU/gemcitabine) improved OS (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.79, low‐quality evidence), PFS (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.62) and QOL. 
We did not find any survival advantages when comparing 5FU combinations to 5FU alone.
Authors' conclusions
Combination chemotherapy has recently overtaken the long‐standing gemcitabine as the standard of care. FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine plus nab‐paclitaxel are highly efficacious, but our analysis shows that other combination regimens also offer a benefit. Selection of the most appropriate chemotherapy for individual patients still remains difficult, with clinicopathological stratification remaining elusive. Biomarker development is essential to help rationalise treatment selection for patients.","The effects of anti‐cancer therapies on advanced pancreatic cancer
Review question 
This review aimed to answer the question, which therapies are the most effective for advanced pancreatic cancer? 
Background 
Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a serious, often fatal disease, and many people are not diagnosed until they have advanced tumours that cannot be removed with surgery. Symptoms include abdominal pain, weight loss, and yellowing of the skin and eyes. Up until recently, gemcitabine was the standard drug for treating advanced pancreatic cancer, but this gave people only a modest benefit. 
Study characteristics 
We looked for all studies in people with pancreatic cancer that could not be operated on (locally advanced) or that had already spread beyond the pancreas (metastatic). We found 42 clinical studies involving 9463 participants who were receiving their first therapy for PC. Our search is current to June 2017. 
The studies compared one therapy against either best supportive care (symptom management only) or another type of therapy. Studies had to evaluate overall survival (or time to death). The study could be testing either chemotherapy (drugs that kill or slow the growth of cancer cells) or radiotherapy (X‐ray treatment). We collected data on survival, tumour response rate, side effects and quality of life. The results of clinical studies addressing targeted/biological therapies, immunotherapies, second‐line therapies and local treatments for locally advanced disease will be reported in a separate Cochrane Review. 
Key results 
This review has shown that in advanced disease, combination chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX (5‐fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin combination); GEMOXEL (gemcitabine, oxaliplatin and capecitabine); cisplatin/epirubicin/5FU/gemcitabine; gemcitabine plus nab‐paclitaxel; and gemcitabine plus a fluoropyrimidine agent, provide a survival advantage over gemcitabine alone. These combinations do increase side effects. Gemcitabine given slowly using a fixed rate of infusion may be more effective than giving it in the standard way, which is quickly over 30 minutes. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence varied greatly amongst comparisons. The highest quality evidence was for gemcitabine versus fixed dose rate gemcitabine and some of the gemcitabine combinations (fluoropyrimidine, topoisomerase, and taxane). We judged the studies for quality using factors like how well they were conducted, how well they reported results and whether they used a placebo.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Treatment Options for Advanced Pancreatic Cancer

## What was this study about?

Researchers reviewed studies on treatments for people with advanced pancreatic cancer that has spread or cannot be removed with surgery. They wanted to find out which treatments work best to help people live longer and maintain their quality of life.

## What did the researchers look at?

The research team searched medical databases through June 2017 for studies that tested chemotherapy (cancer-fighting drugs) and radiation therapy. They found 42 studies involving 9,463 people with advanced pancreatic cancer. All studies looked at chemotherapy; none looked at radiation therapy alone.

## What were the main findings?

**Combination treatments generally worked better than single drugs:**

- **FOLFIRINOX** (a combination of four drugs) helped people live longer and delayed cancer growth better than gemcitabine alone, though it caused more side effects

- **Gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel** also helped people live longer and delayed cancer growth better than gemcitabine alone, but increased side effects

- **Gemcitabine plus other drugs** (like fluoropyrimidine) showed benefits for survival and slowing cancer growth compared to gemcitabine alone

- Giving gemcitabine at a steady rate rather than all at once helped people live longer

**Some treatments didn't show clear benefits:**

- The studies didn't show a clear advantage of chemotherapy over supportive care alone (though the data was limited)

- 5FU (an older drug) alone was less effective than gemcitabine

## What does this mean?

Combination chemotherapy treatments are now the preferred approach for advanced pancreatic cancer. While these combinations can help people live longer, they also cause more side effects. Doctors need better ways to determine which specific treatment is best for each individual patient.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary: First treatment options for advanced pancreatic cancer

Objective
- To find which first treatment works best for adults with advanced pancreatic cancer: chemotherapy, radiation, or both.
- Main measure: how long people lived. Others: time until the cancer got worse, tumor shrinkage, side effects, and quality of life.

Who was studied
- 42 randomized studies with 9,463 people who had advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
- No eligible radiation studies were found.

How the review was done
- Researchers searched major medical databases and meeting abstracts through June 14, 2017.
- Only randomized studies were included.

Treatments compared
- Single drugs: gemcitabine; 5‑fluorouracil (5FU).
- Combinations: FOLFIRINOX; gemcitabine + nab‑paclitaxel; gemcitabine + platinum drugs; gemcitabine + fluoropyrimidine; gemcitabine + topoisomerase inhibitor; multi‑drug mixes (such as GEMOXEL or cisplatin/epirubicin/5FU/gemcitabine).
- Other drugs tested with gemcitabine: CO‑101, ZD9331, exatecan.
- Different ways to give gemcitabine: fixed dose rate vs quick (bolus) dose.

Key findings
- Chemotherapy vs best supportive care: no clear benefit was shown in the small, older studies available.
- 5FU alone was worse than gemcitabine alone for survival and quality of life.
- FOLFIRINOX was better than gemcitabine alone for living longer, delaying worsening, and tumor response, but caused more side effects.
- Gemcitabine given at a fixed dose rate helped people live longer than quick dosing, but caused more side effects.
- Gemcitabine + platinum: improved time without worsening and tumor response, but not overall survival; more side effects.
- Gemcitabine + fluoropyrimidine: improved survival, time without worsening, and response; more side effects.
- Gemcitabine + topoisomerase inhibitor: no survival benefit; more side effects.
- Gemcitabine + nab‑paclitaxel: improved survival, time without worsening, and response; more side effects.
- Multi‑drug gemcitabine combinations: improved survival, time without worsening, and quality of life in some studies.
- 5FU combinations did not help people live longer compared with 5FU alone.
- Some newer drugs tested with gemcitabine (CO‑101, ZD9331, exatecan) did not show clear benefit or harm.

Safety
- Most combination treatments worked better but caused more serious side effects. Side effects varied by regimen.

Bottom line
- Combination chemotherapy has become the usual first treatment over gemcitabine alone.
- FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine + nab‑paclitaxel showed strong benefits but with higher side effects.
- Other gemcitabine‑based combinations can also help.
- The best choice depends on the person’s health and ability to handle side effects. Discuss options and risks with your care team.

Timing note
- Evidence comes from studies found up to June 14, 2017, and some older regimens may no longer be commonly used."
11,"Background
Poor nutrition occurs frequently in people with cystic fibrosis and is associated with other adverse outcomes. Oral calorie supplements are used to increase total daily calorie intake and improve weight gain. However, they are expensive and there are concerns they may reduce the amount of food eaten and not improve overall energy intake. This is an update of a previously published review. 
Objectives
To establish whether in people with cystic fibrosis, oral calorie supplements: increase daily calorie intake; and improve overall nutritional intake, nutritional indices, lung function, survival and quality of life. To assess adverse effects associated with using these supplements. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register comprising references from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We contacted companies marketing oral calorie supplements. 
Last search: 18 October 2016.
Selection criteria
Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing use of oral calorie supplements for at least one month to increase calorie intake with no specific intervention or additional nutritional advice in people with cystic fibrosis. 
Data collection and analysis
We independently selected the included trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted the authors of included trials and obtained additional information for two trials. 
Main results
We identified 21 trials and included three, reporting results from 131 participants lasting between three months and one year. Two trials compared supplements to additional nutritional advice and one to no intervention. Two of the included trials recruited only children. In one trial the risk of bias was low across all domains, in a second trial the risk of bias was largely unclear and in the third mainly low. Blinding of participants was unclear in two of the trials. Also, in one trial the clinical condition of groups appeared to be unevenly balanced at baseline and in another trial there were concerns surrounding allocation concealment. There were no significant differences between people receiving supplements or dietary advice alone for change in weight, height, body mass index, z score or other indices of nutrition or growth. Changes in weight (kg) at three, six and 12 months respectively were: mean difference (MD) 0.32 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.09 to 0.72); MD 0.47 (95% CI ‐0.07 to 1.02 ); and MD 0.16 (‐0.68 to 1.00). Total calorie intake was greater in people taking supplements at 12 months, MD 265.70 (95% CI 42.94 to 488.46). There were no significant differences between the groups for anthropometric measures of body composition, lung function, gastro‐intestinal adverse effects or activity levels. Moderate quality evidence exists for the outcomes of changes in weight and height and low quality evidence exists for the outcomes of change in total calories, total fat and total protein intake as results are applicable only to children between the ages of 2 and 15 years and many post‐treatment diet diaries were not returned. Evidence for the rate of adverse events in the treatment groups was extremely limited and judged to be of very low quality 
Authors' conclusions
Oral calorie supplements do not confer any additional benefit in the nutritional management of moderately malnourished children with cystic fibrosis over and above the use of dietary advice and monitoring alone. While nutritional supplements may be used, they should not be regarded as essential. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to establish the role of short‐term oral protein energy supplements in people with cystic fibrosis and acute weight loss and also for the long‐term nutritional management of adults with cystic fibrosis or advanced lung disease, or both.","Use of oral supplements to increase calorie intake in people with cystic fibrosis
We reviewed the evidence for the use of oral supplements to increase calorie intake in people with cystic fibrosis. 
Background 
Cystic fibrosis affects many organs, including the digestive system, and can lead to food not being absorbed as it should be, which in turn leads to growth problems. Children with cystic fibrosis need more energy than other children, but they often have reduced appetites. Poor diet has been linked to poor outcomes in cystic fibrosis. Milks or juices containing additional calories are often added to the diets of children with cystic fibrosis to increase their total daily calorie intake and help them gain weight. However, these supplements are expensive and may not achieve the desired effect if patients take them as a substitute for calories consumed from food rather than as an additional component. In toddlers or young children use of supplements may risk compromising the development of normal eating behaviour. This is an updated version of the review. 
Search date 
We last searched for evidence on 18 October 2016.
Study characteristics 
This review includes three randomised controlled trials with a total of 131 participants and two of them only included children. Two of the trials compared supplements to dietary advice and one compared supplements to no advice. The trials lasted between three months and one year. 
Key results 
There were no major differences between people receiving supplements or just dietary advice for any nutritional or growth measurements. This was also true for measures of body composition, lung function, adverse effects on the digestive system or people's levels of activity. Advice and monitoring appear to be enough to manage the diet of moderately malnourished children. 
Future trials should look into the use of calorie supplements for acute weight loss or long‐term care for adults with cystic fibrosis. 
Quality of the evidence 
One of the trials appeared to be well run and the risk of bias was low for all the aspects of trial design that we assessed; so we do not think any bias will influence the results in a negative way. In the other two trials, we were not sure if the people taking part could guess which treatment group they were in. In one of these two trials, we further thought it was likely that the person recruiting them to the trial knew which group the participant would be in. In the second of these trials, the people in the group receiving supplements appeared to be generally in better clinical condition at the start of the trial than those who didn't receive any supplements or advice. These factors affect our confidence in the results from these trials. 
We judged the quality of the evidence for the changes in weight and height to be moderate, but judged the quality of the evidence for the changes in total calories, total fat and total protein intake as low since results are applicable only to children aged between 2 and 15 years; also many post‐treatment diet diaries were not returned to the investigators. Evidence for the rate of adverse events in the treatment groups was extremely limited and judged to be of very low quality.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Oral Calorie Supplements for People with Cystic Fibrosis

## What was this study about?

Researchers reviewed studies to see if oral calorie supplements (special drinks or foods with extra calories) help people with cystic fibrosis gain weight and improve their health.

## Why is this important?

Many people with cystic fibrosis struggle to maintain a healthy weight. Doctors sometimes recommend calorie supplements to help them gain weight. However, these supplements are expensive, and some worry they might replace regular meals rather than add extra calories.

## What did researchers look for?

The review included studies where people with cystic fibrosis took oral calorie supplements for at least one month. Researchers compared them to people who received nutritional advice or no special treatment. They looked at:
- Weight gain
- Height growth
- Total daily calorie intake
- Lung function
- Quality of life
- Side effects

## What did they find?

Researchers found 3 studies with 131 people (mostly children ages 2-15). The studies lasted between 3 months and 1 year.

**Key findings:**
- People taking supplements ate more total calories each day
- However, there was **no significant difference** in weight gain, height growth, or body composition between those taking supplements and those receiving dietary advice alone
- No major differences were found in lung function or activity levels
- Very little information was available about side effects

## What does this mean?

For children with cystic fibrosis who are moderately underweight, oral calorie supplements don't appear to provide extra benefits beyond regular dietary advice and monitoring. While supplements may still be used, they shouldn't be considered essential.

More research is needed for adults with cystic fibrosis and people experiencing sudden weight loss.",0,Plano,"Plain-Language Summary

- Last search date for studies: October 18, 2016.

What treatments were compared
- Oral calorie supplements (drinks or powders) added to the diet
- Versus extra dietary advice or no added treatment

What outcomes were measured
- Daily calories eaten
- Weight, height, body mass index (BMI), and other growth/nutrition measures
- Lung function and activity levels
- Side effects, especially stomach or gut problems
- Quality of life and survival (looked for, but limited data)

Key findings
- Weight and growth: No meaningful differences between supplements and dietary advice alone at 3, 6, or 12 months.
- Daily calories: People taking supplements ate more total calories at 12 months (about 266 calories more per day).
- Body composition, lung function, and activity: No important differences between groups.
- Quality of evidence: Moderate for weight and height; low for calorie and nutrient intake (many food diaries were missing); very limited for side effects.

Safety
- No clear differences in stomach or gut side effects between groups.
- Overall side effect reporting was very limited.

What this means
- For moderately undernourished children with cystic fibrosis, oral calorie supplements did not provide extra benefit over good dietary advice and regular monitoring.
- Supplements may be used, but they are not essential for most children in this situation.

Gaps and future research
- More trials are needed, especially for:
  - Short-term use during sudden weight loss
  - Adults with cystic fibrosis
  - People with advanced lung disease
  - Better tracking of side effects and quality of life over time"
12,"Background
The use of etomidate for emergency airway interventions in critically ill patients is very common. In one large registry trial, etomidate was the most commonly used agent for this indication. Etomidate is known to suppress adrenal gland function, but it remains unclear whether or not this adrenal gland dysfunction affects mortality. 
Objectives
The primary objective was to assess, in populations of critically ill patients, whether a single induction dose of etomidate for emergency airway intervention affects mortality. 
The secondary objectives were to address, in populations of critically ill patients, whether a single induction dose of etomidate for emergency airway intervention affects adrenal gland function, organ dysfunction, or health services utilization (as measured by intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), duration of mechanical ventilation, or vasopressor requirements). 
We repeated analyses within subgroups defined by the aetiologies of critical illness, timing of adrenal gland function measurement, and the type of comparator drug used. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; CINAHL; EMBASE; LILACS; International Pharmaceutical Abstracts; Web of Science; the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE); and ISI BIOSIS Citation indexSM on 8 February 2013. We reran the searches in August 2014. We will deal with any studies of interest when we update the review. 
We also searched the Scopus database of dissertations and conference proceedings and the US Food and Drug Administration Database. We handsearched major emergency medicine, critical care, and anaesthesiology journals. 
We handsearched the conference proceedings of major emergency medicine, anaesthesia, and critical care conferences from 1990 to current, and performed a grey literature search of the following: Current Controlled Trials; National Health Service – The National Research Register; ClinicalTrials.gov; NEAR website. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials in patients undergoing emergency endotracheal intubation for critical illness, including but not limited to trauma, stroke, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, septic shock, hypovolaemic or haemorrhagic shock, and undifferentiated shock states. We included single (bolus) dose etomidate for emergency airway intervention compared to any other rapid‐acting intravenous bolus single‐dose induction agent. 
Data collection and analysis
Refinement of our initial search results by title review, and then by abstract review was carried out by three review authors. Full‐text review of potential studies was based on their adherence to our inclusion and exclusion criteria. This was decided by three independent review authors. We reported the decisions regarding inclusion and exclusion in accordance with the PRISMA statement. 
Electronic database searching yielded 1635 potential titles, and our grey literature search yielded an additional 31 potential titles. Duplicate titles were filtered leaving 1395 titles which underwent review of their titles and abstracts by three review authors. Sixty seven titles were judged to be relevant to our review, however only eight met our inclusion criteria and seven were included in our analysis. 
Main results
We included eight studies in the review and seven in the meta‐analysis. Of those seven studies, only two were judged to be at low risk of bias. Overall, no strong evidence exists that etomidate increases mortality in critically ill patients when compared to other bolus dose induction agents (odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.60, 6 studies, 772 participants, moderate quality evidence). Due to a large number of participants lost to follow‐up, we performed a post hoc sensitivity analysis. This gave a similar result (OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.53). There was evidence that the use of etomidate in critically ill patients was associated with a positive adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test, and this difference was more pronounced at between 4 to 6 hours (OR 19.98; 95% CI 3.95 to 101.11) than after 12 hours (OR 2.37; 95% CI 1.61 to 3.47) post‐dosing. Etomidate's use in critically ill patients was associated with a small increase in SOFA score, indicating a higher risk of multisystem organ failure (mean difference (MD) 0.70; 95% CI 0.01 to 1.39, 2 studies, 591 participants, high quality evidence), but this difference was not clinically meaningful. Etomidate use did not have an effect on ICU LOS (MD 1.70 days; 95% CI ‐2.00 to 5.40, 4 studies, 621 participants, moderate quality evidence), hospital LOS (MD 2.41 days; 95% CI ‐7.08 to 11.91, 3 studies, 152 participants, moderate quality evidence), duration of mechanical ventilation (MD 2.14 days; 95% CI ‐1.67 to 5.95, 3 studies, 621 participants, moderate quality evidence), or duration of vasopressor use (MD 1.00 day; 95% CI ‐0.53 to 2.53, 1 study, 469 participants). 
Authors' conclusions
Although we have not found conclusive evidence that etomidate increases mortality or healthcare resource utilization in critically ill patients, it does seem to increase the risk of adrenal gland dysfunction and multi‐organ system dysfunction by a small amount. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. This evidence is judged to be of moderate quality, owing mainly to significant attrition bias in some of the smaller studies, and new research may influence the outcomes of our review. The applicability of these data may be limited by the fact that 42% of the patients in our review were intubated for ""being comatose"", a population less likely to benefit from the haemodynamic stability inherent in etomidate use, and less at risk from its potential negative downstream effects of adrenal suppression.","Etomidate for sedating critically ill people during emergency endotracheal intubation
Review question 
Does a single dose of etomidate increase mortality or complications in people who are critically ill and undergoing emergency endotracheal intubation? 
Background 
People who are critically ill often need help breathing. One way to do this is called endotracheal intubation. This involves placing a tube into the windpipe (trachea) and having a ventilator (breathing machine) help the patient breathe. 
People are often given sedative agents during endotracheal intubation to make them unaware of the procedure. Many sedative agents cause a potentially harmful drop in blood pressure. 
Etomidate is commonly used to sedate patients before endotracheal intubation because it has minimal effects on blood pressure. However, when someone is given etomidate their adrenal glands do not function as well. This may be harmful to them. 
Study characteristics 
We looked at the evidence up to February 2013 and found 1666 studies. We included eight studies in our review and seven studies (involving 772 patients) in our meta‐analysis. The studies involved people who were in an unstable condition and critically ill. They were given one dose of etomidate or another sedative agent for endotracheal intubation. We reran the search in August 2014. We will deal with any studies of interest when we update the review. 
Results 
No strong evidence exists to suggest that etomidate, when compared to other bolus dose induction agents, increases mortality in critically ill patients. We must be careful in interpreting this finding because only large studies would be able to show a difference in mortality. So far, no such study has been completed. 
Etomidate does seem to impair adrenal gland functioning. Functioning is impaired most between four and six hours after etomidate is given. 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores are used to find out how badly someone’s organs are failing. Using etomidate results in worse SOFA scores but this difference is small and not clinically meaningful. 
The effects of impaired adrenal gland functioning and higher SOFA scores on people’s health is unknown. Using etomidate does not seem to increase the length of time someone is in hospital (including an intensive care unit), the length of time a person is connected to a mechanical ventilator (a machine to assist with breathing), or the use of vasopressors (medicines to increase blood pressure). 
Quality of the evidence 
Most of the evidence was moderate quality. This is mainly because some small studies we looked at did not check up on people adequately after they were intubated. 
Most people that were involved in one study were intubated because they were in a coma. These people comprise 42% of those involved in the studies we looked at. People in a coma are unlike other critically ill people because they may not benefit to the same extent from having stable blood pressure during endotracheal intubation, which etomidate provides, nor are they at high risk from impaired adrenal gland function compared to other critically ill patients, for example those with severe infection.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Study on Etomidate for Emergency Breathing Tube Insertion

## What was this study about?

Researchers reviewed existing studies to learn whether a medication called etomidate is safe when used to help insert breathing tubes in critically ill patients during emergencies.

## Why was this important?

Etomidate is commonly used to sedate patients before inserting a breathing tube. While it works well for this purpose, doctors know it can temporarily affect how the adrenal glands work (glands that help the body respond to stress). Researchers wanted to know if this side effect could lead to serious problems or death.

## Who was studied?

The review looked at critically ill patients who needed emergency breathing tubes. This included people with various serious conditions like severe infections, shock, trauma, stroke, or heart problems.

## What did researchers do?

They searched medical databases and found 8 studies involving 772 patients. These studies compared etomidate to other similar medications used for the same purpose. They looked at:
- Whether patients survived
- How the adrenal glands functioned after receiving etomidate
- How long patients stayed in the hospital and intensive care unit
- How long patients needed breathing machines or blood pressure medications

## What did they find?

- **Survival**: Etomidate did not clearly increase the risk of death compared to other medications
- **Adrenal glands**: Etomidate did affect adrenal gland function, especially in the first 4-6 hours after use
- **Organ function**: There was a small increase in organ problems, but it may not be meaningful in real-world care
- **Hospital stays and breathing support**: Etomidate did not significantly affect how long patients stayed in the hospital or needed breathing machines

## What does this mean?

Etomidate appears reasonably safe for emergency breathing tube insertion in critically ill patients, though it does temporarily affect adrenal gland function. More research may help doctors better understand when etomidate is the best choice.",0,Plano,"Plain-Language Summary

What is this study about?
- This review looked at whether giving one dose of etomidate to help place a breathing tube in very sick patients affects survival and recovery.

Who was studied?
- People who needed emergency breathing tube placement because of critical illness (for example: serious infections, shock, heart problems, trauma, or coma).

What was compared?
- One dose of etomidate (a fast-acting sleep medicine used for intubation)
- Versus other similar single-dose medicines used for the same purpose

Main questions (outcomes)
- Death (mortality)
- Adrenal gland function (how the body handles stress hormones)
- Organ function (SOFA score)
- Use of healthcare: time in the ICU and hospital, time on a breathing machine, and time needing medicines to support blood pressure

How was the research done?
- Review of 8 randomized trials (7 included in pooled analysis)
- Searches covered many medical databases up to August 2014
- Total participants varied by outcome; two studies had low risk of bias
- Overall evidence quality: mostly moderate

Key results
- Survival: No strong evidence that etomidate changes the risk of death compared with other drugs.
- Adrenal function: Etomidate more often led to short-term adrenal suppression on a lab test.
  - Strongest within 4–6 hours after the dose; smaller effect after 12 hours.
- Organ function: Small increase in organ failure score with etomidate, but the difference was not clinically meaningful.
- Healthcare use: No clear difference in ICU stay, hospital stay, time on ventilator, or time on blood-pressure medicines.

Timing of measurements
- Adrenal function was checked at about 4–6 hours and again after 12 hours post-dose.
- Other outcomes were measured during the hospital stay.

Safety
- Etomidate was linked to short-term adrenal suppression and a small, not clinically important, rise in organ failure score.
- No clear increase in death or longer hospital care compared with other medicines.

What this means
- For emergency intubation in very sick patients, a single dose of etomidate did not clearly change survival or length of care but did temporarily affect stress hormone response.
- New studies may change these findings."
13,"Background
Traditionally inhaled treatment for asthma has used separate preventer and reliever therapies. The combination of formoterol and budesonide in one inhaler has made possible a single inhaler for both prevention and relief of symptoms (single inhaler therapy or SiT). 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of budesonide and formoterol in a single inhaler for maintenance and reliever therapy in asthma compared with maintenance with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (alone or as part of current best practice) and any reliever therapy. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register in February 2013.
Selection criteria
Parallel, randomised controlled trials of 12 weeks or longer in adults and children with chronic asthma. Studies had to assess the combination of formoterol and budesonide as SiT, against a control group that received inhaled steroids and a separate reliever inhaler. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We included 13 trials involving 13,152 adults and one of the trials also involved 224 children (which have been separately reported). All studies were sponsored by the manufacturer of the SiT inhaler. We considered the nine studies assessing SiT against best practice to be at a low risk of selection bias, but a high risk of detection bias as they were unblinded. 
In adults whose asthma was not well‐controlled on ICS, the reduction in hospital admission with SiT did not reach statistical significance (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 1.44, eight trials, N = 8841, low quality evidence due to risk of detection bias in open studies and imprecision). The rates of hospital admission were low; for every 1000 people treated with current best practice six would experience a hospital admission over six months compared with between three and eight treated with SiT. The odds of experiencing exacerbations needing treatment with oral steroids were lower with SiT compared with control (OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.70 to 0.98, eight trials, N = 8841, moderate quality evidence due to risk of detection bias). For every 100 adults treated with current best practice over six months, seven required a course of oral steroids, whilst for SiT there would be six (95% CI 5 to 7). The small reduction in time to first severe exacerbation needing medical intervention was not statistically significant (hazard ratio (HR) 0.94; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.04, five trials, N = 7355). Most trials demonstrated a reduction in the mean total daily dose of ICS with SiT (mean reduction was based on self‐reported data from patient diaries and ranged from 107 to 385 µg/day). Withdrawals due to adverse events were more common in people treated with SiT in comparison to current best practice (OR 2.85; 95% CI 1.89 to 4.30, moderate quality evidence due to risk of detection bias). 
Three studies including 4209 adults compared SiT with higher dose budesonide maintenance and terbutaline for symptom relief. The studies were considered as low risk of bias. The run‐in for these studies involved withdrawal of LABA, and patients were recruited who were symptomatic during run‐in. The reduction in the odds of hospitalisation with SiT compared with higher dose ICS did not reach statistical significance (Peto OR; 0.56; 95% CI 0.28 to 1.09, moderate quality evidence due to imprecision). Fewer patients on SiT needed a course of oral corticosteroids (OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.64, high quality evidence). For every 100 adults treated with ICS over 11 months, 18 required a course of oral steroids, whilst for SiT there would be 11 (95% CI 9 to 12). Withdrawals due to adverse events were less common in people treated with SiT in comparison to higher dose budesonide maintenance (OR 0.57; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.93, high quality evidence). 
One study included children (N = 224), in which SiT was compared with higher dose budesonide. There was a significant reduction in participants who needed an increase in their inhaled steroids with SiT, but there were only two hospitalisations for asthma and no separate data on courses of oral corticosteroids. Less inhaled and oral corticosteroids were used in the SiT group and the annual height gain was also 1 cm greater in the SiT group, (95% CI 0.3 cm to 1.7 cm). 
The results for fatal serious adverse events were too rare to rule out either treatment being harmful. There was no significant difference found in non‐fatal serious adverse events for any of the comparisons. 
Authors' conclusions
Single inhaler therapy has now been demonstrated to reduce exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids against current best practice strategies and against a fixed higher dose of inhaled steroids. The strength of evidence that SiT reduces hospitalisation against these same treatments is weak. There were more discontinuations due to adverse events on SiT compared to current best practice, but no significant differences in serious adverse events. Our confidence in these conclusions is limited by the open‐label design of the trials, and by the unknown adherence to treatment in the current best practice arms of the trials. 
Single inhaler therapy can reduce the risk of asthma exacerbations needing oral corticosteroids in comparison with fixed dose maintenance ICS and separate relief medication. The reduced odds of exacerbations with SiT compared with higher dose ICS should be viewed in the context of the possible impact of LABA withdrawal during study run‐in. This may have made the study populations more likely to respond to SiT. 
Single inhaler therapy is not currently licensed for children under 18 years of age in the United Kingdom and there is currently very little research evidence for this approach in children or adolescents.","In people with asthma are single inhalers that contain both formoterol and budesonide better than current best practice? 
Background to the review  ‘Single inhaler therapy’ means that a single inhaler containing two drugs is used. One of these drugs acts quickly and is called the ""reliever"". The other works much more slowly and is called the ""preventer"". The reliever is a beta‐agonist bronchodilator, which help to open the airways and help people breathe more easily. The preventer is a steroid that controls the underlying inflammation in the lungs, which is caused by the asthma. People on 'single inhaler therapy' (SiT) have one inhaler for use every day to control their underlying inflammation and also for symptom relief. The idea behind SiT is that when people take their inhalers to reduce their shortness of breath or wheezing they will also be getting an increased dose of the steroid preventer. 
We wanted to discover whether using the SiT was better or worse than alternatives, such as receiving two separate inhalers for regular treatment and relief of symptoms.  What did we do?  We reviewed the clinical trials that looked at SiT against inhaled steroids and reliever medication given as two separate inhalers (sometimes called current best practice).  What did we find out?  We found 13 trials on 13,152 adults and one trial also included 224 children, up to February 2013. The trials were all sponsored by the manufacturer of the single inhaler.  When compared with current best practice or higher doses of inhaled steroid, we found that SiT probably reduces the number of flare‐ups that will need treatment with an oral steroid in adults but we are uncertain whether the number of adults admitted to hospital would be reduced. When compared with high doses of inhaled steroids, we found that fewer people experienced a flare‐up that needed treatment with an oral steroid.  The results for death (1 per 1000 people given either treatment), or life threatening problems (just under 50 per 1000 people given either treatment), were too imprecise to enable us to rule out either treatment being more harmful than the other. More adults left the trial early because they experienced adverse effects in the group taking single inhalers. There was only one small trial in children, so we are unable to make any firm conclusions in children.  The studies were generally well‐designed, although in the studies which compared SiT against current best practice people knew which treatment they were getting, and this could have affected the reliability of the results. The studies comparing SiT against inhaled steroids were designed differently and were more reliable. Overall, we think that more evidence from future trials might change the strength of the conclusions for the question of whether SiT is better than current best practice. We believe that there is good quality evidence that SiT is more effective than high dose inhaled steroids, although the studies recruited people who were likely to respond.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Single Inhaler Therapy for Asthma

## What was studied?

Researchers looked at a different way to treat asthma using one inhaler instead of two. Traditionally, people with asthma use two separate inhalers:
- A ""preventer"" inhaler taken daily to control asthma
- A ""reliever"" inhaler used when symptoms occur

This study examined a single inhaler containing both budesonide (a steroid that prevents symptoms) and formoterol (a medicine that quickly relieves symptoms). People could use this one inhaler for both daily prevention and quick relief when needed.

## Who participated?

The study included 13,152 adults and 224 children with chronic asthma. Most participants were adults whose asthma wasn't well-controlled with their current treatment.

## What was compared?

Researchers compared the single inhaler approach to:
- Standard treatment (separate preventer and reliever inhalers)
- Higher doses of steroid preventers with a separate reliever inhaler

The studies lasted between 3 and 11 months.

## What were the main findings?

**Compared to standard treatment:**
- Slightly fewer people needed oral steroid pills for asthma flare-ups (6 out of 100 people versus 7 out of 100)
- Hospital admissions were similar between groups (both were rare)
- People using the single inhaler used lower daily doses of steroids
- More people stopped treatment due to side effects with the single inhaler

**Compared to higher-dose steroid preventers:**
- Fewer people needed oral steroid pills (11 out of 100 versus 18 out of 100)
- Hospital admissions were similar
- Fewer people stopped treatment due to side effects with the single inhaler

**In children:**
- Only one small study included children
- Children using the single inhaler grew about 1 cm more per year
- More research is needed in children

## Important notes

- All studies were funded by the company making the single inhaler
- Most studies were ""open-label,"" meaning participants knew which treatment they received
- The single inhaler is not currently approved for children under 18 in the United Kingdom
- Serious side effects were rare in both treatment approaches",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the clinical trial review

What was studied
- A single inhaler that combines budesonide (a preventer steroid) and formoterol (a fast-acting bronchodilator) used for both daily control and quick relief. This is called single inhaler therapy (SiT).
- SiT was compared to:
  - Current best practice: a daily inhaled steroid (ICS) with a separate reliever inhaler.
  - A higher daily dose of inhaled budesonide with terbutaline as the reliever.

Who was included
- 13 trials with 13,152 adults; 1 trial also included 224 children.
- Trials lasted at least 12 weeks; many ran about 6 to 11 months.

What researchers measured
- Asthma flare-ups needing oral steroid tablets.
- Hospital admissions.
- Time to first severe flare-up.
- Daily dose of inhaled steroids used.
- Side effects and serious safety events.
- Study dropouts due to side effects.

Main results in adults
- SiT vs current best practice (daily ICS + separate reliever):
  - Fewer people needed oral steroid tablets for flare-ups with SiT.
  - Hospital admissions were low in both groups; the small difference with SiT was not clearly proven.
  - Time to first severe flare-up was similar.
  - People on SiT often used a lower total daily dose of inhaled steroids.
  - More people stopped treatment due to side effects with SiT.
  - Serious side effects were similar between groups.

- SiT vs higher-dose budesonide + terbutaline reliever:
  - Fewer people on SiT needed oral steroid tablets for flare-ups.
  - Hospital admissions were uncommon; the difference with SiT was not clearly proven.
  - Fewer people stopped treatment due to side effects with SiT.
  - Serious side effects were similar between groups.

Results in children (one small study)
- SiT led to fewer increases in inhaled steroid dose.
- Children on SiT used less inhaled and oral steroids and grew about 1 cm more over a year.
- Only two hospitalizations occurred in total; no separate data on oral steroid courses.
- Note: In the UK, SiT was not licensed for under 18s at the time, and evidence in children is limited.

Safety
- Serious (non-fatal) side effects were similar across treatments.
- Deaths were too rare to compare.
- Adults: stopping treatment due to side effects was more common with SiT vs current best practice, but less common vs higher-dose budesonide.

Study quality notes
- Most adult studies were open-label (people knew their treatment), which can affect results.
- All studies were funded by the SiT inhaler manufacturer.

Timing
- Evidence comes from trials found up to February 2013; many ran about 6–11 months.

Bottom line
- For adults with asthma, using the budesonide–formoterol single inhaler for both daily control and quick relief lowers the chance of flare-ups needing oral steroid tablets compared with both current best practice and higher-dose inhaled steroids.
- It is unclear if SiT reduces hospital stays.
- Serious safety was similar, but treatment stoppage due to side effects varied by comparison.
- Evidence in children is limited."
14,"Background
The recommended management for neonates with a possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI) is hospitalisation and treatment with intravenous antibiotics, such as ampicillin plus gentamicin. However, hospitalisation is often not feasible for neonates in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs). Therefore, alternative options for the management of neonatal PSBI in LMICs needs to be evaluated. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of community‐based antibiotics for neonatal PSBI in LMICs on neonatal mortality and to assess whether the effects of community‐based antibiotics for neonatal PSBI differ according to the antibiotic regimen administered. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2018, Issue 3), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 16 April 2018), Embase (1980 to 16 April 2018), and CINAHL (1982 to 16 April 2018). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomised trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised, quasi‐randomised and cluster‐randomised trials. For the first comparison, we included trials that compared antibiotics which were initiated and completed in the community to the standard hospital referral for neonatal PSBI in LMICs. For the second comparison, we included trials that compared simplified antibiotic regimens which relied more on oral antibiotics than intravenous antibiotics to the standard regimen of seven to 10 days of injectable penicillin/ampicillin with an injectable aminoglycoside delivered in the community to treat neonatal PSBI. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data using the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Group. The primary outcomes were all‐cause neonatal mortality and sepsis‐specific neonatal mortality. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence. 
Main results
For the first comparison, five studies met the inclusion criteria. Community‐based antibiotic delivery for neonatal PSBI reduced neonatal mortality when compared to hospital referral only (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 0.99; 5 studies, n = 125,134; low‐quality evidence). There was, however, a high level of statistical heterogeneity (I² = 87%) likely, due to the heterogenous nature of the study settings as well as the fact that four of the studies provided various co‐interventions in conjunction with community‐based antibiotics. Community‐based antibiotic delivery for neonatal PSBI showed a possible effect on reducing sepsis‐specific neonatal mortality (typical RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.00; 2 studies, n = 40,233; low‐quality evidence). 
For the second comparison, five studies met the inclusion criteria. Using a simplified antibiotic approach resulted in similar rates of neonatal mortality when compared to the standard regimen of seven days of injectable procaine benzylpenicillin and injectable procaine benzylpenicillin and injectable gentamicin delivered in community‐settings for neonatal PSBI (typical RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.50; 3 studies, n = 3476; moderate‐quality evidence). In subgroup analysis, the simplified antibiotic regimen of seven days of oral amoxicillin and injectable gentamicin showed no difference in neonatal mortality (typical RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.51; 3 studies, n = 2001; moderate‐quality evidence). Two days of injectable benzylpenicillin and injectable gentamicin followed by five days of oral amoxicillin showed no difference in neonatal mortality (typical RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.65; 3 studies, n = 2036; low‐quality evidence). Two days of injectable gentamicin and oral amoxicillin followed by five days of oral amoxicillin showed no difference in neonatal mortality (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.85; 1 study, n = 893; moderate‐quality evidence). For fast breathing alone, seven days of oral amoxicillin resulted in no difference in neonatal mortality (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.20 to 4.91; 1 study, n = 1406; low‐quality evidence). None of the studies in the second comparison reported the effect of a simplified antibiotic regimen on sepsis‐specific neonatal mortality. 
Authors' conclusions
Low‐quality data demonstrated that community‐based antibiotics reduced neonatal mortality when compared to the standard hospital referral for neonatal PSBI in resource‐limited settings. The use of co‐interventions, however, prevent disentanglement of the contribution from community‐based antibiotics. Moderate‐quality evidence showed that simplified, community‐based treatment of PSBI using regimens which rely on the combination of oral and injectable antibiotics did not result in increased neonatal mortality when compared to the standard treatment of using only injectable antibiotics. Overall, the evidence suggests that simplified, community‐based antibiotics may be efficacious to treat neonatal PSBI when hospitalisation is not feasible. However, implementation research is recommended to study the effectiveness and scale‐up of simplified, community‐based antibiotics in resource‐limited settings.","Antibiotics delivered in the home or clinic for newborns with suspected, serious infections in low‐ and middle‐income countries 
Review question 
In low‐ and middle‐income countries, are antibiotics delivered in the home or clinic an effective method for treating newborns with suspected, serious bacterial infections? 
Background 
Given their fragility, newborns with a suspected, serious bacterial infection are advised to be admitted to a hospital and receive intravenous antibiotics. However, hospital admission is often not possible for families who live in countries with limited resources. Therefore, alternative methods of delivering antibiotics to sick newborns have been studied. Treating a newborn outside of the hospital relies on a community health worker with limited, but targeted training, to diagnose the infection, dispense medication, and follow‐up the newborn's response, either at home or in a clinic. Also, antibiotics may be provided orally so that parents can administer at home, but oral antibiotics may be less potent than intravenous antibiotics. 
Study characteristics 
We searched medical databases and found two types of studies that addressed our review question. One group of five trials studied communities in which sick newborns were offered antibiotics in the home or ambulatory clinics and compared them to communities in which sick newborns received only the standard referral to a hospital. The second group of five trials treated sick newborns in the home or clinic with either the intravenous antibiotics that are typically administered in the hospital or with simpler antibiotic regimens that relied more on oral antibiotics. The trials were conducted in a variety of countries within sub‐Saharan Africa and South Asia. The evidence is up to date as of 16 April 2018. 
Key results 
There is reduced risk of newborn death when sick newborns are given antibiotics in the home or clinic compared to sick newborns who are only referred to a hospital, but this result is based on low‐quality evidence. In addition, the majority of the studies that examined home‐ or clinic‐based antibiotics included other interventions, such as improved care at birth, that may have influenced the findings. 
Moderate‐quality evidence showed that antibiotic regimens that involve fewer injections and can be administered in the home or clinic do not result in more newborn deaths when compared to the typically administered antibiotic regimens that rely solely on injections. Based on this result, simpler antibiotic regimens delivered in the home or clinic may be considered as an alternative treatment for sick newborns that cannot access a hospital. However, it is important to remember that the studies were conducted under ideal conditions with a high level of patient monitoring. Additional research in real‐world settings with limited resources are recommended to determine if the results hold true. 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of evidence ranged from low to moderate quality.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Community-Based Antibiotics for Newborns with Serious Infections

## What was this study about?

Researchers reviewed studies to see if antibiotics given to newborns in their communities could help treat serious bacterial infections when hospital care isn't available.

## Why was this research needed?

In many low- and middle-income countries, newborns with serious infections should go to the hospital for antibiotic treatment through an IV. However, many families cannot reach or afford hospitals. Researchers wanted to find out if giving antibiotics in the community could be a safe alternative.

## What did researchers look for?

The researchers searched for studies that tested:
1. Giving antibiotics in the community compared to sending newborns to the hospital
2. Different types of antibiotic treatments given in the community, including some taken by mouth instead of only by injection

They looked at how many newborns died during their first month of life.

## What did they find?

**Community treatment vs. hospital referral:**
- Five studies included 125,134 newborns
- Newborns who received antibiotics in their community had lower death rates than those only referred to hospitals
- The studies varied significantly in their settings and methods

**Simpler antibiotic treatments:**
- Five studies included 3,476 newborns
- Different simplified treatments (using pills by mouth combined with injections, or fewer days of injections) worked similarly to the standard 7-10 days of injections
- No treatment approach showed worse results than the standard treatment

## What does this mean?

When hospital care isn't possible, giving antibiotics to newborns in their communities may help reduce deaths from serious infections. Simpler treatments using some oral antibiotics appear to work as well as treatments using only injections. More research is needed to understand the best ways to provide this care in different communities.",0,Plano,"Plain-Language Summary

What is this study about?
- Researchers looked at whether giving antibiotics in the community (outside the hospital) helps newborns with possible serious bacterial infection in low- and middle-income countries.
- They also checked if simpler antibiotic plans (more oral medicine, fewer injections) work as well as the standard injectable plan.

Who was studied?
- Newborn babies in low- and middle-income countries who had signs of a serious infection.

What treatments were compared?
1) Community-based antibiotics vs hospital referral only.
2) Simplified community regimens vs standard community regimen.
   - Standard: 7–10 days of injectable penicillin/ampicillin plus gentamicin.
   - Simplified options studied included:
     - 7 days oral amoxicillin plus injectable gentamicin.
     - 2 days injectables (penicillin/ampicillin + gentamicin) then 5 days oral amoxicillin.
     - 2 days injectable gentamicin + oral amoxicillin, then 5 more days oral amoxicillin.
     - For fast breathing only: 7 days oral amoxicillin.

Main outcomes measured
- Death from any cause during the newborn period.
- Death from sepsis (when reported).

How was the research done?
- This was a review of randomized and similar trials found in major databases up to April 16, 2018.
- It included studies from community settings in resource-limited areas.

Key results
- Community antibiotics vs hospital referral:
  - Community treatment lowered newborn deaths compared with referral alone. Evidence quality: low. Results varied a lot between studies, partly because some studies also added other services along with antibiotics.
  - There may also be fewer deaths from sepsis. Evidence quality: low.

- Simplified community regimens vs standard injectables:
  - Simplified regimens had similar death rates to the standard injectable regimen. Evidence quality: mostly moderate.
  - Each simplified plan listed above showed no clear difference in death rates compared with the standard plan.

Safety
- The included studies did not report clear safety/adverse event results for the simplified regimens in this summary.

Timing
- Standard treatment length was 7–10 days. Simplified regimens were 7 days total (with different mixes of oral and injectable doses).

What does this mean?
- When hospital care is not possible, giving antibiotics in the community can reduce newborn deaths.
- Simpler antibiotic plans that use more oral medicine and fewer injections appear to work as well as the standard plan for survival.
- More real-world implementation studies are needed to see how best to deliver and scale these treatments safely."
15,"Background
Increasingly, cancer is recognised as a chronic condition with a growing population of informal caregivers providing care for cancer patients. Informal caregiving can negatively affect the health and well‐being of caregivers. We need a synthesised account of best evidence to aid decision‐making about effective ways to support caregivers for individuals 'living with cancer'. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions designed to improve the quality of life (QoL), physical health and well‐being of informal caregivers of people living with cancer compared with usual care. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, ProQuest, Open SIGLE, Web of Science from inception up to January 2018, trial registries and citation lists of included studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing psychosocial interventions delivered to adult informal caregivers of adults affected by cancer on a group or individual basis with usual care. Psychosocial interventions included non‐pharmacological interventions that involved an interpersonal relationship between caregivers and healthcare professionals. We included interventions delivered also to caregiver‐patient dyads. Interventions delivered to caregivers of individuals receiving palliative or inpatient care were excluded. Our primary outcome was caregiver QoL. Secondary outcomes included patient QoL, caregiver and patient depression, anxiety, psychological distress, physical health status and intervention satisfaction and adverse effects. 
Data collection and analysis
Pairs of review authors independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data and conducted 'Risk of bias' assessments. We synthesised findings using meta‐analysis, where possible, and reported remaining results in a narrative synthesis. 
Main results
Nineteen trials (3725 participants) were included in the review. All trials were reported in English and were undertaken in high‐income countries. Trials targeted caregivers of patients affected by a number of cancers spanning newly diagnosed patients, patients awaiting treatment, patients who were being treated currently and individuals post‐treatment. Most trials delivered interventions to caregiver‐patient dyads (predominantly spousal dyads) and there was variation in intervention delivery to groups or individual participants. There was much heterogeneity across interventions though the majority were defined as psycho‐educational. All trials were rated as being at 'high risk of bias'. 
Compared to usual care, psychosocial interventions may improve slightly caregiver QoL immediately post intervention (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 0.53; two studies, 265 participants) and may have little to no effect on caregiver QoL at 12 months (SMD 0.14, 95% CI ‐ 0.11 to 0.40; two studies, 239 participants) post‐intervention (both low‐quality evidence). 
Psychosocial interventions probably have little to no effect on caregiver depression immediately to one‐month post‐intervention (SMD 0.01, 95% CI ‐0.14 to 0.15; nine studies, 702 participants) (moderate‐quality evidence). Psychosocial interventions may have little to no effect on caregiver anxiety immediately post‐intervention (SMD ‐0.12, 95 % CI ‐0.33 to 0.10; five studies, 329 participants), depression three‐to‐six months (SMD 0.03, 95% CI ‐0.33 to 0.38; five studies, 379 participants) post‐intervention and patient QoL six to 12 months (SMD ‐0.05, 95% CI ‐0.37 to 0.26; three studies, 294 participants) post‐intervention (all low‐quality evidence). There was uncertainty whether psychosocial interventions improve patient QoL immediately (SMD ‐0.03, 95 %CI ‐0.50 to 0.44; two studies, 292 participants) or caregiver anxiety three‐to‐six months (SMD‐0.25, 95% CI ‐0.64 to 0.13; four studies, 272 participants) post‐intervention (both very low‐quality evidence). Two studies which could not be pooled in a meta‐analysis for caregiver physical health status found little to no effect immediately post‐intervention and a small intervention effect 12 months post‐intervention. Caregiver or patient satisfaction or cost‐effectiveness of interventions were not assessed in any studies. Interventions demonstrated good feasibility and acceptability. 
Psychosocial interventions probably have little to no effect on patient physical health status immediately post‐intervention (SMD 0.17, 95 % CI ‐0.07 to 0.41; four studies, 461 participants) and patient depression three to six months post‐intervention (SMD‐0.11, 95% CI ‐0.33 to 0.12; six studies, 534 participants) (both moderate‐quality evidence). 
Psychosocial interventions may have little to no effect on caregiver psychological distress immediately to one‐month (SMD ‐0.08, 95% CI ‐0.42 to 0.26; three studies, 134 participants), and seven to 12 months (SMD 0.08, 95% CI ‐0.42 to 0.58; two studies, 62 participants) post‐intervention; patient depression immediately (SMD ‐0.12, 95% CI ‐0.31 to 0.07; nine studies, 852 participants); anxiety immediately (SMD ‐0.13, 95% CI ‐0.41 to 0.15; four studies, 422 participants), and three to six months (SMD ‐0.22, 95% CI ‐0.45 to 0.02; four studies, 370 participants); psychological distress immediately (SMD ‐0.02, 95% CI ‐0.47 to 0.44; two studies, 74 participants) and seven to 12 months (SMD ‐0.27, 95% CI ‐0.78 to 0.24; two studies, 61 participants); and physical health status six to 12 months (SMD 0.06, 95% CI ‐0.18 to 0.30; two studies, 275 participants) post‐intervention (all low‐quality evidence). 
Three trials reported adverse effects associated with the interventions, compared with usual care, including higher distress, sexual function‐related distress and lower relationship satisfaction levels for caregivers, higher distress levels for patients, and that some content was perceived as insensitive to some participants. 
Trials not able to be pooled in a meta‐analysis did not tend to report effect size and it was difficult to discern intervention effectiveness. Variable intervention effects were reported for patient and caregiver outcomes. 
Authors' conclusions
Heterogeneity across studies makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for this population. There is an immediate need for rigorous trials with process evaluations and clearer, detailed intervention descriptions. Cost‐effectiveness studies should be conducted alongside future trials.","Psychosocial support for informal caregivers of people living with cancer
Background 
Increasingly, people who are not health professionals provide care for a partner, family member or friend affected by cancer, which can have negative effects on their health and well‐being. Psychosocial interventions that comprise psychological or social support and involve direct interaction between a healthcare professional and caregivers (or caregiver‐patient pairs) may help to address the negative health effects for caregivers. 
Review question 
What is the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions compared to usual care for informal caregivers of people living with cancer on a range of outcomes related to health and well‐being? 
Results 
We found19 trials that compared psychosocial interventions with usual care, in studies that included almost four thousand participants. Studies included caregivers of people affected by different cancers across all stages of the disease. There were differences in intervention make‐up. Intervention examples include providing information and/or teaching caregivers (or caregiver‐patient pairs) coping, communication or problem‐solving skills to manage symptoms or improve relationships. Interventions were delivered by nurses, psychologists or other professionals on an outpatient basis or at home via telephone. 
There may be a minimal benefit for caregiver quality‐of‐life immediately after the intervention, but this may not last. Psychosocial interventions may have little to no effect on quality of life for patients six to 12 months post‐intervention, but we are uncertain whether or not interventions improve quality of life for patients immediately post‐intervention. 
Psychosocial interventions may have little to no effect on caregiver depression, anxiety, distress and physical health and patient anxiety and distress at any time after the intervention, or on patient depression immediately and patient physical health six to 12 months post‐intervention. Psychosocial interventions probably have little to no effect on patient physical health immediately post‐intervention or patient depression three to six months post‐intervention. 
Three studies reported adverse effects including increased distress and sexual function‐related distress and lower relationship satisfaction levels for carers, increased distress levels for patients, and intervention content that was seen as inappropriate for some participants. No studies looked at cost‐effectiveness or intervention satisfaction for caregivers or patients. Because the quality of evidence was low generally, findings must be treated with caution. 
Conclusion 
Psychosocial interventions do not impact to a clinically meaningful degree outcomes for caregivers irrespective of patient cancer stage or type. Perhaps, other outcomes (e.g. relationship quality) or other psychosocial interventions (e.g. meditation) may be more helpful for caregivers. Interventions should be subjected to better conducted trials. Intervention development should involve caregivers and pay particular attention to individual personal needs.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Support Programs for Cancer Caregivers

## What was this study about?

Researchers reviewed studies that tested support programs for family members and friends who care for people living with cancer. These unpaid caregivers often experience stress and health problems while helping their loved ones. The researchers wanted to know if special support programs could help improve caregivers' quality of life and well-being.

## What did the researchers do?

They searched medical databases through January 2018 and found 19 studies involving 3,725 people. All studies took place in wealthy countries and were published in English. The studies tested different types of support programs, mostly educational and emotional support sessions. These programs were usually offered to both the caregiver and the cancer patient together. The programs were compared to regular care without extra support.

## Who was included?

The studies included adult caregivers helping adult cancer patients at different stages—newly diagnosed, receiving treatment, or finished with treatment. Most caregivers were spouses. The studies did not include caregivers of people in hospice or hospital care.

## What did they find?

**For caregivers:**
- Support programs may slightly improve quality of life right after the program ends, but this improvement may not last at 12 months
- Programs probably don't change depression levels much
- Programs may have little to no effect on anxiety or stress levels
- A few studies found little change in physical health

**For patients:**
- Programs may have little to no effect on patients' quality of life, depression, anxiety, or physical health

**Safety concerns:**
Some programs caused increased distress or relationship problems for a small number of participants.

## What does this mean?

The studies were too different from each other to draw clear conclusions about whether these support programs help cancer caregivers. Better-designed studies with clearer descriptions of the programs are needed. None of the studies looked at cost or whether participants were satisfied with the programs.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

Purpose
- To see if psychosocial programs help unpaid adult caregivers of adults living with cancer feel better and stay healthy, compared with usual care.

Who was studied
- Adult informal caregivers (often spouses). Some programs included both the caregiver and the patient together.
- Caregivers of people newly diagnosed, in treatment, or after treatment. Caregivers of people in inpatient or palliative care were not included.
- 19 trials with 3,725 participants, all from high‑income countries.

What was tested
- Psychosocial programs led by health professionals (for example, education, skills training, counseling, or support). These were delivered to individuals or groups.
- Compared with usual care.

Main outcomes measured
- Main: caregiver quality of life.
- Others: caregiver and patient depression, anxiety, psychological distress, physical health, and any harms. Satisfaction and costs were not measured.

How the research was done
- Only randomized or quasi‑randomized trials were included.
- Medical databases and trial registries were searched up to January 2018.
- Many studies differed from each other, and most had a high risk of bias.

Results
- Caregiver quality of life: may improve a little right after the program; likely little to no improvement by 12 months.
- Caregiver depression and anxiety: likely little to no change shortly after the program; similar at 3–6 months.
- Caregiver psychological distress and physical health: little to no change in the short term; one study found a small benefit for physical health at 12 months.
- Patient outcomes (quality of life, depression, anxiety, physical health): generally little to no change from these programs.
- Programs were generally feasible and acceptable to participants.

Timing of effects checked
- Right after or within 1 month of the program.
- 3–6 months after.
- 6–12 months after.

Safety
- Three trials reported possible harms, including higher distress, distress related to sexual function, lower relationship satisfaction for some caregivers, higher distress for some patients, and that some content felt insensitive.

Bottom line
- These programs may give a small, short‑term boost to caregiver quality of life, but overall they showed little to no effect on most outcomes.
- Better, well‑designed trials with clear program details and cost‑effectiveness data are needed."
16,"Background
Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) is used to keep the ductus arteriosus patent and can be life‐saving in neonates with ductal‐dependent cardiac lesions. PGE1 is used to promote mixing of pulmonary and systemic blood flow or improve pulmonary or systemic circulations, prior to balloon atrial septostomy or surgery. PGE1 therapy may cause several short‐term and long‐term adverse effects. The efficacy and safety of PGE1 in neonates with ductal‐dependent cardiac lesions has not been systematically reviewed. 
Objectives
To determine the efficacy and safety of both short‐term (< 120 hours) and long‐term (≥120 hours) PGE1 therapy in maintaining patency of the ductus arteriosus and decreasing mortality in ductal‐dependent cardiac lesions. 
Search methods
We searched the literature in October 2017, using the search strategy recommended by Cochrane Neonatal. We searched electronic databases (CENTRAL (in the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase); abstracts of the Pediatric Academic Societies; websites for registered trials at www.clinicaltrials.gov and www.controlled‐trials.com; and in the reference list of identified articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomized or quasi‐randomized trials using PGE1 at any dose or duration to maintain ductal patency in term or late preterm (≥ 34 weeks' gestation) infants with ductal‐dependent cardiac lesions and which reported effectiveness and safety in the short term or long term. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed the standard Cochrane methods for conducting a systematic review. Two review authors (SA and MP) independently assessed the titles and abstracts of studies identified by the search strategy to determine eligibility for inclusion. We obtained the full‐text version if eligibility could not be done reliably by title and abstract. We resolved any differences by discussion. We designed electronic forms for trial inclusion/exclusion, data extraction, and for requesting additional published information from authors of the original reports. 
Main results
Our search did not identify any completed or ongoing trials that met our inclusion criteria. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence from randomized controlled trials to determine the safety and efficacy of PGE1 in neonates with ductal‐dependent cardiac lesions. Evidence from observational trials have informed clinical practice on the use of PGE, which is now considered the standard of care for ductal‐dependent cardiac lesions. It is unlikely that randomized controlled studies will be performed for this indication but comparative efficacy of newer formulations of PGE1, different doses of PGE1 and studies comparing PGE with PDA stents or other measures to keep the ductus open may be ethical and necessary.","Prostaglandin E1 for keeping the duct open in heart conditions in the newborn
Review question: 
Is keeping the ductus arteriosus open with prostaglandin E1 effective and safe in babies with heart conditions that need an open ductus arteriosus for survival? 
Background 
Ductus arteriosus is a blood vessel connection between the large blood vessel supplying blood to the lungs (pulmonary artery) and to the large blood vessel supplying blood to the body (aorta). Normally the ductus is open before birth and closes within the first day after birth. However, certain heart conditions where there is a block to the blood flow to the lungs or the body, or a condition where the blood vessels supplying the lungs and body are switched (transposition of great arteries), an open ductus is necessary for survival. Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) is a substance produced by the ductus that keeps it open. External PGE1 is used to keep the ductus arteriosus open in neonates who have heart lesions that depend on an open ductus for survival. PGE1, though lifesaving, is not without risks. There are no systematic reviews to assess PGE1's effectiveness or safety. 
Study characteristics: 
We searched the literature for studies that used chance selection (randomization) that used PGE1 in neonates born at greater than 34 weeks of gestation to keep the ductus arteriosus open in newborn heart conditions and which reported on effectiveness and safety. 
Key results: 
We found no ongoing or completed randomized studies to include in this review. Currently there is no evidence from randomized trials on prostaglandin (PGE1) but information from non‐randomized studies is available. Use of PGE1 in heart lesions, where the ductus arteriosus needs to stay open, is considered standard of care, and it would be perceived as unethical to do randomized studies. 
Quality of evidence: 
The quality of evidence could not be assessed as we found no randomized studies for inclusion in this review.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Review of a Medication to Keep a Heart Vessel Open in Newborns

## What was this review about?

Some newborns are born with serious heart problems that require a small blood vessel called the ductus arteriosus to stay open. This vessel normally closes shortly after birth, but keeping it open can be life-saving for babies with certain heart conditions. Doctors use a medication called Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) to keep this vessel open until the baby can have a procedure or surgery to fix their heart problem.

## What did researchers want to find out?

The researchers wanted to find out:
- How well PGE1 works to keep this blood vessel open
- Whether PGE1 helps reduce deaths in newborns with these heart problems
- What side effects PGE1 might cause
- Whether short-term use (less than 5 days) or long-term use (5 days or more) makes a difference

## What did they do?

The research team searched medical databases in 2017 for studies that tested PGE1 in newborns (born at 34 weeks or later) with heart conditions requiring this vessel to stay open. They looked for studies that compared PGE1 to other treatments or no treatment.

## What did they find?

The researchers did not find any studies that met their requirements. This means there are no formal comparison studies to prove whether PGE1 works or is safe.

## What does this mean?

Even though there are no formal studies, doctors have learned from years of experience that PGE1 helps babies with these heart conditions. It is now considered standard treatment. Future studies might compare different doses of PGE1, newer versions of the medication, or other ways to keep the vessel open.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What is this review about
- Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) is a medicine used in newborns to keep a blood vessel called the ductus arteriosus open before a heart procedure or surgery.
- The review asked: Does PGE1 work well and is it safe in newborns who need this vessel to stay open?

Who was the focus
- Term or late preterm newborns (34 weeks gestation or more) with heart conditions that require the ductus arteriosus to stay open.

What was studied
- PGE1 given at any dose.
- Short-term use: less than 120 hours (5 days).
- Long-term use: 120 hours or more.
- Main outcomes: keeping the ductus arteriosus open and reducing death. Safety (short- and long-term side effects) was also assessed.

How the review was done
- Researchers searched multiple medical databases and trial registries in October 2017.
- They looked for randomized or quasi-randomized trials that tested PGE1 in the target newborns.

What did they find
- No completed or ongoing randomized trials met the criteria.
- Because of this, the review could not measure how effective or safe PGE1 is using randomized trial evidence.

What this means
- There is not enough randomized trial evidence to judge the benefits and risks of PGE1 for these newborns.
- In practice, doctors use PGE1 based on observational studies, and it is considered standard care for ductal-dependent heart conditions.

Safety
- PGE1 can have short-term and long-term side effects. This review did not find randomized trial data to quantify these.

Future research needs
- Studies comparing different PGE1 doses or formulations, and studies comparing PGE1 with other ways to keep the ductus open (such as stents), may be appropriate and helpful.

17,"Background
Tailored intervention strategies are frequently recommended among approaches to the implementation of improvement in health professional performance. Attempts to change the behaviour of health professionals may be impeded by a variety of different barriers, obstacles, or factors (which we collectively refer to as determinants of practice). Change may be more likely if implementation strategies are specifically chosen to address these determinants. 
Objectives
To determine whether tailored intervention strategies are effective in improving professional practice and healthcare outcomes. We compared interventions tailored to address the identified determinants of practice with either no intervention or interventions not tailored to the determinants. 
Search methods
We conducted searches of The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL, and the British Nursing Index to May 2014. We conducted a final search in December 2014 (in MEDLINE only) for more recently published trials. We conducted searches of the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) in March 2013. We also handsearched two journals. 
Selection criteria
Cluster‐randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions tailored to address prospectively identified determinants of practice, which reported objectively measured professional practice or healthcare outcomes, and where at least one group received an intervention designed to address prospectively identified determinants of practice. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed quality and extracted data. We undertook qualitative and quantitative analyses, the quantitative analysis including two elements: we carried out 1) meta‐regression analyses to compare interventions tailored to address identified determinants with either no interventions or an intervention(s) not tailored to the determinants, and 2) heterogeneity analyses to investigate sources of differences in the effectiveness of interventions. These included the effects of: risk of bias, use of a theory when developing the intervention, whether adjustment was made for local factors, and number of domains addressed with the determinants identified. 
Main results
We added nine studies to this review to bring the total number of included studies to 32 comparing an intervention tailored to address identified determinants of practice to no intervention or an intervention(s) not tailored to the determinants. The outcome was implementation of recommended practice, e.g. clinical practice guideline recommendations. Fifteen studies provided enough data to be included in the quantitative analysis. The pooled odds ratio was 1.56 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27 to 1.93, P value < 0.001). The 17 studies not included in the meta‐analysis had findings showing variable effectiveness consistent with the findings of the meta‐regression. 
Authors' conclusions
Despite the increase in the number of new studies identified, our overall finding is similar to that of the previous review. Tailored implementation can be effective, but the effect is variable and tends to be small to moderate. The number of studies remains small and more research is needed, including trials comparing tailored interventions to no or other interventions, but also studies to develop and investigate the components of tailoring (identification of the most important determinants, selecting interventions to address the determinants). Currently available studies have used different methods to identify determinants of practice and different approaches to selecting interventions to address the determinants. It is not yet clear how best to tailor interventions and therefore not clear what the effect of an optimally tailored intervention would be.","Tailored interventions to address identified determinants of practice
Tailored interventions to change professional practice are interventions planned following an investigation into the factors that explain current professional practice and any reasons for resisting new practice. These factors are referred to using various terms, including barriers, enablers, obstacles, and facilitators; in this review we use the term determinants of practice to include all such factors. The determinants may vary in different healthcare settings, groups of healthcare professionals, or clinical tasks. It is widely assumed that efforts to change professional practice have a lower likelihood of success unless these determinants are identified and taken into account. 
In a previous review, we included 26 studies and we concluded that tailoring can change professional practice. However, more studies of tailoring have been published and therefore we have incorporated the new studies into an update of the review. 
We have included 32 studies in the new review. The findings continue to indicate that tailored interventions can change professional practice, although they are not always effective and, when they are, the effect is small to moderate. There is insufficient evidence on the most effective approaches to tailoring, including how determinants should be identified, how decisions should be made on which determinants are most important to address, and how interventions should be selected to account for the important determinants. In addition, there is no evidence about the cost‐effectiveness of tailored interventions compared to other interventions to change professional practice. Therefore, future research studies should seek to develop and evaluate more systematic approaches to tailoring.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Customizing Strategies to Help Healthcare Workers Improve Patient Care

## What was this study about?

Researchers wanted to find out if customizing improvement strategies works better than using standard approaches when trying to help healthcare workers change how they provide care. They looked at whether identifying specific barriers first, then choosing strategies to address those barriers, leads to better results.

## What did the researchers do?

The research team searched medical databases through 2014 for studies that tested customized improvement strategies. They found 32 studies that compared:
- Customized strategies (designed to address specific barriers identified ahead of time)
- Either no strategy at all, or standard strategies not customized to address those barriers

All studies measured whether healthcare workers actually followed recommended practices, such as clinical guidelines.

## What did they find?

- 15 studies had enough data to combine and analyze together
- Customized strategies showed positive results overall, with healthcare workers being about 1.5 times more likely to follow recommended practices
- However, the improvement was small to moderate, and results varied considerably across different studies
- The other 17 studies showed mixed results that were consistent with these findings

## What does this mean?

Customizing improvement strategies based on identified barriers can help healthcare workers improve their practices, but the benefit is usually modest and inconsistent. More research is needed to understand the best ways to identify barriers and match them with the right strategies. Different studies used different methods, making it hard to determine the most effective approach.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the study

What was the goal?
- To see if “tailored” strategies help health professionals follow recommended practices and improve care. “Tailored” means the strategy is chosen to address specific barriers found in each setting.

Who was studied?
- Health professionals and their clinics or hospitals. The studies looked at how their practice changed, not at individual patients directly.

What did researchers do?
- They reviewed cluster randomized trials that compared:
  - Tailored strategies (picked to address known barriers) versus
  - No strategy or strategies not tailored to barriers.
- They searched medical databases up to December 2014.

What were the strategies?
- Methods varied by study. Examples include feedback on performance, education, reminders, or workflow changes chosen to fit local problems.

Main outcomes measured
- Whether professionals followed recommended practices (such as guideline steps).
- Some studies also looked at healthcare outcomes.

Key results
- 32 studies were included; 15 had enough data for combined analysis.
- Overall, tailored strategies led to better practice than no or non-tailored strategies.
- Size of effect: small to moderate (pooled odds ratio 1.56; 95% CI 1.27–1.93).
- Results varied across studies.

Timing
- Studies were identified through searches up to May 2014, with a final MEDLINE search in December 2014.

Safety
- These were implementation strategies, not drugs or procedures. Safety or harms were not the main focus and were rarely reported.

What does this mean?
- Tailoring strategies to local barriers can help improve professional practice, but the amount of improvement differs and is usually modest.
- More research is needed to learn the best way to identify barriers and choose the most effective tailored actions."
18,"Background
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends undertaking 150 minutes of moderate‐intensity physical activity per week, but most people do not. Workplaces present opportunities to influence behaviour and encourage physical activity, as well as other aspects of a healthy lifestyle. A pedometer is an inexpensive device that encourages physical activity by providing feedback on daily steps, although pedometers are now being largely replaced by more sophisticated devices such as accelerometers and Smartphone apps. For this reason, this is the final update of this review. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of pedometer interventions in the workplace for increasing physical activity and improving long‐term health outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) UPDATE, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from the earliest record to December 2016. We also consulted the reference lists of included studies and contacted study authors to identify additional records. We updated this search in May 2019, but these results have not yet been incorporated. One more study, previously identified as an ongoing study, was placed in 'Studies awaiting classification'. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of workplace interventions with a pedometer component for employed adults, compared to no or minimal interventions, or to alternative physical activity interventions. We excluded athletes and interventions using accelerometers. The primary outcome was physical activity. Studies were excluded if physical activity was not measured. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. When studies presented more than one physical activity measure, we used a pre‐specified list of preferred measures to select one measure and up to three time points for analysis. When possible, follow‐up measures were taken after completion of the intervention to identify lasting effects once the intervention had ceased. Given the diversity of measures found, we used ratios of means (RoMs) as standardised effect measures for physical activity. 
Main results
We included 14 studies, recruiting a total of 4762 participants. These studies were conducted in various high‐income countries and in diverse workplaces (from offices to physical workplaces). Participants included both healthy populations and those at risk of chronic disease (e.g. through inactivity or overweight), with a mean age of 41 years. All studies used multi‐component health promotion interventions. Eleven studies used minimal intervention controls, and four used alternative physical activity interventions. Intervention duration ranged from one week to two years, and follow‐up after completion of the intervention ranged from three to ten months. 
Most studies and outcomes were rated at overall unclear or high risk of bias, and only one study was rated at low risk of bias. The most frequent concerns were absence of blinding and high rates of attrition. 
When pedometer interventions are compared to minimal interventions at follow‐up points at least one month after completion of the intervention, pedometers may have no effect on physical activity (6 studies; very low‐certainty evidence; no meta‐analysis due to very high heterogeneity), but the effect is very uncertain. Pedometers may have effects on sedentary behaviour and on quality of life (mental health component), but these effects were very uncertain (1 study; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Pedometer interventions may slightly reduce anthropometry (body mass index (BMI) ‐0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.45 to 0.18; 3 studies; low‐certainty evidence). Pedometer interventions probably had little to no effect on blood pressure (systolic: ‐0.08 mmHg, 95% CI ‐3.26 to 3.11; 2 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence) and may have reduced adverse effects (such as injuries; from 24 to 10 per 100 people in populations experiencing relatively frequent events; odds ratio (OR) 0.50, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.84; low‐certainty evidence). No studies compared biochemical measures or disease risk scores at follow‐up after completion of the intervention versus a minimal intervention. 
Comparison of pedometer interventions to alternative physical activity interventions at follow‐up points at least one month after completion of the intervention revealed that pedometers may have an effect on physical activity, but the effect is very uncertain (1 study; very low‐certainty evidence). Sedentary behaviour, anthropometry (BMI or waist circumference), blood pressure (systolic or diastolic), biochemistry (low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol, or triglycerides), disease risk scores, quality of life (mental or physical health components), and adverse effects at follow‐up after completion of the intervention were not compared to an alternative physical activity intervention. 
Some positive effects were observed immediately at completion of the intervention periods, but these effects were not consistent, and overall certainty of evidence was insufficient to assess the effectiveness of workplace pedometer interventions. 
Authors' conclusions
Exercise interventions can have positive effects on employee physical activity and health, although current evidence is insufficient to suggest that a pedometer‐based intervention would be more effective than other options. It is important to note that over the past decade, technological advancement in accelerometers as commercial products, often freely available in Smartphones, has in many ways rendered the use of pedometers outdated. Future studies aiming to test the impact of either pedometers or accelerometers would likely find any control arm highly contaminated. Decision‐makers considering allocating resources to large‐scale programmes of this kind should be cautious about the expected benefits of incorporating a pedometer and should note that these effects may not be sustained over the longer term. 
Future studies should be designed to identify the effective components of multi‐component interventions, although pedometers may not be given the highest priority (especially considering the increased availability of accelerometers). Approaches to increase the sustainability of intervention effects and behaviours over a longer term should be considered, as should more consistent measures of physical activity and health outcomes.","Do health promotion programmes in the workplace increase people's physical activity if they include a pedometer? 
Key messages 
Overall, there is not enough evidence to show whether workplace health promotion programmes involving a pedometer affect people's physical activity, especially in the long term. 
What is a pedometer? 
A pedometer is a small, portable electronic device that counts the number of steps a person takes, but unlike an accelerometer, there is no record of intensity. Pedometers aim to encourage people to increase their physical activity by giving them feedback on their daily steps. 
Why we did this review 
Most people do not do enough physical activity. According to the World Health Organization, doing at least 30 minutes of moderately intense physical activity on most days can reduce a person's risk of developing cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and some cancers. We wanted to find out if workplace health promotion programmes that involve wearing pedometers would motivate people to increase their physical activity. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies of workplace programmes that used pedometers to promote health in employees. We looked for randomised controlled studies, where the treatment each person receives is decided randomly. 
Search date: We included evidence published up to December 2016. 
What we found 
We found 14 studies including 4762 people in different workplaces, ranging from offices to construction sites, mostly in high‐income countries. In all studies, pedometers were part of a health programme that included other components, such as walking groups, counselling, or dietary advice. Studies compared the effects of participating in pedometer programmes with: 
‐ receiving no or a minimal health programme such as regular advice about the benefits of physical activity; and 
‐ participating in other health programmes, that did not include a pedometer.
The programmes lasted from two weeks to two years; assessments continued for three to ten months afterwards. 
We were most interested to see whether there pedometers had a lasting effect on physical activity and health. We were also interested in learning about effects on sedentary behaviour (time spent sitting), risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes (blood pressure, body mass index (BMI) and levels of cholesterol in the blood), quality of life (well‐being) and adverse (unwanted) effects. 
What are the results of our review? 
Compared with no or a minimal health programme: 
Pedometer programmes may not affect physical activity at least one month after the programme end (6 studies), but they may reduce sedentary behaviour and may improve people's well‐being (1 study). We have very little certainty about these results. 
Pedometer programmes may slightly reduce body mass index (3 studies, low certainty), but probably make little to no difference in blood pressure (2 studies, moderate certainty) and may reduce unwanted effects such as injuries (2 studies, low certainty). 
No studies measured cholesterol or disease risk scores at least one month after the programme ended. 
Compared with another health programme:
Pedometer programmes may affect physical activity after at least one month since the programme end (1 study), but we have very little certainty about this result. 
We could not draw conclusions about unwanted effects. The evidence was not good enough for us to be certain about effects on sedentary behaviour, BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol, cardiovascular disease risk and well‐being. Some effects were seen but findings were not consistent. 
Conclusions 
Exercise programmes can have positive effects on an employee's physical activity and health, but we did not find enough reliable evidence to be certain whether a pedometer programme is better than other types of health programmes, especially for achieving long‐term changes in behaviour. 
Evidence is uncertain because results were reported by a small number of studies — sometimes only one study. In most studies, the people involved knew which study group they were in, which can affect results. Many people dropped out of studies before the studies ended, so not enough results were collected. Some studies did not report any results for some measures we were interested in or did not assess/evaluate if benefits were maintained after the program ended. 
As pedometers are largely being replaced by more sophisticated devices such as accelerometers and Smartphone apps, we will not update this review again.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Workplace Programs Using Step Counters to Increase Physical Activity

## What was studied?
Researchers reviewed studies that tested whether giving step counters (pedometers) to workers could help them become more physically active and healthier. Most people don't get the recommended 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week, and workplaces offer a good opportunity to encourage healthy habits.

## Who was studied?
The review included 14 studies with 4,762 working adults (average age 41) from various countries. Participants worked in different settings, from offices to more physically demanding jobs. Some were healthy, while others were at risk for health problems due to inactivity or being overweight.

## What did the programs involve?
All programs included multiple health promotion activities along with step counters. Workers received feedback on how many steps they took each day. Programs lasted from one week to two years. Researchers checked results anywhere from 3 to 10 months after programs ended to see if changes lasted.

## What did researchers compare?
Most studies compared step counter programs to minimal or no intervention. A few compared them to other physical activity programs.

## What were the results?
The evidence was limited and uncertain. When measured at least one month after programs ended:
- **Physical activity**: Step counters may not increase activity levels, but results were very uncertain
- **Weight**: Programs may slightly reduce body weight measurements
- **Blood pressure**: Probably little to no effect
- **Injuries**: May reduce exercise-related injuries
- **Quality of life and sitting time**: Effects were very uncertain

Some positive effects appeared right after programs ended, but these didn't consistently last over time.

## What does this mean?
The researchers couldn't determine if workplace step counter programs are truly effective. Technology has advanced significantly—many people now have step tracking built into their smartphones, making standalone step counters outdated. Workplaces considering these programs should be cautious about expected benefits, especially long-term results.

**Note**: This is the final update of this review because step counters are being replaced by newer technology.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What was studied
- Do workplace programs that include a pedometer help adults be more active and improve health over time?

Who was included
- 14 randomized studies with 4,762 employed adults
- Mix of office and physical jobs in high‑income countries
- Adults were mostly healthy or at higher risk due to low activity or higher weight
- Average age: 41 years

What the programs were
- Workplace health programs that included a pedometer to track steps
- All were multi‑component (for example: goals, education, or coaching)
- Compared to: minimal/no program, or a different type of physical activity program

How long and follow‑up
- Program length: 1 week to 2 years
- Follow‑up after programs ended: 3 to 10 months

What outcomes were measured
- Physical activity (main outcome)
- Sitting time (sedentary behavior)
- Body measures (like BMI)
- Blood pressure
- Blood tests (like cholesterol) in some studies
- Quality of life
- Adverse events (like injuries)

Main findings at follow‑up (at least 1 month after programs ended)
- Physical activity: May not increase compared to minimal programs; results very uncertain
- Sitting time and mental quality of life: Effects very uncertain (limited data)
- Body measures: Small possible drop in BMI (about 0.6 points); low certainty
- Blood pressure: Little to no change; moderate certainty
- Adverse events: May be fewer (e.g., injuries); low certainty
- Not enough data on blood tests or disease risk scores after programs ended

Safety
- Adverse events were tracked in some studies. There may be fewer events with pedometer programs, but the evidence is not strong.

How certain is the evidence
- Most studies had issues (for example, many people dropped out; blinding was not possible)
- Only one study had low risk of bias
- Overall certainty ranged from very low to moderate

Key takeaways
- Workplace exercise programs can help, but adding a pedometer is not clearly better than other activity programs.
- Any benefits may not last after the program ends.
- Newer tools (like smartphone step counters and accelerometers) are common, which may affect future studies.

What this means for workplaces
- Be cautious about expecting large, long‑term benefits from pedometer‑based programs alone.
- Focus on well‑designed, multi‑component programs and ways to maintain changes over time."
19,"Background
Adequate haemodialysis (HD) in people with end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD) is reliant upon establishment of vascular access, which may consist of arteriovenous fistula, arteriovenous graft, or central venous catheters (CVC). Although discouraged due to high rates of infectious and thrombotic complications as well as technical issues that limit their life span, CVC have the significant advantage of being immediately usable and are the only means of vascular access in a significant number of patients. Previous studies have established the role of thrombolytic agents (TLA) in the prevention of catheter malfunction. Systematic review of different thrombolytic agents has also identified their utility in restoration of catheter patency following catheter malfunction. To date the use and efficacy of fibrin sheath stripping and catheter exchange have not been evaluated against thrombolytic agents. 
Objectives
This review aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of TLA, preparations, doses and administration as well as fibrin‐sheath stripping, over‐the‐wire catheter exchange or any other intervention proposed for management of tunnelled CVC malfunction in patients with ESKD on HD. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to 17 August 2017 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Specialised Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov. 
Selection criteria
We included all studies conducted in people with ESKD who rely on tunnelled CVC for either initiation or maintenance of HD access and who require restoration of catheter patency following late‐onset catheter malfunction and evaluated the role of TLA, fibrin sheath stripping or over‐the‐wire catheter exchange to restore catheter function. The primary outcome was be restoration of line patency defined as ≥ 300 mL/min or adequate to complete a HD session or as defined by the study authors. Secondary outcomes included dialysis adequacy and adverse outcomes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed retrieved studies to determine which studies satisfy the inclusion criteria and carried out data extraction. Included studies were assessed for risk of bias. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random‐effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using GRADE. 
Main results
Our search strategy identified 8 studies (580 participants) as eligible for inclusion in this review. Interventions included: thrombolytic therapy versus placebo (1 study); low versus high dose thrombolytic therapy (1); alteplase versus urokinase (1); short versus long thrombolytic dwell (1); thrombolytic therapy versus percutaneous fibrin sheath stripping (1); fibrin sheath stripping versus over‐the‐wire catheter exchange (1); and over‐the‐wire catheter exchange versus exchange with and without angioplasty sheath disruption (1). No two studies compared the same interventions. Most studies had a high risk of bias due to poor study design, broad inclusion criteria, low patient numbers and industry involvement. 
Based on low certainty evidence, thrombolytic therapy may restore catheter function when compared to placebo (149 participants: RR 4.05, 95% CI 1.42 to 11.56) but there is no data available to suggest an optimal dose or administration method. The certainty of this evidence is reduced due to the fact that it is based on only a single study with wide confidence limits, high risk of bias and imprecision in the estimates of adverse events (149 participants: RR 2.03, 95% CI 0.38 to 10.73). 
Based on the available evidence, physical disruption of a fibrin sheath using interventional radiology techniques appears to be equally efficacious as the use of a pharmaceutical thrombolytic agent for the immediate management of dysfunctional catheters (57 participants: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.07). 
Catheter patency is poor following use of thrombolytic agents with studies reporting median catheter survival rates of 14 to 42 days and was reported to improve significantly by fibrin sheath stripping or catheter exchange (37 participants: MD ‐27.70 days, 95% CI ‐51.00 to ‐4.40). Catheter exchange was reported to be superior to sheath disruption with respect to catheter survival (30 participants: MD 213.00 days, 95% CI 205.70 to 220.30). 
There is insufficient evidence to suggest any specific intervention is superior in terms of ensuring either dialysis adequacy or reduced risk of adverse events. 
Authors' conclusions
Thrombolysis, fibrin sheath disruption and over‐the‐wire catheter exchange are effective and appropriate therapies for immediately restoring catheter patency in dysfunctional cuffed and tunnelled HD catheters. On current data there is no evidence to support physical intervention over the use of pharmaceutical agents in the acute setting. Pharmacological interventions appear to have a bridging role and long‐term catheter survival may be improved by fibrin sheath disruption and is probably superior following catheter exchange. There is no evidence favouring any of these approaches with respect to dialysis adequacy or risk of adverse events. 
The current review is limited by the small number of available studies with limited numbers of patients enrolled. Most of the studies included in this review were judged to have a high risk of bias and were potentially influenced by pharmaceutical industry involvement. 
Further research is required to adequately address the question of the most efficacious and clinically appropriate technique for HD catheter dysfunction.","Interventions for treating central venous catheter malfunction
What is the issue? 
Patients who rely on haemodialysis due to kidney failure require vascular access and although not optimal, a tunnelled haemodialysis catheter is frequently used. Unfortunately, along with infection issues these lines are prone to dysfunction due to clotting and fibrin sheath formation. Medications such as alteplase have a recognised role in preventing line dysfunction but the best approach to treating established line dysfunction has not been found. 
What did we do? 
We searched Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register up to 17 August 2017 and performed a systematic review of studies performed in patients with dysfunctional haemodialysis catheters and compared the success of thrombolytic agents, fibrin sheath stripping and line replacement. 
What did we find? 
We found eight studies involving 580 participants that tested the three different treatments. Studies also compared drug dosages and methods of administration. The quality of evidence is limited by small study size and high risk of bias. Thrombolytic therapy was probably better than placebo at restoring catheter function but there was no optimal dose or administration method. Physical disruption of a fibrin sheath may be equally effective as pharmaceutical thrombolytic agent for immediate management of catheter dysfunction. Catheter patency at two weeks is probably better following fibrin sheath stripping or catheter exchange compared to thrombolytic agent. Catheter exchange may be better than sheath disruption for long‐term catheter survival and the use of both techniques together is probably best. There is currently insufficient evidence favouring any technique in terms of either dialysis adequacy or reduced risk of adverse events. 
Conclusions 
Further research is required to adequately address the question of the most effective technique for haemodialysis catheter dysfunction.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Treating Blocked Dialysis Catheters

## What was this review about?

People with severe kidney disease need dialysis to clean their blood. Many use a tube called a catheter placed in a large vein to connect to the dialysis machine. Sometimes these catheters get blocked and stop working properly. Researchers wanted to find the best way to unblock these catheters.

## What methods were studied?

The review looked at three main approaches:
- **Clot-dissolving drugs** (called thrombolytics) that are put into the catheter
- **Physical removal** of blockages using special medical tools inserted through blood vessels
- **Replacing the catheter** by sliding a new one over a wire where the old one was

## What did the researchers find?

The review included 8 studies with 580 people total. Each study tested different treatments, making it hard to compare results.

**Key findings:**
- Clot-dissolving drugs worked better than inactive treatment (placebo) at unblocking catheters right away
- Physical removal of blockages worked about as well as clot-dissolving drugs for immediate unblocking
- Catheters stayed working longer when blockages were physically removed or catheters were replaced (weeks to months) compared to just using drugs (2-6 weeks)
- Replacing the catheter appeared to keep it working longest

## What are the limitations?

- Only a small number of studies with few participants
- Studies had design problems that made results less reliable
- Some studies were funded by drug companies, which may have influenced results
- Not enough information to determine which method is safest

## What does this mean?

All three methods can unblock dialysis catheters. Clot-dissolving drugs work as a quick fix, but physically removing blockages or replacing the catheter may help the catheter work longer. More research is needed to determine the best approach.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the research review

What was studied
- People with severe kidney disease who get hemodialysis through a tunneled central line (catheter) that later becomes hard to use.
- Ways to fix a clogged or poorly flowing catheter.

Who was included
- 8 studies with 580 people.
- All had tunneled dialysis catheters that were not working well.
- Studies were found up to August 17, 2017.

Treatments compared
- Clot-busting medicines placed into the catheter (thrombolytics such as alteplase or urokinase), with different doses and dwell times, or vs placebo.
- Physical procedures done by specialists:
  - Fibrin sheath stripping (breaking up the sheath around the catheter).
  - Over-the-wire catheter exchange (replacing the catheter through the same track).
  - Sheath disruption with angioplasty tools.

Main outcomes measured
- Primary: Getting the catheter working again (good flow ≥300 mL/min or enough to finish a dialysis session).
- Secondary: How well dialysis worked (adequacy), how long the catheter stayed usable (catheter survival), and side effects.

Key results
- Getting the line working now:
  - Clot-busting drugs may restore catheter function better than placebo (low certainty).
  - Drugs and physical procedures worked about the same for immediate fix (low certainty).
- How long the line lasts after the fix:
  - After drugs alone, median catheter survival was short (about 14 to 42 days).
  - Survival was longer after fibrin sheath stripping or catheter exchange.
  - Catheter exchange lasted longer than sheath disruption in one small study.
- Dialysis adequacy and safety:
  - No clear differences between approaches.
  - Side effect estimates were imprecise due to small study sizes.

Timing
- Evidence comes from studies published before or identified by August 17, 2017.

Safety
- Side effects were not well defined; the certainty of safety findings was low.

Certainty of the evidence
- Overall confidence is low.
- Studies were small, used different methods, and some had industry involvement.

What this means
- All three options—clot-busting drugs, sheath disruption, and catheter exchange—can quickly get a clogged dialysis catheter working.
- Medicines may serve as a short-term bridge.
- Replacing the catheter may keep it working longer than other methods.
- More, better-quality research is needed to know which approach is best overall."
20,"Background
Thromboangiitis obliterans, also known as Buerger's disease, is a non‐atherosclerotic, segmental inflammatory pathology that most commonly affects the small‐ and medium‐sized arteries, veins, and nerves in the upper and lower extremities. The etiology is unknown, but involves hereditary susceptibility, tobacco exposure, immune and coagulation responses. In many cases, there is no possibility of revascularization to improve the condition. Stem cell therapy is an option for patients with severe complications, such as ischemic ulcers or rest pain. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of stem cell therapy in individuals with thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease). 
Search methods
The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and AMED databases and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 17 October 2017. The review authors searched the European grey literature OpenGrey Database, screened reference lists of relevant studies and contacted study authors. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs of stem cell therapy in thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease). 
Data collection and analysis
The review authors (DC, DM, FN) independently assessed the studies, extracted data and performed data analysis. 
Main results
We only included one RCT (18 participants with thromboangiitis obliterans) comparing the implantation of stem cell derived from bone marrow with placebo and standard wound dressing care in this review. We identified no studies that compared stem cell therapy (bone marrow source) versus stem cell therapy (umbilical cord source), stem cell therapy (any source) versus pharmacological treatment and stem cell therapy (any source) versus sympathectomy. Ulcer healing was assessed in the form of ulcer size. The mean ulcer area decreased more in the stem cell implantation group: from 5.04 cm2 (standard deviation (SD) 0.70) to 1.48 cm2 (SD 0.56) compared with the control group: mean ulcer size area decreased from 4.68 cm2 (SD 0.62) to 3.59 cm2 (SD 0.14); mean difference (MD) ‐2.11 cm2, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐2.49 to ‐1.73; 1 study, 18 participants; very low‐quality evidence. Pain‐free walking distance showed more of an improvement in the stem cell implantation group: from mean of 38.33 meters (SD 17.68) to 284.44 meters (SD 212.12) compared with the control group: mean walking distance increased from 35.66 meters (SD 19.79) to 78.22 meters (SD 35.35); MD 206.22 meters, 95% CI 65.73 to 346.71; 1 study; 18 participants; very low‐quality evidence. 
Outcomes such as rate of amputation, pain, amputation‐free survival and adverse effects were not assessed. 
The quality of evidence was classified as very low, with only one study, small numbers of participants, high risk of bias in many domains and missing information regarding tobacco exposure status. 
Authors' conclusions
Very low‐quality evidence suggests there may be an effect of the use of bone marrow‐derived stem cells in the healing of ulcers and improvement in the pain‐free walking distance in patients with Buerger's disease. High‐quality trials assessing the effectiveness of stem cell therapy for treatment of patients with thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease) are needed.","Stem cell therapy for treatment of thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease)
Background 
Thromboangiitis obliterans, also known as Buerger's disease, is a condition characterized by recurring progressive inflammation and clotting in small‐ and medium‐sized arteries and veins of the hands and feet. Its cause is unknown, but it is most common in men with a history of tobacco use. It is responsible for ulcers and extreme pain in the limbs of young smokers. In many cases, mainly in patients with the most severe form, there is no possibility of improving the condition with surgery, and therefore, alternative treatments are used. Stem cell therapy is an experimental treatment performed through the implantation of cells (from bone marrow, umbilical cord, peripheral blood etc.) which are capable of becoming new blood vessels, improving local circulation and contributing to the healing of ulcers and relieving rest pain. This review assessed the effectiveness of stem cell therapy in the treatment of patients with thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease). 
Key results 
Only one randomized controlled study (18 participants with thromboangiitis obliterans) comparing the implantation of stem cells derived from bone marrow with placebo and standard wound dressing care was included in this review (most recent search was 17 October 2017). We identified no studies that compared stem cell therapy from different sources, stem cell therapy versus drug treatment and stem cell therapy versus sympathectomy (surgical cutting of a sympathetic nerve). The results showed a decrease in ulcer size and improvement in pain‐free walking distance in the group receiving the stem cell implantation compared with the group receiving placebo and standard wound dressing care. 
Outcomes such as rate of amputation, pain, amputation‐free survival and adverse effects were not assessed. 
Quality of the evidence 
We classified the quality of evidence as very low, because there was only one study, small numbers of participants, and high risk of bias in many domains and missing information regarding tobacco exposure status. 
Conclusions 
Very low‐quality evidence suggests there may be an effect of the use of bone marrow‐derived stem cells in the healing of ulcers and improving the pain‐free walking distance in patients with Buerger's disease. High‐quality trials assessing the effectiveness of stem cell therapy for treatment of patients with thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease) are needed.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Stem Cell Therapy for Buerger's Disease

## What is Buerger's disease?
Buerger's disease is a condition that causes inflammation and blockages in small and medium blood vessels, usually in the arms and legs. It's strongly linked to tobacco use. People with this disease may develop painful sores (ulcers) or pain even when resting. Sometimes, blood vessel surgery isn't possible to help these patients.

## What did researchers want to find out?
Researchers wanted to know if stem cell therapy (using special cells that can help repair tissue) is safe and works well for people with Buerger's disease.

## What did they find?
Researchers found only one small study with 18 people that tested this treatment. In this study, some participants received stem cells taken from bone marrow injected into their affected limbs, while others received standard wound care without stem cells.

**Results showed:**
- **Ulcer healing:** Sores got smaller in people who received stem cells (shrinking from about 5 cm² to 1.5 cm²) compared to those who didn't receive stem cells (shrinking from about 4.7 cm² to 3.6 cm²).
- **Walking ability:** People who received stem cells could walk much farther without pain (improving from about 38 meters to 284 meters) compared to those who didn't (improving from about 36 meters to 78 meters).

The study didn't measure other important outcomes like amputation rates, pain levels, or side effects.

## What does this mean?
The evidence is very limited and uncertain because only one small study was available, and it had quality concerns. More high-quality research with larger groups of people is needed before doctors can know if stem cell therapy truly helps people with Buerger's disease.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

- Very low. Reasons: only one small study, risk of bias, and missing details (such as tobacco exposure status).

Dates
- Researchers searched medical databases and trial registries up to October 17, 2017.

What this means
- Stem cell therapy from bone marrow may help ulcers heal and may increase pain-free walking distance in Buerger’s disease, but the evidence is very uncertain.
- Larger, high-quality trials that also track safety and amputation outcomes are needed."
21,"Background
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurologic disorder that is associated with peripheral iron deficiency in a subgroup of patients. It is unclear whether iron therapy is effective treatment for RLS. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral or parenteral iron for the treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) when compared with placebo or other therapies. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycNFO, and CINAHL for the time period January 1995 to September 2017. We searched reference lists for additional published studies. We searched Clinicaltrials.gov and other clinical trial registries (September 2017) for ongoing or unpublished studies. 
Selection criteria
Controlled trials comparing any formulation of iron with placebo, other medications, or no treatment, in adults diagnosed with RLS according to expert clinical interview or explicit diagnostic criteria. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality, with discussion to reach consensus in the case of any disagreement. The primary outcome considered in this review was restlessness or unpleasant sensations, as experienced subjectively by the patient. We combined treatment/control differences in the outcomes across studies using random‐effects meta‐analyses. We analysed continuous data using mean differences (MDs) where possible and performed standardised mean difference (SMD) analyses when different measurements were used across studies. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data using the Mantel‐Haenszel method and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We analysed study heterogeneity using the I2 statistic. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We performed GRADE analysis using GRADEpro. 
Main results
We identified and included 10 studies (428 total participants, followed for 2‐16 weeks) in this review. Our primary outcome was restlessness or uncomfortable leg sensations, which was quantified using the International Restless Legs Scale (IRLS) (range, 0 to 40) in eight trials and a different RLS symptom scale in a ninth trial. Nine studies compared iron to placebo and one study compared iron to a dopamine agonist (pramipexole). The possibility for bias among the trials was variable. Three studies had a single element with high risk of bias, which was lack of blinding in two and incomplete outcome data in one. All studies had at least one feature resulting in unclear risk of bias. 
Combining data from the seven trials using the IRLS to compare iron and placebo, use of iron resulted in greater improvement in IRLS scores (MD ‐3.78, 95% CI ‐6.25 to ‐1.31; I2= 66%, 7 studies, 345 participants) measured 2 to 12 weeks after treatment. Including an eighth study, which measured restlessness using a different scale, use of iron remained beneficial compared to placebo (SMD ‐0.74, 95% CI ‐1.26 to ‐0.23; I2 = 80%, 8 studies, 370 participants). The GRADE assessment of certainty for this outcome was moderate. 
The single study comparing iron to a dopamine agonist (pramipexole) found a similar reduction in RLS severity in the two groups (MD ‐0.40, 95% CI ‐5.93 to 5.13, 30 participants). 
Assessment of secondary outcomes was limited by small numbers of trials assessing each outcome. Iron did not improve quality of life as a dichotomous measure (RR 2.01, 95% CI 0.54 to 7.45; I2=54%, 2 studies, 39 participants), but did improve quality of life measured on continuous scales (SMD 0.51, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.87; I2= 0%, 3 studies, 128 participants), compared to placebo. Subjective sleep quality was no different between iron and placebo groups (SMD 0.19, 95% CI ‐0.18 to 0.56; I2 = 9%, 3 studies, 128 participants), nor was objective sleep quality, as measured by change in sleep efficiency in a single study (‐35.5 +/‐ 92.0 versus ‐41.4 +/‐ 98.2, 18 participants). Periodic limb movements of sleep were not significantly reduced with iron compared to placebo ( SMD ‐0.19, 95% CI ‐0.70 to 0.32; I2 = 0%, 2 studies, 60 participants). Iron did not improve sleepiness compared to placebo, as measured on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (data not provided, 1 study, 60 participants) but did improve the daytime tiredness item of the RLS‐6 compared to placebo (least squares mean difference ‐1.5, 95% CI ‐2.5 to ‐0.6; 1 study, 110 participants). The GRADE rating for secondary outcomes ranged from low to very low. 
Prespecified subgroup analyses showed more improvement with iron in those trials studying participants on dialysis. The use of low serum ferritin levels as an inclusion criteria and the use or oral versus intravenous iron did not show significant subgroup differences. 
Iron did not result in significantly more adverse events than placebo (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.25; I2=45%, 6 studies, 298 participants). A single study reported that people treated with iron therapy experienced fewer adverse events than the active comparator pramipexole. 
Authors' conclusions
Iron therapy probably improves restlessness and RLS severity in comparison to placebo. Iron therapy may not increase the risk of side effects in comparison to placebo. We are uncertain whether iron therapy improves quality of life in comparison to placebo. Iron therapy may make little or no difference to pramipexole in restlessness and RLS severity, as well as in the risk of adverse events. The effect on secondary outcomes such as quality of life, daytime functioning, and sleep quality, the optimal timing and formulation of administration, and patient characteristics predicting response require additional study.","Iron for the treatment of restless legs syndrome
Background 
Restless legs syndrome is a common medical condition that causes uncomfortable urges to move the legs. These urges happen in the evening and at night and can keep people from sleeping well. Low blood levels of iron are often seen in people who have restless legs syndrome. Low blood iron levels may be part of the cause of restless legs syndrome. Iron can be taken as a pill or given as an injection into the bloodstream. We performed this review to see if iron treatment reduces the symptoms of restless legs syndrome. 
Study characteristics 
We included 10 studies of iron. These 10 studies included 428 people with restless legs syndrome. Not all participants had low blood levels of iron. All participants were adults. Most of the studies used injections of iron, while three studies used iron in pill form. Iron treatment was compared to a non‐active treatment (i.e. a placebo) in nine studies. In one study, iron was compared to another restless legs syndrome treatment called a dopamine agonist. The main measure of interest in our review was the severity of restlessness. This was usually measured using a 10‐question survey regarding severity and effects of urges to move the legs, called the International Restless Legs Syndrome Severity Rating Scale (IRLS). This was measured 2‐4 weeks after injections of iron and 12‐14 weeks after iron in pill form. 
Four trials were funded by the drug manufacturer. Two trials were funded by the USA National Institutes of Health. Two trials were funded by the workplaces of the study investigators. Two studies did not report who funded the study. The four studies funded by drug manufacturers were the largest. The studies funded by drug companies contributed over half of the total number of participants. 
Key results and quality of evidence 
Overall, the studies showed that iron is better than a placebo for reducing the severity of restless legs syndrome symptoms, although the benefit was low to moderate. This is mostly based on studies using injections of iron, rather than iron pills. Iron was helpful even if blood iron levels were normal at the start of the study. The quality of the evidence was moderate, because not all completed studies have been published, not all important outcomes have been measured, and not enough people have been studied. Side effects were not more common with iron than with placebo. Based on one study, side effects were less common with iron than with another commonly used restless legs syndrome treatment, although the certainty in this result is very low. More studies are needed to allow people with RLS and doctors to make decisions about who should take iron for restless legs syndrome treatment, using what type of iron, and for how long. The evidence is current to September 2017.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Iron Treatment for Restless Legs Syndrome

## What is this study about?

Researchers reviewed studies to see if taking iron supplements helps people with restless legs syndrome (RLS). RLS causes uncomfortable feelings in the legs and an urge to move them, especially at rest or during the night. Some people with RLS have low iron levels in their body, so researchers wanted to know if iron treatment could help.

## What did the researchers do?

They found 10 studies with 428 adults who had RLS. These studies lasted between 2 and 16 weeks. Most studies compared iron supplements to inactive pills (placebo). One study compared iron to another RLS medication called pramipexole. The researchers looked at whether iron helped reduce uncomfortable leg sensations and other symptoms.

## What did they find?

**Main findings:**
- People who took iron had less restlessness and fewer uncomfortable leg sensations compared to those who took placebo pills
- Iron appeared to work about as well as pramipexole medication
- Iron did not cause more side effects than placebo pills

**Other findings:**
- Iron may improve quality of life when measured on certain scales
- Iron did not clearly improve sleep quality
- Iron may help reduce daytime tiredness

## What does this mean?

Iron supplements likely help reduce RLS symptoms for some people. The treatment appears safe, with side effects similar to placebo. However, more research is needed to understand who benefits most from iron treatment, what type and dose works best, and how it affects daily life and sleep over longer periods.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What was the study about?
- To see if iron (pills or IV) helps reduce symptoms of restless legs syndrome (RLS) and if it is safe.

Who was studied?
- Adults with RLS diagnosed by experts or set criteria.
- 10 controlled studies with 428 people total.
- People were followed for 2 to 16 weeks.
- Most studies compared iron to a placebo. One study compared iron to pramipexole (a standard RLS medicine).

What treatments were tested?
- Iron given by mouth or by IV.
- Compared to placebo or to pramipexole.

Main outcomes measured
- RLS symptom severity (how restless or uncomfortable the legs felt).
- Quality of life.
- Sleep quality and daytime tiredness.
- Side effects.

Key results
- RLS symptoms: Iron improved RLS symptoms more than placebo over 2–12 weeks. Certainty of evidence: moderate.
- Compared to pramipexole: One small study found iron and pramipexole worked about the same for symptoms.
- Quality of life: Mixed results. Some measures improved; others did not. Certainty: low to very low.
- Sleep: No clear improvement in sleep quality or limb movements during sleep.
- Daytime tiredness: One study showed improvement with iron on a daytime tiredness rating.
- Subgroups: People on dialysis seemed to benefit more. No clear difference between iron pills vs IV, or by low ferritin entry criteria.

Safety
- Side effects were similar between iron and placebo.
- In the one study versus pramipexole, iron had fewer side effects.

What this means
- Iron probably reduces RLS symptoms compared to no treatment/placebo.
- It may be as effective as pramipexole for symptoms in the short term, but evidence is limited.
- Effects on quality of life and sleep are unclear.
- Short-term safety looks similar to placebo.

Timeframe and sources
- Studies published or registered from 1995 to September 2017 were searched in multiple medical databases and trial registries."
22,"Background
Stroke is one of the leading causes of long‐lasting disability and mortality and its global burden has increased in the past two decades. Several therapies have been proposed for the recovery from, and treatment of, ischemic stroke. One of them is citicoline. This review assessed the benefits and harms of citicoline for treating patients with acute ischemic stroke. 
Objectives
To assess the clinical benefits and harms of citicoline compared with placebo or any other control for treating people with acute ischemic stroke. 
Search methods
We searched in the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, LILACS until 29 January 2020. We searched the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. Additionally, we also reviewed reference lists of the retrieved publications and review articles, and searched the websites of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA). 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in any setting including participants with acute ischemic stroke. Trials were eligible for inclusion if they compared citicoline versus placebo or no intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
We selected RCTs, assessed the risk of bias in seven domains, and extracted data by duplicate. Our primary outcomes of interest were all‐cause mortality and the degree of disability or dependence in daily activities at 90 days. We estimated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes. We measured statistical heterogeneity using the I² statistic. We conducted our analyses using the fixed‐effect and random‐effects model meta‐analyses. We assessed the overall quality of evidence for six pre‐specified outcomes using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We identified 10 RCTs including 4281 participants. In all these trials, citicoline was given either orally, intravenously, or a combination of both compared with placebo or standard care therapy. Citicoline doses ranged between 500 mg and 2000 mg per day. We assessed all the included trials as having high risk of bias. Drug companies sponsored six trials. 
A pooled analysis of eight trials indicates there may be little or no difference in all‐cause mortality comparing citicoline with placebo (17.3% versus 18.5%; RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.07; I² = 0%; low‐quality evidence due to risk of bias). Four trials showed that citicoline may not increase the proportion of patients with a moderate or lower degree of disability or dependence compared with placebo, according to the Rankin Scale (21.72% versus 19.23%; RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.26; I² = 1%; low‐quality evidence due to risk of bias). 
Meta‐analysis of three trials indicates there may be little or no difference in serious cardiovascular adverse events comparing citicoline with placebo (8.83% versus 7.77%; RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.29; I² = 0%; low‐quality evidence due to risk of bias). Overall, either serious or non‐serious adverse events – central nervous system, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, etc. – were poorly reported and harms may have been underestimated. 
Four trials suggested that citicoline results in no difference in functional recovery, according to the Barthel Index, compared with placebo (32.78% versus 30.70%; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.13; I² = 24%; low‐quality evidence due to risk of bias). Citicoline may not increase the proportion of patients with a minor impairment (according to ≤ 1 scores in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) (5 trials, 24.31% versus 22.44%; RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.21; I² = 27%, low‐quality evidence due to risk of bias). None of the included trials reported data on quality of life. 
A pre‐planned Trial Sequential Analysis suggested that no more trials may be needed for the primary outcomes. 
Authors' conclusions
This review assessed the clinical benefits and harms of citicoline compared with placebo or any other standard treatment for people with acute ischemic stroke. The findings of the review suggest there may be little to no difference between citicoline and its controls regarding all‐cause mortality, disability or dependence in daily activities, functional recovery, neurological function and severe adverse events, based on low‐certainty evidence. None of the included trials assessed quality of life and the safety profile of citicoline remains unknown. The available evidence is of low quality due to either limitations in the design or execution of the trials.","Citicoline for treating people with acute ischemic stroke
Review questionWhat is the clinical benefit and harm of citicoline compared with placebo or other standard treatment for treating people with acute ischemic stroke? 
BackgroundAcute ischemic stroke is defined as a sudden episode of disturbance of brain function caused by a blockage in the blood vessels of the brain. It is the leading cause of long‐lasting disability and the second major cause of death. Citicoline is a substance that may prevent the death of brain cells located close to the area of brain damage. 
Search dateSearching was completed on 29 January 2020 
Study characteristicsWe included randomized controlled trials, both published and unpublished. We did not apply any limitation by language, country, or study design. We included people (adults or children) with acute ischemic stroke irrespective of the underlying cause. Stroke was based on the clinical diagnosis confirmed with brain scans. We included trials that compared citicoline with placebo, usual care, or other usual treatment. 
Key resultsWe identified 10 relevant trials that included 4281 participants; six trials were carried out in multiple centers and two were international. We considered most trials to be at high risk of bias and they included small numbers of participants. This raises the risk of over‐estimating benefits and under‐estimating harms. Trials tested citicoline given either by mouth or by injection. Citicoline did not seem to influence death or disability in daily activities, severe side‐effects, functional recovery, or neurological recovery. 
Quality of the evidenceRisks of bias, imprecision, and outcome reporting bias all make the quality of evidence low. None of the included trials reported data on quality of life. Researchers poorly reported harms caused by citicoline, so the profile of harms remains unclear.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Citicoline for Acute Ischemic Stroke

## What was studied?
Researchers reviewed studies testing whether citicoline (a medication) helps people who have had an acute ischemic stroke. An ischemic stroke happens when blood flow to part of the brain is blocked. The researchers wanted to know if citicoline was better than a placebo (inactive treatment) or standard care.

## Who was in the studies?
The review included 10 studies with 4,281 adults who had recently experienced an acute ischemic stroke.

## What treatment was tested?
Participants received either:
- Citicoline given by mouth, through an IV, or both (doses ranged from 500 mg to 2,000 mg per day)
- Placebo or standard care

## What did the researchers measure?
The main things measured were:
- Deaths from any cause at 90 days
- Level of disability or ability to perform daily activities at 90 days
- Functional recovery
- Neurological function
- Serious side effects, including heart problems
- Quality of life

## What were the results?
The review found that citicoline may make little to no difference compared to placebo in:
- **Deaths**: About 17% with citicoline vs. 18% with placebo
- **Disability levels**: About 22% with moderate or lower disability in citicoline group vs. 19% in placebo group
- **Daily functioning**: Similar results between groups
- **Neurological improvement**: Similar results between groups
- **Serious heart-related side effects**: About 9% with citicoline vs. 8% with placebo

None of the studies measured quality of life. Information about side effects was limited and may not show the complete safety picture.

## What does this mean?
Based on current evidence, citicoline does not appear to provide clear benefits for people recovering from acute ischemic stroke. The quality of the evidence was low, meaning the results may not be reliable. More high-quality research would be needed to draw firm conclusions about citicoline's effectiveness and safety.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the citicoline review for acute ischemic stroke

Purpose
- To find out if citicoline helps people recover after an acute ischemic stroke and if it is safe.

Who was studied
- Adults with an acute ischemic stroke.
- 10 randomized clinical trials with 4,281 people.

What was tested
- Citicoline given by mouth, by IV, or both.
- Daily doses ranged from 500 mg to 2,000 mg.
- Compared to placebo or standard care.

Main outcomes measured
- Death from any cause by about 90 days.
- Ability to do daily activities and level of disability.
- Functional recovery (everyday tasks).
- Neurological function (stroke symptoms).
- Serious heart and blood vessel problems.
- Side effects.
- Quality of life (not reported in any trial).

Key results
- Death: Little to no difference between citicoline and placebo.
- Disability and daily activities: Little to no difference.
- Functional recovery: No meaningful difference.
- Neurological function: Little to no difference.
- Serious cardiovascular events: Little to no difference.
- Side effects overall: Poorly reported, so safety is uncertain.
- Quality of life: Not reported.

Timing
- Main results were assessed around 90 days after stroke.

Evidence quality and limits
- The overall evidence was low quality.
- Many trials had design problems and possible bias.
- Six trials were funded by drug companies.
- Based on the data, more trials may not change the main results for death and disability.

Safety
- Serious harms appeared similar to placebo, but side effects were not well reported.
- The full safety profile of citicoline remains unclear.

What this means
- Based on current low-quality evidence, citicoline does not appear to improve survival, recovery, or independence after acute ischemic stroke compared with placebo or standard care. More complete safety reporting is needed."
23,"Background
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) often complicates the clinical course of cancer. The risk is further increased by chemotherapy, but the trade‐off between safety and efficacy of primary thromboprophylaxis in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy is uncertain. This is the third update of a review first published in February 2012. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of primary thromboprophylaxis for VTE in ambulatory cancer patients receiving chemotherapy compared with placebo or no thromboprophylaxis, or an active control intervention. 
Search methods
For this update, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 3 August 2020. We also searched the reference lists of identified studies and contacted content experts and trialists for relevant references. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing any oral or parenteral anticoagulant or mechanical intervention to no thromboprophylaxis or placebo, or comparing two different anticoagulants. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data on risk of bias, participant characteristics, interventions, and outcomes including symptomatic VTE and major bleeding as the primary effectiveness and safety outcomes, respectively. We applied GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
We identified six additional randomised controlled trials (3326 participants) for this update, bringing the included study total to 32 (15,678 participants), all evaluating pharmacological interventions and performed mainly in people with locally advanced or metastatic cancer. The certainty of the evidence ranged from high to very low across the different outcomes and comparisons. The main limiting factors were imprecision and risk of bias. 
Thromboprophylaxis with direct oral anticoagulants (direct factor Xa inhibitors apixaban and rivaroxaban) may decrease the incidence of symptomatic VTE (risk ratio (RR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 1.06; 3 studies, 1526 participants; low‐certainty evidence); and probably increases the risk of major bleeding compared with placebo (RR 1.74, 95% CI 0.82 to 3.68; 3 studies, 1494 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
When compared with no thromboprophylaxis, low‐molecular‐weight heparin (LMWH) reduced the incidence of symptomatic VTE (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.83; 11 studies, 3931 participants; high‐certainty evidence); and probably increased the risk of major bleeding events (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.35; 15 studies, 7282 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
In participants with multiple myeloma, LMWH resulted in lower symptomatic VTE compared with the vitamin K antagonist warfarin (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.83; 1 study, 439 participants; high‐certainty evidence), while LMWH probably lowers symptomatic VTE more than aspirin (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.17; 2 studies, 781 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Major bleeding was observed in none of the participants with multiple myeloma treated with LMWH or warfarin and in less than 1% of those treated with aspirin. 
Only one study evaluated unfractionated heparin against no thromboprophylaxis, but did not report on VTE or major bleeding. 
When compared with placebo or no thromboprophylaxis, warfarin may importantly reduce symptomatic VTE (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.20; 1 study, 311 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and may result in a large increase in major bleeding (RR 3.82, 95% CI 0.97 to 15.04; 4 studies, 994 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
One study evaluated antithrombin versus no antithrombin in children. This study did not report on symptomatic VTE but did report any VTE (symptomatic and incidental VTE). The effect of antithrombin on any VTE and major bleeding is uncertain (any VTE: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.73; major bleeding: RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.03 to 18.57; 1 study, 85 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
In ambulatory cancer patients, primary thromboprophylaxis with direct factor Xa inhibitors may reduce the incidence of symptomatic VTE (low‐certainty evidence) and probably increases the risk of major bleeding (moderate‐certainty evidence) when compared with placebo. LMWH decreases the incidence of symptomatic VTE (high‐certainty evidence), but increases the risk of major bleeding (moderate‐certainty evidence) when compared with placebo or no thromboprophylaxis. Evidence for the use of thromboprophylaxis with anticoagulants other than direct factor Xa inhibitors and LMWH is limited. More studies are warranted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of primary prophylaxis in specific types of chemotherapeutic agents and types of cancer, such as gastrointestinal or genitourinary cancer.","Prevention of blood clots in non‐hospitalised cancer patients receiving chemotherapy
Background 
Cancer patients are more likely than people without cancer to develop venous thromboembolism (blood clots in the veins). Chemotherapy may activate blood coagulation (clotting) and further increase this risk. Anticoagulants are medicines which are used to prevent and treat blood clots. They are sometimes known as blood thinners. This systematic review aimed to look at the effectiveness and safety of anticoagulants and mechanical interventions when used to prevent blood clots in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. 
Key results 
We included 32 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) involving 15,678 participants (current search to August 2020). All studies evaluated anticoagulants and were performed mainly in people with locally advanced (unlikely to be cured) or metastatic (where the cancer has spread from the part of the body where it started) cancer. Direct oral anticoagulants (anticoagulants that act by directly binding to and inhibiting specific coagulation factors – thrombin or activated factor X) may reduce the occurrence of blood clots and probably increase the risk of major bleeding in people with cancer. Low‐molecular‐weight heparins (anticoagulants that increase the activity of the natural anticoagulant antithrombin) were associated with a reduction in symptomatic blood clots, but increased the risk of major bleeding. In people with the blood‐related cancer, multiple myeloma, low‐molecular‐weight heparin reduced the number of symptomatic blood clots when compared with the vitamin K antagonist warfarin, while the difference with aspirin was not clear; there were no major bleeds with low‐molecular‐weight heparin or warfarin, and in participants treated with aspirin the rate was below 1%. One study evaluated unfractionated heparin and did not report on blood clots or major bleeding. Data for warfarin in comparison with placebo (pretend treatment) were too limited to support the use of warfarin in the prevention of symptomatic blood clots in cancer patients. One study in children evaluated antithrombin, which had no significant effect on any type of blood clots or major bleeding when compared with no antithrombin. 
Quality of the evidence 
The methodological quality of the included studies ranged from low to high, such that future studies may change our confidence in the results, in particular with regard to the safety of anticoagulants. The reliability of the findings ranged from high to very low across the different outcomes and comparisons. The main limiting factors, which were the reason for a decrease in reliability in some outcomes, were imprecision and risk of bias. The relatively low number of studies, participants, and clinical events prevented us from providing more definitive conclusions about the risk of bleeding in association with anticoagulants. None of the studies tested intermittent pneumatic compression (a mechanical device using an air pump and inflatable leggings to provide pulsing pressure that pushes blood through the veins) or graduated elastic stockings (special socks that improve blood flow in the leg veins and prevent blood from pooling in the legs) for the prevention of venous thromboembolism.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Preventing Blood Clots in Cancer Patients Receiving Chemotherapy

## What was this review about?

Researchers looked at whether cancer patients receiving chemotherapy should take blood-thinning medications to prevent dangerous blood clots from forming in their veins. They reviewed 32 studies involving 15,678 people, mostly with advanced cancer.

## What are blood clots and why do they matter?

Blood clots in veins (called venous thromboembolism or VTE) are a common problem for people with cancer. Chemotherapy can increase this risk even more. These clots can be serious and sometimes life-threatening.

## What did the researchers study?

They compared different blood-thinning medications to either inactive pills (placebo) or no treatment. They looked at:
- How well the medications prevented blood clots
- Whether the medications caused serious bleeding (the main safety concern)

## What did they find?

**Newer oral blood thinners (apixaban and rivaroxaban):**
- May reduce blood clots
- Likely increase risk of major bleeding

**Injectable blood thinners (LMWH):**
- Reduce blood clots
- Increase risk of major bleeding

**For people with multiple myeloma (a type of blood cancer):**
- LMWH worked better than warfarin or aspirin at preventing blood clots
- Major bleeding was rare with all treatments

**Warfarin:**
- May reduce blood clots
- May increase major bleeding

## What does this mean?

Blood-thinning medications can help prevent dangerous blood clots in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, but they also increase the risk of serious bleeding. Patients and doctors need to weigh these benefits and risks together when deciding on treatment.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the research review

What is this about
- People with cancer who get chemotherapy have a higher risk of blood clots in veins (called VTE).
- This review looked at whether taking medicines to prevent clots helps, and how safe they are.

Who was studied
- Adults getting chemotherapy while living at home (not in the hospital). Most had advanced cancer.
- One small study included children.
- Total: 32 randomized trials with 15,678 people.

What treatments were tested
- Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs): apixaban, rivaroxaban.
- Low–molecular-weight heparin (LMWH): shots under the skin.
- Warfarin (a blood thinner pill).
- Aspirin.
- Unfractionated heparin (older blood thinner).
- Antithrombin (in children).

What outcomes were measured
- Main benefit: fewer symptomatic blood clots (VTE).
- Main risk: major bleeding.

Key findings
- DOACs vs placebo:
  - May lower blood clots. 
  - Probably increase major bleeding.
- LMWH vs no prevention or placebo:
  - Clearly lowers blood clots (high certainty).
  - Probably increases major bleeding.
- In multiple myeloma:
  - LMWH lowered clots more than warfarin (high certainty).
  - LMWH probably lowered clots more than aspirin.
  - Major bleeding was rare: none with LMWH or warfarin in the trials; under 1% with aspirin.
- Warfarin vs no prevention:
  - May reduce clots.
  - May greatly increase major bleeding.
- Unfractionated heparin: not enough data on main outcomes.
- Antithrombin in children: effects on clots and bleeding are very uncertain.

How sure are these results
- Certainty ranged from high to very low, depending on the outcome.
- Strongest evidence:
  - LMWH reduces clots (high certainty).
  - LMWH and DOACs probably raise major bleeding (moderate certainty).

Safety
- Preventive blood thinners can cause major bleeding. The risk was higher with DOACs and LMWH compared with no treatment or placebo.

Study dates and sources
- This is the third update of a review first published in 2012.
- Searches included studies through August 3, 2020.

What this means
- For people with cancer on chemotherapy, LMWH clearly helps prevent clots but likely raises bleeding risk.
- DOACs may help prevent clots but probably raise bleeding risk.
- Evidence for other options (warfarin, aspirin, unfractionated heparin, antithrombin) is limited or uncertain.
- Choice of prevention should balance clot risk and bleeding risk and consider cancer type and treatment. More research is needed for certain cancers (like gastrointestinal or genitourinary) and specific drugs."
24,"Background
Macrolide antibiotics (macrolides) are among the most commonly prescribed antibiotics worldwide and are used for a wide range of infections. However, macrolides also expose people to the risk of adverse events. The current understanding of adverse events is mostly derived from observational studies, which are subject to bias because it is hard to distinguish events caused by antibiotics from events caused by the diseases being treated. Because adverse events are treatment‐specific, rather than disease‐specific, it is possible to increase the number of adverse events available for analysis by combining randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the same treatment across different diseases. 
Objectives
To quantify the incidences of reported adverse events in people taking macrolide antibiotics compared to placebo for any indication. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group Specialised Register (2018, Issue 4); MEDLINE (Ovid, from 1946 to 8 May 2018); Embase (from 2010 to 8 May 2018); CINAHL (from 1981 to 8 May 2018); LILACS (from 1982 to 8 May 2018); and Web of Science (from 1955 to 8 May 2018). We searched clinical trial registries for current and completed trials (9 May 2018) and checked the reference lists of included studies and of previous Cochrane Reviews on macrolides. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs that compared a macrolide antibiotic to placebo for any indication. We included trials using any of the four most commonly used macrolide antibiotics: azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, or roxithromycin. Macrolides could be administered by any route. Concomitant medications were permitted provided they were equally available to both treatment and comparison groups. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted and collected data. We assessed the risk of bias of all included studies and the quality of evidence for each outcome of interest. We analysed specific adverse events, deaths, and subsequent carriage of macrolide‐resistant bacteria separately. The study participant was the unit of analysis for each adverse event. Any specific adverse events that occurred in 5% or more of any group were reported. We undertook a meta‐analysis when three or more included studies reported a specific adverse event. 
Main results
We included 183 studies with a total of 252,886 participants (range 40 to 190,238). The indications for macrolide antibiotics varied greatly, with most studies using macrolides for the treatment or prevention of either acute respiratory tract infections, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal conditions, or urogynaecological problems. Most trials were conducted in secondary care settings. Azithromycin and erythromycin were more commonly studied than clarithromycin and roxithromycin. 
Most studies (89%) reported some adverse events or at least stated that no adverse events were observed. 
Gastrointestinal adverse events were the most commonly reported type of adverse event. Compared to placebo, macrolides caused more diarrhoea (odds ratio (OR) 1.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34 to 2.16; low‐quality evidence); more abdominal pain (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.26; low‐quality evidence); and more nausea (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.90; moderate‐quality evidence). Vomiting (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.56; moderate‐quality evidence) and gastrointestinal disorders not otherwise specified (NOS) (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.56 to 3.00; moderate‐quality evidence) were also reported more often in participants taking macrolides compared to placebo. 
The number of additional people (absolute difference in risk) who experienced adverse events from macrolides was: gastrointestinal disorders NOS 85/1000; diarrhoea 72/1000; abdominal pain 62/1000; nausea 47/1000; and vomiting 23/1000. 
The number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) ranged from 12 (95% CI 8 to 23) for gastrointestinal disorders NOS to 17 (9 to 47) for abdominal pain; 19 (12 to 33) for diarrhoea; 19 (13 to 30) for nausea; and 45 (22 to 295) for vomiting. 
There was no clear consistent difference in gastrointestinal adverse events between different types of macrolides or route of administration. 
Taste disturbances were reported more often by participants taking macrolide antibiotics, although there were wide confidence intervals and moderate heterogeneity (OR 4.95, 95% CI 1.64 to 14.93; I² = 46%; low‐quality evidence). 
Compared with participants taking placebo, those taking macrolides experienced hearing loss more often, however only four studies reported this outcome (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.70; I² = 0%; low‐quality evidence). 
We did not find any evidence that macrolides caused more cardiac disorders (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.40; very low‐quality evidence); hepatobiliary disorders (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.27 to 4.09; very low‐quality evidence); or changes in liver enzymes (OR 1.56, 95% CI 0.73 to 3.37; very low‐quality evidence) compared to placebo. 
We did not find any evidence that appetite loss, dizziness, headache, respiratory symptoms, blood infections, skin and soft tissue infections, itching, or rashes were reported more often by participants treated with macrolides compared to placebo. 
Macrolides caused less cough (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.80; moderate‐quality evidence) and fewer respiratory tract infections (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.80; moderate‐quality evidence) compared to placebo, probably because these are not adverse events, but rather characteristics of the indications for the antibiotics. Less fever (OR 0.73, 95% 0.54 to 1.00; moderate‐quality evidence) was also reported by participants taking macrolides compared to placebo, although these findings were non‐significant. 
There was no increase in mortality in participants taking macrolides compared with placebo (OR 0.96, 95% 0.87 to 1.06; I² = 11%; low‐quality evidence). 
Only 24 studies (13%) provided useful data on macrolide‐resistant bacteria. Macrolide‐resistant bacteria were more commonly identified among participants immediately after exposure to the antibiotic. However, differences in resistance thereafter were inconsistent. 
Pharmaceutical companies supplied the trial medication or funding, or both, for 91 trials. 
Authors' conclusions
The macrolides as a group clearly increased rates of gastrointestinal adverse events. Most trials made at least some statement about adverse events, such as ""none were observed"". However, few trials clearly listed adverse events as outcomes, reported on the methods used for eliciting adverse events, or even detailed the numbers of people who experienced adverse events in both the intervention and placebo group. This was especially true for the adverse event of bacterial resistance.","Adverse events in people taking macrolide antibiotics
Review question 
We wanted to find out if people treated with a macrolide antibiotic experienced more adverse events than those treated with placebo. 
Background 
Macrolide antibiotics are a group of antibiotics that are commonly used to treat both acute and chronic infections. The four most frequently used macrolides are: azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, and roxithromycin. People taking macrolide antibiotics are at risk of experiencing adverse events such as nausea, diarrhoea, or rash. 
Search date 
We searched the literature up to May 2018.
Study characteristics 
We included 183 studies with a total of 252,886 participants. Most studies were conducted in the hospital setting. Azithromycin and erythromycin were more commonly studied than clarithromycin and roxithromycin. Most studies (89%) reported some adverse events, or at least stated that no adverse events were observed. 
Study funding sources 
Drug companies supplied trial medications or funding, or both, in 91 studies. Funding sources were unclear in 59 studies. 
Key results 
People treated with a macrolide antibiotic experienced gastrointestinal adverse events such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea more often than those treated with placebo. 
Taste disturbances were reported more often by people taking macrolides than those taking a placebo. However, as very few studies reported on these adverse events, these results should be interpreted with caution. 
Hearing loss was reported more often by people taking macrolide antibiotics, however only four studies reported this outcome. 
Macrolides caused less cough and fewer respiratory tract infections than placebo.
We did not find any evidence that macrolides caused more cardiac disorders, liver disorders, blood infections, skin and soft tissue infections, changes in liver enzymes, appetite loss, dizziness, headache, respiratory symptoms, itching, or rashes than placebo. 
We did not find more deaths in people treated with macrolides than in those treated with placebo. 
Very limited information was available to assess if people treated with a macrolide antibiotic were at greater risk of developing resistant bacteria than those treated with placebo. However, bacteria that did not respond to macrolide antibiotics were more commonly identified immediately after treatment in people taking a macrolide than in those taking a placebo, but differences in resistance thereafter were inconsistent. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence ranged from very low (cardiac disorders, change in liver enzymes, liver disorders) to low (abdominal pain, death, diarrhoea, dizziness, hearing loss, skin and soft tissue infections, taste disturbance, wheeze) to moderate (appetite loss, blood infection, cough, fever, headache, itching, nausea, rash, respiratory symptoms, respiratory tract infections, vomiting).",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Side Effects of Macrolide Antibiotics

## What was this study about?

Researchers wanted to understand the side effects that happen when people take macrolide antibiotics. Macrolides are commonly prescribed antibiotics that include drugs like azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, and roxithromycin. These antibiotics treat many different types of infections.

## What did the researchers do?

The researchers looked at 183 studies involving 252,886 people. These studies tested macrolide antibiotics against placebo (inactive pills) for various health conditions. The studies treated people for breathing infections, heart conditions, stomach problems, and other illnesses. The researchers counted how many people experienced different side effects.

## What did they find?

**Stomach and digestive problems were the most common side effects:**
- For every 1,000 people taking macrolides, about 72 more people got diarrhea compared to those taking placebo
- About 62 more people per 1,000 had stomach pain
- About 47 more people per 1,000 felt nauseous
- About 23 more people per 1,000 vomited
- About 85 more people per 1,000 had other digestive problems

**Other side effects included:**
- Changes in taste
- Hearing loss (though only a few studies looked at this)

**What didn't increase:**
- Heart problems
- Liver problems
- Deaths
- Skin rashes or itching
- Dizziness or headaches

**Positive findings:**
- People taking macrolides actually had less coughing and fewer breathing infections, likely because the antibiotics were treating these conditions

## What does this mean?

Macrolide antibiotics commonly cause stomach-related side effects. For every 12 to 45 people taking these antibiotics, one additional person will experience a digestive side effect compared to those not taking the medicine. However, these antibiotics don't appear to increase the risk of serious problems like heart issues or death.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the study

What was the goal?
- To find out how often side effects happen in people taking macrolide antibiotics compared to a placebo (a pill with no medicine).

Who was in the studies?
- 183 randomized controlled trials with 252,886 people.
- People were treated for many conditions (such as lung, heart, stomach, or urogenital problems).
- Most studies took place in hospitals or specialty clinics.

What treatments were studied?
- Macrolide antibiotics: azithromycin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, or roxithromycin.
- Given by any route, compared to placebo.

What did the researchers look for?
- Side effects (especially stomach and gut problems).
- Deaths during the studies.
- Bacteria that became resistant to macrolides.

How were the studies found?
- Medical databases and trial registries were searched up to May 9, 2018.

Main findings

Common side effects (more common with macrolides than placebo):
- Stomach and gut problems:
  - Any GI problem (not otherwise specified): about 85 more people out of 1000.
  - Diarrhea: about 72 more out of 1000.
  - Belly pain: about 62 more out of 1000.
  - Nausea: about 47 more out of 1000.
  - Vomiting: about 23 more out of 1000.
- Taste changes were reported more often, but results varied between studies.
- Hearing loss was reported a bit more often, but only a few studies measured it.

Problems that were not higher with macrolides (no clear increase vs placebo):
- Heart problems.
- Liver problems or liver enzyme changes.
- Appetite loss, dizziness, headache, breathing symptoms, blood or skin infections, itching, or rashes.

Other results:
- No increase in deaths with macrolides compared to placebo.
- Fewer coughs and fewer respiratory infections were reported with macrolides (likely related to why people took the antibiotic, not a side effect).

Antibiotic resistance:
- In 24 studies that reported it, macrolide‑resistant bacteria were more common right after taking the antibiotic. Results later on were mixed.

Funding:
- Drug companies supplied medicine or funding in 91 trials.

What this means
- Macrolide antibiotics clearly raise the chance of stomach and gut side effects.
- Serious problems (heart, liver, death) were not higher than with placebo in these trials.
- Some resistance can appear right after taking macrolides.
- Not all trials fully reported side effects, especially resistance."
25,"Background
Despite efforts to preserve the neurovascular bundles with nerve‐sparing surgery, erectile dysfunction remains common following radical prostatectomy. Postoperative penile rehabilitation seeks to restore erectile function but results have been conflicting. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effects of penile rehabilitation strategies in restoring erectile function following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. 
Search methods
We performed a comprehensive search of multiple databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase), the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, clinical trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) and a grey literature repository (Grey Literature Report) from their inception through to 3 January 2018. We also searched the reference lists of other relevant publications and abstract proceedings. We applied no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised or quasi‐randomised trials with a parallel or cross‐over design.
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Two review authors independently screened the literature, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and rated quality of evidence according to GRADE on a per‐outcome basis. Primary outcomes were self‐reported potency, erectile function measured by validated questionnaires (with potency defined as an International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF‐EF) score of 19 or greater and or an IIEF‐5 of score of 17 or greater) and serious adverse events. For all quality of life assessments on a continuous scale, higher values indicated better quality of life. 
Main results
We included eight randomised controlled trials with 1699 participants across three comparisons. This abstract focuses on the primary outcomes of this review only. 
Scheduled phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5I) versus placebo or no treatment 
Scheduled PDE5I may have little or no effect on short‐term (up to 12 months) self‐reported potency (risk ratio (RR) 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to1.41; very low quality evidence), which corresponds to 47 more men with self‐reported potency per 1000 (95% CI 33 fewer to 149 more) and short‐term erectile function as assessed by a validated instrument (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.55; very low quality evidence), which corresponds to 28 more men per 1000 (95% CI 50 fewer to 138 more), but we are very uncertain of both of these findings. Scheduled PDE5I may result in fewer serious adverse events compared to placebo (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.94; low quality evidence), though this does not appear biologically plausible and may represent a chance finding. We are also very uncertain of this finding. We found no long‐term (longer than 12 months) data for any of the three primary outcomes. 
Scheduled PDE5I versus on‐demand PDE5I 
Daily PDE5I appears to result in little to no difference in both short‐term and long‐term (greater than 12 months) self‐reported potency (short term: RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.53; long term: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.67; both very low quality evidence); this corresponds to nine fewer men with self‐reported short‐term potency per 1000 (95% CI 119 fewer to 166 more) and zero fewer men with self‐reported long‐term potency per 1000 (95% CI 153 fewer to 257 more). We are very uncertain of these findings. Daily PDE5I appears to result in little to no difference in short‐term and long‐term erectile function (short term: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.55; long term; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.14; both very‐low quality evidence), which corresponds to zero men with short‐term erectile dysfunction per 1000 (95% CI 80 fewer to 125 more) and 119 fewer men with long‐term erectile dysfunction per 1000 (95% CI 239 fewer to 64 more). We are very uncertain of these findings. Scheduled PDE5I may result in little or no effects on short‐term adverse events (RR 0.69 95% CI 0.12 to 4.04; very low quality evidence), which corresponds to seven fewer men with short‐term serious adverse events (95% CI 18 fewer to 64 more), but we are very uncertain of these findings. We found no long‐term data for serious adverse events. 
Scheduled PDE5I versus scheduled intraurethral prostaglandin E1 
At short‐term follow‐up, daily PDE5I may result in little or no effect on self‐reported potency (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.79, to 1.52; very low quality evidence), which corresponds to 46 more men per 1000 (95% CI 97 fewer to 241 more). Daily PDE5I may result in a small improvement of erectile function (RR 1.64, 95% CI 0.84 to 3.20; very low quality evidence), which corresponds to 92 more men per 1000 (95% CI 23 fewer to 318 more) but we are very uncertain of both these findings. We found no long‐term (longer than 12 months) data for any of the three primary outcomes. 
We found no evidence for any other comparisons and were unable to perform any of the preplanned subgroup analyses based on nerve‐sparing approach, age or baseline erectile function. 
Authors' conclusions
Based on mostly very‐low and some low‐quality evidence, penile rehabilitation strategies consisting of scheduled PDE5I use following radical prostatectomy may not promote self‐reported potency and erectile function any more than on demand use.","Penile rehabilitation for post prostatectomy erectile dysfunction
Review question 
How well do treatments work to restore men's ability to have erections after surgery for prostate cancer? 
Background 
Many men have problems with erections after having their prostate removed for prostate cancer. Studies suggest that taking certain medicines or using devices to help with erection may help men's erections recover faster and better when used on a regular, scheduled basis (like daily or twice a week) rather than as needed. However, it is unclear how well these treatments actually work. 
Study characteristics 
We included eight randomised studies (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with 1699 participants. Five trials compared the scheduled use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors (a type of medicine) to either no treatment or a placebo (a pretend drug with no effect). Two studies compared the use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors either as a daily prescription or as needed. One study compared the daily use of either a phosphodiesterase inhibitor or a medicine called prostaglandin E1 that is placed into the tip of the penis like a suppository. The main outcomes of this review that we felt were most important to men were how good they thought their erections were (self‐reported potency), how good their erections were based on a specialised erection questionnaire (quality of erections) and any whether there were any major unwanted side effects. 
Key results 
We found that the men who used these medicines on a scheduled basis may have had similar self‐reported erections and quality of erections (based on questionnaires they filled out) as men who took no medication regularly or use it as needed. They also had similar rates of serious unwanted side effects and similar rates of stopping the drug before the end of the treatment duration. However, we are very uncertain of these findings. We were unable to research whether these results would be different in different groups of men based on whether the surgeon tried to preserve the nerves that help with erections or not, based on men's age and how good their erections were beforehand because we found no studies. 
Reliability of evidence 
The quality of evidence was very low for most main outcomes. That means we are very uncertain of the results of this review. Further research will likely change these findings.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Treatments to Restore Erections After Prostate Cancer Surgery

## What was this study about?

Researchers reviewed studies on treatments designed to help men regain the ability to have erections after surgery to remove their prostate due to cancer. Even when surgeons try to protect important nerves during the operation, many men still have trouble getting erections afterward.

## What treatments were studied?

The main treatment studied was a type of medication called PDE5 inhibitors (like Viagra or Cialis). Researchers looked at different ways of using these medications:
- Taking them on a regular schedule versus taking a placebo (fake pill) or no treatment
- Taking them daily on a schedule versus taking them only when needed
- Taking them daily versus using a different medication inserted into the urethra

## What did the researchers find?

The review included 8 studies with 1,699 men who had prostate surgery.

**Taking PDE5 inhibitors on a regular schedule:**
- May not work better than taking a placebo or no treatment for restoring erections within the first year
- May not work better than taking the medication only when needed, either in the short term (up to 12 months) or long term (after 12 months)
- May not work better than using medication inserted into the urethra

**Side effects:**
- Men taking scheduled PDE5 inhibitors may have had fewer serious side effects than those taking placebo, but researchers are uncertain about this finding

## What does this mean?

Taking erection medications on a regular schedule after prostate surgery may not help men regain erections any better than taking them only when needed. However, the quality of evidence was very limited, so more research is needed.",0,Plano,"Plain Language Summary

What was studied
- Researchers reviewed clinical trials to see if “penile rehabilitation” helps men regain the ability to get and keep an erection after prostate removal surgery (radical prostatectomy).

Who was included
- 8 randomized trials with 1,699 men who had surgery for prostate cancer.

Treatments tested
- Scheduled (daily) pills called PDE5 inhibitors (such as sildenafil-type medicines) vs:
  - Placebo or no treatment
  - Taking the same pills only when needed (on‑demand)
  - A different treatment placed in the urethra (prostaglandin E1)

What outcomes were measured
- Self-reported ability to have erections good enough for sex
- Scores on standard erection questionnaires (IIEF)
- Serious side effects
- Follow-up time: short term (up to 12 months) and longer term (more than 12 months)

Main findings
- Daily PDE5 pills vs placebo/no treatment: May make little to no difference in erection recovery at up to 12 months. No longer-term data.
- Daily PDE5 pills vs on-demand use: Little to no difference in erection recovery in the short term or long term.
- Daily PDE5 pills vs urethral prostaglandin E1: Daily pills may give a small benefit on questionnaire scores at up to 12 months, but this is uncertain. No longer-term data.

Safety
- Serious side effects were uncommon. One analysis suggested fewer serious side effects with daily pills than placebo, but this is likely due to chance and is uncertain. No long-term safety data for most comparisons.

Quality of the evidence
- Evidence quality was mostly very low to low. Results are uncertain, and real effects could be different.

Bottom line
- Using PDE5 pills every day after prostate surgery does not clearly help more than taking them only when needed.
- We need better, longer studies to know which approach works best and is safest."
26,"Background
Surgery for anorectal fistula may result in recurrence, or impairment of continence. The ideal treatment for anorectal fistulae should be associated with low recurrence rates, minimal incontinence and good quality of life. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and morbidity of operative procedures for chronic anal fistula, primary outcomes being recurrence and incontinence. 
Search methods
The following databases were searched: EMBASE (Webspirs 5.1, Silver Platter version 2.0, 1950‐2009); Medline (Webspirs 5.1, Silver Platter version 2.0, 1950‐2009); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2009 issue 4)and the IndMed ( Indian Medline, www.indmed.nic.in) database. We restricted our search to the English literature. The Indian Journal of Surgery was electronically searched (issues between 2003 and vol 71, Oct 2009). We also searched all primary trial registers (Indian, Australian, Chinese, WHO, ISRCTN and American). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing operative procedures for anorectal fistulae were considered. Non randomised trials and cohort studies were examined where data on recurrence and function were available. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers (TJ and BP) independently selected the trials for inclusion in the review. Disagreements were solved by discussion. Where disagreement persisted and published results made data extraction difficult, we obtained clarification from the authors. REVMAN 5 was used for statistical analysis. Quality of the trials were assessed and allowances made for subgroup analysis and prevention of publication bias, using funnel plots if needed. 
Main results
Ten randomised controlled trials were available for analysis. The quality of included studies was adequate, though in some trials the numbers were small and they were inadequately powered for equivalence or to detect significant differences. Comparisons were made between various modalities of treatments. There were no significant difference in recurrence rates or incontinence rates in any of the studied comparisons except in the case of advancement flaps. There were more recurrences in the glue plus flap group, a significant difference that favoured the flap only technique. It was also noted that Fibrin glue and advancement flap procedures report low incontinence rates.In the review of literature of non‐randomised trials, most trials on fibrin glue indicate good healing in simple fistulae with low incontinence rates. 
Authors' conclusions
There are very few randomized controlled trials comparing the various modalities of surgery for fistula in ano. While post operative pain, time to healing and discharge from hospital affect quality of life, recurrence and incontinence are the most important. As it turns out, there seems to be no major difference between the various techniques used as far as recurrence rates are concerned. 
The use of Fibrin glue and advancement flaps are associated with low incontinence rates. 
There is a crying need for well powered, well conducted randomised controlled trials comparing various modes of treatment of fistula in ano. Newer operations like the anal fistula plug and the LIFT procedure need to be evaluated by randomised clinical trials.","No major difference between the various surgical interventions for Anorectal fistula used as far as recurrence rates are concerned. 
Anorectal fistula is a common surgical problem. The anorectal fistula can be treated by various surgical options. The common surgical options for rectal fistulae are  a) to lay open the fistula tract (fistulotomy), or  b) to pass a seton (a thread, wire or tube that stimulates the body to extrude it and ultimately heal the fistula), or  c) to primarily remove the fistula (fistulectomy) and repair the defect in the muscle and the anus with an anorectal myo‐mucosal advancement flap.  Other treatment modalities used less frequently include fibrin glue and ayurvedic drugs incorporated into setons. The optimal surgical treatment for anorectal fistulae is associated with low recurrence rates, minimal incontinence and a good quality of life. 
The reviewers identified 10 trials that compare various fistula treatments against one another. There are various parameters that these procedures can be compared on, but we looked at the two most important ones, recurrence (the numbers who got the disease again) and incontinence (a worsening in the ability to control rectal content). 
In the trials that were compared, there was no significant difference between the various comparisons for the disease to recur. However the trials on fibrin glue, as well as data from non randomised trials show that incontinence is less, probably as there is no surgical disruption of the anal muscle. 
There is a paucity of good quality data that compares various types of operative treatment for anorectal fistula and there is scope for further trials in the area.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Surgical Treatments for Anal Fistulas

## What is this study about?

An anal fistula is an abnormal tunnel that forms between the inside of the anal canal and the skin near the anus. Surgery is needed to fix this problem, but different surgical methods exist. Researchers wanted to find out which surgical approach works best.

## What did the researchers look for?

The researchers searched medical databases from 1950 to 2009 for studies comparing different surgical treatments for anal fistulas. They focused on two main concerns:
- **Recurrence**: Whether the fistula comes back after surgery
- **Incontinence**: Problems controlling bowel movements after surgery

They also looked at quality of life, pain after surgery, healing time, and hospital stay length.

## What did they find?

The researchers analyzed 10 studies that compared different surgical methods. Here's what they discovered:

- Most surgical techniques had similar rates of fistulas coming back
- Most techniques had similar rates of bowel control problems
- Two approaches stood out for causing fewer bowel control problems:
  - Fibrin glue (a biological adhesive)
  - Advancement flaps (using tissue to cover the opening)
- When advancement flaps were used alone, they worked better than when combined with fibrin glue

## What does this mean?

The study found that most surgical methods for anal fistulas work about equally well. However, fibrin glue and advancement flaps may be better choices for people concerned about maintaining bowel control after surgery.

The researchers noted that more high-quality studies are needed to better compare these treatments and evaluate newer surgical techniques.",0,Plano,"Plain-Language Summary

What was studied
- Researchers reviewed past studies to learn which surgeries work best for long-lasting anal fistula.
- They focused on two main outcomes: fistula coming back (recurrence) and problems controlling bowel movements (incontinence).

Who was included
- People with chronic anal fistula who had surgery.
- Studies included randomized controlled trials and some non-randomized studies.

What treatments were compared
- Various surgical methods, including:
  - Advancement flap
  - Fibrin glue
  - Fibrin glue plus advancement flap
  - Other common surgical techniques

What outcomes were measured
- Main: recurrence of the fistula and incontinence
- Other: pain after surgery, time to heal, and length of hospital stay

Key findings
- Across most comparisons, there was no clear difference in how often the fistula came back or in incontinence rates.
- One exception: more recurrences happened with fibrin glue plus advancement flap compared with advancement flap alone.
- Fibrin glue and advancement flap procedures generally showed low rates of incontinence.
- Non-randomized studies suggest fibrin glue may heal simple fistulae well with low incontinence.

Safety
- Incontinence rates were low with fibrin glue and advancement flap.
- No other major safety differences were clearly shown across techniques.

How the research was done
- The review included 10 randomized trials. Some trials were small and may not have been strong enough to show differences.
- Studies were published up to 2009 and searched in multiple medical databases and trial registries.

What’s still needed
- Larger, well-designed trials comparing surgical options.
- Testing of newer methods like the anal fistula plug and the LIFT procedure in randomized trials.

Bottom line
- Most surgical methods studied had similar rates of fistula coming back.
- Advancement flap and fibrin glue tend to have low risk of incontinence.
- More high-quality research is needed to guide the best choice of surgery."
27,"Background
Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) is a leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Amnioinfusion aims to restore amniotic fluid volume by infusing a solution into the uterine cavity. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to assess the effects of amnioinfusion for PPROM on perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (2 December 2013). 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials of amnioinfusion compared with no amnioinfusion in women with PPROM.
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion. Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. 
Main results
We included five trials, of moderate quality, but we only analysed data from four studies (with a total of 241 participants). One trial did not contribute any data to the review. 
Transcervical amnioinfusion improved fetal umbilical artery pH at delivery (mean difference 0.11; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.14; one trial, 61 participants) and reduced persistent variable decelerations during labour (risk ratio (RR) 0.52; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.91; one trial, 86 participants). 
Transabdominal amnioinfusion was associated with a reduction in neonatal death (RR 0.30; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.66; two trials, 94 participants), neonatal sepsis (RR 0.26; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.61; one trial, 60 participants), pulmonary hypoplasia (RR 0.22; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.88; one trial, 34 participants) and puerperal sepsis (RR 0.20; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.84; one trial, 60 participants). Women in the amnioinfusion group were also less likely to deliver within seven days of membrane rupture (RR 0.18; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.70; one trial, 34 participants). These results should be treated with circumspection as the positive findings were mainly due to one trial with unclear allocation concealment. 
Authors' conclusions
These results are encouraging but are limited by the sparse data and unclear methodological robustness, therefore further evidence is required before amnioinfusion for PPROM can be recommended for routine clinical practice.","Amnioinfusion for preterm premature rupture of membranes
There is some evidence to show that restoring amniotic fluid volume with saline or a similar fluid (amnioinfusion) following preterm premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM) may be beneficial for preterm babies (by preventing infection, lung damage and death) and mothers (by preventing infection of the womb after childbirth). However, current evidence is insufficient to recommend amnioinfusion for routine use in PPROM. 
Preterm premature rupture of membranes is the single most identifiable cause of preterm labour. The sac (membranes) surrounding the baby and fluid in the womb (uterus) usually breaks (ruptures) during labour. If the membranes rupture before labour and preterm (before 37 weeks) the baby has an increased risk of infection. Reduced fluid around the baby also increases the chance of the umbilical cord being compressed, which can reduce the baby's supply of nutrients and oxygen. In addition, insufficient fluid in the womb may interfere with normal lung development in very small babies and can cause fetal distress, with changes in heart rate. Extra liquid can be injected through the woman's vagina (transcervical amnioinfusion) or abdomen (transabdominal amnioinfusion) into the womb, providing more liquid to surround the baby. The review of five randomised controlled trials (with data from a total of 241 participants analysed) found some evidence to show that amnioinfusion with a saline solution may improve health outcomes and be beneficial for babies and mothers following PPROM. However, the evidence is currently insufficient to recommend its routine use because of the limited number of trials and low numbers of women in the trials.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Amnioinfusion for Preterm Premature Rupture of Membranes

## What was studied?

Researchers reviewed studies about a procedure called amnioinfusion for pregnant women whose water breaks too early (before 37 weeks of pregnancy). When water breaks early, the baby loses the protective fluid that normally surrounds them in the womb. Amnioinfusion involves putting fluid back into the womb through a needle or tube to replace what was lost.

## Who was studied?

The review included 241 pregnant women whose water broke too early in their pregnancy. The studies compared women who received amnioinfusion to those who did not.

## What did researchers do?

They searched medical databases for studies completed by December 2013. They found five studies that met their standards, though only four provided usable information. The researchers looked at two different methods:
- **Transcervical**: fluid added through the cervix (birth canal)
- **Transabdominal**: fluid added through a needle in the belly

## What did they find?

**For transcervical amnioinfusion:**
- Babies had better blood oxygen levels at birth
- Fewer heart rate problems during labor

**For transabdominal amnioinfusion:**
- Fewer newborn deaths
- Fewer infections in newborns and mothers
- Fewer lung development problems in babies
- Women were less likely to deliver within one week of their water breaking

## What does this mean?

The results look promising, but the researchers caution that more studies are needed. The positive findings came mainly from small studies, and some studies had unclear methods. Doctors should not routinely use this procedure until larger, better-designed studies confirm these benefits.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the review

What was the purpose?
- To see if putting fluid into the uterus (amnioinfusion) helps pregnant people and their babies after the water breaks too early (PPROM).

Who was studied?
- Pregnant people with PPROM.
- Only randomized trials that compared amnioinfusion to no amnioinfusion were included.

What was done?
- Researchers looked for trials up to December 2, 2013.
- Five trials were found; data from four trials (241 people) were analyzed.
- Two ways to give fluid were studied:
  - Through the cervix (transcervical)
  - Through the belly (transabdominal)

What outcomes were measured?
- Baby outcomes: umbilical cord blood pH at birth, heart rate problems during labor, death, severe lung problems, infections.
- Parent outcomes: infection after birth (puerperal sepsis).
- Timing of birth after membranes ruptured.

Main findings
- Transcervical amnioinfusion:
  - Improved baby’s cord blood pH at birth (1 study, 61 people).
  - Reduced ongoing variable heart rate drops during labor (1 study, 86 people).

- Transabdominal amnioinfusion:
  - Lower chance of newborn death (2 studies, 94 people).
  - Lower chance of newborn infection (1 study, 60 people).
  - Lower chance of serious newborn lung problem (1 study, 34 people).
  - Lower chance of infection in the parent after birth (1 study, 60 people).
  - Less likely to give birth within 7 days after water broke (1 study, 34 people).

Safety
- No new safety concerns were reported in these trials.
- Some results suggested fewer infections, but data were limited.

Timing
- Evidence includes trials found up to December 2, 2013.

Limits of the evidence
- Small number of trials and participants.
- Moderate study quality; one key trial had unclear methods.
- Because of this, the results should be viewed with caution.

Bottom line
- Early results are encouraging, but there is not enough strong evidence yet to recommend amnioinfusion for PPROM as standard care. More high-quality studies are needed."
28,"Background
Domestic violence during pregnancy is a major public health concern. This preventable risk factor threatens both the mother and baby. Routine perinatal care visits offer opportunities for healthcare professionals to screen and refer abused women for effective interventions. It is, however, not clear which interventions best serve mothers during pregnancy and postpartum to ensure their safety. 
Objectives
To examine the effectiveness and safety of interventions in preventing or reducing domestic violence against pregnant women. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 July 2014), scanned bibliographies of published studies and corresponded with investigators. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including cluster‐randomised trials, and quasi‐randomised controlled trials (e.g. where there was alternate allocation) investigating the effect of interventions in preventing or reducing domestic violence during pregnancy. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. 
Main results
We included 10 trials with a total of 3417 women randomised. Seven of these trials, recruiting 2629 women, contributed data to the review. However, results for all outcomes were based on single studies. There was limited evidence for the primary outcomes of reduction of episodes of violence (physical, sexual, and/or psychological) and prevention of violence during and up to one year after pregnancy (as defined by the authors of trials). In one study, women who received the intervention reported fewer episodes of partner violence during pregnancy and in the postpartum period (risk ratio (RR) 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43 to 0.88, 306 women, moderate quality). Groups did not differ for Conflict Tactics Score ‐ the mean partner abuse scores in the first three months postpartum (mean difference (MD) 4.20 higher, 95% CI ‐10.74 to 19.14, one study, 46 women, very low quality). The Current Abuse Score for partner abuse in the first three months was also similar between groups (MD ‐0.12 lower, 95% CI ‐0.31 lower to 0.07 higher, one study, 191 women, very low quality). Evidence for the outcomes episodes of partner abuse during pregnancy or episodes during the first three months postpartum was not significant (respectively, RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.02, one study with 220 women, very low quality; and RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.04, one study, 271 women, very low quality). Finally, the risk for low birthweight (< 2500 g) did not differ between groups (RR 0.74, 95 % CI 0.41 to 1.32, 306 infants, low quality). 
There were few statistically significant differences between intervention and control groups for depression during pregnancy and the postnatal period. Only one study reported findings for neonatal outcomes such as preterm delivery and birthweight, and there were no clinically significant differences between groups. None of the studies reported results for other secondary outcomes: Apgar score less than seven at one minute and five minutes, stillbirth, neonatal death, miscarriage, maternal mortality, antepartum haemorrhage, and placental abruption. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of interventions for domestic violence on pregnancy outcomes. There is a need for high‐quality, RCTs with adequate statistical power to determine whether intervention programs prevent or reduce domestic violence episodes during pregnancy, or have any effect on maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity outcomes.","Preventing or reducing partner violence against women during pregnancy
Violence against women by partners during pregnancy is a major public health concern. It can cause physical and psychological harm to women and may lead to pregnancy complications and poor outcomes for babies. It is not clear what sort of intervention best serves women and infants during pregnancy and after giving birth to ensure their safety. Interventions that might work include counselling and psychological therapy to give women more confidence and to encourage them to make plans to avoid abuse. Referral to social workers, shelters and other community‐based resources may also help. For partners, referral can be made to 'batterer' treatment programs.   
Routine prenatal care offers opportunities for healthcare staff to identify women at risk of being abused. In this review we included 10 randomised trials involving a total of 3417 women, seven of which studied pregnant women who were at high risk of partner violence. The interventions examined in the studies included a single brief individualised consultation, case management and referral to a social care worker, and multiple therapy sessions during pregnancy and after birth. Due to the lack of data, and the different way outcomes were reported, we were unable to identify interventions that worked better than others. Studies focused on different outcomes and we were not able to pool information to draw conclusions about the overall effectiveness of the interventions. Most of the studies did not report on whether or not there had been any reduction in episodes of violence. There was evidence from a single study that the total number of women reporting partner violence during pregnancy and after birth was reduced for women receiving a psychological therapy intervention. Several of the studies examined whether women who received interventions were less likely to have depression after the birth of the baby, but the evidence was not consistent. Other outcomes for the baby such as reduced birthweight and preterm birth were reported in only one study, and the intervention did not lessen the risk of preterm birth (< 2500 g). None of the studies reported results for important outcomes such as stillbirth, neonatal death, miscarriage, maternal deaths, antepartum haemorrhage, and placental abruption. More information is needed from well‐conducted trials before any particular interventional approach can be recommended.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Testing Programs to Help Pregnant Women Experiencing Domestic Violence

## What is this study about?

Researchers wanted to find out if special programs can help protect pregnant women who experience violence at home from a partner. They looked at whether these programs could reduce violence and improve health outcomes for mothers and babies.

## Why is this important?

Domestic violence during pregnancy is a serious problem that can harm both mothers and babies. Since pregnant women regularly visit healthcare providers, these visits could be good opportunities to identify women experiencing violence and connect them with help.

## What did the researchers do?

They searched for studies that tested different programs designed to help pregnant women experiencing domestic violence. They found 10 studies involving 3,417 women total, though only 7 studies (with 2,629 women) had usable data.

## What did they find?

The results were limited because most findings came from single studies:

- **Violence reduction**: One study showed that women who received help reported fewer incidents of violence during pregnancy and after birth compared to women who didn't receive the program.

- **Other violence measures**: Several other ways of measuring violence showed no clear differences between women who received help and those who didn't.

- **Baby's health**: There was no clear difference in the number of babies born with low birth weight between the two groups.

- **Depression**: Programs didn't show clear benefits for reducing depression in pregnant or new mothers.

- **Other outcomes**: Few studies looked at other important outcomes like premature birth, stillbirth, or complications during pregnancy.

## What does this mean?

There isn't enough strong evidence yet to know which programs work best to help pregnant women experiencing domestic violence. More high-quality studies with larger numbers of participants are needed to find effective ways to protect mothers and babies.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the review

What was the goal?
- To see if programs during pregnancy and after birth can prevent or reduce domestic violence against pregnant women, and to check safety for mothers and babies.

Who was studied?
- Pregnant women taking part in clinical trials.
- The review included 10 trials with 3,417 women; 7 trials (2,629 women) provided usable data.

What interventions were tested?
- Programs given during routine pregnancy care. These included counseling, safety planning, and referrals. Specific programs varied by study.

What outcomes were measured?
- Episodes of partner violence (physical, sexual, and/or psychological) during pregnancy and up to one year after birth.
- Scores from conflict/abuse questionnaires in the first three months after birth.
- Maternal mood (depression) during pregnancy and after birth.
- Baby outcomes: preterm birth, birthweight, and low birthweight.
- Serious outcomes like Apgar scores, stillbirth, neonatal death, miscarriage, maternal death, heavy bleeding before birth, and placental abruption.

Main findings
- Evidence was limited and often came from single small studies.
- One study found fewer reported episodes of partner violence during pregnancy and after birth in the intervention group (risk ratio 0.62; 306 women; moderate-quality evidence).
- Other studies showed no clear differences in violence scores in the first three months after birth.
- Low birthweight did not differ between groups (306 infants; low-quality evidence).
- Few differences were found for depression during pregnancy or after birth.
- Only one study reported preterm birth and birthweight; no important differences were found.
- Many serious outcomes (like stillbirth and maternal death) were not reported.

Timing
- Programs were delivered during pregnancy, with follow-up during pregnancy and up to one year after birth (some outcomes focused on the first three months after birth).

Safety
- Safety information was limited. The trials did not show clear differences in birth outcomes, and many serious outcomes were not reported.

Bottom line
- There is not enough good-quality evidence to know which programs best prevent or reduce domestic violence during pregnancy or improve health outcomes for mothers and babies.
- More large, high-quality trials are needed to find out what works and to assess safety."
29,"Background
Embryo transfer (ET) was traditionally performed two days after oocyte retrieval; however, developments in culture media have allowed embryos to be maintained in culture for longer periods. Delaying transfer from Day two to Day three would allow for further development of the embryo and might have a positive effect on pregnancy outcomes. 
Objectives
To determine if there are any differences in live birth and pregnancy rates when embryo transfer is performed on day three after oocyte retrieval, compared with day two, in infertile couples undergoing treatment with in vitro fertilisation (IVF), including intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid) from the inception of the databases to 26th April 2016. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO portal for ongoing trials plus citation lists of relevant publications, review articles and included studies, as well as abstracts of appropriate scientific meetings. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials that compared Day 3 versus Day 2 embryo transfer after oocyte retrieval during an IVF or ICSI treatment cycle in infertile couples. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. The primary outcome measures were live birth rate and ongoing pregnancy rate. 
Main results
We included 15 studies. Fourteen studies reported data per woman (2894 women) and one study reported data per cycle (969 cycles). The quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach ranged from moderate quality to very low quality. The main reasons for downgrading evidence were poor methodological reporting, selective reporting, inconsistency and imprecision. 
Live birth per woman ‐ Overall, there was no evidence of a difference in live birth rate between Day three and Day two embryo transfer (risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.23; three studies, n = 1200 women; I2 = 63%; very low quality evidence). The data suggest that if 32% of women who underwent a Day two embryo transfer had a live birth, then between 28% to 39% of women undergoing a Day three embryo transfer would have a live birth. 
Ongoing pregnancy per woman ‐ There was no evidence of a difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for ongoing pregnancy (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.12; six studies, n = 1740 women; I2 = 52%; very low quality of evidence). The data suggest that if 33% of women undergoing a Day two embryo transfer had an ongoing pregnancy then between 28% to 37% of women undergoing a Day three embryo transfer would have an ongoing pregnancy. 
Clinical pregnancy per woman ‐ There was no evidence of a difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for the chance of a clinical pregnancy (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.19; 12 studies, n = 2461, I2 = 51%; very low quality evidence). The data suggest that if 39% of women undergoing Day two embryo transfer had a clinical pregnancy, then between 38% to 46% of women undergoing a Day three embryo transfer would have a clinical pregnancy. 
Multiple pregnancy per woman ‐ There was no evidence of a difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for the risk of a multiple pregnancy (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.44; eight studies, n = 1837; I2 = 0%; moderate quality evidence). The data suggest that if 11% of women undergoing Day two embryo transfer had a multiple pregnancy, then between 9% to 15% of women undergoing a Day three embryo transfer would have a multiple pregnancy. 
Miscarriage rate per woman ‐ There was no evidence of a difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for the risk of miscarriage (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.60; nine studies, n = 2153 women, I2 = 26%; moderate quality evidence). The data suggest that if 6% of women undergoing Day two embryo transfer had a miscarriage, then between 5% to 10% of women undergoing a Day three embryo transfer would have a miscarriage. 
Ectopic pregnancy rate per woman ‐ There was no evidence of a difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for the risk of ectopic pregnancy (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.29 to 3.40; six studies, n = 1531 women, I2 = 0%; low quality evidence). The data suggest that if 0.7% of women undergoing Day two embryo transfer have an ectopic pregnancy, then between 0.2% to 2% of women undergoing Day three embryo transfer would have an ectopic pregnancy. 
Subgroup analysis for pregnancy outcomes did not identify any differential effect between IVF and ICSI. 
None of the included studies prespecified complication rate (e.g. OHSS), fetal abnormality or women's evaluation of the procedure as outcomes in their studies. 
Authors' conclusions
Twelve of 15 studies contributed data that could be included in meta‐analyses. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low. Only three of the 15 studies reported data for live birth, although the data for ongoing pregnancy and clinical pregnancy are consistent with the live birth data, suggesting no difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for these outcomes. There was no evidence of a difference identified between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for multiple pregnancy, miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy per woman randomised. No data were reported for complication rate, fetal abnormality or woman's evaluation of the procedure. The current evidence has not identified any evidence of differences in pregnancy outcomes between Day two and Day three embryo transfers. Any further studies comparing these timings of embryo transfer are unlikely to alter the findings and we suggest that this review no longer be updated.","Day three versus day two embryo transfer following in vitro fertilisation or intracytoplasmic sperm injection 
Review question 
Cochrane review authors investigated whether transferring an embryo on Day two or on Day three of development makes a difference to pregnancy outcomes in women having in vitro fertilisation or intracytoplasmic sperm injection. 
Background 
Embryo transfer has usually been performed two days after oocyte (egg) retrieval; however, developments in culture media and embryo culture methods have allowed embryos to be maintained in culture for longer periods. This means that more assessments can be undertaken to look at the implantation chances for each embryo. Delaying transfer from Day two to Day three would allow for further development of the embryo and might have a positive effect on pregnancy outcomes. 
Study characteristics 
We identified 15 randomised trials meeting the review inclusion criteria. These include 14 trials reporting data from 2894 women; one trial reported data from 969 cycles so could not be included in meta‐analysis. All of the included studies were parallel‐design randomised controlled trials conducted in Brazil, Chile, Singapore, Argentina, Finland, Turkey, Spain, Israel, Canada, Greece, Japan, Italy, Norway and Belgium. The evidence is current to April 2016. 
Key results 
Only three of 15 studies reported on live birth as an outcome. We found that there was no clear evidence of a difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for rates of live birth, ongoing pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, multiple pregnancy or miscarriage. There were no data reported for complication rate, fetal abnormality or women's evaluation of the procedure. 
Quality of the evidence 
Allocation concealment was poorly reported in the included studies and blinding was not possible (although we feel this is unlikely to affect pregnancy outcomes). Blinding of outcome assessors was not reported. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low. The main reasons for downgrading the evidence were poor reporting of study methods (risk of bias), lack of agreement between studies (inconsistency), low event rates and lack of accuracy (imprecision) for some outcomes and poor reporting of live birth outcomes (selective reporting). 
Any further studies comparing these timings of embryo transfer are unlikely to alter the findings and we do not plan to update this review again. Many of the trials included in this review have used outdated techniques that include stimulation, laboratory technology and transferring more than one embryo. We would direct the reader to the Glujovsky 2016 Cochrane review comparing Day 2/3 with day 5/6 embryo transfer.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Timing of Embryo Transfer in IVF Treatment

## What was this study about?

Researchers wanted to find out if the timing of embryo transfer during in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment makes a difference in pregnancy success. Specifically, they compared transferring embryos two days after egg collection versus three days after egg collection.

## Why is this important?

In IVF treatment, eggs are collected from a woman's ovaries and fertilized in a laboratory. The resulting embryos are then transferred back into the woman's uterus. Traditionally, this transfer happened two days after egg collection. However, improvements in laboratory techniques now allow embryos to grow longer before transfer. Researchers wanted to know if waiting one extra day might improve the chances of having a baby.

## What did the researchers do?

The research team reviewed 15 studies that included nearly 2,900 women undergoing IVF treatment. These studies randomly assigned women to have their embryos transferred either on day two or day three after egg collection. The researchers looked at various outcomes, including live births, ongoing pregnancies, and potential complications.

## What did they find?

The researchers found no meaningful differences between day two and day three embryo transfers for:

- **Live births**: About 32% of women in both groups had a baby
- **Ongoing pregnancies**: About 33% of women in both groups had ongoing pregnancies
- **Clinical pregnancies**: About 39% of women in both groups became pregnant
- **Multiple pregnancies** (twins or more): About 11% in both groups
- **Miscarriages**: About 6% in both groups

## What does this mean?

Based on current evidence, transferring embryos on day two or day three after egg collection appears to produce similar results. Women and their doctors can choose either timing without expecting different pregnancy outcomes.",0,Plano,"Plain Language Summary

What was studied
Researchers looked at whether moving embryo transfer from Day 2 to Day 3 after egg retrieval in IVF (including ICSI) changes results for patients.

Who was included
- Infertile couples having IVF or ICSI

- This was a review of randomized controlled trials.

Quality of the evidence
- Ranged from moderate to very low.
- Limitations included poor reporting, selective reporting, and inconsistent results across studies.

Bottom line
Moving embryo transfer from Day 2 to Day 3 after egg retrieval did not change chances of live birth, pregnancy, multiple pregnancy, miscarriage, or ectopic pregnancy. Further studies are unlikely to change this conclusion."
30,"Background
Worldwide, mother‐to‐child transmission (MTCT) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) represents the most common means by which children acquire HIV infection.  Efficacious and effective interventions to prevent in utero and intrapartum transmission of HIV infection have been developed and implemented.  However, a large proportion of MTCT of HIV occurs postnatally, through breast milk transmission.  
Objectives
The objectives of this systematic review were to collate and assess the evidence regarding interventions to decrease late postnatal MTCT of HIV, and to determine the efficacy of such interventions in decreasing late postnatal MTCT of HIV, increasing overall survival, and increasing HIV‐free survival.  
Search methods
Electronic searches were undertaken using PubMed, EMBASE and other databases for 1980‐2008.  Hand searches of reference lists of pertinent reviews and studies, as well as abstracts from relevant conferences, were also conducted.  Experts in the field were contacted to locate any other studies.  The search strategy was iterative.     
Selection criteria
Randomized clinical trials assessing the efficacy of interventions to prevent MTCT of HIV through breast milk were included in the analysis.  Other trials and intervention cohort studies with relevant data also were included, but only when randomization was not feasible due to the nature of the intervention (i.e., infant feeding modality).  
Data collection and analysis
Data regarding HIV infection status and vital status of infants born to HIV‐infected women, according to intervention, were extracted from the reports of the studies. 
Main results
Six randomized clinical trials and one intervention cohort study were included in this review.  Two trials addressed the issue of shortening the duration of (or eliminating) exposure to breast milk. In a trial of breastfeeding versus formula feeding, formula feeding was efficacious in preventing MTCT of HIV (the cumulative probability of HIV infection at 24 months was 36.7% in the breastfeeding arm and 20.5% in the formula arm [p = 0.001]), but the mortality and malnutrition rates during the first two years of life were similar in the two groups.  In a trial of early cessation of breastfeeding, HIV‐free survival was similar between those children who ceased breastfeeding abruptly around four months of age and those who continued breastfeeding.  Another trial addressing vitamin supplementation found more cases of HIV infection among children of mothers in the vitamin A arm.  Efficacy for other vitamin supplements was not shown.  An intervention cohort study evaluated the risk of MTCT by six months of age according to infant feeding modality, and found increased risks of MTCT among breastfed children who also received solids any time after birth (hazard ratio = 10.87, 1.51‐78.00, p = 0.018). Cumulative 3‐month mortality among formula fed infants was higher than among exclusively breastfed infants (hazard ratio = 2.06, 1.00‐4.27, p = 0.051). Three trials evaluated antiretroviral prophylaxis to breastfeeding infants. In one trial conducted in Botswana, mothers received zidovudine prophylaxis beginning at 34 weeks gestation and during labor, and mother and infants were randomized to receive a two‐dose nevirapine regimen or placebo.  Infants were randomized to six months of breastfeeding with zidovudine prophylaxis (breastfeeding+zidovudine) or formula feeding with one month of infant zidovudine (formula+zidovudine). Mothers were instructed to initiate and complete weaning between five and six months of age. Breastfeeding+zidovudine (transmission rate = 9.0%) was not as effective as formula+zidovudine (transmission rate 5.6%) in preventing late postnatal HIV transmission (p = 0.04).  Breastfeeding+zidovudine and formula+zidovudine had comparable HIV‐free survival rates at 18 months (p = 0.60). Two trials of extended infant nevirapine prophylaxis demonstrated efficacy.  In the first (data combined from trials conducted in three different countries), a six‐week course of nevirapine resulted in a lower risk of HIV transmission by six weeks of age (p=0.009), but not at six months of age (p = 0.016).  In the second, mothers were counseled to breastfeed exclusively for six months and to consider weaning thereafter.  Nevirapine administration until 14 weeks of age (5.2%) or nevirapine with zidovudine until 14 weeks of age (6.4%) resulted in significantly lower risks of MTCT of HIV by 9 months of age than a control regimen of two‐dose nevirapine prophylaxis (10.6%) (p < 0.001).  HIV‐free survival was significantly better through the age of 9 months in both extended prophylaxis groups, and through the age of 15 months in the extended nevirapine group.   
Authors' conclusions
Complete avoidance of breastfeeding is efficacious in preventing MTCT of HIV, but this intervention has significant associated morbidity (e.g., diarrheal morbidity if formula is prepared without clean water).  If breastfeeding is initiated, two interventions 1). exclusive breastfeeding during the first few months of life;  and 2)  extended antiretroviral prophylaxis to the infant (nevirapine alone, or nevirapine with zidovudine) are efficacious in preventing transmission.","Transmission of HIV from mother to child through breast milk
Mother‐to‐child transmission (MTCT) of HIV is the primary way that children become infected with HIV.  Such transmission can take place when the child is still in the mother’s womb, around the time of birth, or through breastfeeding after birth.  Hundreds of thousands of children are infected this way every year, with most of them in developing countries.  Major progress has been made in preventing MTCT when the baby is still in the mother’s womb, or around the time the baby is born.  In many resource‐rich settings, mothers with HIV infection are counseled not to breastfeed their children, and there are feasible and affordable alternatives to breastfeeding.  However, in parts of the world where the vast majority of mothers with HIV infection live, complete avoidance of breastfeeding is often not feasible (for example, because of the lack of availability of clean water and of affordable replacement feeding).  Therefore, interventions to prevent transmission of HIV infection through breast milk are urgently needed.  The authors found that, in addition to complete avoidance of breastfeeding if safe and affordable, exclusive breastfeeding (where the baby receives only breast milk) for the first few months of life helps prevent transmission (as compared to breastfeeding supplemented by feeding the baby other liquids or solids).  Another intervention, giving the baby an anti‐HIV medicine (antiretroviral) while breastfeeding, decreases the risk of transmission of HIV from mother to child. Implementation of such interventions, as well as developing more and better interventions, is essential.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Preventing HIV Transmission from Mother to Baby Through Breastfeeding

## What was this review about?

Researchers looked at ways to prevent babies from getting HIV from their mothers through breast milk. While HIV can pass from mother to baby during pregnancy or birth, many babies also get infected through breastfeeding after they are born.

## What did the researchers study?

The review team searched medical databases from 1980 to 2008 for studies testing different approaches to reduce HIV transmission through breast milk. They included 6 randomized trials and 1 other study that compared different feeding methods and medications.

## What did they find?

The researchers tested several approaches:

**Formula feeding instead of breastfeeding:**
- Babies who received formula had lower rates of HIV infection at 24 months (20.5%) compared to breastfed babies (36.7%)
- However, death rates and malnutrition were similar in both groups during the first two years

**Stopping breastfeeding early:**
- Stopping breastfeeding around 4 months did not show clear benefits compared to continuing breastfeeding

**Vitamin supplements:**
- Vitamin A given to mothers did not help prevent HIV transmission and may have increased infection rates
- Other vitamin supplements also did not show benefits

**Giving babies anti-HIV medications while breastfeeding:**
- Giving babies the medication nevirapine for 6 weeks reduced HIV transmission in the first 6 weeks
- Giving babies nevirapine for 14 weeks (or nevirapine plus another medication called zidovudine) significantly reduced HIV transmission by 9 months (5-6% infection rate versus 10.6% without extended medication)
- Babies receiving extended medication also had better survival rates

**Exclusive breastfeeding:**
- Babies who received only breast milk (no other foods or liquids) had lower HIV infection rates than babies who received breast milk plus solid foods

## What does this mean?

For mothers with HIV who choose to breastfeed, two strategies can help protect babies from infection:
1. Breastfeeding only (no other foods or liquids) during the first few months
2. Giving babies anti-HIV medication (nevirapine alone or with zidovudine) for an extended period

Formula feeding can prevent HIV transmission through breast milk, but requires access to clean water and proper preparation to avoid other health problems.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What is this review about?
- It looks at ways to lower the chance that babies get HIV from breast milk after birth.

Who is included?
- Babies born to mothers with HIV.
- Studies were from 1980–2008 and included 6 randomized trials and 1 cohort study.

What did the researchers test?
1) Feeding approaches
- No breastfeeding (formula only) vs. breastfeeding.
- Stopping breastfeeding early (around 4 months) vs. continuing.
- Exclusive breastfeeding (only breast milk) vs. mixed feeding (breast milk plus other foods/liquids).

2) Medicines to the baby (antiretroviral prophylaxis)
- Nevirapine for different lengths of time.
- Zidovudine (ZDV).
- Nevirapine plus zidovudine.

3) Vitamins
- Vitamin A and other vitamin supplements.

Main findings

Feeding approaches
- Formula feeding lowered HIV transmission compared with breastfeeding: at 24 months, 36.7% with breastfeeding vs. 20.5% with formula. Death and malnutrition in the first 2 years were similar between groups overall, but formula feeding can be risky where clean water is not guaranteed.
- Stopping breastfeeding suddenly at about 4 months did not improve HIV‑free survival compared with continued breastfeeding.
- Mixed feeding raised the risk: breastfed babies who also got solids had higher HIV transmission by 6 months than those exclusively breastfed.
- In one study, deaths by 3 months were higher in formula‑fed infants than in exclusively breastfed infants.

Infant antiretroviral medicines
- Botswana trial: Babies given 6 months of breastfeeding plus infant ZDV had more HIV transmission (9.0%) than babies fed formula plus 1 month of infant ZDV (5.6%). HIV‑free survival at 18 months was similar between these two groups.
- Extended infant nevirapine worked:
  - A 6‑week course lowered transmission by 6 weeks, but not by 6 months.
  - Giving nevirapine until 14 weeks, or nevirapine plus ZDV until 14 weeks, cut transmission by 9 months (about 5–6% vs. 10.6% with only two doses). HIV‑free survival was better through 9 months in both extended groups, and through 15 months with extended nevirapine alone.

Vitamins
- Vitamin A for mothers led to more infant HIV infections. Other vitamins did not show benefit.

Safety notes
- Avoiding breastfeeding prevents HIV transmission but can cause illness if formula is mixed with unsafe water (e.g., diarrhea).
- Early weaning did not improve overall outcomes.
- Exclusive breastfeeding for the first months is safer than mixed feeding.
- Extended infant nevirapine (with or without ZDV) reduced transmission and improved HIV‑free survival in the first year.

What does this mean?
- If breastfeeding is not used, HIV transmission is prevented, but safe water and formula preparation are critical.
- If breastfeeding is used:
  - Keep it exclusive for the first months.
  - Provide extended antiretroviral prophylaxis to the infant (nevirapine alone or with zidovudine) for up to 14 weeks.
- Do not use vitamin A supplementation to prevent transmission."
31,"Background
Mitoxantrone (MX) has been shown to be moderately effective in reducing the clinical outcome measures of disease activity in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. 
This is an update of the Cochrane review ""Mitoxantrone for multiple sclerosis"" (published on Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2013, Issue 5). 
Objectives
The main objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of MX compared to a control group in relapsing‐remitting (RRMS), progressive relapsing (PRMS) and secondary progressive (SPMS) MS participants. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the Central Nervous System Group Specialised Register (23 May 2013). We also undertook handsearching and contacted trialists and pharmaceutical companies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised, double‐blinded, controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the administration of MX versus placebo or MX plus steroids treatment versus placebo plus steroids treatment were included. 
Data collection and analysis
The review authors independently selected articles for inclusion. They independently extracted clinical, safety and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, resolving disagreements by discussion. Risk of bias was evaluated to assess the quality of the studies. Treatment effect was measured using odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the binary outcomes and mean differences (MD) with 95% CI for the continuous outcomes. If heterogeneity was absent, a fixed‐effect model was used. 
Main results
Three trials were selected and 221 participants were included in the analyses. MX reduced the progression of disability at two years follow‐up (proportion of participants with six months confirmed progression of disability (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.99 and MD ‐0.36, 95% CI‐ 0.70 to ‐0.02; P = 0.04). Significant results were found regarding the reduction in annualised relapse rate (MD ‐0.85, 95% CI ‐1.47 to ‐0.23; P = 0.007), the proportion of patients free from relapses at one year (OR 7.13, 95% CI 2.06 to 24.61; P = 0.002) and two years (OR 2.82, 95% CI 1.54 to 5.19; P = 0.0008), and the number of patients with active MRI lesions at six months or one year only (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.57; P = 0.001). 
Side effects reported in the trials (amenorrhoea, nausea and vomiting, alopecia and urinary tract infections) were more frequent in treated patients than in controls, while no major adverse events have been reported. These results should be considered with caution because of the limited number of included subjects the heterogeneous characteristics of included trials in term of drug dosage, inclusion criteria and quality of included trials. Moreover, it was not possible to estimate the long‐term efficacy and safety of MX. 
Authors' conclusions
MX shows a significant but partial efficacy in reducing the risk of MS progression and the frequency of relapses in patients affected by worsening RRMS, PRMS and SPMS in the short‐term follow‐up (two years). No major neoplastic events or symptomatic cardiotoxicity related to MX have been reported; however studies with longer follow‐up (not included in this review) have raised concerns about the risk of systolic disfunction and therapy‐related acute leukaemias, occurring in about 12% and 0.8% of MX‐treated patients respectively. 
MX should be limited to treating patients with worsening RRMS and SPMS and with evidence of persistent inflammatory activity after a careful assessment of the individual patients’ risk and benefit profiles. Assessment should also consider the present availability of alternative therapies with less severe adverse events.","The use of the immunosuppressive drug mitoxantrone (MX) in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) 
This is an update of the Cochrane review ""Mitoxantrone for multiple sclerosis"" (published on Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2013, Issue 5). 
MX is considered an immune‐mediated chronic disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by multiple areas of inflammation and demyelination. Several drugs such as steroids as well as immunomodulant and immunosuppressive agents have been used to treat the disease course. Among them, MX, an immunosuppressive agent widely used for treatment of breast cancer and leukaemia, has been tested in MS individuals. Two hundred seventy‐five articles were identified by the search strategy up to May 2013. Three trials contributed to this review, comprising a total of 221 participants. Data show that MX was moderately effective in reducing the risk of MS progression and the frequency of relapses in short‐term follow‐up (up to two years) of patients affected by worsening relapsing‐remitting MS (RRMS), progressive relapsing MS (PRMS) and secondary progressive MS (SPMS). However, caution must be exercised when interpreting these results because of the heterogeneous characteristics and quality of the included trials, which are different in terms of treatment schedules and types of enrolled patients. 
The most frequent adverse effects were nausea and vomiting, alopecia, urinary tract infections and transitory leucopenia; 35% of MX‐treated female participants developed transitory amenorrhoea, and almost 15% developed a persistent amenorrhoea which was still present at the end of the follow‐up period. Data from studies with longer follow‐up and out of included trials have raised concerns about cardiotoxicity and acute leukaemias, occurring in about 12% and 0.8% of MX‐treated patients respectively.   
For these reasons, MX treatment should be limited to patients with worsening RRMS and SPMS after a careful assessment of the individual patients’ risk and benefit profiles, also considering the present availability of alternative therapies with less severe adverse events. Moreover, MX‐treated patients need to be followed‐up after the end of treatment to control the risk of serious adverse events.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Mitoxantrone for Multiple Sclerosis

## What was studied?
Researchers reviewed studies on mitoxantrone (MX), a medication used to treat multiple sclerosis (MS). They wanted to see if it helps people with MS and whether it's safe.

## Who was in the studies?
The review included 221 adults with different types of MS that were getting worse:
- Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) - where symptoms come and go
- Progressive relapsing MS (PRMS) - where the condition steadily worsens with occasional flare-ups
- Secondary progressive MS (SPMS) - where the condition gradually worsens over time

## What did the studies test?
Three studies compared people who received mitoxantrone to those who received a placebo (inactive treatment). The studies lasted up to 2 years.

## What were the main findings?
Mitoxantrone showed some benefits over 2 years:
- Slowed down disability from getting worse
- Reduced the number of MS flare-ups per year
- More people stayed flare-up free
- Fewer active disease spots on brain scans at 6 months to 1 year

Side effects were more common in people taking mitoxantrone and included:
- Missed menstrual periods
- Nausea and vomiting
- Hair loss
- Urinary tract infections

## Important safety information
While no serious problems occurred during these short studies, longer-term research (not included in this review) found more serious risks:
- Heart problems in about 12 out of 100 people treated
- A type of blood cancer in about 1 out of 100 people treated

## What does this mean?
Mitoxantrone may help slow MS progression and reduce flare-ups in the short term, but it carries serious long-term risks. Doctors should carefully weigh the benefits against the risks for each person and consider other available treatments that may be safer.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the research on mitoxantrone for multiple sclerosis

What was studied
- Researchers reviewed past clinical trials to see how well mitoxantrone (MX) works and how safe it is for people with multiple sclerosis (MS), including relapsing-remitting (RRMS), progressive-relapsing (PRMS), and secondary progressive (SPMS) MS.

Who was included
- 3 randomized, double‑blinded, controlled trials with a total of 221 adults with worsening RRMS, PRMS, or SPMS.

What treatments were compared
- MX versus placebo.
- Some trials used MX plus steroids versus placebo plus steroids.

Main goals (outcomes)
- Disability progression over up to 2 years.
- Number of MS relapses (flare-ups).
- Brain MRI activity (new or active lesions).
- Safety and side effects.

Key results (short-term, up to 2 years)
- Disability: Fewer people on MX had disability get worse over 6 months, measured at 2 years.
- Relapses: MX lowered the yearly relapse rate and increased the number of people with no relapses at 1 and 2 years.
- MRI: Fewer people on MX had active brain lesions at 6–12 months.

Safety
- Side effects were more common with MX. Reported problems included:
  - Missed periods (amenorrhea)
  - Nausea and vomiting
  - Hair loss
  - Urinary tract infections
- In the trials reviewed, no major heart or cancer events were reported. However, longer-term studies outside this review have raised concerns:
  - Heart pumping problems (systolic dysfunction) in about 12% of people on MX
  - Therapy‑related acute leukemia in about 0.8% of people on MX

Timing
- Benefits and most safety data in this review were measured over 1–2 years. Long‑term safety and effectiveness were not well measured in these trials.

Limits of the evidence
- Small number of participants.
- Differences between trials (doses, who was included, study quality).
- Long‑term risks and benefits remain uncertain.

What this means
- MX can reduce relapses and slow worsening disability in the short term for people with worsening RRMS, PRMS, or SPMS.
- Because of possible serious long‑term risks, MX use should be limited to people with ongoing inflammatory activity after careful review of personal risks and benefits, and after considering other treatments with fewer severe side effects."
32,"Background
Acupuncture is increasingly used in people with epilepsy. It remains unclear whether existing evidence is rigorous enough to support its use. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2008. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in people with epilepsy.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (June 2013) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 5), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED and other databases (from inception to June 2013). We reviewed reference lists from relevant trials. We did not impose any language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture with placebo or sham treatment, antiepileptic drugs or no treatment; or comparing acupuncture plus other treatments with the same other treatments, involving people of any age with any type of epilepsy. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.
Main results
We included 17 RCTs with 1538 participants that had a wide age range and were suffering mainly from generalized epilepsy. The duration of treatment varied from 7.5 weeks to 1 year. All included trials had a high risk of bias with short follow‐up. Compared with Chinese herbs, needle acupuncture plus Chinese herbs was not effective in achieving at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (80% in control group versus 90% in intervention group, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.31, 2 trials; assumed risk 500 per 1000, corresponding risk 485 to 655 per 1000).

Acupuncture did not have excess adverse events compared to control treatment in the included trials. 
Authors' conclusions
Available RCTs are small, heterogeneous and have high risk of bias. The current evidence does not support acupuncture for treating epilepsy.","Acupuncture for epilepsy
People with epilepsy are currently treated with antiepileptic drugs but a significant number of people continue to have seizures and many experience adverse effects to the drugs. As a result, there is increasing interest in alternative therapies and acupuncture is one of those. Seventeen randomised controlled trials with 1538 participants were included in the current systematic review (literature search conducted on 3rd June 2013). 
Compared with Chinese herbs, needle acupuncture plus Chinese herbs was not effective in achieving satisfactory seizure control (at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency). If we assumed that 500 out of 1000 patients treated with Chinese herbs alone normally achieved satisfactory seizure control, we estimated that 485 to 655 out of 1000 patients treated with needle acupuncture plus Chinese herbs would achieve satisfactory seizure control. Compared with valproate, needle acupuncture plus valproate was not effective in achieving freedom from seizures or satisfactory seizure control. If we assumed that 136 out of 1000 patients treated with valproate alone normally achieved seizure freedom, we estimated that about 97 to 177 out of 1000 patients treated with acupuncture plus valproate would achieve seizure freedom; if we assumed that 556 out of 1000 patients treated with valproate alone normally achieved satisfactory seizure control, we estimated that about 289 to 1000 out of 1000 patients treated with acupuncture plus valproate would achieve satisfactory seizure control. Compared with phenytoin, needle acupuncture was not effective in achieving satisfactory seizure control. If we assumed that 700 out of 1000 patients treated with phenytoin alone normally achieved satisfactory seizure control, we estimated that about 322 to 1000 out of 1000 patients treated with acupuncture alone would achieve satisfactory seizure control. Compared with valproate, needle acupuncture was not effective in achieving seizure freedom but it may have been better in achieving satisfactory seizure control. If we assumed that 136 out of 1000 patients treated with valproate alone normally achieved seizure freedom, we estimated that about 126 to 445 out of 1000 patients treated with acupuncture alone would achieve seizure freedom; if we assumed that 556 out of 1000 patients treated with valproate alone normally achieved satisfactory seizure control, we estimated that about 583 to 923 out of 1000 patients treated with acupuncture alone would achieve satisfactory seizure control. Compared with antiepileptic drugs, catgut implantation at acupoints plus antiepileptic drugs was not effective in achieving seizure freedom, but it may have been better in achieving satisfactory seizure control. If we assumed that 127 out of 1000 patients treated with antiepileptic drugs alone normally achieved seizure freedom, we estimated that about 118 to 309 out of 1000 patients treated with catgut implantation at acupoints plus antiepileptic drugs would achieve seizure freedom; If we assumed that 444 out of 1000 patients treated with antiepileptic drugs alone normally achieved satisfactory seizure control, we estimated that about 475 to 840 out of 1000 patients treated with catgut implantation at acupoints plus antiepileptic drugs would achieve satisfactory seizure control. Compared with valproate, catgut implantation may have been better in achieving seizure freedom but not satisfactory seizure control. If we assumed that 82 out of 1000 patients treated with valproate alone normally achieved seizure freedom, we estimated that about 132 to 406 out of 1000 patients treated with catgut implantation at acupoints alone would achieve seizure freedom; if we assumed that 721 out of 1000 patients treated with valproate alone normally achieved satisfactory seizure control, we estimated that about 677 to 1000 out of 1000 patients treated with catgut implantation at acupoints alone would achieve satisfactory seizure control.

## What was this review about?

Researchers wanted to find out if acupuncture is safe and helpful for people with epilepsy. Acupuncture is a treatment where thin needles are inserted into specific points on the body. This review looked at updated information from studies done through June 2013.

## Who was studied?

The review included 1,538 people of various ages who had epilepsy. Most participants had a type called generalized epilepsy, which affects both sides of the brain.

## What was tested?

Researchers looked at 17 studies that compared:
- Acupuncture combined with other treatments versus those same treatments alone
- Acupuncture versus epilepsy medications
- Different types of acupuncture, including needle acupuncture and a method called catgut implantation (where special thread is placed at acupuncture points)

The treatments lasted between about 2 months and 1 year.

## What were the main findings?

The studies showed mixed results:
- When acupuncture was added to standard epilepsy medications, it did not consistently reduce seizures by half or more
- Acupuncture alone did not work better than epilepsy medications at stopping seizures completely
- Some studies suggested acupuncture might improve quality of life for people with epilepsy
- Acupuncture did not cause more side effects than the comparison treatments

## What are the limitations?

All studies had problems with how they were designed and conducted. The studies were small, varied widely in their methods, and didn't follow participants for very long.

## Bottom line

Based on current evidence, researchers cannot recommend acupuncture as a proven treatment for epilepsy. Better-quality studies are needed.",0,Plano,"Plain-Language Summary: Acupuncture for Epilepsy

Purpose
- To find out if acupuncture is effective and safe for people with epilepsy.

Who was studied
- 17 randomized controlled trials with 1,538 people of different ages, mostly with generalized epilepsy.

What treatments were tested
- Needle acupuncture.
- Catgut implantation at acupoints (a small thread placed under the skin at acupuncture points).
- These were compared with:
  - No acupuncture.
  - Sham/placebo.
  - Anti-seizure medicines (like valproate or phenytoin).
  - Chinese herbal medicine.
  - Combinations of acupuncture plus medicines or herbs.

What outcomes were measured
- Seizure freedom.
- At least 50% fewer seizures.
- Quality of life (QOL) scores.
- Side effects.

How long
- Treatments lasted from about 7.5 weeks to 1 year.
- Studies had short follow-up after treatment.

Main findings
- Overall, the evidence does not support acupuncture to treat epilepsy.
- Needle acupuncture plus medicines or herbs did not clearly improve seizure control compared with medicines or herbs alone.
- Some studies showed better quality of life scores with acupuncture, but results were inconsistent.
- Catgut implantation showed some improved results in a few studies, but findings were not consistent and the studies had important limits.

Safety
- Reported side effects were similar between acupuncture and comparison groups in these trials.

Limits of the evidence
- Most studies were small, varied a lot, and had a high risk of bias.
- Follow-up was short, so long-term effects are unclear.

When the evidence was collected
- Medical databases were searched up to June 2013.

Bottom line
- Based on current studies, acupuncture is not supported as a treatment for epilepsy. More large, high-quality studies are needed."
33,"Background
Sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus disease is a common debilitating condition that predominantly affects young adults, with a profound impact on their activities of daily living. The condition is treated surgically, and in some cases the wound in the natal cleft is left open to heal by itself. Many dressings and topical agents are available to aid healing of these wounds. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of dressings and topical agents for the management of open wounds following surgical treatment for sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus in any care setting. 
Search methods
In March 2021, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and we scanned reference lists of included studies, reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. 
Selection criteria
We included parallel‐group randomised controlled trials (RCTs) only. We included studies with participants who had undergone any type of sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus disease surgery and were left with an open wound. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. 
Main results
We included 11 RCTs comprising 932 participants. Two studies compared topical negative pressure wound therapy (TNPWT) with conventional open wound healing, two studies compared platelet‐rich plasma with sterile absorbent gauze, and the other seven studies compared various dressings and topical agents. All studies were at high risk of bias in at least one domain, whilst one study was judged to be at low risk of bias in all but one domain. All studies were conducted in secondary care. Mean participant ages were between 20 and 30 years, and nearly 80% of participants were male. No studies provided data on quality of life, cost‐effectiveness, pain at first dressing change or proportion of wounds healed at 6 or 12 months, and very few adverse effects were recorded in any study. 
It is unclear whether TNPWT reduces time to wound healing compared with conventional open wound healing (comparison 1), as the certainty of evidence is very low. The two studies provided conflicting results, with one study showing benefit (mean difference (MD) −24.01 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) −35.65 to −12.37; 19 participants), whilst the other reported no difference. It is also unclear whether TNPWT has any effect on the proportion of wounds healed by 30 days (risk ratio (RR) 3.60, 95% CI 0.49 to 26.54; 19 participants, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence). Limited data were available for our secondary outcomes time to return to normal daily activities and recurrence rate; we do not know whether TNPWT has any effect on these outcomes. 
Lietofix cream may increase the proportion of wounds that heal by 30 days compared with an iodine dressing (comparison 4; RR 8.06, 95% CI 1.05 to 61.68; 205 participants, 1 study; low‐certainty evidence). The study did not provide data on time to wound healing. 
We do not know whether hydrogel dressings reduce time to wound healing compared with wound cleaning with 10% povidone iodine (comparison 5; MD −24.54 days, 95% CI −47.72 to −1.36; 31 participants, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence). The study did not provide data on the proportion of wounds healed. It is unclear whether hydrogel dressings have any effect on adverse effects as the certainty of the evidence is very low. 
Platelet‐rich plasma may reduce time to wound healing compared with sterile absorbent gauze (comparison 6; MD −19.63 days, 95% CI −34.69 to −4.57; 210 participants, 2 studies; low‐certainty evidence). No studies provided data on the proportion of wounds healed. Platelet‐rich plasma may reduce time to return to normal daily activities (MD −15.49, 95% CI −28.95 to −2.02; 210 participants, 2 studies; low‐certainty evidence). 
Zinc oxide mesh may make little or no difference to time to wound healing compared with placebo (comparison 2; median 54 days in the zinc oxide mesh group versus 62 days in the placebo mesh group; low‐certainty evidence). We do not know whether zinc oxide mesh has an effect on the proportion of wounds healed by 30 days as the certainty of the evidence is very low (RR 2.35, 95% CI 0.49 to 11.23). 
It is unclear whether gentamicin‐impregnated collagen sponge reduces time to wound healing compared with no dressing (comparison 7; MD −1.40 days, 95% CI −5.05 to 2.25; 50 participants, 1 study; very low‐certainty evidence). The study did not provide data on the proportion of wounds healed. 
Dialkylcarbamoyl chloride (DACC)‐coated dressings may make little or no difference to time to wound healing compared with alginate dressings (comparison 8; median 69 (95% CI 62 to 72) days in the DACC group versus 71 (95% CI 69 to 85) days in the alginate group; 1 study, 246 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
One study compared a polyurethane foam hydrophilic dressing with an alginate dressing (comparison 3) whilst another study compared a hydrocolloid dressing with an iodine dressing (comparison 9). It is unclear whether either intervention has any effect on time to wound healing as the certainty of evidence is very low. 
Authors' conclusions
At present, the evidence that any of the dressings or topical agents contained in this review have a benefit on time to wound healing, the proportion of wounds that heal at a specific time point or on any of the secondary outcomes of our review ranges from low certainty to very low certainty. There is low‐certainty evidence on the benefit on wound healing of platelet‐rich plasma from two studies and of Lietofix cream and hydrogel dressings from single studies. Further studies are required to investigate these interventions further.","How effective are dressings and topical agents in the management of wounds after surgical treatment for pilonidal sinus of the buttocks? 
Key messages 
‐ Platelet‐rich plasma (part of the participant's own blood that promotes tissue regeneration) may reduce time to wound healing compared with sterile gauze‐ Lietofix skin repair cream may help wounds to heal by 30 days compared with a dressing with iodine (which helps to reduce bacteria in the wound)‐ It is not clear whether hydrogel dressings (designed to keep the wound moist) reduce time to wound healing compared with wound cleaning with iodine 
What is pilonidal sinus disease of the buttocks? 
Pilonidal sinus disease of the buttocks is a common painful condition that mainly affects young adults. 
It occurs in the natal cleft (the groove between the buttocks). It begins as infected or inflamed hair follicles. A vacuum effect, created by the motion of the buttocks, may draw more hairs down into the inflamed area. Symptoms can be very painful and sometimes last for a long time. 
How is pilonidal sinus of the buttocks treated? 
The condition is often treated surgically, by cutting out the inflamed area containing the hair and debris, and in some cases the wounds are not closed by stitches but left open to heal naturally. A lot of dressings and topical agents (creams or lotions) are available to help these wounds heal. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to see which dressings and topical agents are better for treating open wounds after surgical treatment for pilonidal sinus of the buttocks.   
For each intervention we looked at:
‐ how long it took wounds to heal;‐ the number of wounds healed after 30 days, 6 months and 1 year;‐ whether the wounds came back;‐ how long it took people who had been treated to return to normal daily activities;‐ quality of life;‐ value for money;‐ pain during the first dressing change;‐ harmful effects (for example surgical site infection or allergic reaction) after treatment. 
What did we do? 
We included participants of any age and either sex who had been treated in any care setting. We searched for studies where: 
‐ participants had been treated for pilonidal sinus disease of the buttocks and were left with an open wound;‐ different dressings and topical agents were compared to see how effective they were for helping wounds to heal.  
What did we find? 
We included 11 studies with a combined total of 932 participants. Two studies compared topical negative pressure wound therapy (which applies controlled suction to the surface of the wound) with simple wound dressings. Two studies compared platelet‐rich plasma with sterile absorbent gauze. The other seven studies compared various dressings and topical agents. All the studies took place in hospitals. 
‐ No studies provided data on quality of life, value for money or pain at the first dressing change.‐ We do not know if topical negative pressure wound therapy helps wounds to heal faster than simple wound dressings.‐ Lietofix skin repair cream may help wounds to heal by 30 days.‐ We do not know if hydrogel dressings help wounds to heal faster or protect better against surgical site infection compared with wound cleaning with 10% povidone iodine.‐ Platelet‐rich plasma may reduce the time to wound healing compared with sterile absorbent gauze. ‐ Compared with placebo mesh, mesh with zinc oxide (which is thought to have healing properties) may have little or no effect on whether wounds heal by 30 days, and it is unclear if it reduces the time to wound healing.‐ We do not know if collagen sponge soaked in antibiotic has any effect on the time to wound healing compared with no dressing.‐ Dressings coated with dialkylcarbamoyl chloride (a substance that bacteria sticks to) may make little to no difference to wound healing time compared with alginate dressings (derived from seaweed).  
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We are not very confident in the evidence because there were only one or two studies in each comparison and most of the studies were very small. It is also possible that people in the studies were aware of what treatment they were getting. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence in this review is up to date to March 2021.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Treating Wounds After Pilonidal Sinus Surgery

## What was studied?

Researchers looked at different types of dressings and creams used to help heal wounds after surgery for pilonidal sinus disease. This is a painful condition that occurs in the area between the buttocks (tailbone area) and mainly affects young adults. After surgery, the wound is sometimes left open to heal on its own, which can take time.

## Who was in these studies?

The review included 11 studies with 932 people total. Most participants (about 80%) were men, and the average age was between 20 and 30 years old. All studies took place in hospitals.

## What treatments were compared?

Researchers compared many different wound care approaches, including:
- Negative pressure wound therapy (a device that uses suction) versus standard care
- Platelet-rich plasma (a treatment using a person's own blood) versus gauze dressings
- Various types of dressings and creams, including foam dressings, hydrogel, iodine, and antibiotic-containing materials

## What did they find?

The evidence was generally weak, making it hard to draw firm conclusions. However:

- **Platelet-rich plasma** may help wounds heal about 20 days faster than standard gauze dressings and may help people return to normal activities sooner
- **Lietofix cream** may help more wounds heal within 30 days compared to iodine dressings
- **Hydrogel dressings** may speed up healing compared to iodine cleaning
- Most other treatments showed unclear or little difference in healing time

The studies did not measure quality of life, cost, or long-term healing (6-12 months). Very few side effects were reported.

## What does this mean?

More research is needed to determine which dressings or treatments work best for healing these wounds. The current evidence is not strong enough to recommend one treatment over another with confidence.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What is this about
- After surgery for pilonidal sinus (a skin problem near the tailbone), some wounds are left open to heal. This review looked at which dressings or topical treatments help these open wounds heal faster and safer.

Who was studied
- 11 randomized studies, 932 people
- Most were young adults (about 20–30 years old); about 80% were male
- All care took place in hospitals or surgical clinics

What treatments were tested
- Negative pressure wound therapy (a vacuum device) vs usual open wound care
- Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) vs sterile gauze
- Zinc oxide mesh vs placebo mesh
- Lietofix cream vs iodine dressing
- Hydrogel dressing vs cleaning with 10% povidone iodine
- Gentamicin-collagen sponge vs no dressing
- DACC-coated dressing vs alginate dressing
- Polyurethane foam vs alginate
- Hydrocolloid dressing vs iodine

Main outcomes checked
- Time to wound healing
- How many wounds healed by a set time (for example, 30 days)
- Return to normal daily activities
- Recurrence of the problem
- Side effects
- Note: No studies reported quality of life, cost, pain at first dressing change, or how many wounds healed at 6 or 12 months.

What the evidence shows
- Overall certainty of the evidence was low to very low. This means results may change with better studies.
- PRP: may shorten healing by about 20 days and may help people return to normal activities about 15 days sooner (low certainty; 2 studies, 210 people).
- Lietofix cream: may increase the number of wounds healed by 30 days compared with iodine (low certainty; 1 study, 205 people).
- Hydrogel dressing: may shorten healing by about 25 days vs iodine cleaning (very low certainty; 1 small study).
- Negative pressure therapy: results were mixed; it’s unclear if it helps heal faster or improves healing by 30 days (very low certainty; 2 small studies).
- Zinc oxide mesh: likely little or no difference in healing time vs placebo (median 54 vs 62 days; low certainty).
- DACC vs alginate: little or no difference in healing time (median 69 vs 71 days; low certainty).
- Gentamicin sponge, polyurethane foam vs alginate, and hydrocolloid vs iodine: effects on healing are unclear (very low certainty).

Safety
- Very few side effects were reported in any study.

Bottom line
- There is no strong, high-certainty evidence that any dressing or topical agent clearly speeds healing for these open wounds.
- PRP, Lietofix cream, and hydrogel dressings showed possible benefits, but the evidence is limited and uncertain.
- Better, larger studies are needed to know which option works best and is safest."
34,"Background
Faecal incontinence (FI) and constipation are both socially‐embarrassing and physically‐disabling conditions that impair quality of life. For both, surgery may be required in a minority of people when more conservative measures fail. However, the invasiveness and irreversible nature of direct surgery on bowel and sphincter muscles, poor long‐term outcomes and well‐established compIications makes such procedures unappealing for these benign conditions. A less‐invasive surgical option to treat faecal incontinence and constipation is direct, low‐voltage stimulation of the sacral nerve roots, termed sacral nerve stimulation (SNS). SNS has become the first line surgical treatment for FI in people failing conservative therapies. Its value in the treatment of constipation is less clear. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of sacral nerve stimulation using implanted electrodes for the treatment of faecal incontinence and constipation in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In‐Process, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) ICTRP and handsearched journals and conference proceedings (searched 5 February 2015), EMBASE (1 January 1947 to 2015 Week 5), and the reference lists of retrieved relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
All randomised or quasi‐randomised trials assessing the effects of SNS for faecal incontinence or constipation in adults. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the search results, assessed the methodological quality of the included trials, and undertook data extraction. 
Main results
Six crossover trials and two parallel group trials were included.
Six trials assessed the effects of SNS for FI. In the parallel group trial conducted by Tjandra, 53 participants with severe FI in the SNS group experienced fewer episodes of faecal incontinence compared to the control group who received optimal medical therapy (mean difference (MD) −5.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) −9.15 to −1.25 at 3 months; MD −6.30, 95% CI −10.34 to −2.26 at 12 months). Adverse events were reported in a proportion of participants: pain at implant site (6%), seroma (2%) and excessive tingling in the vaginal region (9%). 
In the parallel group trial carried out by Thin, 15 participants with FI in the SNS group experienced fewer episodes of FI compared with the percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) group (MD −3.00, 95% CI −6.61 to 0.61 at 3 months; MD −3.20, 95% CI −7.14 to 0.74 at 12 months). Adverse events were reported in three participants: mild ipsilateral leg pain during temporary testing (n = 1); and stimulator‐site pain following insertion of neurostimulator (n = 2). 
In the crossover trial by Leroi 7 of 34 recruited participants were excluded from the crossover due mainly to complications or immediate device failure. Twenty‐four of the remaining 27 participants while still blinded chose the period of stimulation they had preferred. Outcomes were reported separately for 19 participants who preferred the 'on' and five who preferred the 'off' period. For the group of 19, the median (range) episodes of faecal incontinence per week fell from 1.7 (0 to 9) during the 'off' period to 0.7 (0 to 5) during the 'on' period; for the group of five, however, the median (range) rose from 1.7 (0 to 11) during the 'off' period compared with 3.7 (0 to 11) during the 'on' period. Four of 27 participants experienced an adverse event resulting in removal of the stimulator. 
In the crossover trial by Sørensen and colleagues, participants did not experience any FI episodes in either the one‐week ‘on’ or ‘off’ periods. 
In the crossover trial by Vaizey, participants reported an average of six, and one, episodes of faecal incontinence per week during the 'off' and 'on' periods respectively in two participants with FI. Neither study reported adverse events. 
In the crossover trial by Kahlke, 14 participants with FI experienced significantly lower episodes of FI per week during the stimulator 'on' (1 (SD, 1.7)) compared with the 'off' period (8.4 (SD, 8.7)). Adverse events reported include: haematoma formation (n = 3); misplacement of tined lead (1); and pain at stimulator site (n = 1). 
Two trials assessed SNS for constipation. In the Kenefick trial, the two participants experienced an average of two bowel movements per week during the 'off' crossover period, compared with five during the 'on' period. Abdominal pain and bloating occurred 79% of the time during the 'off' period compared with 33% during the 'on' period. No adverse events occurred. In contrast, in the trial by Dinning with 59 participants, SNS did not improve frequency of bowel movements and 73 adverse events were reported, which included pain at site of the implanted pulse generator (32), wound infection (12), and urological (17) events. 
Authors' conclusions
The limited evidence from the included trials suggests that SNS can improve continence in a proportion of patients with faecal incontinence. However, SNS did not improve symptoms in patients with constipation. In addition, adverse events occurred in some patients where these were reported. Rigorous high quality randomised trials are needed to allow the effects of SNS for these conditions to be assessed with more certainty.","Sacral nerve stimulation for treating faecal incontinence and constipation in adults
Importance of the review/Background: Faecal incontinence occurs when a person passes stools without the usual control. Constipation is harder to define but generally describes a situation in which a person feels that their bowel opening is unsatisfactory (usually a combination of difficulty or infrequency of passing stools). Both conditions can severely affect people's quality of life. There are many non‐surgical treatments for both conditions but occasionally surgery is required when other options fail. Sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) is a relatively new treatment for these conditions. It involves implanting a battery‐powered stimulator unit in the buttock. This is connected to electrodes which rest on the nerves in the lower spine. The stimulator then continuously sends impulses to the nerves and muscles that control the bowel and anus. Initially, a temporary electrode lead is connected to a portable battery unit outside the body. If symptoms are improved enough, this is replaced by the implanted battery. 
Main findings: This review evaluated the published evidence for the use of SNS for patients with faecal incontinence or constipation from six trials of SNS for faecal incontinence (219 participants) and two trials of SNS for constipation (61 participants). Two of the faecal incontinence trials had a 'parallel group design', which means that one group of participants received SNS and the other control group did not receive SNS throughout the trial. The remaining six trials had a 'crossover design', in which the participants experienced equal periods with stimulation 'off' then 'on', or vice versa. The level of stimulation was such that participants could not tell whether the system was 'on' or 'off'. 
SNS for faecal incontinence: In the two 'parallel group' trials, 53 and 15 participants with faecal incontinence who were in the SNS group experienced fewer episodes of faecal incontinence compared to the control group at 3 and 12 months. In the first crossover trial, 24 participants who completed the trial chose the period of stimulation they had preferred while still unaware whether this was 'on' or 'off'. Nineteen participants who preferred the 'on' period experienced 59% fewer episodes of FI per week during the 'on' period, and 5 participants who preferred the 'off' period experienced 118% more episodes of FI per week. In the second crossover trial, the participants did not experience episodes of FI during either the 'on' or the 'off' periods. In the third trial, participants experienced 83% fewer episodes of faecal incontinence during the 'on' compared with the 'off' period. In the fourth crossover trial participants experienced 88% fewer episodes of faecal incontinence during the 'on' period compared with the 'off' period. 
SNS for faecal incontinence—adverse effects: Not all trials reported adverse effects after SNS. The two 'parallel group' trials reported only minor complications, in 10% of SNS participants in the first study, and in 3 participants in the second study. In the first crossover study 7 out of 34 participants were excluded from crossover due mainly to complications. Four out of 27 participants with an implanted system in this study experienced a problem that led to the device being removed. The participants in the fourth crossover trial experienced some complications with the SNS implanted electrode such as pain (one person), misplacement of the tined lead (one person) and haematoma (swelling containing blood) (three people). 
SNS for constipation: In one trial assessing SNS for constipation, two participants reported an increase of 150% in the frequency of passing stools per week, and time with abdominal pain and swelling went down from 79% during the 'off' period to 33% during the 'on' period. However, in the much larger second trial assessing SNS for constipation, in 59 participants SNS did not improve frequency of bowel movements. 
Limitations of the review: The limited evidence suggests that SNS can improve continence in some people with faecal incontinence. SNS did not improve symptoms in patients with constipation. Larger, good‐quality trials are needed to provide more reliable evidence on the effectiveness of SNS for these two conditions.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Sacral Nerve Stimulation for Bowel Control Problems

## What was studied?

Researchers looked at whether a treatment called sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) could help adults with two bowel control problems:
- **Faecal incontinence** – when people cannot control their bowel movements
- **Constipation** – when people have difficulty passing stools

SNS uses a small device implanted under the skin that sends gentle electrical signals to nerves near the tailbone. This treatment is less invasive than traditional surgery on the bowel muscles.

## What did researchers do?

They reviewed 8 studies involving adults with bowel control problems. Six studies tested SNS for faecal incontinence, and two tested it for constipation.

## What did they find?

**For faecal incontinence:**
- People who received SNS had fewer episodes of accidental bowel movements compared to those who didn't get the treatment
- In one study, participants had about 5-6 fewer episodes per week after 3-12 months
- Most participants preferred having the device turned ""on"" rather than ""off""

**For constipation:**
- Results were mixed. One small study showed some improvement, but a larger study found no benefit

**Side effects:**
Some people experienced problems including:
- Pain where the device was placed
- Tingling sensations
- Infection at the surgery site
- Device problems requiring removal in some cases

## What does this mean?

SNS may help some people with faecal incontinence have better bowel control. However, there isn't enough evidence to show it helps with constipation. More high-quality studies are needed to better understand who benefits most from this treatment and what risks are involved.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the research

What was studied
- Researchers looked at whether sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) helps adults with bowel control problems: fecal incontinence (leakage) or constipation.
- SNS uses a small implanted device that sends mild electrical signals to nerves in the lower back.

Who was included
- Adults with fecal incontinence or constipation.
- The review included 8 randomized trials (6 crossover and 2 parallel-group).
- Searches covered studies available up to February 5, 2015.

What treatments were compared
- SNS with implanted electrodes versus:
  - Usual medical care
  - Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS)
  - The same SNS device switched “off” (placebo condition)

Main outcomes measured
- For fecal incontinence: number of leakage episodes per week.
- For constipation: number of bowel movements per week and related symptoms (pain, bloating).
- Safety: pain, infection, device problems, and other side effects.
- Follow-up times included short crossover periods and 3 and 12 months in two trials.

Key results

Fecal incontinence
- Compared with optimal medical therapy, SNS reduced leakage episodes at 3 months and 12 months in one parallel-group trial. Example: about 5–6 fewer episodes per week on average.
- Compared with PTNS, SNS showed fewer leakage episodes at 3 and 12 months in one small trial, but results were not clearly confirmed due to small numbers.
- In several crossover trials, most people had fewer leakage episodes when the device was “on” versus “off,” though not everyone improved.

Constipation
- One very small trial (2 people) showed more bowel movements and less pain/bloating with SNS “on.”
- A larger trial (59 people) found no improvement in bowel movement frequency with SNS.

Safety
- Side effects happened in some patients. Reported problems included:
  - Pain at the implant site or leg pain during testing
  - Seroma (fluid under the skin)
  - Tingling in the vaginal area
  - Hematoma (bruising/bleeding)
  - Lead misplacement
  - Wound infection
  - Urinary issues
- Example rates where reported: pain at implant site about 6% in one trial; in the constipation trial with 59 people, 73 adverse events were recorded (most often pain at the pulse generator site, infections, and urinary events).
- Some people needed device removal due to complications in one crossover study.

What this means
- SNS can help reduce fecal leakage for some adults when other treatments have not worked.
- SNS did not improve constipation in the larger, better-quality study.
- Side effects are possible and sometimes require more treatment.

Evidence quality and next steps
- The number of trials and participants was limited, and some studies were small.
- More high-quality, longer-term trials are needed to know who benefits most and to better understand risks."
35,"Background
The optimal glycaemic control target in pregnant women with pre‐existing diabetes is unclear, although there is a clear link between high glucose concentrations and adverse birth outcomes. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of different intensities of glycaemic control in pregnant women with pre‐existing type 1 or type 2 diabetes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 January 2016) and planned to search reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials comparing different glycaemic control targets in pregnant women with pre‐existing diabetes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, conducted data extraction, assessed risk of bias and checked for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included three trials, all in women with type 1 diabetes (223 women and babies). All three trials were at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding, unclear methods of randomisation and selective reporting of outcomes. Two trials compared very tight (3.33 to 5.0 mmol/L fasting blood glucose (FBG)) with tight‐moderate (4.45 to 6.38 mmol/L) glycaemic control targets, with one trial of 22 babies reporting no perinatal deaths orserious perinatal morbidity (evidence graded low for both outcomes). In the same trial, there were two congenital anomalies in the very tight, and none in the tight‐moderate group, with no significant differences in caesarean section between groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 1.73; evidence graded very low). In these two trials, glycaemic control was not significantly different between the very tight and tight‐moderate groups by the third trimester, although one trial of 22 women found significantly less maternal hypoglycaemia in the tight‐moderate group. 
In a trial of 60 women and babies comparing tight (≤ 5.6 mmol/L FBG); moderate (5.6 to 6.7 mmol/L); and loose (6.7 to 8.9 mmol/L) glycaemic control targets, there were two neonatal deaths in the loose and none in the tight or moderate groups (evidence graded very low). There were significantly fewer women with pre‐eclampsia (evidence graded low), fewer caesarean sections (evidence graded low) and fewer babies with birthweights greater than 90th centile (evidence graded low) in the combined tight‐moderate compared with the loose group. 
The quality of the evidence was graded low or very low for important outcomes, because of design limitations to the studies, the small numbers of women included, and wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect. Many of the important outcomes were not reported in these studies. 
Authors' conclusions
In a very limited body of evidence, few differences in outcomes were seen between very tight and tight‐moderate glycaemic control targets in pregnant women with pre‐existing type 1 diabetes, including actual glycaemic control achieved. There is evidence of harm (increased pre‐eclampsia, caesareans and birthweights greater than 90th centile) for 'loose' control (FBG above 7 mmol/L). Future trials comparing interventions, rather than glycaemic control targets, may be more feasible. Trials in pregnant women with pre‐existing type 2 diabetes are required.","What is the best blood glucose target for pregnant women who have type 1 or type 2 diabetes before becoming pregnant? 
What is the issue? 
Pregnant women with diabetes need to keep their blood glucose levels stable, using diet, exercise, insulin or other drugs, clinic visits and monitoring. This review looked at the best blood glucose target for pregnant women with diabetes. 
Why is this important? 
Women who have either type 1 or type 2 diabetes before they become pregnant have an increased risk of pregnancy loss, large babies, and babies dying. When a pregnant woman has high blood glucose and insulin resistance this can affect the development of the baby's heart and other organs. Babies born to diabetic mothers may also have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes. 
Monitoring a diabetic pregnant woman's blood glucose level and staying within a target range may help to reduce these risks. We wanted to find out what the best blood glucose target is for pregnant women who had type 1 or type 2 diabetes before becoming pregnant. 
What evidence did we find? 
We found three small trials (in total 223 pregnant women with type 1 diabetes) looking at different blood glucose targets: very tight, tight, moderate, and loose. The quality of the studies and therefore the strength of the evidence was very low or low, so future research may change the results. 
There were very few differences between very tight and tight‐moderate blood glucose targets in two trials, although there were more cases of low blood glucose (hypoglycaemia) and longer hospital stays for women who had very tight blood glucose control. 
A single trial compared tight, moderate, and loose blood glucose targets. In the loose target group, more women had pre‐eclampsia, and there were more caesareans and large babies. There were few differences between the tight and moderate groups, although more women in the tight control group had low blood glucose in the first half of pregnancy. 
What does this mean? 
The evidence does not show much difference between moderate, tight and very tight blood glucose targets, although a loose blood glucose target may be worse for mothers and babies. However, the studies were small and the evidence is weak, so we do not yet know the best blood glucose target for women who have diabetes before becoming pregnant.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Blood Sugar Control Targets During Pregnancy for Women with Diabetes

## What was this study about?

Researchers reviewed studies to find out what blood sugar (glucose) levels work best for pregnant women who already have diabetes (either type 1 or type 2) before getting pregnant. High blood sugar during pregnancy can cause problems for both mothers and babies, but it's unclear exactly what target levels are safest.

## What did the researchers look for?

They searched for studies that compared different blood sugar targets in pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes. They wanted to see which targets led to better outcomes for mothers and babies.

## What did they find?

The researchers found only 3 small studies involving 223 women and babies. All three studies included only women with type 1 diabetes. No studies were found for women with type 2 diabetes.

**Key findings:**
- Two studies compared very strict blood sugar targets with moderately strict targets. By late pregnancy, there wasn't much difference in actual blood sugar levels between the two groups.
- One study found that keeping blood sugar levels too loose (higher targets) led to more problems, including:
  - More high blood pressure during pregnancy
  - More cesarean deliveries
  - More babies born larger than normal

## What does this mean?

The evidence is limited and comes from small studies with some quality concerns. Based on available information, keeping blood sugar levels too high during pregnancy appears harmful. However, there isn't enough evidence to say exactly what the best target should be. More research is needed, especially for women with type 2 diabetes.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What is this study about?
- Researchers looked at how tight blood sugar targets should be during pregnancy for people who already have diabetes.
- They compared very tight, tight-to-moderate, and loose blood sugar targets to see how they affect parent and baby health.

Who was studied?
- Pregnant people with pre‑existing diabetes.
- The trials that were found included only type 1 diabetes (223 participants and their babies). No trials in type 2 were included.

What did the studies compare?
- Very tight fasting blood sugar: about 3.3–5.0 mmol/L
- Tight–moderate: about 4.5–6.4 mmol/L
- Loose: about 6.7–8.9 mmol/L (some definitions used ≥7.0 mmol/L)

Main outcomes they looked at
- Deaths around birth and serious illness in newborns
- Pre‑eclampsia
- Cesarean birth
- Baby’s birthweight (large for dates, over the 90th percentile)
- Low blood sugar in the pregnant person
- Birth defects
- How well blood sugar was actually controlled by the third trimester

Key findings
- Very tight vs tight–moderate targets: Few clear differences in outcomes. By the third trimester, actual blood sugar levels were similar between groups. One small trial found fewer low blood sugar episodes in the tight–moderate group.
- Loose targets: Linked to worse outcomes. In one trial, there were 2 newborn deaths in the loose group and none in the tight or moderate groups. Tight–moderate targets had fewer cases of pre‑eclampsia, fewer cesareans, and fewer very large babies compared with loose targets.

Safety notes
- Very tight control may raise the chance of low blood sugar in the pregnant person.
- Loose control (fasting above about 7 mmol/L) was linked to harms for parent and baby.

Quality of the evidence
- Low to very low. The trials were small, methods were not always clear, and many important outcomes were not reported. Results should be interpreted with caution.

Timing
- Searches were done up to January 31, 2016.
- Three trials were included, all in type 1 diabetes.

What’s still needed
- Better, larger trials.
- Trials that include people with type 2 diabetes.
- Studies comparing specific treatments, not just target numbers."
36,"Background
Cervical artery dissection (CeAD) is a pathological bleed or tear, or both, in the wall of the carotid or vertebral arteries as they course through the neck, and is a leading cause of stroke in young people. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of surgical and radiological interventions versus best medical treatment alone for treating symptomatic cervical artery dissection. 
Search methods
We performed comprehensive searches of the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched March 2020), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), 2020, Issue 4, in the Cochrane Library (searched March 2020), MEDLINE (1946 to March 2020) and Embase (1974 to March 2020). We searched relevant ongoing trials and research registers (searched March 2020), checked references in all relevant papers for additional eligible studies, and contacted authors and researchers in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) of either surgical or endovascular intervention for the management of symptomatic CeAD were eligible for inclusion. Only studies with anticoagulants or antiplatelet treatment as the control group were included. Two review authors planned to independently extract data. 
Data collection and analysis
Primary outcomes were ipsilateral stroke and disability. Secondary outcomes were death, any stroke, or transient ischaemic attack, residual stenosis (> 50%), recurrence of cervical dissection, expanding pseudoaneurysm, or major bleeding. We analysed the studies according to the first choice of treatment. We planned to assess for risk of bias and apply GRADE criteria for any included studies. 
Main results
We did not find any completed RCTs or CCTs undertaken in this area of research.
Authors' conclusions
No RCTs or CCTs compared either surgery or endovascular therapy with control. Thus, there is no available evidence to support their use for the treatment of extracranial cervical artery dissection in addition to antithrombotic therapy in people who continue to have neurological symptoms when treated with antithrombotic therapy alone.","Surgical and radiological interventions for treating symptomatic extracranial cervical artery dissection 
Review question 
This review was conducted to establish whether a surgical operation or a keyhole endovascular treatment, such placement of stent in addition to blood‐thinning medication would improve outcomes in people with cervical artery dissection for whom treatment with blood‐thinning medication alone does not improve persistent or worsening symptoms of stroke. The outcomes which we wished to assess are permanent brain damage and long‐term disability from stroke. 
Background 
Cervical artery dissection is a tear in the wall of the blood vessels in the neck that supply blood to the brain. There are two of each artery, a carotid artery on the right and one on the left of the neck, and a vertebral artery on the right and one on the left of the neck. When tears occur in the walls of these arteries, clots can form inside the artery. These clots can then break away from the artery wall and travel to the brain to cause a stroke. The standard way of treating tears in these arteries is to give patients medications which thin the blood and reduce clot formation. However, sometimes patients continue to get symptoms of stroke, and their condition worsens despite being on maximum dose medication. 
Search date 
We performed a thorough and comprehensive review of the literature to look for clinical trials which could help us to answer the review question. The evidence is current to March 2020. 
Study characteristics 
We looked for trials which were conducted in an objective way and designed specifically to compare either surgery or radiological intervention to medical therapy alone. 
Key results 
We did not find any trials that matched the criteria of the review. Therefore, there is no available objective evidence that an operation or a radiological procedure can benefit patients who continue to have symptoms of stroke despite medical therapy. We did find a number of reports from experienced groups of doctors that operations and radiological interventions were safe in their hands. However, we found no evidence that this could be applicable to other hospitals and clinical teams. Therefore, large scale, well‐conducted studies are required to answer the review question. 
Certainty of the evidence 
There is no good quality evidence to guide clinicians on the best treatment for people with cervical artery dissection who remain symptomatic despite optimal medical therapy.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Treating Tears in Neck Arteries That Can Cause Stroke

## What was this review about?

Researchers looked for studies on how to treat tears or bleeding in the major arteries in the neck (called cervical artery dissection). These tears can lead to strokes, especially in younger adults. The review wanted to compare two treatment approaches:
- Surgery or procedures using tubes and wires inserted into blood vessels (called endovascular procedures)
- Medications alone that prevent blood clots (like blood thinners)

## What did the researchers find?

The researchers searched medical databases through March 2020 for high-quality studies comparing these treatments. They looked for studies where patients were randomly assigned to different treatment groups.

**They found no completed studies that met their criteria.**

## What does this mean?

There is currently no solid research evidence to show whether surgery or endovascular procedures work better than medication alone for treating these neck artery tears. Without this evidence, doctors cannot be certain which treatment approach is best for patients who continue having symptoms despite taking blood clot prevention medications.

More research is needed to determine the most effective treatment for people with this condition.

## Who was this review for?

This review focused on people with symptomatic cervical artery dissection—meaning they have tears in their neck arteries that are causing problems like stroke symptoms.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What is this about?
- Cervical artery dissection (CeAD) is a tear or bleed in one of the neck arteries (carotid or vertebral). It can lead to stroke, especially in younger adults.

Goal
- To find out if surgery or radiology procedures (endovascular treatments like stents) work better than the best medicines alone for people with symptoms from CeAD.

Who was the focus?
- People with symptomatic CeAD outside the skull (extracranial).

What treatments were compared?
- Surgery or endovascular procedures
- Versus standard medical therapy: antithrombotic medicines (anticoagulants or antiplatelets)

What outcomes were of interest?
Primary
- Stroke on the same side as the dissection
- Disability

Secondary
- Death
- Any stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)
- Ongoing narrowing of the artery (>50% stenosis)
- Recurrence of dissection
- Growing pseudoaneurysm
- Major bleeding

How was the evidence gathered?
- Researchers searched major medical databases and trial registers up to March 2020 (MEDLINE from 1946, Embase from 1974, Cochrane databases). They also checked references and contacted experts.

What did they find?
- No completed randomized or controlled clinical trials compared surgery or endovascular treatment with medical therapy for symptomatic extracranial CeAD.

Safety
- The review planned to track major bleeding and other harms, but no eligible trials were found to assess these.

What does this mean?
- There is no trial evidence showing that adding surgery or endovascular procedures to antithrombotic medicines helps people with symptomatic extracranial CeAD.
- Current evidence does not support using these procedures in addition to standard antithrombotic therapy based on randomized or controlled trials."
37,"Background
This is an update of the Cochrane review ""Pharmacologic treatment for memory disorder in multiple sclerosis"" (first published in The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 10). 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic immune‐mediated, inflammatory, demyelinating, neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) and can cause both neurological and neuropsychological disability. Both demyelination and axonal and neuronal loss are believed to contribute to MS‐related cognitive impairment. Memory disorder is one of the most frequent cognitive dysfunctions and presents a considerable burden to people with MS and to society due to the negative impact on function. A number of pharmacological agents have been evaluated in many existing randomised controlled trials for their efficacy on memory disorder in people with MS but the results were not consistent. 
Objectives
To assess the absolute and comparative efficacy, tolerability and safety of pharmacological treatments for memory disorder in adults with MS. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the Central Nervous System Group Trials Register (24 July 2013), PsycINFO (January 1980 to 26 June 2013) and CBMdisc (1978 to 24 June 2013), and checked reference lists of identified articles, searched some relevant journals manually, registers of clinical trials and published abstracts of conference proceedings. 
Selection criteria
All double‐blind, randomised controlled parallel trials on pharmacological treatment versus placebo or one or more pharmacological treatments in adults with MS who had at least mild memory impairment (at 0.5 standard deviations below age‐ and sex‐based normative data on a validated memory scale). We placed no restrictions regarding dose, route of administration and frequency; however, we only included trials with an administration duration of 12 weeks or greater. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We discussed disagreements and resolved them by consensus among review authors. We contacted principal investigators of included studies for additional data or confirmation. 
Main results
We included seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 625 people mostly with relapsing‐remitting, secondary‐progressive and primary‐progressive MS, evaluating the absolute efficacy of donepezil, ginkgo biloba, memantine and rivastigmine versus placebo in improving memory performance with diverse assessment scales. Overall, clinical and methodological heterogeneities existed across these studies. Moreover, most of them had methodological limitations on non‐specific selections of targeted sample, non‐matched variables at baseline or incomplete outcome data (high attrition bias). Only the two studies on donepezil had clinical and methodological homogeneity and relatively low risks for bias. One RCT evaluating estriol versus placebo is currently ongoing. 
We could not carry out a meta‐analysis due to the heterogeneities across studies and the high attrition bias. A subgroup analysis for donepezil versus placebo showed no treatment effects on total recall on the Selective Reminding Test (mean difference (MD) 1.68; 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐2.21 to 5.58), total correct scores on the 10/36 Spatial Recall Test (MD ‐0.93; 95% CI ‐3.18 to 1.32), the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (MD ‐1.27; 95% CI ‐3.15 to 0.61) and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (2+3 sec) (MD 2.23; 95% CI ‐1.87 to 6.33). Concerning safety, the main adverse events were: diarrhoea (risk ratio (RR) 3.88; 95% CI 1.66 to 9.05), nausea (RR 1.71; 95% CI 0.93 to 3.18) and abnormal dreams (RR 2.91; 95% CI 1.38 to 6.14). However, the results in both studies were subjected to a serious imprecision resulting from the small sample sizes and the low power of test (lower than 80%), which contributed to a moderate quality of the evidence. No serious adverse events were attributed to the treatments in all experimental groups. 
Authors' conclusions
We found no convincing evidence to support the efficacy of pharmacological symptomatic treatment for MS‐associated memory disorder because most of available RCTs had a limited quality. Whether pharmacological treatment is effective for memory disorder in patients with MS remains inconclusive. However, there is moderate‐quality evidence that donepezil 10 mg daily was not effective in improving memory in MS patients with mild memory impairment, but had a good tolerability. Adverse events such as nausea, diarrhoea and abnormal dreams were not frequent but were associated with treatment. Ginkgo biloba, memantine and rivastigmine were safe and well tolerated and no serious adverse effects were reported. Future large‐scale RCTs with higher methodological quality are needed.","Pharmacological agents as symptomatic treatment for memory disorder in people with multiple sclerosis 
This is an update of the Cochrane review ""Pharmacologic treatment for memory disorder in multiple sclerosis"" (first published in The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 10). 
Background 
Memory disorder is one of the most frequent cognitive impairments (where people have difficulty with thinking, learning and memory) in people with multiple sclerosis (MS), affecting an estimated 40% to 60% of people and represents a considerable burden to those people. Data on the use of agents such as donepezil, ginkgo biloba, memantine and rivastigmine, either by mouth (orally) and by other means (parenterally), seemed to provide promising results. The authors of this review tried to assess the extent by which these treatments produced beneficial results (efficacy), whether they had side effects (tolerability) and whether they were safe in adults with all the types of MS. 
Study characteristics 
We searched medical databases for randomised controlled trials (where participants were randomly allocated to one of two or more treatment groups) of adults with MS. Neither patients nor researchers were told which treatment was given. Doctors had diagnosed MS and memory impairment using standard methods. 
Key results and quality of evidence 
Up to July 2013, we found only seven studies with 625 participants that met our requirements although the quality of the included studies was overall low. We did not find convincing evidence to support the use of these drugs as effective symptomatic treatments for memory disorder in people with MS. There was moderate‐quality evidence that donepezil 10 mg daily was ineffective in improving memory in MS patients with mild memory problems, but it was well tolerated. Side effects such as nausea, diarrhoea and abnormal dreams, although not frequent, were reported for donepezil, while ginkgo biloba, memantine and rivastigmine were well tolerated and no serious side effects were reported. 
There is one ongoing study that may ultimately provide valuable evidence in the future updates.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Medications for Memory Problems in Multiple Sclerosis

## What was this review about?

Researchers looked at whether medications can help improve memory problems in adults with multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is a long-term condition that affects the brain and spinal cord, and many people with MS experience memory difficulties that can make daily life harder.

## What did the researchers do?

They searched medical databases through 2013 for high-quality studies that tested medications for memory problems in adults with MS. They only included studies that:
- Tested medications against inactive pills (placebos) or other medications
- Lasted at least 12 weeks
- Included adults with MS who had at least mild memory problems

## What did they find?

The researchers found 7 studies involving 625 people with MS. These studies tested four different medications:
- Donepezil
- Ginkgo biloba
- Memantine
- Rivastigmine

**Main findings:**
- None of the medications showed clear evidence of improving memory in people with MS
- The studies had various quality issues that made it hard to draw firm conclusions
- Donepezil (10 mg daily) specifically did not improve memory scores on several memory tests
- The medications were generally safe and well-tolerated
- Common side effects included diarrhea, nausea, and unusual dreams
- No serious safety problems were reported

## What does this mean?

Based on current evidence, there is no proof that these medications help memory problems in people with MS. However, the available studies had limitations, so more research with better-designed studies is needed to know for certain whether any medications can help with MS-related memory problems.",0,Plano,"Plain-Language Summary

What was the goal?
- To find out if medicines can help adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) who have memory problems, and to check safety and side effects.

Who was studied?
- Adults with MS who had mild memory problems.
- Studies included people with different types of MS.
- Total: 7 randomized, double-blind trials with 625 people. Each trial lasted at least 12 weeks.

What treatments were tested?
- Donepezil
- Ginkgo biloba
- Memantine
- Rivastigmine
- One estriol study was ongoing at the time of the review.

What did the studies measure?
- Memory and thinking tests, such as Selective Reminding Test, 10/36 Spatial Recall, Symbol Digit Modalities Test, and PASAT.

Main findings
- Overall, there is no clear proof that these medicines improve memory in adults with MS.
- Donepezil (10 mg daily) did not improve memory compared with placebo in two better-quality studies.
- Results for ginkgo biloba, memantine, and rivastigmine were also not convincing. Studies were small and differed from each other, so results are uncertain.

Safety
- No serious side effects were tied to these medicines in the studies.
- With donepezil, some people had diarrhea, nausea, or abnormal dreams. These were not common but happened more often than with placebo.
- Ginkgo biloba, memantine, and rivastigmine were generally well tolerated in the trials.

Timing of evidence
- The review searched studies up to July 2013.

Bottom line
- There is no strong evidence that these medicines help memory problems in adults with MS.
- Donepezil did not show benefit for mild memory problems but was generally tolerated.
- Larger, better studies are needed to know if any medicine helps."

The method of delivering a diagnosis of breast cancer to women has the potential to impact on their level of interpretation, patient recall and satisfaction. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of different methods when used to communicate a primary diagnosis of breast cancer to women. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register on 7th September 2006, Cochrane Consumers and Communication Group on 27th October 2006, MEDLINE (1966 to present), CINAHL (1982 to present), EMBASE OVID (1980 to present), British Nursing Index (Jan 1984 to present), PsycInfo (1967 to present), Dissertation Abstracts International (2004 to 2006), Library and Info Science Abstracts (LISA) (1969 to present), ISI Web of Knowledge (conference abstracts) and reference lists of articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of women with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer receiving a diagnosis of primary breast cancer. Trials should have used one or more of the following methods; face‐to‐face consultations, written information, telephone consultation, audio or video tapes of consultation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion in the review. Studies were to have been assessed using standardised data extraction and quality assessment forms. 
Main results
The search strategies identified 2847 citations overall. A total of 30 citations appeared relevant however there were three duplicates which left 27 articles for further review. Articles reporting the same primary data accounted for 6 of the publications Brown 1997; Brown 1998; Brown 1999; Brown 2000; Hack 2000; Hack 2003 which left 23 original papers to be reviewed for inclusion. Of these, none met the inclusion criteria. Data extraction and assessment of methodological quality was therefore not possible. 
Authors' conclusions
The review question remains unanswered as there were no randomised trials of methods of communicating a diagnosis of breast cancer to women. The authors have considered the possible reasons for the lack of research studies in this area and have considered that it is perhaps unethical to randomise women at such a vulnerable time such as waiting for a diagnosis. The design of ethically sensitive research to examine this topic needs to be explored to inform future practice. As some papers reviewed by the authors related to the first consultation visit, where treatment options are discussed, perhaps a review which focused on the methods of communication at the first consultation visit would provide more reliable evidence for the effectiveness of methods of communication and overcome the ethical dilemmas previously mentioned.","Ways of communicating to a woman that she has breast cancer
For women to wait for and receive a first diagnosis of breast cancer (primary diagnosis) is an extremely stressful experience. Studies conducted to date suggest that what a woman is told at this time has the potential to influence her sense of well being, the way she copes with the news, how much she remembers of what was discussed (her recall) and her overall level of satisfaction with the encounter.  The diagnosis of confirmed breast cancer can be delivered in a variety of ways, including face‐to‐face consultation, telephone consultation, written or audiovisual materials. This information can be given by a range of health professionals, such as general practitioners or specialists. 
The present systematic review set out to assess the effectiveness of various methods of communicating a first diagnosis of confirmed breast cancer. The review was particularly interested in how this would impact on what the patient remembered, the satisfaction with the information received, the coping strategies used as a result of the information given and the impact of receiving the information on the patient's quality of life. The review authors made a thorough search of the medical literature looking for controlled trials in which women receiving a first diagnosis of breast cancer were randomised to the intervention group. They retrieved 23 original reports of trials for further review but ultimately no trial could be included. A number of the trials focused on communication at the first treatment consultation rather than the method of delivering the diagnosis. In an area that is ethically sensitive, the authors suggest that a review which focuses on the various methods of communication at the first consultation visit may provide useful information as to which methods are more effective and beneficial for this patient group.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: How Doctors Tell Women They Have Breast Cancer

## What was this study about?

Researchers wanted to find out the best way for doctors to tell women they have breast cancer. They looked at whether different methods of sharing this news affect how well women understand their diagnosis, remember what they were told, and feel about the conversation.

## What methods did researchers look for?

The team searched medical databases for studies that tested different ways of communicating a breast cancer diagnosis, including:
- In-person conversations with doctors
- Written materials
- Phone calls
- Audio or video recordings of the consultation

They looked for studies where women were randomly assigned to receive their diagnosis in different ways.

## What did they find?

The researchers searched through nearly 3,000 published articles. After careful review, they found **no studies** that met their requirements. This means there is currently no research comparing different ways of delivering a breast cancer diagnosis to women.

## What does this mean?

Without research studies, we don't have clear evidence about the best way to communicate a breast cancer diagnosis. The researchers suggest this gap exists because it may be difficult or inappropriate to conduct such studies when women are in a vulnerable situation waiting for diagnosis results.

## What's next?

The researchers recommend that future studies should:
- Focus on how doctors communicate during follow-up visits when discussing treatment options, rather than the initial diagnosis
- Find ethical ways to study communication methods that respect women's emotional needs during this difficult time",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What was this review about?
- Researchers wanted to know the best way to tell women they have primary breast cancer. They looked at methods like in-person talks, written handouts, phone calls, and recordings of the visit.
- They planned to measure how well women understood the information, how much they remembered, and how satisfied they were.

Who was the focus?
- Adult women who were being told they had primary breast cancer (confirmed by lab testing).

- They looked for randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

What did they find?
- Out of 2,847 records, 27 papers were checked closely.
- None were RCTs that met the review’s criteria.
- Because no suitable trials were found, the team could not compare methods or analyze results.

- No safety information was available because there were no eligible trials.

What does this mean?
- There is no high-quality trial evidence on the best way to communicate a primary breast cancer diagnosis to women.
- More research, designed with care for ethics, is needed to guide practice.
- Studying the first treatment consultation (rather than the diagnosis visit) may be more practical and ethical for future research.

- Searches covered studies published from the start of each database through late 2006. No eligible RCTs were found by that time."
39,"Background
There are two injectable progestogen‐only contraceptives (IPCs) that have been available in many countries in the world since 1983. They are both still extensively used in many developing countries, forming a large proportion of the health system's expenditure on contraception. These are depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and norethisterone oenanthate (NET‐EN). These are both highly effective contraceptives that receive wide acceptance amongst women in their fertile years. They differ in frequency of administration that has implications on patient uptake. They also differ in cost that may significantly affect budgeting in the health system. A systematic comparison will aid to ensure their rational use. 
Objectives
To determine if there are differences between depot medroxyprogesterone acetate given at a dose of 150 mg IM every 3 months and norethisterone oenanthate given at a dose of 200mg IM every 2 months, in terms of contraceptive effectiveness, reversibility and discontinuation patterns, minor effects and major effects. 
Search methods
We searched the computerized databases MEDLINE using PubMed, Popline, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Biblioline, LILACS, EMBASE and PASCAL for randomised controlled trials of DMPA versus NET‐EN for long‐acting progestogenic contraception. Studies were included regardless of language, and all databases were reviewed from the time that injectable progestogens have been in use. 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled comparisons of DMPA acetate given at a dose of 150 mg IM every 3 months versus NET‐EN given at a dose of 200mg IM every 2 months, used for contraception, were included. Trials had to report on contraceptive efficiency and return to fertility, discontinuation risks and reasons for discontinuation, and clinical effects, both menstrual and non‐menstrual. 
Data collection and analysis
BD and CM evaluated the titles and abstracts obtained through applying the search strategy and applied the eligibility criteria. BD attempted to contact authors where clarification of the data was required, and contacted all main manufacturers of the contraceptives. After inclusion of the two studies, the data was abstracted and analysed with RevMan 4.2. 
Main results
Two trials were included in this review. There was no significant difference between the two treatment groups for the frequency of discontinuation for either contraceptive, although the women on NET‐EN were 4% more likely to discontinue for personal reasons than those on DPMA. Discontinuation because of accidental pregnancy did not differ between the groups. Although the duration of bleeding and spotting events was the same in each group, women on DPMA were 21% more likely to develop amenorrhoea. Mean changes in body weight at 12 and 24 months, and in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at 12 months did not differ significantly between the studies. 
Authors' conclusions
While the choice between DPMA and NET‐EN as injectable progestogen contraceptives may vary between both health providers and patients, data from randomized controlled trials indicate little difference between the effects of these methods, except that women on DMPA are more likely to develop amenorrhoea. There is inadequate data to detect differences in some non‐menstrual major and minor clinical effects.","This review compares two injectable hormonal contraceptives containing only progestogen, namely depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and norethisterone oenanthate (NET‐EN), for the risks and reasons of their discontinuation and for their clinical effects 
Injectable hormonal contraceptives remain in extensive use in many developing countries. There are two progestogen‐only injectable contraceptives that have been available in many countries since the 1980's. These are depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and norethisterone oenanthate (NET‐EN). They are both highly effective contraceptives that receive wide acceptance amongst women in their fertile years, and form a sizeable proportion of the health expenditure on contraception. They differ in frequency of administration and cost, and a systematic comparison aids to ensure their rational use. This review seeks to compare DPMA given at a dose of 150 mg IM every 3 months and NET‐EN given at a dose of 200mg IM every 2 months, and determine whether there are differences in contraceptive effectiveness, reversibility and patterns of discontinuation, and their minor and major clinical effects.  All databases were reviewed from the time that injectable progestogens have been in use and this review included all randomised controlled comparisons of DMPA and NET‐EN used for contraception. Trials had to report on contraceptive efficiency and return to fertility, the rates and reasons for stopping use, as well as menstrual and non‐menstrual clinical effects.  It was found that there was no significant difference between the two treatment groups regarding the time from when women started the contraceptive until they stopped its use. The women on NET‐EN were 4% more likely to stop use for personal reasons than those on DPMA, but this difference was not statistically significant. There was no difference between the groups when an accidental pregnancy was the reason to stop use. The length of time of episodes of vaginal bleeding and spotting was the same in each group. Women who were on DPMA were 21% more likely to stop vaginal bleeding altogether while using the contraceptive. Changes in body weight and changes in blood pressure did not differ between DMPA and NET‐EN. Furthermore, these changes in body weight and blood pressure were relatively small and not clinically relevant.  In summary, therefore, data from the trials included in this review indicate little difference between the effects of these methods, except that women on DMPA are more likely to experience cessation of vaginal bleeding during its use. There was inadequate data to detect differences in some non‐menstrual clinical effects, and considering that this contraceptive method remains in use in some countries, further research is indicated.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Two Types of Birth Control Shots

## What was this study about?

Researchers compared two types of birth control shots that contain hormones to prevent pregnancy. Both shots have been used in many countries since 1983, especially in developing nations where they make up a large part of family planning budgets.

## What are these birth control methods?

The two shots compared were:
- **DMPA**: A shot given every 3 months
- **NET-EN**: A shot given every 2 months

Both are highly effective at preventing pregnancy and are popular among women of childbearing age. However, they differ in how often they need to be given and how much they cost.

## What did researchers want to learn?

The researchers wanted to find out if there were differences between these two shots in:
- How well they prevent pregnancy
- How quickly women can get pregnant after stopping
- Why and how often women stop using them
- Side effects, both minor and major

## What did they find?

After reviewing two studies, researchers found:
- Both shots worked equally well at preventing pregnancy
- Women stopped using both shots at similar rates
- Women using NET-EN were slightly more likely (4%) to stop for personal reasons
- Women using DMPA were more likely (21%) to stop having periods completely
- Both groups had similar patterns of bleeding and spotting
- Weight changes and blood pressure changes were similar for both shots at 12 and 24 months

## What does this mean?

Both birth control shots work similarly, with the main difference being that DMPA users are more likely to stop having periods. The choice between them may depend on personal preference and how often someone wants to get shots.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What is this study about?
- Researchers compared two birth control shots used worldwide: DMPA and NET-EN.
- Goal: see if they differ in how well they prevent pregnancy, how often people stop using them, how quickly periods or fertility return, and side effects.

Who was included?
- Women of childbearing age who chose a long-acting birth control shot.

What were the treatments?
- DMPA: 150 mg given as a shot in the muscle every 3 months.
- NET-EN: 200 mg given as a shot in the muscle every 2 months.

What did researchers measure?
- How well each shot prevented pregnancy.
- How often and why people stopped using the method.
- Changes in bleeding patterns, including no monthly bleeding (amenorrhea).
- Body weight and blood pressure.
- Return to fertility after stopping (data were limited).

How was the study done?
- This was a review of two randomized trials found in several medical databases.
- Results included checks at about 12 and 24 months for weight, and at 12 months for blood pressure.

Main findings
- Pregnancy prevention: no meaningful difference between DMPA and NET-EN.
- Stopping use: overall similar. Women on NET-EN were about 4% more likely to stop for personal reasons.
- Bleeding patterns: length of bleeding/spotting was similar. DMPA users were about 21% more likely to have no monthly bleeding (amenorrhea).
- Weight and blood pressure: no meaningful differences at 12 or 24 months.
- Return to fertility: not enough data to show a clear difference.

Safety
- No major safety differences were found between the two shots in the available trials.
- Data were limited for some less common side effects.

Bottom line
- Both shots work well to prevent pregnancy.
- Main difference seen: no monthly bleeding was more common with DMPA.
- Choice may depend on dosing schedule (every 3 months vs every 2 months) and personal preference."
40,"Background
Globally, cannabis use is prevalent and widespread. There are currently no pharmacotherapies approved for treatment of cannabis use disorders. 
This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in the Cochrane Library in Issue 12, 2014. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacotherapies as compared with each other, placebo or no pharmacotherapy (supportive care) for reducing symptoms of cannabis withdrawal and promoting cessation or reduction of cannabis use. 
Search methods
We updated our searches of the following databases to March 2018: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and Web of Science. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs involving the use of medications to treat cannabis withdrawal or to promote cessation or reduction of cannabis use, or both, in comparison with other medications, placebo or no medication (supportive care) in people diagnosed as cannabis dependent or who were likely to be dependent. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We included 21 RCTs involving 1755 participants: 18 studies recruited adults (mean age 22 to 41 years); three studies targeted young people (mean age 20 years). Most (75%) participants were male. The studies were at low risk of performance, detection and selective outcome reporting bias. One study was at risk of selection bias, and three studies were at risk of attrition bias. 
All studies involved comparison of active medication and placebo. The medications were diverse, as were the outcomes reported, which limited the extent of analysis. 
Abstinence at end of treatment was no more likely with Δ9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) preparations than with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 1.52; 305 participants; 3 studies; moderate‐quality evidence). For selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants, mixed action antidepressants, anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers, buspirone and N‐acetylcysteine, there was no difference in the likelihood of abstinence at end of treatment compared to placebo (low‐ to very low‐quality evidence). 
There was qualitative evidence of reduced intensity of withdrawal symptoms with THC preparations compared to placebo. For other pharmacotherapies, this outcome was either not examined, or no significant differences was reported. 
Adverse effects were no more likely with THC preparations (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.17; 318 participants; 3 studies) or N‐acetylcysteine (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.23; 418 participants; 2 studies) compared to placebo (moderate‐quality evidence). For SSRI antidepressants, mixed action antidepressants, buspirone and N‐acetylcysteine, there was no difference in adverse effects compared to placebo (low‐ to very low‐quality evidence). 
There was no difference in the likelihood of withdrawal from treatment due to adverse effects with THC preparations, SSRIs antidepressants, mixed action antidepressants, anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers, buspirone and N‐acetylcysteine compared to placebo (low‐ to very low‐quality evidence). 
There was no difference in the likelihood of treatment completion with THC preparations, SSRI antidepressants, mixed action antidepressants and buspirone compared to placebo (low‐ to very low‐quality evidence) or with N‐acetylcysteine compared to placebo (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21; 418 participants; 2 studies; moderate‐quality evidence). Anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers appeared to reduce the likelihood of treatment completion (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.92; 141 participants; 3 studies; low‐quality evidence). 
Available evidence on gabapentin (anticonvulsant), oxytocin (neuropeptide) and atomoxetine was insufficient for estimates of effectiveness. 
Authors' conclusions
There is incomplete evidence for all of the pharmacotherapies investigated, and for many outcomes the quality of the evidence was low or very low. Findings indicate that SSRI antidepressants, mixed action antidepressants, bupropion, buspirone and atomoxetine are probably of little value in the treatment of cannabis dependence. Given the limited evidence of efficacy, THC preparations should be considered still experimental, with some positive effects on withdrawal symptoms and craving. The evidence base for the anticonvulsant gabapentin, oxytocin, and N‐acetylcysteine is weak, but these medications are also worth further investigation.","Medicines for the treatment of cannabis dependence
Background 
Cannabis use is relatively common and widespread worldwide. Demand by cannabis users for treatment has been increasing in most regions of the world. Moves in some countries to decriminalise or legalise cannabis use is likely to result in this trend continuing. Currently there are no medicines specifically for the treatment of cannabis use. This review sought to assess the effectiveness and safety of medicines for the treatment of cannabis dependence. 
Search date 
We searched the scientific literature in March 2018.
Study characteristics 
We identified 21 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are allocated at random to one of two or more treatment groups) involving 909 participants treated with active medicines, and 846 who received placebo (a pretend treatment). Key features of dependent drug use are compulsive use, loss of control over use and withdrawal symptoms on cessation of drug use. This review included studies where participants were described as dependent or were likely to be dependent based on cannabis use occurring several days a week, or daily. 
The mean age of participants in individual studies ranged from 22 to 41 years, excluding three studies that targeted young people. Most (75%) study participants were male. Most (16) of the studies were undertaken in the USA, with three occurring in Australia, one in Canada and one in Israel. The studies tested a wide range of medicines to reduce the symptoms of cannabis withdrawal and to promote cessation or reduction of cannabis use. 
Four studies received study medicines from the manufacturing pharmaceutical company but none were funded by pharmaceutical companies. One study did not report funding or medicine source. 
Key results 
For the outcome of abstinence at the end of treatment, Δ9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, the major constituent in cannabis) preparations were probably ineffective; antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, mixed action antidepressants, a medicine called buspirone and a medicine called N‐acetylcysteine may also have been ineffective; and we are uncertain about the effect of anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers. 
For the outcome of completion of the scheduled period of treatment, THC preparations, mixed action antidepressants, anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers may not have been effective, we were uncertain about the effect of SSRI antidepressants, and N‐acetylcysteine probably did not support treatment completion. The use of anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers may have increased the likelihood that people left treatment early. 
THC preparations and N‐acetylcysteine were probably no more likely to cause side effects than placebo, mixed action antidepressants and buspirone may have been no more likely to cause side effects than placebo, and we were uncertain about SSRI antidepressants. 
Based on current research, all medicines should be considered still experimental.
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence for many of the outcomes in this review was low or very low because each medicine was investigated by a small number of studies (ranging from one to four), each study involved small numbers of participants, there was some inconsistency in the findings and there was a risk of bias due to study participants dropping out of treatment.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Medications for Cannabis Use Problems

## What was this review about?

Researchers looked at whether medications can help people who want to stop or reduce their cannabis (marijuana) use. They also wanted to know if these medications could ease withdrawal symptoms that happen when someone stops using cannabis.

## What did the researchers find?

The review included 21 studies with 1,755 people. Most participants were men, with ages ranging from their early 20s to early 40s. The studies tested different types of medications against inactive pills (placebos).

## Key findings:

**Stopping cannabis use:**
- None of the medications tested clearly helped people stop using cannabis better than placebo pills
- This included THC medications (the main active ingredient in cannabis), antidepressants, anti-seizure medications, and other drugs

**Withdrawal symptoms:**
- THC medications may have reduced some withdrawal symptoms
- Other medications showed little to no effect on withdrawal symptoms

**Side effects:**
- THC medications and a supplement called N-acetylcysteine caused about the same number of side effects as placebo pills
- Most medications did not cause people to drop out of treatment due to side effects
- Anti-seizure medications and mood stabilizers may have caused more people to leave treatment early

## What does this mean?

Currently, there is no proven medication treatment for cannabis use problems. The evidence is limited and more research is needed. THC medications might help with withdrawal symptoms, but need more study. Some other medications like gabapentin, oxytocin, and N-acetylcysteine also deserve further research.",0,Plano,"Plain-Language Summary

Purpose
- To see if medicines help people stop or cut down cannabis use and ease withdrawal symptoms, and to check safety.

Who was studied
- 21 randomized controlled trials with 1,755 people.
- Mostly adults (average ages 22–41); three studies included young people (average age 20).
- About 75% were male.
- Studies compared medicines to placebo (a dummy pill) or to each other.

What treatments were tested
- THC preparations (forms of cannabis’ main active ingredient)
- Antidepressants: SSRIs and mixed-action types, bupropion
- Anticonvulsants and mood stabilizers (including gabapentin)
- Buspirone
- N-acetylcysteine (NAC)
- Oxytocin
- Atomoxetine

Main outcomes
- Quitting cannabis at end of treatment: THC, SSRIs, mixed-action antidepressants, anticonvulsants/mood stabilizers, buspirone, and NAC did not help people quit more than placebo.
- Withdrawal symptoms: THC preparations reduced the intensity of withdrawal symptoms in some studies. Other medicines showed no clear benefit.
- Treatment completion: Similar to placebo for THC, SSRIs, mixed-action antidepressants, buspirone, and NAC. People on anticonvulsants/mood stabilizers were less likely to finish treatment.

Safety
- Side effects were about the same as placebo for THC and NAC. For SSRIs, mixed-action antidepressants, buspirone, and NAC, side effects were similar to placebo in low- to very low-quality evidence.
- Stopping treatment due to side effects did not differ from placebo for most medicines.

What this means
- There is no strong evidence that any medicine tested helps people quit cannabis.
- THC preparations may ease withdrawal but did not increase quitting; they remain experimental.
- SSRIs, mixed-action antidepressants, bupropion, buspirone, and atomoxetine are probably not helpful for cannabis dependence.
- Evidence for gabapentin, oxytocin, and NAC is weak; more research is needed.

Study quality and timing
- Evidence quality ranged from moderate to very low; many results are uncertain.
- This is an update of a Cochrane Review. Searches were current to March 2018.

Note
- There are currently no approved medicines for treating cannabis use disorder. Supportive care and behavioral therapies remain important."
41,"Background
Maternal complications, including psychological/mental health problems and neonatal morbidity, have commonly been observed in the postpartum period. Home visits by health professionals or lay supporters in the weeks following birth may prevent health problems from becoming chronic, with long‐term effects. This is an update of a review last published in 2017. 
Objectives
The primary objective of this review is to assess the effects of different home‐visiting schedules on maternal and newborn mortality during the early postpartum period. The review focuses on the frequency of home visits (how many home visits in total), the timing (when visits started, e.g. within 48 hours of the birth), duration (when visits ended), intensity (how many visits per week), and different types of home‐visiting interventions. 
Search methods
For this update, we searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (19 May 2021), and checked reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (including cluster‐, quasi‐RCTs and studies available only as abstracts) comparing different home‐visiting interventions that enrolled participants in the early postpartum period (up to 42 days after birth) were eligible for inclusion. We excluded studies in which women were enrolled and received an intervention during the antenatal period (even if the intervention continued into the postnatal period), and studies recruiting only women from specific high‐risk groups (e.g. women with alcohol or drug problems). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included 16 randomised trials with data for 12,080 women. The trials were carried out in countries across the world, in both high‐ and low‐resource settings. In low‐resource settings, women receiving usual care may have received no additional postnatal care after early hospital discharge. 
The interventions and controls varied considerably across studies. Trials focused on three broad types of comparisons, as detailed below. In all but four of the included studies, postnatal care at home was delivered by healthcare professionals. The aim of all interventions was broadly to assess the well‐being of mothers and babies, and to provide education and support. However, some interventions had more specific aims, such as to encourage breastfeeding, or to provide practical support. 
For most of our outcomes, only one or two studies provided data, and results were inconsistent overall. All studies had several domains with high or unclear risk of bias. 
More versus fewer home visits (five studies, 2102 women) 
The evidence is very uncertain about whether home visits have any effect on maternal and neonatal mortality (very low‐certainty evidence). Mean postnatal depression scores as measured with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) may be slightly higher (worse) with more home visits, though the difference in scores was not clinically meaningful (mean difference (MD) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 1.79; two studies, 767 women; low‐certainty evidence). Two separate analyses indicated conflicting results for maternal satisfaction (both low‐certainty evidence); one indicated that there may be benefit with fewer visits, though the 95% CI just crossed the line of no effect (risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.02; two studies, 862 women). However, in another study, the additional support provided by health visitors was associated with increased mean satisfaction scores (MD 14.70, 95% CI 8.43 to 20.97; one study, 280 women; low‐certainty evidence). Infant healthcare utilisation may be decreased with more home visits (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.64; four studies, 1365 infants) and exclusive breastfeeding at six weeks may be increased (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.36; three studies, 960 women; low‐certainty evidence). Serious neonatal morbidity up to six months was not reported in any trial. 
Different models of postnatal care (three studies, 4394 women) 
In a cluster‐RCT comparing usual care with individualised care by midwives, extended up to three months after the birth, there may be little or no difference in neonatal mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.12; one study, 696 infants). The proportion of women with EPDS scores ≥ 13 at four months is probably reduced with individualised care (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.86; one study, 1295 women). One study suggests there may be little to no difference between home visits and telephone screening in neonatal morbidity up to 28 days (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.12; one study, 696 women). In a different study, there was no difference between breastfeeding promotion and routine visits in exclusive breastfeeding rates at six months (RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.69; one study, 656 women). 
Home versus facility‐based postnatal care (eight studies, 5179 women) 
The evidence suggests there may be little to no difference in postnatal depression rates at 42 days postpartum and also as measured on an EPDS scale at 60 days. Maternal satisfaction with postnatal care may be better with home visits (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.62; three studies, 2368 women). There may be little to no difference in infant emergency health care visits or infant hospital readmissions (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.38; three studies, 3257 women) or in exclusive breastfeeding at two weeks (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.18; 1 study, 513 women). 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of home visits on maternal and neonatal mortality. Individualised care as part of a package of home visits probably improves depression scores at four months and increasing the frequency of home visits may improve exclusive breastfeeding rates and infant healthcare utilisation. Maternal satisfaction may also be better with home visits compared to hospital check‐ups. Overall, the certainty of evidence was found to be low and findings were not consistent among studies and comparisons. Further well designed RCTs evaluating this complex intervention will be required to formulate the optimal package.","Home visits in the early period after the birth of a baby
What is the issue? 
Health problems for mothers and babies commonly occur or become apparent in the weeks following the birth. For the mothers these include postpartum haemorrhage (substitute excessive blood loss), fever and infection, abdominal and back pain, abnormal discharge (heavy or smelly vaginal discharge), thromboembolism (a blood clot), and urinary tract complications (being unable to control the urge to pee), as well as psychological and mental health problems such as postnatal depression. Mothers may also need support to establish breastfeeding. Babies are at risk of death related to infections (babies may be badly affected by infections), asphyxia (difficulties in breathing, caused by lack of oxygen), and preterm birth (being born prematurely). 
Why is this important? 
Home visits by health professionals or lay supporters in the early postpartum period may prevent health problems from becoming long‐term, with effects on women, their babies, and their families. This review looked at different home‐visiting schedules in the weeks following the birth. 
What evidence did we find? 
We included 16 randomised trials with data for 12,080 women. Some trials focused on physical checks of the mother and newborn, while others provided support for breastfeeding, and one included the provision of practical support with housework and childcare. They were carried out in both high‐resource countries and low‐resource settings where women receiving usual care may not have received additional postnatal care after early hospital discharge. 
The trials focused on three broad types of comparisons: schedules involving more versus fewer postnatal home visits (five studies), schedules involving different models of care (three studies), and home versus facility postnatal check‐ups (eight studies). In all but four of the included studies, postnatal care at home was delivered by healthcare professionals. For most of our outcomes, only one or two studies provided data. Overall, our results were inconsistent. 
The evidence was very uncertain about whether home visits reduced newborn deaths or serious health problems with the mother. Women's physical and psychological health were not improved with more intensive schedules of home visits although more individualised care improved women's mental health in one study and maternal satisfaction was slightly better in two studies. Overall, babies may be less likely to have additional medical care if their mothers received more postnatal home visits. More home visits may have encouraged more women to exclusively breastfeed their babies and women to be more satisfied with their postnatal care. The different outcomes reported in different studies, how the outcomes were measured, and the considerable variation in the interventions and control conditions across studies were limitations of this review. The certainty of the evidence was generally found to be low or very low according to the GRADE criteria. 
What does this mean? 
Increasing the number of postnatal home visits may promote infant health and exclusive breastfeeding and more individualised care may improve outcomes for women. More research is needed before any particular schedule of postnatal care can be recommended.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Home Visits After Having a Baby

## What was this review about?

Researchers wanted to know if home visits by nurses or other healthcare workers after a woman gives birth help keep mothers and babies healthy. They looked at different schedules of home visits—how many visits, when they started, and how long they continued.

## What did the researchers study?

They reviewed 16 studies involving over 12,000 women from countries around the world. The studies compared:
- More home visits versus fewer home visits
- Different types of care programs
- Home visits versus going to a clinic or hospital for checkups

Healthcare workers doing home visits checked on mothers and babies, provided education and support, and sometimes focused on specific goals like encouraging breastfeeding.

## What did they find?

**More versus fewer home visits:**
- It's unclear whether more home visits reduce deaths of mothers or babies
- More home visits may help with exclusive breastfeeding at 6 weeks
- More home visits may reduce how often babies need healthcare visits
- Results about mother's satisfaction were mixed

**Different care programs:**
- Personalized care by midwives for up to 3 months probably helps reduce depression symptoms at 4 months
- There may be little difference in baby health problems between home visits and phone check-ins

**Home visits versus clinic visits:**
- Depression rates appear similar with either option
- Mothers may be more satisfied with home visits
- Breastfeeding rates and baby healthcare visits appear similar with either option

## What does this mean?

The evidence is limited and results varied across studies. Some home visit programs may help with breastfeeding and reducing depression, and mothers may prefer them over clinic visits. However, more high-quality research is needed to determine the best approach for home visits after birth.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the review

What was the goal?
- To see if different schedules of home visits after birth help mothers and newborns live healthier and safer lives in the first weeks after delivery.

Who was studied?
- 12,080 women and their babies from 16 randomized studies around the world.
- Families were enrolled in the early postpartum period (up to 42 days after birth).

What were the home visit programs?
- Visits at home by health workers (nurses, midwives, or trained staff). A few used lay supporters.
- Programs differed in:
  - How many visits happened.
  - When visits started (for example, within 48 hours after birth).
  - How long the program lasted.
  - How often visits happened each week.
  - The focus (general support, breastfeeding help, or practical support).

What were these compared to?
- Fewer or no home visits, usual care, phone support, or clinic/hospital-based checkups.

Main outcomes measured
- Death of mother or baby.
- Maternal mood (postnatal depression scores).
- Breastfeeding.
- Use of infant health services (clinic or emergency visits, readmissions).
- Maternal satisfaction with care.
- Serious health problems in newborns.

Key findings
- Maternal and newborn deaths: It is very uncertain whether home visits change death rates. Evidence quality was very low.
- Depression:
  - More visits: Small differences that likely do not change how mothers feel day to day.
  - A tailored (individualized) midwife-led program up to 3 months likely lowered high depression scores at 4 months.
- Breastfeeding: More frequent visits may increase exclusive breastfeeding at about 6 weeks.
- Infant health service use: More visits may reduce infant healthcare visits.
- Satisfaction: Mothers may be more satisfied with home visits than with clinic/hospital checkups.
- Newborn illness: Little to no difference seen in some comparisons; serious newborn illness up to 6 months was not reported.

Timing
- Outcomes were commonly checked between 2 weeks and 4 months after birth (some up to 6 months).

Safety
- No clear increase in harms was reported. Data on serious newborn problems were limited.

How strong is the evidence?
- Overall, the evidence was low certainty and results were not consistent across studies.
- More high-quality trials are needed to find the best mix of visit timing, number, and type."
42,"Background
It remains unclear whether people with non‐muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) benefit from intravesical gemcitabine compared to other agents in the primary or recurrent setting following transurethral resection of a bladder tumor. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2012. Since that time, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been reported, making this update relevant.  
Objectives
To assess the comparative effectiveness and toxicity of intravesical gemcitabine instillation for NMIBC. 
Search methods
We performed a comprehensive literature search of the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases, trial registries, and conference proceedings to 11 September 2020, with no restrictions on the language or status of publication. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs in which participants received intravesical gemcitabine for primary or recurrent NMIBC. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the included studies and extracted data for the primary outcomes: time to recurrence, time to progression, grade III to V adverse events determined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0), and the secondary outcomes: time to death from bladder cancer, time to death from any cause, grade I or II adverse events determined by the CTCAE v5.0 and disease‐specific quality of life. We performed statistical analyses using a random‐effects model and rated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We included seven studies with 1222 participants with NMIBC across five comparisons. This abstract focuses on the primary outcomes of the three most clinically relevant comparisons. 
1. Gemcitabine versus saline: based on two years' to four years' follow‐up, gemcitabine may reduce the risk of recurrence over time compared to saline (39% versus 47% recurrence rate, hazard ratio [HR] 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54 to 1.09; studies = 2, participants = 734; I2 = 49%; low‐certainty evidence), but the CI included the possibility of no effect.  Gemcitabine may result in little to no difference in the risk of progression over time compared to saline (4.6% versus 4.8% progression rate, HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.19 to 4.71; studies = 2, participants = 654; I2 = 53%; low‐certainty evidence).  Gemcitabine may result in little to no difference in the CTCAE grade III to V adverse events compared to saline (5.9% versus 4.7% adverse events rate, risk ratio [RR] 1.26, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.75; studies = 2, participants = 668; I2 = 24%; low‐certainty evidence).  
2. Gemcitabine versus mitomycin: based on three years' follow‐up (studies = 1, participants = 109), gemcitabine may reduce the risk of recurrence over time compared to mitomycin (17% versus 40% recurrence rate, HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.69; low‐certainty evidence). Gemcitabine may reduce the risk of progression over time compared to mitomycin (11% versus  18% progression rate, HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.01; low‐certainty evidence), but the CI included the possibility of no effect.  We are very uncertain about the effect of gemcitabine on the CTCAE grade III to V adverse events compared to mitomycin (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.93; very low‐certainty evidence). The analysis was only based on recurrent NMIBC. 
3. Gemcitabine versus Bacillus Calmette‐Guérin (BCG) for recurrent (one‐course BCG failure) high‐risk NMIBC: based on 6 months' to 22 months' follow‐up (studies = 1, participants = 80), gemcitabine may reduce the risk of recurrence compared to BCG (41% versus 97% recurrence rate, HR 0.15, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.26; low‐certainty evidence) and progression over time (16% versus 33% progression rate, HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.76; low‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain about the effect of gemcitabine on the CTCAE grade III to V adverse events compared to BCG (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.21 to 4.66; very low‐certainty evidence).  
In addition, the review provides information on  the comparison of gemcitabine versus BCG and gemcitabine versus one‐third dose BCG.  
Authors' conclusions
Based on findings of this review, gemcitabine may have a more favorable impact on recurrence and progression‐free survival than mitomycin but we are very uncertain as to how major adverse events compare. The same is true when comparing gemcitabine to BCG in individuals with high risk disease who have previously failed BCG. The underlying low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence indicates that our confidence in these results is limited; the true effects may be substantially different from these findings; therefore, better quality studies are needed.","Intravesical gemcitabine for non‐muscle invasive bladder cancer
Review question 
In people with tumors of the superficial layer of the urinary bladder (namely non‐muscle invasive bladder cancer [NMIBC]), how does gemcitabine that is put into the bladder compare to other medicines after the tumor has been removed?  
Background 
NMIBC can be taken out of the bladder using small instruments and a light source (called transurethral surgery). However, these tumors often come back (recurrence) with an aggressive feature such as spread into the deep layers of the bladder. To prevent this, we can put various medicines into the bladder. In this review, we wanted to know whether gemcitabine (a chemotherapy medication) was better or worse than other medicines. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to 11 September 2020. We included only studies in which chance determined whether people received gemcitabine or other medicines. We found seven studies with 1222 participants. Two studies compared gemcitabine versus saline. One study compared gemcitabine versus mitomycin (a chemotherapy medication). Three studies compared gemcitabine versus BCG (Bacillus Calmette‐Guérin; a medicine used to help keep cancer from growing). One study compared gemcitabine versus one‐third dose BCG. 
Key results 
Gemcitabine may reduce the risk of recurrence over time, but may have a similar effect on progression (cancer getting worse) and severe unwanted effects compared to saline. Gemcitabine may prevent recurrence and progression compared to mitomycin. We are very unsure about the effect of gemcitabine on the severe unwanted effects compared to mitomycin. In people who had a high‐risk NMIBC with the cancer coming back after one course of treatment with BCG, gemcitabine may cause less tumor recurrence and progression compared to giving BCG again. We are very unsure about the effect of gemcitabine on the severe unwanted effects compared to BCG retreatment. The review also includes information on how gemcitabine compares to BCG and how it compares to one‐third dose BCG.  
Reliability of the evidence 
The reliability of the evidence was low or very low for most of the treatments we compared, meaning that we were often uncertain about whether the findings were true. Further research will likely change these findings.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Gemcitabine Treatment for Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer

## What was this study about?

Researchers reviewed studies about a treatment for bladder cancer that hasn't spread into the muscle layer of the bladder wall. After surgery to remove bladder tumors, doctors sometimes put medicine directly into the bladder to help prevent the cancer from coming back. This review looked at whether a medicine called gemcitabine works better than other treatments.

## What did the researchers do?

They searched medical databases through September 2020 and found 7 studies with 1,222 people who had bladder cancer that hadn't spread into the muscle. They compared gemcitabine to other treatments, including saltwater (saline), another medicine called mitomycin, and a vaccine called BCG.

## What did they find?

**Gemcitabine compared to saline (saltwater):**
- May reduce the chance of cancer coming back (39% vs 47% over 2-4 years)
- Showed little difference in cancer getting worse or in serious side effects

**Gemcitabine compared to mitomycin:**
- May reduce the chance of cancer coming back (17% vs 40% over 3 years)
- May reduce the chance of cancer getting worse (11% vs 18%)
- Unclear whether serious side effects were different

**Gemcitabine compared to BCG (in people whose cancer came back after BCG treatment):**
- May reduce the chance of cancer coming back (41% vs 97%)
- May reduce the chance of cancer getting worse (16% vs 33%)
- Unclear whether serious side effects were different

## What does this mean?

Gemcitabine might work better than some other treatments at keeping bladder cancer from coming back or getting worse. However, the researchers noted that the quality of evidence was low, meaning they cannot be very confident in these results. More high-quality studies are needed to know for sure how well gemcitabine works.",0,Plano,"Plain language summary of the trial review

What was the goal?
- To see how well bladder instillations of gemcitabine work and how safe they are for people with non–muscle invasive bladder cancer after tumor removal surgery.
- To compare gemcitabine with saline (placebo), mitomycin, and BCG.

Who was studied?
- 7 randomized trials with 1,222 adults who had non–muscle invasive bladder cancer (some newly treated, some with return of cancer).
- Follow‑up ranged from about 6 months to 4 years.

What treatments were compared?
- Gemcitabine put into the bladder (intravesical) versus:
  - Saline (placebo)
  - Mitomycin
  - BCG, including people whose cancer came back after BCG

What did researchers measure?
- If and when the cancer came back (recurrence)
- If and when the cancer got worse (progression)
- Serious side effects (grade III–V)
- Death from bladder cancer and from any cause (secondary outcomes; not highlighted in the abstract)
- Quality of life (secondary; not highlighted in the abstract)

Key results

1) Gemcitabine vs saline (2 trials; about 2–4 years follow‑up)
- Recurrence: 39% with gemcitabine vs 47% with saline. This suggests fewer recurrences with gemcitabine, but results were uncertain.
- Progression: About 5% in both groups (little to no difference).
- Serious side effects: About 6% with gemcitabine vs 5% with saline (little to no difference).
- Certainty of evidence: low.

2) Gemcitabine vs mitomycin (1 trial; 3 years follow‑up; people with recurrent cancer)
- Recurrence: 17% with gemcitabine vs 40% with mitomycin (gemcitabine may reduce recurrences).
- Progression: 11% with gemcitabine vs 18% with mitomycin (trend toward fewer progressions; uncertain).
- Serious side effects: Too few events to be sure of differences.
- Certainty of evidence: low for benefits; very low for side effects.

3) Gemcitabine vs BCG after BCG failure (1 trial; 6–22 months follow‑up; high‑risk group)
- Recurrence: 41% with gemcitabine vs 97% with BCG (gemcitabine may reduce recurrences).
- Progression: 16% with gemcitabine vs 33% with BCG (gemcitabine may reduce progression).
- Serious side effects: Too few events to be sure of differences.
- Certainty of evidence: low for benefits; very low for side effects.

Safety
- Across studies, serious side effects were uncommon and similar between groups, but the evidence is limited. We cannot be certain how gemcitabine compares to mitomycin or BCG for major side effects.

What do these results mean?
- Gemcitabine given into the bladder may lower the chance of cancer coming back compared to saline, mitomycin, and BCG in certain groups, and may lower the chance of getting worse in some settings.
- However, the overall certainty is low to very low. The true effects could be different.
- Better, larger studies are needed to confirm benefits and safety.

Timeframe
- Evidence includes follow‑up from about 6 months to 4 years, depending on the comparison."
43,"Background
Multiple risk factor interventions using counselling and educational methods assumed to be efficacious and cost‐effective in reducing coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality and morbidity and that they should be expanded. Trials examining risk factor changes have cast doubt on the effectiveness of these interventions. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of multiple risk factor interventions for reducing total mortality, fatal and non‐fatal events from CHD and cardiovascular risk factors among adults assumed to be without prior clinical evidence CHD.. 
Search methods
We updated the original search BY SEARCHING CENTRAL (2006, Issue 2), MEDLINE (2000 to June 2006) and EMBASE (1998 to June 2006), and checking bibliographies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of more than six months duration using counselling or education to modify more than one cardiovascular risk factor in adults from general populations, occupational groups or specific risk factors (i.e. diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, obesity). 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors extracted data independently. We expressed categorical variables as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where studies published subsequent follow‐up data on mortality and event rates, we updated these data. 
Main results
We found 55 trials (163,471 participants) with a median duration of 12 month follow up. Fourteen trials (139,256 participants) with reported clinical event endpoints, the pooled ORs for total and CHD mortality were 1.00 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.05) and 0.99 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.07), respectively. Total mortality and combined fatal and non‐fatal cardiovascular events showed benefits from intervention when confined to trials involving people with hypertension (16 trials) and diabetes (5 trials): OR 0.78 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.89) and OR 0.71 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.83), respectively. Net changes (weighted mean differences) in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (53 trials) and blood cholesterol (50 trials) were ‐2.71 mmHg (95% CI ‐3.49 to ‐1.93), ‐2.13 mmHg (95% CI ‐2.67 to ‐1.58 ) and ‐0.24 mmol/l (95% CI ‐0.32 to ‐0.16), respectively. The OR for reduction in smoking prevalence (20 trials) was 0.87 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.00). Marked heterogeneity (I2 > 85%) for all risk factor analyses was not explained by co‐morbidities, allocation concealment, use of antihypertensive or cholesterol‐lowering drugs, or by age of trial. 
Authors' conclusions
Interventions using counselling and education aimed at behaviour change do not reduce total or CHD mortality or clinical events in general populations but may be effective in reducing mortality in high‐risk hypertensive and diabetic populations. Risk factor declines were modest but owing to marked unexplained heterogeneity between trials, the pooled estimates are of dubious validity. Evidence suggests that health promotion interventions have limited use in general populations.","Multiple risk factor interventions for coronary heart disease
In many countries, there is enthusiasm for 'healthy heart programmes' that use counselling and educational methods to encourage people to reduce their risks for developing heart disease. These risk factors include high cholesterol, excessive salt intake, high blood pressure, excess weight, a high‐fat diet, smoking, diabetes and a sedentary lifestyle. This review is an update of all relevant randomised trials that have evaluated an intervention that aimed to reduce more than one risk factor (multiple risk factor intervention) in people without evidence of cardiovascular disease. The findings are from 55 trials of between six months and 12 years duration conducted in several countries over the course of four decades. The median duration of follow up was 12 months (with a range of six months to 12 years). Multiple risk factor intervention does result in small reductions in risk factors including blood pressure, cholesterol and smoking. Contrary to expectations, multiple risk factor interventions had little or no impact on the risk of coronary heart disease mortality or morbidity. This could be because these small risk factor changes were not maintained in the long term. Alternatively, the small reductions in risk factors may be caused by biases in some of the studies. The methods of attempting behaviour change in the general population are limited and do not appear to be effective. Different approaches to behaviour change are needed and should be tested empirically before being widely promoted, particularly in developing countries where cardiovascular disease rates are rising. Further trials may be warranted.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Can Counseling and Education Reduce Heart Disease Risk?

## What was this study about?

Researchers reviewed studies to see if counseling and education programs could help healthy adults lower their risk of heart disease and death. These programs aimed to change multiple health behaviors at once, like improving diet, increasing exercise, and quitting smoking.

## Who was studied?

The review included 163,471 adults from the general public, workplace groups, and people with specific risk factors like high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, or obesity. These participants did not have existing heart disease.

## What did the programs involve?

Participants received counseling or education to help them change several heart disease risk factors at the same time. Programs lasted at least 6 months, with most studies following participants for about 12 months.

## What did researchers find?

**For the general population:**
- These programs did not reduce death rates or heart disease events
- Small improvements were seen in blood pressure (about 3 points lower) and cholesterol levels (slightly lower)
- Smoking rates decreased slightly

**For people with high blood pressure or diabetes:**
- These programs were more helpful
- They reduced death rates and heart disease events by about 20-30%

## What does this mean?

Counseling and education programs that try to change multiple health behaviors don't appear to prevent heart disease or death in healthy adults from the general population. However, these programs may help people who already have high blood pressure or diabetes. The results varied widely between studies, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions.",0,Plano,"Plain Language Summary

Background
Many programs try to lower heart disease risk by teaching people to change several habits at once (like diet, exercise, and smoking). This review looked at how well these programs work.

Purpose
To find out if counseling and education programs that target more than one heart risk factor reduce deaths and heart problems in adults who do not already have diagnosed heart disease.

Who was studied
- Adults from the general public, workplaces, or with certain risks (high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, or obesity)
- 55 randomized trials, 163,471 people total
- Trials lasted at least 6 months (typical follow‑up was about 12 months)

What the programs were
- Counseling or education to change more than one risk factor (for example: diet, physical activity, smoking)
- Compared with usual care or less intensive support

Main outcomes measured
- Death from any cause
- Death from coronary heart disease (CHD)
- Combined fatal and non‑fatal heart and blood vessel events
- Blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and smoking rates

Key results
- In general adult groups, these programs did not reduce deaths from any cause or from CHD.
- In higher‑risk groups:
  - People with high blood pressure: fewer deaths and heart events
  - People with diabetes: fewer deaths and heart events
- Risk factors changed only a little on average:
  - Systolic blood pressure dropped about 2.7 mmHg
  - Diastolic blood pressure dropped about 2.1 mmHg
  - Total cholesterol dropped about 0.24 mmol/L
  - Smoking rates showed a small decrease
- Results varied a lot between studies, making exact estimates uncertain.

Timeline and search
- Evidence came from studies found in major medical databases up to June 2006.

Safety
- This review did not report on harms from counseling or education programs.

Bottom line
- For the general population, multi‑risk counseling and education did not lower deaths or heart events.
- For people with high blood pressure or diabetes, these programs were linked to fewer deaths and heart events.
- Average improvements in blood pressure, cholesterol, and smoking were small, and study results differed widely."
44,"Background
During in vitro fertilisation (IVF) procedures, human preimplantation embryos are cultured in the laboratory. While some laboratories culture in an atmospheric oxygen concentration (˜ 20%), others use a lower concentration (˜ 5%) as this is more comparable to the oxygen concentration observed in the oviduct and the uterus. Animal studies have shown that high oxygen concentration could have a negative impact on embryo quality via reactive oxygen species causing oxidative stress. In humans, it is currently unknown which oxygen concentration provides the best success rates of IVF procedures, eventually resulting in the hightest birth rate of healthy newborns. 
Objectives
To determine whether embryo culture at low oxygen concentrations improves treatment outcome (better embryo development and more pregnancies and live births) in IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) as compared to embryo culture at atmospheric oxygen concentrations. 
Search methods
The Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO electronic databases were searched (up to 4th November 2011) for randomised controlled trials on the effect of low oxygen concentrations for human embryo culture. Furthermore, reference lists of all obtained studies were checked and conference abstracts handsearched. 
Selection criteria
Only truly randomised controlled trials comparing embryo culture at low oxygen concentrations (˜ 5%) with embryo culture at atmospheric oxygen concentrations (˜ 20%) were included in this systematic review and meta‐analysis. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors selected the trials for inclusion according to the above criteria. After that two authors independently extracted the data for subsequent analysis, and one author functioned as a referee in case of ambiguities. The statistical analysis was performed in accordance with the guidelines developed by The Cochrane Collaboration. 
Main results
Seven studies with a total of 2422 participants were included in this systematic review. Meta‐analysis could be performed with the data of four included studies, with a total of 1382 participants. The methodological quality of the included trials was relatively low. Evidence of a beneficial effect of culturing in low oxygen concentration was found for live birth rate (OR 1.39; 95% CI 1.11 to 1.76; P = 0.005; I2 = 0%); this would mean that a typical clinic could improve a 30% live birth rate using atmospheric oxygen concentration to somewhere between 32% and 43% by using a low oxygen concentration. The results were very similar for ongoing and clinical pregnancy rates. There was no evidence that culturing embryos under low oxygen concentrations resulted in higher numbers of adverse events such as multiple pregnancies, miscarriages or congenital abnormalities. 
Authors' conclusions
The results of this systematic review and meta‐analysis suggest that culturing embryos under conditions with low oxygen concentrations improves the success rates of IVF and ICSI, resulting in the birth of more healthy newborns.","Low oxygen concentrations for embryo culture in In vitro fertilisation
Couples who experience difficulty conceiving are commonly referred for assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) as a way to achieve pregnancy. Over 3.5 million babies have been born worldwide from IVF and ICSI procedures. One of the main focuses of research in reproductive medicine is to optimise the treatment success of IVF and ICSI procedures. One such area has focused on improving the in vitro environment to which human embryos are exposed before implantation into the uterus. An important component of this in vitro environment is the oxygen concentration. Traditionally, embryos have been cultured under atmospheric oxygen concentrations (˜ 20%), probably because culturing at lower oxygen concentration requires additional expenses. More recently there has been a shift towards the use of lower oxygen concentrations (˜ 5%) as these more closely resemble the oxygen concentration under natural conditions (2% to 8%). The results of clinical studies that have been undertaken to study the effect on the outcomes of IVF and ICSI procedures of culturing embryos under low oxygen concentrations have been conflicting. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta‐analysis of the literature to find the best available evidence. It has shown that culturing embryos under low oxygen concentrations does indeed improve clinical outcomes after IVF and ICSI, such as number of deliveries (live birth rate) and ongoing and clinical pregnancy rates. Furthermore, no evidence was found of an increased risk of adverse events such as multiple pregnancies, miscarriages and congenital abnormalities. We concluded that culturing embryos under low oxygen concentrations seems beneficial with an increase in the number of newborns, but more studies are needed to strongly prove this effect.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Oxygen Levels During Embryo Development in IVF

## What was this study about?

During in vitro fertilization (IVF), embryos are grown in a laboratory before being placed in the uterus. Researchers wanted to find out which oxygen level works best for growing these embryos. Some labs use regular room air (about 20% oxygen), while others use lower oxygen levels (about 5% oxygen), which is closer to what embryos experience naturally inside the body.

## Who was studied?

This review combined results from 7 studies that included 2,422 women undergoing IVF or a similar procedure called ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection).

## What did researchers compare?

They compared two approaches:
- Growing embryos in low oxygen (about 5%)
- Growing embryos in regular room air oxygen (about 20%)

## What were the main findings?

Growing embryos in low oxygen conditions led to better results:
- More babies were born alive. For example, if 30 out of 100 women typically have a baby using regular oxygen, then 32 to 43 out of 100 might have a baby using low oxygen.
- More women became pregnant and stayed pregnant

There was no increase in problems such as:
- Multiple pregnancies (twins, triplets)
- Miscarriages
- Birth defects

## What does this mean?

Using lower oxygen levels when growing embryos in the lab may improve IVF success rates and help more women have healthy babies.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the study

What was the question?
Does growing IVF/ICSI embryos in low oxygen (about 5%) lead to better results than growing them in normal air oxygen (about 20%)?

Who was studied?
People having IVF or ICSI. The review included 7 randomized controlled trials with 2,422 participants. Four trials (1,382 participants) had data that could be combined.

What did the researchers do?
- Compared two lab conditions for embryo growth:
  - Low oxygen: about 5%
  - Normal air oxygen: about 20%
- Looked for differences in pregnancy and birth outcomes.

What outcomes were measured?
- Live birth rate (main outcome)
- Ongoing and clinical pregnancy rates
- Safety: multiple pregnancy, miscarriage, and birth defects

What did they find?
- Low oxygen improved results:
  - Live birth odds were higher (OR 1.39; 95% CI 1.11–1.76).
  - Example: a clinic with a 30% live birth rate using normal air might see about 32% to 43% with low oxygen.
- Pregnancy rates showed similar improvement.
- Safety: No evidence of higher rates of multiple pregnancy, miscarriage, or birth defects with low oxygen.

How good is the evidence?
- Trials were randomized, but overall quality was relatively low.
- Results came from studies available up to November 4, 2011.

Bottom line
Growing embryos in lower oxygen (about 5%) during IVF/ICSI may increase the chance of a live birth without raising known risks, based on the studies available up to 2011. More high-quality research could help confirm these findings."
45,"Background
Current standard treatment for patients with cervical cancer who have locally advanced stage disease (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IIB to IVA) is concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT). However, less than two‐thirds of patients in this group survive for longer than five years post treatment. Adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) can be given in an attempt to improve survival by eradicating residual disease in the pelvis and treating occult disease outside the pelvic radiation field. However, inconsistency in trial design, inclusion criteria for participants, interventions and survival benefit has been noted among trials of ACT after CCRT for locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC). 
Objectives
To evaluate the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) after concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) on survival of women with locally advanced cervical cancer compared with CCRT alone. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Review Group Trial Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and conference proceedings to March 2014. We handsearched citation lists of relevant studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CCRT alone versus CCRT plus ACT were included. Patients were diagnosed with cervical cancer FIGO stage IIB to IVA with a histopathology of squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors (ST, KK) selected relevant trials, extracted data, assessed risk of bias independently, compared results and resolved disagreements by discussion. 
Main results
We identified two RCTs involving 978 women with cervical cancer stage IIB to IVA. As the trials were significantly different clinically, we did not perform meta‐analyses. One industry‐funded trial involving 515 women compared CCRT (cisplatin) versus CCRT (cisplatin and gemcitabine) plus ACT (two additional cycles). This trial reported significant improvement in progression‐free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in women who were given CCRT plus ACT compared with those treated with CCRT alone: Three‐year PFS was 74.4% versus 65.0% (hazard ratio (HR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 0.95, P value 0.027), and three‐year OS was 80% versus 69% (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.95, P value 0.022). However, as the CCRT chemotherapy differed between the two arms, we considered the findings to be at high risk of bias. 
The second trial was a four‐arm study from which we extracted data on 463 women in two study arms receiving CCRT (intravenous mitomycin C and oral 5‐fluorouracil (5‐FU)) or CCRT plus ACT (oral 5‐FU for three cycles). The HR for OS in women who received ACT after CCRT compared with the HR for OS in those who were given CCRT alone was 1.309 (95% CI 0.795 to 2.157), and the HR for disease‐free survival (DFS) was 1.125 (95% CI 0.799 to 1.586). 
Haematological adverse events were more common in the ACT arms of both trials. Quality of life (QoL) was not reported in either trial. 
Authors' conclusions
With limited data from only two trials, we found insufficient evidence to support the use of ACT after CCRT. Future large trials are required to demonstrate efficacy, toxicities and QoL.","Can additional chemotherapy after initial treatment for locally advanced stage cervical cancer reduce recurrence and extend life? 
The issue 
Standard treatment for locally advanced stage cervical cancer (stage IIB to IVA) is 'concurrent chemoradiation' when anticancer drugs are given during the same treatment period as pelvic radiotherapy (radiation therapy to lower abdomen). However, the tumour may remain (residual cancer) or may come back (recurrent cancer) after this standard treatment. This review evaluated whether giving additional anticancer drugs (ACTs) after standard treatment could help women with locally advanced cervical cancer to live longer compared with standard treatment alone. 
How we conducted the review 
We searched the literature to March 2014 and identified two randomised controlled trials comparing standard treatment versus standard treatment plus ACT in women with locally advanced cervical cancer. Two review authors assessed these studies and collected data independently. 
Findings 
The two studies were very different; therefore we could not pool their data. One trial conducted internationally between 2002 and 2004, involving 515 women, found that cancer took longer to return in women receiving ACT (cisplatin and gemcitabine), and more women in the ACT group were alive after three years than in the standard treatment group (80% versus 69%). We considered the findings to be at high risk of bias in this trial, as women were given different drugs during standard treatment, and so the overall effect of the study treatment could not be attributed to the ACT alone. The other trial, which was conducted in several hospitals in Thailand between 1988 and 1994, involved 463 women. ACT (5‐fluorouracil) did not improve the length of survival or the time taken for cancer to return in women in this trial. A trend towards increased side effects was reported in the ACT arms of both studies. 
Conclusions 
We found insufficient evidence to support giving additional anticancer drugs to women who have received standard treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer, as currently only limited data are available from two very different trials.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Chemotherapy After Standard Treatment for Advanced Cervical Cancer

## What was this study about?

Researchers wanted to find out if giving extra chemotherapy (cancer drugs) after standard treatment helps women with advanced cervical cancer live longer.

## What is the current standard treatment?

Women with cervical cancer that has spread locally (but not to distant parts of the body) typically receive:
- Radiation therapy (high-energy rays to kill cancer cells)
- Chemotherapy given at the same time as radiation

This combined treatment is called concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT). However, fewer than two out of three women survive more than five years after this treatment.

## What did researchers want to test?

They wanted to see if giving additional chemotherapy **after** completing the standard treatment would help women live longer by:
- Eliminating any remaining cancer cells in the pelvis
- Treating cancer that may have spread outside the pelvis but can't be seen

## What did they find?

Researchers found only 2 studies involving 978 women. The studies were too different to combine their results:

**Study 1 (515 women):** Women who received extra chemotherapy appeared to do better, but the study design made it hard to know if the extra chemotherapy was truly responsible for the improvement.

**Study 2 (463 women):** Extra chemotherapy did not appear to help women live longer.

Both studies found that women receiving extra chemotherapy had more blood-related side effects. Neither study measured quality of life.

## What does this mean?

There isn't enough evidence to know whether extra chemotherapy after standard treatment helps women with advanced cervical cancer. More research is needed.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What is this study about?
- Doctors often treat locally advanced cervical cancer (FIGO stages IIB–IVA) with chemoradiation given at the same time (called CCRT). Some add extra chemotherapy afterward (called adjuvant chemotherapy, or ACT) to try to help patients live longer.
- This review looked at whether adding ACT after CCRT helps women live longer compared with CCRT alone.

Who was included?
- Women with cervical cancer stages IIB–IVA.
- Cancer types: squamous cell, adenosquamous, adenocarcinoma, or undifferentiated carcinoma.

What treatments were compared?
- CCRT alone versus CCRT followed by ACT.
- Two randomized trials (total 978 women) were found.
  - Trial 1 (515 women): CCRT with cisplatin compared to CCRT with cisplatin plus gemcitabine, then 2 extra cycles of cisplatin plus gemcitabine (ACT).
  - Trial 2 (data from 463 women across two arms): CCRT with mitomycin C and 5‑fluorouracil (5‑FU) compared to the same CCRT plus 3 extra cycles of oral 5‑FU (ACT).

What outcomes were measured?
- Survival without the cancer getting worse (progression‑free or disease‑free survival).
- Overall survival (living longer overall).
- Side effects.
- Quality of life (not reported).

Key results and timelines
- Searches included studies up to March 2014.
- Trial 1 reported at 3 years:
  - Progression‑free survival: 74.4% with CCRT+ACT vs 65.0% with CCRT alone (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.49–0.95; P=0.027).
  - Overall survival: 80% with CCRT+ACT vs 69% with CCRT alone (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.49–0.95; P=0.022).
  - Important note: The two groups also received different chemotherapy during CCRT, which raises risk of bias.
- Trial 2:
  - No clear benefit from adding ACT after CCRT.
  - Overall survival HR 1.309 (95% CI 0.795–2.157).
  - Disease‑free survival HR 1.125 (95% CI 0.799–1.586).

Safety
- Blood-related side effects (like low blood counts) were more common when ACT was added.
- Quality of life was not reported.

Bottom line
- From only two trials with different designs, there is not enough clear evidence to support adding chemotherapy after CCRT for locally advanced cervical cancer.
- Larger, well-designed studies are needed to confirm benefits, side effects, and impact on quality of life."
46,"Background
Young women, especially adolescents, often lack access to modern contraception. Reasons vary by geography and regional politics and culture. The projected 2015 birth rate in 'developing' regions was 56 per 1000 compared with 17 per 1000 for 'developed' regions. 
Objectives
To identify school‐based interventions that improved contraceptive use among adolescents
Search methods
Until 6 June 2016, we searched for eligible trials in PubMed, CENTRAL, ERIC, Web of Science, POPLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP. 
Selection criteria
We considered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assigned individuals or clusters. The majority of participants must have been 19 years old or younger. 
The educational strategy must have occurred primarily in a middle school or high school. The intervention had to emphasize one or more effective methods of contraception. Our primary outcomes were pregnancy and contraceptive use. 
Data collection and analysis
We assessed titles and abstracts identified during the searches. One author extracted and entered the data into RevMan; a second author verified accuracy. We examined studies for methodological quality. 
For unadjusted dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the Mantel‐Haenszel odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). For cluster randomized trials, we used adjusted measures, e.g. OR, risk ratio, or difference in proportions. For continuous outcomes, we used the adjusted mean difference (MD) or other measures from the models. We did not conduct meta‐analysis due to varied interventions and outcome measures. 
Main results
The 11 trials included 10 cluster RCTs and an individually randomized trial. The cluster RCTs had sample sizes from 816 to 10,954; the median number of clusters was 24. Most trials were conducted in the USA and UK; one was from Mexico and one from South Africa. 
We focus here on the trials with moderate quality evidence and an intervention effect. Three addressed preventing pregnancy and HIV/STI through interactive sessions. One trial provided a multifaceted two‐year program. Immediately after year one and 12 months after year two, the intervention group was more likely than the standard‐curriculum group to report using effective contraception during last sex (reported adjusted ORs 1.62 ± standard error (SE) 0.22) and 1.76 ± SE 0.29), condom use during last sex (reported adjusted ORs 1.91 ± SE 0.27 and 1.68 ± SE 0.25), and less frequent sex without a condom in the past three months (reported ratios of adjusted means 0.50 ± SE 0.31 and 0.63 ± SE 0.23). Another trial compared multifaceted two‐year programs on sexual risk reduction and risk avoidance (abstinence‐focused) versus usual health education. At 3 months, the risk reduction group was less likely than the usual‐education group to report no condom use at last intercourse (reported adjusted OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.96) and sex without a condom in the last three months (reported adjusted OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.95). At 3 and after 15 months, the risk avoidance group was also less likely than the usual‐education group to report no condom use at last intercourse (reported adjusted ORs 0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.93; and 0.61, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.85). At the same time points, the risk reduction group had a higher score than the usual‐education group for condom knowledge. The third trial provided a peer‐led program with eight interactive sessions. At 17 months, the intervention group was less likely than the teacher‐led group to report oral contraceptive use during last sex (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.91). This difference may not have been significant if the investigators had adjusted for the clustering. At 5 and 17 months, the peer‐led group had a greater mean increase in knowledge of HIV and pregnancy prevention compared with the control group. An additional trial showed an effect on knowledge only. The group with an emergency contraception (EC) session was more likely than the group without the EC unit to know the time limits for using hormonal EC (pill) and the non‐hormonal IUD as EC. 
Authors' conclusions
Since most trials addressed preventing STI/HIV and pregnancy, they emphasized condom use. However, several studies covered a range of contraceptive methods. The overall quality of evidence was low. Main reasons for downgrading the evidence were having limited information on intervention fidelity, analyzing a subsample rather than all those randomized, and having high losses.","School‐based programs to improve birth control use among adolescents
Background 
Adolescents have high rates of unplanned pregnancy. They may not have family planning services nearby or know how to get modern birth control. We wanted to find programs in schools that helped teenagers learn about birth control. 
Methods 
We did computer searches for randomized trials until 6 June 2016. Programs included in this review must have occurred in a school, such as a middle school or high school. The programs tried to improve birth control use among teenagers. They also had to emphasize one or more methods of birth control known to work well. 
Results 
We found 11 trials. One study was small, and the other 10 had 816 to 10,954 participants. Six studies were from the USA, three were from the UK, and one each came from Mexico and South Africa. We focus here on three programs that had some effect and were good quality. All three involved students in a variety of activities versus usual sex education. After a two‐year program, the intervention group reported more use of birth control as well as condoms during last sex than the group with standard classes. Another study lasting two years provided two different programs. The intent was to avoid risk by not having sex until marriage or to reduce risk by delaying sex until older. The control group had usual health education. The programs for avoiding risk and reducing risk showed fewer reports of sex without using birth control or condoms. The third study had peers lead eight sessions of educational activities. The program showed less birth control use compared with teacher education but the researchers did not adjust for the study design. 
Of the other eight studies, one had good quality results. The intervention group knew the time limits for using emergency contraception. Six of seven studies with low or very low quality results reported some program effect, such as more condom or contraceptive use or more knowledge of condoms. 
Authors' conclusions 
Since most trials aimed to prevent STI/HIV and pregnancy, they focused on condom use. However, several studies covered a variety of birth control methods. The overall quality of results was low. Some trials lacked information on how their programs worked. Many analyzed subsamples rather than all students in the study, and most had high losses.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: School Programs to Help Teens Use Birth Control

## What Was This Study About?

Researchers looked at school programs designed to help teenagers learn about and use birth control. Teen pregnancy rates are much higher in developing countries (56 births per 1,000 teens) compared to developed countries (17 per 1,000 teens). Young people, especially teens, often have trouble getting birth control for various reasons.

## What Did Researchers Do?

They searched for studies through June 2016 that tested birth control education programs in middle schools and high schools. They found 11 studies that met their requirements. Most were from the United States and United Kingdom, with one each from Mexico and South Africa. The studies included between 816 and nearly 11,000 students.

## What Did They Find?

Several programs showed positive results:

- **Two-year interactive program**: Students who participated were more likely to use effective birth control and condoms during sex compared to students receiving standard health classes. These differences lasted up to 12 months after the program ended.

- **Risk reduction vs. abstinence programs**: Both approaches led to more condom use compared to regular health education. Students also learned more about proper condom use.

- **Peer-led sessions**: When other students led eight interactive sessions, participants gained more knowledge about preventing HIV and pregnancy compared to teacher-led classes.

- **Emergency contraception education**: Students who learned about emergency contraception better understood when and how to use it.

## What Does This Mean?

School-based programs can help teens learn about birth control and increase their use of condoms and other methods. However, the quality of evidence was limited because some studies had incomplete information or lost track of many participants over time.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of school-based programs to improve birth control use in teens

What was the goal?
- To find out which school programs help teens use effective birth control.

Who was studied?
- Middle and high school students, most age 19 or younger.
- Studies took place mostly in the USA and UK, plus one in Mexico and one in South Africa.

What did researchers do?
- They looked for randomized controlled trials (the strongest type of study) up to June 6, 2016.
- They found 11 trials (10 were done by school groups or classes, 1 by individual students).
- Group sizes ranged from 816 to 10,954 students.

What were the programs?
- Classes were held mainly in schools.
- Programs taught about condoms and other effective birth control methods. Some also covered preventing HIV/STIs.
- Types included:
  - Multifaceted, two-year programs with interactive lessons.
  - Programs focused on reducing sexual risk or on risk avoidance (abstinence-focused).
  - Peer-led programs with eight interactive sessions.
  - A single session on emergency contraception (EC).

What outcomes were measured?
- Main outcomes: pregnancy and use of effective birth control.
- Other outcomes: condom use, sex without a condom, and knowledge about contraception and condoms.
- Because programs and measures differed, results were not combined into one overall estimate.

Key findings (moderate-quality evidence trials)
- Two-year, interactive programs:
  - Students were more likely to report using effective birth control and condoms at last sex.
  - Students reported fewer times having sex without a condom.
  - Some benefits were seen right after year 1 and about a year after year 2.

- Risk reduction vs usual health education:
  - At about 3 months, students in risk reduction were less likely to report no condom use at last sex and less likely to report sex without a condom in the last 3 months.
  - Knowledge about condoms was higher at 3 and 15 months.

- Risk avoidance (abstinence-focused) vs usual health education:
  - At about 3 and 15 months, students were less likely to report no condom use at last sex.

- Peer-led program:
  - At about 17 months, students were less likely to report using the birth control pill at last sex compared with a teacher-led group.
  - The peer-led group showed bigger gains in knowledge at 5 and 17 months.

- Emergency contraception session:
  - Students were more likely to know the time limits for using EC pills and an IUD for EC.

Timing
- Follow-ups ranged from 3 months to 2 years, with some checks 12 months after year two, and at 15 or 17 months.

Safety
- These were school education programs, not medical treatments. No safety issues were reported.

Limits to the evidence
- Overall evidence quality was low.
- Common problems: not enough detail on how well programs were delivered, analyzing only part of the students who were assigned, and many students lost to follow-up.

Bottom line
- Some school-based, interactive programs can improve reported condom use and knowledge about birth control in teens.
- Evidence on pregnancy outcomes was limited, and overall study quality was low.
- Programs that are longer and multifaceted may help, but stronger studies are needed."
47,"Background
Coenzyme Q10, or ubiquinone, is a non‐prescription nutritional supplement. It is a fat‐soluble molecule that acts as an electron carrier in mitochondria, and as a coenzyme for mitochondrial enzymes. Coenzyme Q10 deficiency may be associated with a multitude of diseases, including heart failure. The severity of heart failure correlates with the severity of coenzyme Q10 deficiency. Emerging data suggest that the harmful effects of reactive oxygen species are increased in people with heart failure, and coenzyme Q10 may help to reduce these toxic effects because of its antioxidant activity. Coenzyme Q10 may also have a role in stabilising myocardial calcium‐dependent ion channels, and in preventing the consumption of metabolites essential for adenosine‐5'‐triphosphate (ATP) synthesis. Coenzyme Q10, although not a primary recommended treatment, could be beneficial to people with heart failure. Several randomised controlled trials have compared coenzyme Q10 to other therapeutic modalities, but no systematic review of existing randomised trials was conducted prior to the original version of this Cochrane Review, in 2014. 
Objectives
To review the safety and efficacy of coenzyme Q10 in heart failure.
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL Plus, and AMED on 16 October 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov on 16 July 2020, and the ISRCTN Registry on 11 November 2019. We applied no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials of either parallel or cross‐over design that assessed the beneficial and harmful effects of coenzyme Q10 in people with heart failure. When we identified cross‐over studies, we considered data only from the first phase. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methods, assessed study risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and GRADE methods to assess the quality of the evidence. For dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR); for continuous data, the mean difference (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where appropriate data were available, we conducted meta‐analysis. When meta‐analysis was not possible, we wrote a narrative synthesis. We provided a PRISMA flow chart to show the flow of study selection. 
Main results
We included eleven studies, with 1573 participants, comparing coenzyme Q10 to placebo or conventional therapy (control). In the majority of the studies, sample size was relatively small. There were important differences among studies in daily coenzyme Q10 dose, follow‐up period, and the measures of treatment effect. All studies had unclear, or high risk of bias, or both, in one or more bias domains. We were only able to conduct meta‐analysis for some of the outcomes. None of the included trials considered quality of life, measured on a validated scale, exercise variables (exercise haemodynamics), or cost‐effectiveness. 
Coenzyme Q10 probably reduces the risk of all‐cause mortality more than control (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.95; 1 study, 420 participants; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 13.3; moderate‐quality evidence). 
There was low‐quality evidence of inconclusive results between the coenzyme Q10 and control groups for the risk of myocardial infarction (RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.27 to 9.59; 1 study, 420 participants), and stroke (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.48; 1 study, 420 participants). 
Coenzyme Q10 probably reduces hospitalisation related to heart failure (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.78; 2 studies, 1061 participants; NNTB 9.7; moderate‐quality evidence). 
Very low‐quality evidence suggests that coenzyme Q10 may improve the left ventricular ejection fraction (MD 1.77, 95% CI 0.09 to 3.44; 7 studies, 650 participants), but the results are inconclusive for exercise capacity (MD 48.23, 95% CI ‐24.75 to 121.20; 3 studies, 91 participants); and the risk of developing adverse events (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.10; 2 studies, 568 participants). 
We downgraded the quality of the evidence mainly due to high risk of bias and imprecision.
Authors' conclusions
The included studies provide moderate‐quality evidence that coenzyme Q10 probably reduces all‐cause mortality and hospitalisation for heart failure. There is low‐quality evidence of inconclusive results as to whether coenzyme Q10 has an effect on the risk of myocardial infarction, or stroke. Because of very low‐quality evidence, it is very uncertain whether coenzyme Q10 has an effect on either left ventricular ejection fraction or exercise capacity. There is low‐quality evidence that coenzyme Q10 may increase the risk of adverse effects, or have little to no difference. 
There is currently no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of coenzyme Q10 for heart failure. Future trials are needed to confirm our findings.","Coenzyme Q10 for heart failure
Heart failure is a term used to describe the state that develops when the heart cannot maintain adequate cardiac output, or can do so only at the expense of overfilling the heart chambers. People with heart failure commonly experience a relapsing and remitting disease course, with periods of stability and episodes of decompensation (failure to cope with heart damage), leading to worsening symptoms that necessitate hospitalisation. 
Treatment options for heart failure range from drugs to heart transplantation, with each having its own limitations. Coenzyme Q10 (or ubiquinone) has been suggested as a treatment option in some trials. Coenzyme Q10 is a non‐prescription nutritional supplement. It is a fat‐soluble molecule that has a role in energy production within the cells of the body. It may also have antioxidant properties. 
Low levels of coenzyme Q10 may be related to the severity of heart failure. Coenzyme Q10 has been found in all tissues and organs in the body, with the highest concentrations in the heart. Emerging data have suggested that the harmful effects of reactive oxygen species (unstable molecules that contains oxygen and easily reacts with other molecules) are increased in people with heart failure. Because of its antioxidant activity, coenzyme Q10 may help to reduce these toxic effects, which damage the components of the cardiac cells, and disrupt cellular signalling. Coenzyme Q10 plays an important role in conducting signals within the heart muscle and in generating energy.The concentration of coenzyme Q10 has been inversely related to the severity of heart failure. Supplementation with coenzyme Q10 may improve heart failure. Coenzyme Q10 is sometimes used because it is thought to have an acceptable safety profile, with no significant side effects. 
We conducted this review to assess the available evidence on the effects of coenzyme Q10 in people with heart failure. We included 11 randomised controlled trials, involving 1573 participants. They were relatively small, and followed up participants for a relatively short period of time. The analyses show that coenzyme Q10 probably reduces the risk of mortality from all causes, and hospitalisations due to heart failure. It may result in increased, or little or no difference in the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or adverse events. The effect of coenzyme Q10 on cardiac function and symptom improvement is uncertain. 
The evidence, current to October 2020, is of a moderate quality at best, because of the high risk of bias in some of the included studies and the absence of precise and consistent results. There is currently no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of coenzyme Q10 for heart failure.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Coenzyme Q10 for Heart Failure

## What was studied?
Researchers reviewed studies on Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), a nutritional supplement available without a prescription, to see if it helps people with heart failure. CoQ10 is a natural substance that helps cells produce energy and may protect against cell damage.

## Who was studied?
The review included 1,573 adults with heart failure from 11 different studies.

## What did participants receive?
Participants received either:
- Coenzyme Q10 supplements (in varying daily doses), or
- Placebo (inactive pill) or standard heart failure treatment

The length of treatment varied across studies.

## What did researchers measure?
Researchers looked at:
- Deaths from any cause
- Hospital stays for heart failure
- Heart attacks and strokes
- How well the heart pumps blood
- Exercise ability
- Side effects

## What were the main findings?

**Possible benefits:**
- CoQ10 may reduce the risk of death (1 study, 420 people)
- CoQ10 may reduce hospital stays for heart failure (2 studies, 1,061 people)
- CoQ10 might slightly improve how well the heart pumps, but results were uncertain

**Unclear results:**
- Not enough evidence to know if CoQ10 affects the risk of heart attacks or strokes
- Unclear if CoQ10 improves exercise ability
- Unclear if CoQ10 causes side effects

## What are the limitations?
- Most studies were small
- Studies used different doses and treatment lengths
- The quality of evidence was limited due to how the studies were designed
- More research is needed to confirm these findings

## Bottom line
CoQ10 might help reduce deaths and hospital stays in people with heart failure, but the evidence is not strong enough to make firm recommendations. More high-quality studies are needed.",0,Plano,"Plain‑Language Summary: Coenzyme Q10 for Heart Failure

What is being studied
- Whether taking coenzyme Q10 (a dietary supplement) helps people with heart failure.
- How safe it is to take.

Who was included
- Adults with heart failure who took part in randomized controlled trials.

What was done
- Researchers reviewed 11 clinical trials with 1,573 people.
- Coenzyme Q10 was compared to placebo or usual care.
- Doses and follow‑up times were different across studies.

Main outcomes measured
- Death from any cause
- Hospital stays due to heart failure
- Heart attack and stroke
- Heart pumping measure (left ventricular ejection fraction)
- Exercise capacity
- Side effects
- Quality of life and costs (not reported in these trials)

Key results
- Death from any cause: Probably lower with coenzyme Q10 (moderate‑quality evidence). In one study of 420 people, about 1 in 13 people might benefit.
- Hospital stays for heart failure: Probably lower with coenzyme Q10 (moderate‑quality evidence). In two studies (1,061 people), about 1 in 10 people might avoid a hospitalization.
- Heart attack and stroke: Results uncertain (low‑quality evidence).
- Heart pumping (ejection fraction): May improve slightly, but results are very uncertain (very low‑quality evidence).
- Exercise capacity: Results uncertain (very low‑quality evidence).
- Side effects: May be similar or slightly fewer with coenzyme Q10, but results are uncertain (low‑ to very low‑quality evidence).

Quality and limits of the evidence
- Many studies were small and had risks of bias.
- Not all outcomes could be combined for analysis.
- Quality of life, detailed exercise measures, and costs were not reported.
- Overall, evidence ranges from very low to moderate quality.

Timing
- Studies were identified up to October 2020.
- Follow‑up times varied by study.

Safety
- No clear increase in side effects was found, but the evidence is uncertain.

Bottom line
- Coenzyme Q10 may lower deaths and hospital stays in heart failure, but the evidence is not strong enough to make firm recommendations.
- Better, larger trials are needed to confirm benefits and clarify safety."
48,"Background
Development of cancer of the cervix is a multi‐step process as before cervical cancer develops, cervical cells undergo changes and become abnormal. These abnormalities are called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and are associated with increased risk of subsequent invasive cancer of the cervix. Oncogenic high‐risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV), the causative agent of cervical cancer and its precursor lesions, is present in up to one‐third of women following large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) treatment and is associated with increased risk of residual disease and disease recurrence. HPV testing may serve as a surveillance tool for identifying women at higher risk of recurrence. High‐risk human papillomavirus testing will enable us to identify women at increased risk of residual or recurrent CIN and therefore will allow us to offer closer surveillance and early treatment, when indicated. 
Objectives
• To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of hrHPV testing after large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) treatment • To determine optimal follow‐up management strategies following LLETZ treatment according to hrHPV status 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Gynacological Cancer Review Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed and PsycINFO up to August 2013. We searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings and reference lists of included studies, and we contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
We searched for randomised control trials (RCTs) that compared follow‐up management strategies following LLETZ treatment for CIN. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed whether potentially relevant studies met the inclusion criteria. No trials were found; therefore no data were analysed. 
Main results
The search identified 813 references on MEDLINE, 418 on EMBASE, 22 on CINAHL, 666 on PubMed, 291 on PsycINFO and 145 on CENTRAL. When all references were imported into EndNote and duplications were removed, 1348 references remained. Initial screening of titles and abstracts of these references revealed that 42 references were potentially eligible for this review. After reading the full‐text versions, we identified no relevant trials comparing hrHPV and cytology testing versus cytology testing alone for detecting residual or recurrent disease during follow‐up to LLETZ treatment of adult women with CIN. 
We found no evidence on the effects of hrHPV and cytology testing on residual or recurrent CIN2 or higher lesions, anxiety and psychosexual morbidity outcomes in women undergoing colposcopy and treatment for CIN. 
Authors' conclusions
We found no evidence from RCTs to inform decisions about the best surveillance strategy for women following treatment for CIN. A prognostic systematic review is needed to investigate the risk of developing recurrent cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2+ (CIN2+) in women with a positive hrHPV test after large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) treatment.","Follow‐up strategies for women following treatment for CIN: Impact of HPV testing
Background 
It is widely accepted that infection with high‐risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) is associated with development of precancerous changes, namely, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer. It is also accepted that women who develop high‐grade CIN and subsequently receive treatment with a procedure called large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ), which uses a wire loop to remove abnormal cells, are at greater risk for developing further CIN than women who have never had CIN. Therefore, these women need regular follow‐up assessment to detect additional abnormalities. 
Main findings 
We searched for randomised control trials (RCTs) that compared follow‐up management strategies following LLETZ treatment for CIN. We checked 1348 titles and abstracts of potentially relevant references, but we identified no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that met our inclusion criteria. We identified trials of interest, but they were deemed not relevant because of their focus on diagnostic outcomes and examination of how sensitive tests are, rather than on the effects of different follow‐up strategies on long‐term outcomes. Currently no evidence indicates whether hrHPV post‐treatment testing is better or worse in terms of important long‐term clinical outcomes. This review highlights the need for good quality trials in this area that do not focus solely on the diagnostic accuracy of testing. 
Conclusion 
We found no evidence from RCTs to inform decisions about the best surveillance strategy following treatment for CIN. A prognostic systematic review is needed to investigate the risks and benefits of different follow‐up strategies for women after LLETZ treatment.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Testing for HPV After Treatment for Abnormal Cervical Cells

## What was this review about?

Researchers looked for studies that tested different ways to monitor women after they received treatment for abnormal cervical cells. The treatment studied was called LLETZ (a procedure that removes abnormal cells from the cervix using a small wire loop).

## Why is this important?

Before cervical cancer develops, cells in the cervix can become abnormal. These changes are linked to a virus called high-risk HPV. Even after treatment to remove abnormal cells, some women still have the virus, which can increase their chances of the problem coming back. Testing for this virus after treatment might help doctors identify which women need closer monitoring.

## What did the researchers want to find out?

The researchers wanted to know:
- Whether testing for high-risk HPV after LLETZ treatment is effective and safe
- What the best way is to monitor women after LLETZ treatment based on their HPV test results

## What did they find?

The researchers searched medical databases and found over 1,300 articles to review. However, they could not find any studies that properly compared different monitoring approaches after LLETZ treatment.

## What does this mean?

There is currently no research evidence from quality studies to guide doctors on the best way to monitor women after treatment for abnormal cervical cells. More research is needed to understand which women are at higher risk for abnormal cells returning and how best to follow up with them.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What this study looked at
- Researchers wanted to know if testing for high‑risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) after treatment with LLETZ helps find returning abnormal cervical cells earlier and more safely than standard follow‑up.
- They also wanted to find the best follow‑up plan after LLETZ based on a woman’s hrHPV test result.

Who this applies to
- Adult women who had LLETZ treatment for abnormal cervical cells (called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, or CIN).

Why this matters
- Some women still have hrHPV after LLETZ (up to about one‑third). This may mean a higher chance of abnormal cells coming back.
- Testing for hrHPV after treatment might help identify women who need closer follow‑up.

What was compared
- Follow‑up that includes hrHPV testing plus Pap/cytology tests
- Versus Pap/cytology testing alone

Outcomes the researchers wanted to measure
- Residual or returning high‑grade abnormal cells (CIN2+)
- Anxiety and sexual well‑being
- Safety of follow‑up strategies

What they did
- Searched many medical databases and trial registers up to August 2013 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on this question.

What they found
- No RCTs were found that directly compared hrHPV+cytology versus cytology alone after LLETZ.
- Because no trials met the criteria, there were no results to analyze for effectiveness, safety, anxiety, or sexual well‑being.

What this means
- There is no RCT evidence to guide the best follow‑up strategy after LLETZ based on hrHPV testing.
- More research is needed, especially studies that track the risk of CIN2+ returning in women who test positive for hrHPV after LLETZ.

Timeline
- Evidence search covered studies available up to August 2013.

Safety
- Safety was a planned outcome, but no eligible trials were found, so no safety conclusions can be made."
49,"Background
Intramedullary nailing is commonly used for treating fractures of the tibial shaft. These fractures are one of the most common long bone fractures in adults. 
Objectives
To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of different methods and types of intramedullary nailing for treating tibial shaft fractures in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and reference lists of articles to December 2009. The search was subsequently updated to September 2011 to assess the more recent literature. 
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled clinical studies evaluating different methods and types of intramedullary nailing for treating tibial shaft fractures in adults were included. Primary outcomes were health‐related quality of life, patient‐reported function and re‐operation for treatment failure or complications. 
Data collection and analysis
At least two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment, and data collection and extraction. 
Main results
Nine randomised and two quasi‐randomised clinical trials, involving a total of 2093 participants with 2123 fractures, were included. The evidence was dominated by one large multicentre trial of 1319 participants. Both quasi‐randomised trials were at high risk of selection bias. Otherwise, the trials were generally at low or unclear risk of bias. There were very few data on functional outcomes; and often incomplete data on re‐operations. The trials evaluated five different comparisons of interventions: reamed versus unreamed intramedullary nailing (six trials); Ender nail versus interlocking nail (two trials); expandable nail versus interlocking nail (one trial); interlocking nail with one distal screw versus with two distal screws (one trial); and closed nailing via the transtendinous approach versus the paratendinous approach (one trial). 
No statistically significant differences were found between the reamed and unreamed nailing groups in 'major' re‐operations (66/789 versus 72/756; risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 1.21; 5 trials), or in the secondary outcomes of nonunion, pain, deep infection, malunion and compartment syndrome. While inconclusive, the evidence from a subgroup analysis suggests that reamed nailing is more likely to reduce the incidence of major re‐operations related to non‐union in closed fractures than in open fractures. Implant failure, such as broken screws, occurred less often in the reamed nailing group (35/789 versus 79/756; RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.61). 
There was insufficient evidence established to determine the effects of interlocking nail with one distal screw versus with two distal screws, interlocking nail versus expandable nail and paratendinous approach versus transtendinous approach for treating tibial shaft fractures in adults. 
Ender nails when compared with an interlocking nail in two trials resulted in a higher re‐operation rate (12/110 versus 3/128; RR 4.43, 95% CI 1.37 to 14.32) and more malunions. There were no statistically significant differences between the two devices in the other reported secondary outcomes of nonunion, deep infection, and implant failure. 
One trial found a lower re‐operation rate for an expandable nail when compared with an interlocking nail (1/27 versus 9/26; RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.79). The differences between the two nails in the incidence of deep infection or neurological defects were not statistically significant. 
The trial comparing one distal screw versus two distal screws found no statistically significant difference in nonunion between the two groups. However, it found significantly more implant failures in the one distal screw group (13/22 versus 1/20; RR 11.82, 95% CI 1.70 to 82.38). 
One trial found no statistically significant differences in functional outcomes or anterior knee pain at three year follow‐up between the transtendinous approach and the paratendinous approach for nail insertion. 
Authors' conclusions
Overall, there is insufficient evidence to draw definitive conclusions on the best type of, or technique for, intramedullary nailing for tibial shaft fractures in adults. 'Moderate' quality evidence suggests that there is no clear difference in the rate of major re‐operations and complications between reamed and unreamed intramedullary nailing. Reamed intramedullary nailing has, however, a lower incidence of implant failure than unreamed nailing. 'Low' quality evidence suggests that reamed nailing may reduce the incidence of major re‐operations related to non‐union in closed fractures rather than in open fractures. 'Low' quality evidence suggests that the Ender nail has poorer results in terms of re‐operation and malunion than an interlocking nail.","Intramedullary nailing treat tibial shaft fractures in adults
Fractures of the tibial shaft (breaks in the bone situated in the long middle section of the tibia or shin bone) are mostly caused by high‐energy trauma, such as motor vehicle accidents. One commonly used method of fixation is intramedullary nailing. This involves the insertion of a metal rod, usually from the upper side of the tibia, into the inner cavity (medulla) of the tibia. The rod is generally held in place by screws. An available and widely used surgical technique of intramedullary nailing is inserting intramedullary nails with reaming (the bone cavity is reamed, before inserting the nail into the bone cavity space) or without reaming. This review looked at the evidence from trials comparing various types of intramedullary nailing. 
Eleven studies involving a total of 2093 participants were included. The evidence was dominated by one large multicentre trial of 1319 participants. The methods of two studies were flawed such that their results were likely to be biased. The remaining studies were at a lower risk of bias. The trials evaluated five different comparisons of interventions. Only the two comparisons tested by more than one trial are reported here. These were reamed versus unreamed intramedullary nailing (six trials) and Ender nail versus interlocking nail (two trials). The review found no evidence of a significant difference between reamed and unreamed intramedullary nailing in re‐operations for complications, nor in various complications such as nonunion (where the bone fails to heal). However, reamed nailing was more associated with a lower implant failure, such as broken screws, than unreamed nailing. Moreover, there was some weak evidence that reamed nailing may be associated with fewer major re‐operations for non‐union when used for closed fractures (where the skin remains intact) compared with open (where the skin is broken) fractures. The review also found that the Ender nail resulted in more re‐operations and deformity (malunion) than an interlocking nail. The review concluded that there is insufficient evidence to draw definitive conclusions on the best type of, or technique for, intramedullary nailing for tibial shaft fractures in adults.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Different Methods of Intramedullary Nailing for Broken Shinbones in Adults

## What was this study about?

Researchers reviewed studies comparing different ways to fix broken shinbones (tibia) in adults. The tibia is the larger bone in the lower leg, and breaks in the middle part of this bone are common injuries. Doctors often treat these breaks by inserting a metal rod (called an intramedullary nail) down the center of the bone to hold it in place while it heals.

## What did the researchers look for?

The researchers searched medical databases through September 2011 for studies that compared different types of rods and different techniques for inserting them. They found 11 studies involving 2,093 people with 2,123 broken shinbones.

## What did they compare?

The studies looked at five different comparisons:
- **Reamed vs. unreamed nailing** (6 studies): Reaming means widening the bone canal before inserting the rod
- **Ender nail vs. interlocking nail** (2 studies): Different types of rods
- **Expandable nail vs. interlocking nail** (1 study)
- **One screw vs. two screws** at the bottom of the rod (1 study)
- **Two different surgical approaches** for inserting the rod (1 study)

## What were the main findings?

**Reamed vs. unreamed nailing:**
- No clear difference in the need for additional surgeries or major complications
- Reamed nailing had fewer broken screws and hardware problems
- Reamed nailing might work better for closed fractures (where skin isn't broken) than open fractures

**Ender nail vs. interlocking nail:**
- Ender nails required more follow-up surgeries and had more healing problems with bone alignment

**One screw vs. two screws:**
- Using only one screw led to more hardware failures

**Other comparisons:**
- Not enough information to draw conclusions

## What does this mean?

There isn't enough evidence to say definitively which method is best for fixing broken shinbones. However, reamed and unreamed nailing appear similarly safe overall, though reamed nailing has fewer hardware problems. Interlocking nails appear better than Ender nails, and using two screws seems better than one.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the research

What was studied
- This review looked at different ways to use intramedullary nails (metal rods placed inside the bone) to treat broken tibia shafts in adults.
- Goal: Find out which nail type or technique works best and is safest.

Who was included
- Adults with tibial shaft fractures.
- Evidence came from 11 clinical trials with 2,093 people and 2,123 fractures. One large trial included 1,319 people.

What treatments were compared
- Reamed vs. unreamed nails (reamed means the bone canal is widened before placing the nail).
- Ender nails vs. interlocking nails.
- Expandable nails vs. interlocking nails.
- One distal screw vs. two distal screws to lock the nail.
- Two ways to insert the nail at the knee: through the tendon (transtendinous) vs. beside the tendon (paratendinous).

Main outcomes measured
- Need for another surgery (re-operation) because of problems.
- Patient-reported function and quality of life.
- Bone not healing (nonunion), bone healing in the wrong position (malunion), pain, deep infection, compartment syndrome, implant breakage or failure, nerve problems, and knee pain.
- Follow-up in some trials lasted up to 3 years.

Key results
- Reamed vs. unreamed nails:
  - No clear difference in major re-operations or in nonunion, pain, deep infection, malunion, or compartment syndrome.
  - Fewer implant failures (like broken screws) with reamed nails.
  - Low-quality evidence suggests reamed nails may lower re-operations due to nonunion in closed fractures more than in open fractures.

- Ender vs. interlocking nails:
  - Ender nails had more re-operations and more malunions.
  - No clear differences in nonunion, deep infection, or implant failure.

- Expandable vs. interlocking nails:
  - One small trial showed fewer re-operations with expandable nails.
  - No clear differences in deep infection or nerve problems.

- One vs. two distal screws:
  - No clear difference in nonunion.
  - More implant failures with one screw than with two.

- Transtendinous vs. paratendinous approach:
  - No clear differences in function or front-of-knee pain at 3 years.

Safety
- Overall, serious problems like deep infection were uncommon and similar between groups in most comparisons.
- Reamed nails had fewer implant breakages than unreamed.
- Using two distal screws reduced implant failure compared with one screw.

Quality and limits of the evidence
- Evidence quality ranged from moderate to low.
- Some trials had risk of bias, and data on patient-reported outcomes were limited.
- Searches included studies up to September 2011.

Bottom line
- There is not enough strong evidence to name one best nail type or technique for all adults with tibial shaft fractures.
- Reamed nails likely reduce implant failure compared with unreamed nails.
- Ender nails had worse results than interlocking nails.
- Using two distal screws appears safer for the implant than one screw."
50,"Background
High intake of added sugar have been suggested to impact the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Knowledge on the subject can contribute to preventing CVD. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of a high versus low‐added sugar consumption for primary prevention of CVD in the general population. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science (CPCI‐S) on 2 July 2021. We also conducted a search of ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal for ongoing or unpublished trials. The search was performed together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We imposed no restriction on language of publication or publication status. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cross‐over trials, that compared different levels of added sugar intake. Exclusion criteria were: participants aged below 18 years; diabetes mellitus (type 1 and 2); and previous CVD. Primary outcomes were incident cardiovascular events (coronary, carotid, cerebral and peripheral arterial disease) and all‐cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL‐cholesterol, HDL‐cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose and adverse events (gastrointestinal symptoms and impaired dental health). 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We included 21 RCTs (1110 participants completing the interventions) examining the effects of different levels of added sugar intake with a mean duration of 14 weeks. The study participants were generally described as healthy and the mean age ranged from 22 to 57 years. 
No studies reported on cardiovascular events or all‐cause mortality. There was minimal effect of low intake of added sugar on total cholesterol levels (MD 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.21; I² = 0%; 16 studies; 763 participants; low certainty of evidence) and triglycerides (MD 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.17; I² = 3%; 14 studies; 725 participants) but no evidence of effect on LDL‐cholesterol and HDL‐cholesterol. There was minimal effect on diastolic blood pressure (MD 1.52, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.37; I² = 0%; 13 studies; 873 participants) and on systolic blood pressure (MD 1.44, 95% 0.08 to 2.80; I² = 27%, 14 studies; 873 participants; low certainty of evidence), but no evidence of effect on fasting plasma glucose. 
Only one study reported on dental health, with no events. No other trials reported adverse events (impaired dental health or gastrointestinal symptoms). 
All results were judged as low‐quality evidence according to GRADE. The risk of bias was generally unclear, five studies were classified at an overall low risk of bias (low risk in at least four domains, not including other bias). 
Authors' conclusions
No trials investigating the effect of added sugar on cardiovascular events or all‐cause mortality were identified in our searches. Evidence is uncertain whether low intake of added sugar has an effect on risk factors for CVD; the effect was small and the clinical relevance is, therefore, uncertain. Practical ways to achieve reductions in dietary added sugar includes following current dietary recommendations. 
Future trials should have longer follow‐up time and report on all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular events in order to clarify the effect of added sugar on these outcomes. Future trials should also aim for more direct interventions and preferably be more independent of industry funding.","Low levels of sugar to prevent cardiovascular disease
Background 
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a group of disorders affecting the heart and blood vessels and the number one cause of death worldwide. It is important to detect modifiable risk factors and find strategies to prevent CVD. There are several established modifiable risk factors for developing CVD, one of them being eating an unhealthy diet rich in sugar. Sugar can be divided in two categories; sugars naturally occurring in food and sugars that are added to food. A high level of added sugar intake is suggested to cause weight gain and affect blood lipids, increasing the risk of CVD. This review assessed different levels of added sugars in the diet and the effect on cardiovascular events (e.g. heart attack or stroke), death, and CVD risk factors in healthy adults. 
Study characteristics 
Databases for randomised controlled trials (clinical trials in which participants are randomly assigned to either an experimental or a control treatment) were searched. The trials that were included compared different levels of added sugar intake and its effect on risk factors for CVD in healthy adults. People with previous CVD or diabetes were not included in the review. 
Key results 
Twenty‐one trials were found with 1110 participants. None of the trials looked at cardiovascular events or death. The trials reported on blood pressure, blood lipid levels and blood sugar levels. The review found that low levels of added sugar intake led to a small reduction in blood pressure and blood lipid levels, but no effect was seen on blood sugar. The evidence is current to July 2021. 
Quality of the evidence 
The studies included in the review provide low‐quality evidence that low levels of added sugar in the diet indirectly reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease. More long‐term studies of high quality assessing effects of different levels of sugar on CVD risk factors, cardiovascular events and death are needed.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Study on Added Sugar and Heart Health

## What was this study about?

Researchers wanted to find out if eating less added sugar could help prevent heart and blood vessel disease in healthy adults. Added sugars are sweeteners put into foods and drinks during processing or preparation, like sugar in soda, candy, or baked goods.

## What did the researchers do?

The research team searched medical databases through July 2021 to find studies that compared people eating high amounts of added sugar versus low amounts. They looked for studies involving adults 18 years and older who did not have diabetes or existing heart disease.

## What did they find?

The researchers found 21 studies involving 1,110 people. The average study lasted about 14 weeks, and participants were generally healthy adults between ages 22 and 57.

**Key findings:**
- No studies measured heart attacks, strokes, or deaths
- Eating less added sugar showed very small changes in:
  - Cholesterol levels
  - Blood pressure
  - Blood fats (triglycerides)
- Blood sugar levels showed no clear changes
- Only one study looked at tooth decay, and found no problems
- Most studies did not report side effects like stomach problems or dental issues

The researchers rated the quality of evidence as low, meaning the results are uncertain.

## What does this mean?

There isn't enough evidence to know if eating less added sugar prevents heart disease or extends life. The small changes seen in cholesterol and blood pressure may not be meaningful for health. Following current dietary recommendations to limit added sugar is still a reasonable approach.

More research is needed with longer studies that track actual heart disease events and deaths.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the clinical trial review

Purpose
- To find out if eating less added sugar, compared to more, helps prevent heart and blood vessel disease in adults.

Who was studied
- Adults without diabetes and without past heart or blood vessel disease.
- People were generally healthy, ages 22 to 57.

What was tested
- High versus low intake of added sugar in the diet.

How the research was done
- Review of 21 randomized controlled trials (the strongest type of study).
- 1,110 people completed the studies.
- Average study length: about 14 weeks.
- Searches included studies up to July 2, 2021.

What outcomes were measured
- Main outcomes: new heart or blood vessel problems (like heart attack or stroke) and deaths from any cause.
- Other outcomes: blood pressure, blood fats (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides), fasting blood sugar, and side effects (stomach problems, dental health).

Key results
- No study reported heart events or deaths.
- Lower added sugar made only small changes:
  - Small decreases in total cholesterol and triglycerides.
  - Small decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
  - No clear effect on LDL, HDL, or fasting blood sugar.
- Side effects:
  - One study checked dental health and found no problems.
  - Other side effects were not reported.

Safety
- Few side effects were reported, but side effects were not well measured.

Quality of the evidence
- Overall certainty of the evidence was low.
- Many studies had unclear risk of bias; five studies had lower risk.

What this means
- It is uncertain whether reducing added sugar lowers the chance of heart or blood vessel disease. Any changes in risk factors were small, and it is unclear how important they are for health.
- Following current dietary advice to limit added sugar is a practical approach.

What’s needed next
- Longer studies that track heart events and deaths.
- More direct diet interventions and more studies independent of industry funding."
51,"Background
Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common emergency involving the gastrointestinal tract occurring in the neonatal period. There have been published reports that suggest that oral immunoglobulins (Ig)A and IgG produce an immunoprotective effect in the gastrointestinal mucosa. 
Objectives
To determine the effect of oral immunoglobulin on the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis and other complications in preterm or low birth weight (or both) neonates. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Group. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 1), PubMed (1966 to January 2016), CINAHL (1982 to January 2016) and EMBASE (1980 to January 2016) and conference proceedings. 
Selection criteria
All randomized or quasi‐randomised controlled trials where oral immunoglobulins were used as prophylaxis against NEC in preterm (less than 37 weeks' gestation) or low birth weight (less than 2500 gram), or both, neonates. 
Data collection and analysis
We performed data collection and analysis in accordance with the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. 
Main results
The search identified five studies on oral immunoglobulin for the prevention of NEC of which three met the inclusion criteria. In this review of the three eligible trials (including 2095 neonates), the oral administration of IgG or an IgG/IgA combination did not result in a significant reduction in the incidence of definite NEC (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 1.25; typical risk difference (RD) ‐0.01, 95% CI ‐0.03 to 0.01; 3 studies, 1840 infants), suspected NEC (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.46; RD ‐0.01, 95% CI ‐0.02 to 0.01; 1 study, 1529 infants), need for surgery (typical RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.75; typical RD ‐0.03, 95% CI ‐0.06 to 0.00; 2 studies, 311 infants) or death from NEC (typical RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.59; typical RD 0.00, 95% CI ‐0.01 to 0.01; 3 studies, 1840 infants). 
Authors' conclusions
Based on the available trials, the evidence does not support the administration of oral immunoglobulin for the prevention of NEC. There are no randomized controlled trials of oral IgA alone for the prevention of NEC.","Oral immunoglobulin for preventing necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm and low birth weight neonates 
Review question: Does the use of oral immunoglobulin reduce the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis and other complications in preterm or low birth weight (or both) neonates? 
Background: Immunoglobulin given orally for preventing emergency intestinal problems (necrotizing enterocolitis) in premature and low birth weight newborn infants. Destructive inflammation of the intestine (called necrotizing enterocolitis, NEC) is caused by gas‐producing bacteria that ferment milk. It is a potential problem for newborn preterm (born before their due date) and low birth weight (born at less than 2500 grams) infants. Even after leaving hospital, affected infants may need frequent and prolonged hospitalisation because of continuing nutritional problems. This makes it difficult for parents both emotionally and financially. Immunoglobulins are proteins found in the blood that give the body immunity to disease. Immunoglobulins (types IgA and IgG) taken by mouth (orally) may protect susceptible infants from developing NEC. 
Study characteristics: We searched the medical literature through January 2016 and found three randomized controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) (with 2095 newborn infants). Treatment was started either in the first 24 hours following birth (two small studies) or following commencement of oral feeding (enteral) (one large well‐controlled study). In this large study, infants generally received breast milk, whereas they received formula milk in the other two studies. 
Results: Giving immunoglobulin (IgG alone or IgG plus IgA combination) did not reduce the incidence of NEC, need for surgery related to NEC or death from NEC, either during or after the study period. Immunoglobulins could possibly cause breakdown of red blood cells (called haemolysis) (red blood cells are common cells in the blood that delivery oxygen to organs), but no clinically important haemolysis was apparent. There were no other reported side effects. 
Quality of the evidence: There was low‐very low evidence for all the major outcomes. The major factor that affected the quality of evidence was the lack of precision in the result estimates, as the calculated plausible range of the effects (the 95% confidence intervals) were wide.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Oral Immunoglobulin to Prevent Serious Intestinal Problems in Premature Babies

## What was this study about?

Researchers wanted to know if giving oral immunoglobulin (a type of protein that helps fight infections) to premature or small babies could prevent a serious intestinal problem called necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). NEC is the most common emergency affecting the intestines in newborn babies.

## Who was studied?

The review looked at studies involving premature babies (born before 37 weeks) or babies with low birth weight (less than 5.5 pounds). A total of 2,095 babies were included across three studies.

## What was tested?

Researchers gave some babies oral immunoglobulin (either IgG alone or a combination of IgG and IgA) by mouth to see if it would protect their intestines. Other babies did not receive this treatment. The babies were then monitored to see who developed NEC.

## What did they find?

Giving oral immunoglobulin did not reduce the chances of babies developing:
- Confirmed NEC
- Suspected NEC
- Need for surgery
- Death from NEC

The results showed no clear benefit from this treatment.

## What does this mean?

Based on current evidence, giving oral immunoglobulin to premature or low birth weight babies does not appear to prevent serious intestinal problems. More research would be needed before recommending this as a prevention strategy.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What is the study about?
- Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious gut problem in newborns, especially those born early or very small.
- Some reports suggested that giving antibodies by mouth (immunoglobulins IgG or IgA) might protect the gut.

Goal
- To see if giving oral immunoglobulins lowers the chance of NEC and other problems in preterm or low birth weight babies.

Who was studied?
- Preterm babies (born before 37 weeks) and/or low birth weight babies (under 2500 grams).
- Data came from 3 randomized studies including 2,095 newborns.

What was the treatment?
- Babies received oral immunoglobulins: IgG alone or a mix of IgG and IgA.
- Compared to babies who did not receive these antibodies.

What did researchers look for?
- Definite NEC
- Suspected NEC
- Need for surgery
- Death from NEC

Main results
- Oral immunoglobulins did not lower the chance of definite NEC.
- They did not lower suspected NEC.
- They did not clearly reduce the need for surgery.
- They did not reduce deaths from NEC.

Safety
- The review did not show a benefit. It did not report clear safety problems, but no benefit was found.
- No trials tested oral IgA alone.

Timing of the evidence
- Researchers searched medical databases up to January 2016.

Bottom line
- Based on current trials, giving oral immunoglobulins (IgG or IgG/IgA) to preterm or low birth weight babies does not prevent NEC. More research would be needed to know if oral IgA alone helps."
52,"Background
Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions are frequently implemented to reduce infectious diseases, and may be linked to improved nutrition outcomes in children. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effect of interventions to improve water quality and supply (adequate quantity to maintain hygiene practices), provide adequate sanitation and promote handwashing with soap, on the nutritional status of children under the age of 18 years and to identify current research gaps. 
Search methods
We searched 10 English‐language (including MEDLINE and CENTRAL) and three Chinese‐language databases for published studies in June 2012. We searched grey literature databases, conference proceedings and websites, reviewed reference lists and contacted experts and authors. 
Selection criteria
Randomised (including cluster‐randomised), quasi‐randomised and non‐randomised controlled trials, controlled cohort or cross‐sectional studies and historically controlled studies, comparing WASH interventions among children aged under 18 years. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently sought and extracted data on childhood anthropometry, biochemical measures of micronutrient status, and adherence, attrition and costs either from published reports or through contact with study investigators. We calculated mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We conducted study‐level and individual‐level meta‐analyses to estimate pooled measures of effect for randomised controlled trials only. 
Main results
Fourteen studies (five cluster‐randomised controlled trials and nine non‐randomised studies with comparison groups) from 10 low‐ and middle‐income countries including 22,241 children at baseline and nutrition outcome data for 9,469 children provided relevant information. Study duration ranged from 6 to 60 months and all studies included children under five years of age at the time of the intervention. Studies included WASH interventions either singly or in combination. Measures of child anthropometry were collected in all 14 studies, and nine studies reported at least one of the following anthropometric indices: weight‐for‐height, weight‐for‐age or height‐for‐age. None of the included studies were of high methodological quality as none of the studies masked the nature of the intervention from participants. 
Weight‐for‐age, weight‐for‐height and height‐for‐age z‐scores were available for five cluster‐randomised controlled trials with a duration of between 9 and 12 months. Meta‐analysis including 4,627 children identified no evidence of an effect of WASH interventions on weight‐for‐age z‐score (MD 0.05; 95% CI ‐0.01 to 0.12). Meta‐analysis including 4,622 children identified no evidence of an effect of WASH interventions on weight‐for‐height z‐score (MD 0.02; 95% CI ‐0.07 to 0.11). Meta‐analysis including 4,627 children identified a borderline statistically significant effect of WASH interventions on height‐for‐age z‐score (MD 0.08; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.16). These findings were supported by individual participant data analysis including information on 5,375 to 5,386 children from five cluster‐randomised controlled trials. 
No study reported adverse events. Adherence to study interventions was reported in only two studies (both cluster‐randomised controlled trials) and ranged from low (< 35%) to high (> 90%). Study attrition was reported in seven studies and ranged from 4% to 16.5%. Intervention cost was reported in one study in which the total cost of the WASH interventions was USD 15/inhabitant. None of the studies reported differential impacts relevant to equity issues such as gender, socioeconomic status and religion. 
Authors' conclusions
The available evidence from meta‐analysis of data from cluster‐randomised controlled trials with an intervention period of 9‐12 months is suggestive of a small benefit of WASH interventions (specifically solar disinfection of water, provision of soap, and improvement of water quality) on length growth in children under five years of age. The duration of the intervention studies was relatively short and none of the included studies is of high methodological quality. Very few studies provided information on intervention adherence, attrition and costs. There are several ongoing trials in low‐income country settings that may provide robust evidence to inform these findings.","The effect of interventions to improve water quality and supply, provide sanitation and promote handwashing with soap on physical growth in children 
In low‐income countries an estimated 165 million children under the age of five years suffer from chronic undernutrition causing them to be short in height and 52 million children suffer from acute undernutrition causing them to be very thin. Poor growth in early life increases the risks of illness and death in childhood. The two immediate causes of childhood undernutrition are inadequate dietary intake and infectious diseases such as diarrhoea. Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions are frequently implemented to reduce infectious diseases; this review evaluates the effect that WASH interventions may have on nutrition outcomes in children. The review includes evidence from randomised and non‐randomised interventions designed to (i) improve the microbiological quality of drinking water or protect the microbiological quality of water prior to consumption; (ii) introduce new or improved water supply or improve distribution; (iii) introduce or expand the coverage and use of facilities designed to improve sanitation; or (iv) promote handwashing with soap after defecation and disposal of child faeces, and prior to preparing and handling food, or a combination of these interventions, in children aged under 18 years. 
We identified 14 studies of such interventions involving 22,241 children at baseline and nutrition outcome data for 9,469 children. Meta‐analyses of the evidence from the cluster‐randomised trials suggests that WASH interventions confer a small benefit on growth in children under five years of age. While potentially important, this conclusion is based on relatively short‐term studies, none of which is of high methodological quality, and should therefore be treated with caution. There are several large, robust studies underway in low‐income country settings that should provide evidence to inform these findings.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Can Clean Water, Toilets, and Handwashing Help Children Grow Better?

## What was this study about?

Researchers wanted to find out if helping families get clean water, toilets, and teaching them to wash hands with soap could help children grow and stay healthy. These basic services are often called WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene).

## Who was studied?

The researchers looked at 14 studies from 10 countries with lower incomes. These studies included over 22,000 children under age 5 when they started. The researchers were able to use growth measurements from about 9,500 of these children.

## What did the studies test?

The studies tested different WASH programs, including:
- Making water cleaner and safer to drink
- Providing enough water for families to stay clean
- Building or improving toilets
- Teaching families to wash hands with soap

Some studies tested just one of these things, while others tested several together.

## What did they measure?

Researchers measured children's weight and height to see if the WASH programs helped them grow better. They tracked children for 6 months to 5 years, though most studies lasted about 9 to 12 months.

## What did they find?

When looking at the five best-designed studies (which followed about 4,600 children for 9-12 months), researchers found:
- No clear effect on children's weight compared to their age
- No clear effect on children's weight compared to their height
- A small possible benefit for children's height compared to their age

The studies had some limitations. None could hide from families whether they received the WASH programs or not. Only two studies checked if families actually used what they were given. One study reported costs of about $15 per person.

## What does this mean?

Clean water, toilets, and handwashing might help young children grow a bit taller, but more research is needed to be sure. The benefit appears small, and the studies didn't last very long.",1,Técnico,"Plain-Language Summary of the Study

Purpose
- To see if improving water, sanitation, and handwashing (WASH) helps children’s nutrition and growth.

Who was studied
- Children under 5 years old at the time of the interventions.
- 14 studies from 10 low- and middle-income countries.
- 22,241 children at the start; nutrition results available for 9,469 children.

What the interventions were
- Cleaner drinking water (including solar disinfection and water quality improvements).
- Better sanitation (toilets/latrines).
- Handwashing with soap.
- Some studies used one WASH action; others used a combination.

How the research was done
- The team searched many databases up to June 2012.
- Included randomized and non-randomized studies.
- Main outcomes: child growth measures (weight-for-age, weight-for-height, height-for-age) and some lab measures of nutrition.
- Study duration ranged from 6 to 60 months. The strongest evidence came from 5 cluster randomized trials that lasted 9–12 months.

Main findings
- Weight-for-age: no clear effect.
- Weight-for-height: no clear effect.
- Height-for-age (length/height growth): a very small improvement was seen in the 5 randomized trials (borderline statistical significance).
- Overall, evidence suggests a small benefit of certain WASH actions (solar water disinfection, providing soap, improving water quality) on children’s height growth over about 9–12 months.

Safety
- No studies reported adverse events.

Adherence, dropouts, and costs
- Adherence (following the intervention) was reported in 2 studies only and ranged from under 35% to over 90%.
- Dropouts were 4% to 16.5% in 7 studies.
- Cost was reported in 1 study: about USD 15 per person for the WASH package.

Quality and gaps
- No study was high quality; participants knew which intervention they received.
- Few studies reported adherence, costs, or results by gender or socioeconomic group.
- More rigorous and longer studies are needed."
53,"Background
Child overweight and obesity has increased globally, and can be associated with short‐ and long‐term health consequences. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions for the treatment of overweight or obesity in preschool children up to the age of 6 years. 
Search methods
We performed a systematic literature search in the databases Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and LILACS, as well as in the trial registers ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP Search Portal. We also checked references of identified trials and systematic reviews. We applied no language restrictions. The date of the last search was March 2015 for all databases. 
Selection criteria
We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions for treating overweight or obesity in preschool children aged 0 to 6 years. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias, evaluated the overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE instrument, and extracted data following the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We contacted trial authors for additional information. 
Main results
We included 7 RCTs with a total of 923 participants: 529 randomised to an intervention and 394 to a comparator. The number of participants per trial ranged from 18 to 475. Six trials were parallel RCTs, and one was a cluster RCT. Two trials were three‐arm trials, each comparing two interventions with a control group. The interventions and comparators in the trials varied. We categorised the comparisons into two groups: multicomponent interventions and dietary interventions. The overall quality of the evidence was low or very low, and six trials had a high risk of bias on individual 'Risk of bias' criteria. The children in the included trials were followed up for between six months and three years. 
In trials comparing a multicomponent intervention with usual care, enhanced usual care, or information control, we found a greater reduction in body mass index (BMI) z score in the intervention groups at the end of the intervention (6 to 12 months): mean difference (MD) ‐0.3 units (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.4 to ‐0.2); P < 0.00001; 210 participants; 4 trials; low‐quality evidence, at 12 to 18 months' follow‐up: MD ‐0.4 units (95% CI ‐0.6 to ‐0.2); P = 0.0001; 202 participants; 4 trials; low‐quality evidence, and at 2 years' follow‐up: MD ‐0.3 units (95% CI ‐0.4 to ‐0.1); 96 participants; 1 trial; low‐quality evidence. 
One trial stated that no adverse events were reported; the other trials did not report on adverse events. Three trials reported health‐related quality of life and found improvements in some, but not all, aspects. Other outcomes, such as behaviour change and parent‐child relationship, were inconsistently measured. 
One three‐arm trial of very low‐quality evidence comparing two types of diet with control found that both the dairy‐rich diet (BMI z score change MD ‐0.1 units (95% CI ‐0.11 to ‐0.09); P < 0.0001; 59 participants) and energy‐restricted diet (BMI z score change MD ‐0.1 units (95% CI ‐0.11 to ‐0.09); P < 0.0001; 57 participants) resulted in greater reduction in BMI than the comparator at the end of the intervention period, but only the dairy‐rich diet maintained this at 36 months' follow‐up (BMI z score change in MD ‐0.7 units (95% CI ‐0.71 to ‐0.69); P < 0.0001; 52 participants). The energy‐restricted diet had a worse BMI outcome than control at this follow‐up (BMI z score change MD 0.1 units (95% CI 0.09 to 0.11); P < 0.0001; 47 participants). There was no substantial difference in mean daily energy expenditure between groups. Health‐related quality of life, adverse effects, participant views, and parenting were not measured. 
No trial reported on all‐cause mortality, morbidity, or socioeconomic effects.
All results should be interpreted cautiously due to their low quality and heterogeneous interventions and comparators. 
Authors' conclusions
Muticomponent interventions appear to be an effective treatment option for overweight or obese preschool children up to the age of 6 years. However, the current evidence is limited, and most trials had a high risk of bias. Most trials did not measure adverse events. We have identified four ongoing trials that we will include in future updates of this review. 
The role of dietary interventions is more equivocal, with one trial suggesting that dairy interventions may be effective in the longer term, but not energy‐restricted diets. This trial also had a high risk of bias.","Diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions for the treatment of overweight or obesity in preschool children up to the age of 6 years 
Review question 
How effective are diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions in reducing the weight of overweight and obese preschool children? 
Background 
Across the world more children are becoming overweight and obese. These children are more likely to suffer from health problems, both while as children and in later life. More information is needed about what works best for treating this problem. 
Study characteristics 
We found 7 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing diet, physical activity, and behavioural (where habits are changed or improved) treatments (interventions) to a variety of control groups (who did not receive treatment) delivered to 923 overweight or obese preschool children up to the age of 6 years. We grouped the studies by the type of intervention. Our systematic review reported on the effects of multicomponent interventions and dietary interventions compared with no intervention, 'usual care', enhanced usual care, or some other therapy if it was also delivered in the intervention arm. The children in the included studies were monitored (called follow‐up) for between six months and three years. 
Key results 
Most studies reported the body mass index (BMI) z score: BMI is a measure of body fat and is calculated by dividing weight (in kilograms) by the square of the body height measured in metres (kg/m²). In children, BMI is often measured in a way that takes into account sex, weight, and height as children grow older (BMI z score). We summarised the results of 4 trials in 202 children reporting the BMI z score, which on average was 0.4 units lower in the multicomponent intervention groups compared with the control groups. Lower units indicate more weight loss. For example, a 5‐year‐old girl with a body height of 110 cm and a body weight of 32 kg has a BMI of 26.4 and a BMI z score of 2.99. If this girl loses 2 kg weight within a year (and gained 1 cm in height), she would have reduced her BMI z score by approx. 0.4 units (her BMI would be 24.3 and her BMI z score 2.58). Accordingly, the average change in weight in the multicomponent interventions was 2.8 kg lower than in the control groups. Other effects of the interventions, such as improvements in health‐related quality of life or evaluation of the parent‐child relationship, were less clear, and most studies did not measure adverse events. No study investigated death from any cause, morbidity, or socioeconomic effects. One study found that BMI z score reduction was greater at the end of both dairy‐rich and energy‐restricted dietary interventions compared with a healthy lifestyle education only. However, only the dairy‐rich diet continued to show benefits two to three years later, whereas the energy‐restricted diet group had a greater increase in BMI z score than the control group. 
This evidence is up to date as of March 2015.
Quality of the evidence 
The overall quality of the evidence was low or very low, mainly because there were just a few studies per outcome measurement or the number of the included children was small. In addition, many children left the studies before they had finished.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Programs to Help Young Children with Overweight or Obesity

## What was studied?
Researchers looked at programs designed to help young children (up to age 6) who are overweight or obese. They wanted to see if programs focused on diet, physical activity, and behavior changes could help these children reach a healthier weight.

## Who was in the studies?
The review included 7 studies with 923 young children (ages 0-6 years) who were overweight or obese. The studies took place in different locations and followed children for 6 months to 3 years.

## What did the programs include?
The programs varied but fell into two main types:
- **Combined programs** that included multiple parts like diet changes, physical activity, and behavior support
- **Diet-only programs** that focused on specific eating plans

These programs were compared to regular care or basic information given to families.

## What did they find?
**Combined programs** (diet + activity + behavior support):
- Children in these programs showed greater improvement in their weight-for-height measurements compared to children who received regular care
- These improvements were seen at the end of the programs (6-12 months) and continued for up to 2 years
- Some studies found improvements in quality of life for children

**Diet-only programs**:
- One study tested two different diets (a dairy-rich diet and a calorie-restricted diet)
- The dairy-rich diet showed lasting benefits at 3 years
- The calorie-restricted diet did not show lasting benefits

## Important limitations
- The quality of evidence was low, meaning we can't be completely confident in the results
- Most studies did not report whether any negative effects occurred
- The programs varied widely, making it hard to compare results
- More high-quality research is needed

## Bottom line
Combined programs that include diet, physical activity, and behavior support may help young children with overweight or obesity, but more research is needed to be sure these programs are safe and effective.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

Purpose
- To find out if diet, physical activity, and behavior programs help treat extra weight in preschool children (ages 0–6).

Who was studied
- 7 randomized controlled trials with 923 children.
- Follow-up ranged from 6 months to 3 years.

What was tested
- Multicomponent programs: a mix of healthy eating guidance, physical activity, and behavior support, compared to usual care or information only.
- Diet-only programs: one focused on a dairy-rich diet; another on an energy-restricted (lower-calorie) diet.

Main findings
- Multicomponent programs:
  - Lowered children’s BMI z-score more than usual care at:
    - 6–12 months: about 0.3 units lower.
    - 12–18 months: about 0.4 units lower.
    - 2 years: about 0.3 units lower (from one trial).
- Diet-only programs (one three-arm trial):
  - Both dairy-rich and energy-restricted diets lowered BMI z-score at the end of treatment (about 0.1 units each).
  - At 36 months, only the dairy-rich diet kept the benefit (about 0.7 units lower). The energy-restricted diet did worse than control at this time.
  - Daily energy use was similar across groups.

Other outcomes
- Some trials reported small improvements in parts of health-related quality of life.
- Results for behavior change and parent–child relationship were mixed.
- No trials reported deaths, illness rates, or socioeconomic effects.

Safety
- One trial said there were no adverse events.
- Most trials did not report on adverse events.

Quality of the evidence
- Overall evidence quality was low or very low.
- Many trials had a high risk of bias.
- Results should be interpreted with caution.

Timing and sources
- Studies were found through major medical databases and trial registers.
- Last search was March 2015.
- Four related trials are ongoing and were not included."
54,"Background
Children who are securely attached to at least one parent are able to be comforted by that parent when they are distressed and explore the world confidently by using that parent as a 'secure base'. Research suggests that a secure attachment enables children to function better across all aspects of their development. Promoting secure attachment, therefore, is a goal of many early interventions. Attachment is mediated through parental sensitivity to signals of distress from the child. One means of improving parental sensitivity is through video feedback, which involves showing a parent brief moments of their interaction with their child, to strengthen their sensitivity and responsiveness to their child's signals. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of video feedback on parental sensitivity and attachment security in children aged under five years who are at risk for poor attachment outcomes. 
Search methods
In November 2018 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, nine other databases and two trials registers. We also handsearched the reference lists of included studies, relevant systematic reviews, and several relevant websites 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs that assessed the effects of video feedback versus no treatment, inactive alternative intervention, or treatment as usual for parental sensitivity, parental reflective functioning, attachment security and adverse effects in children aged from birth to four years 11 months. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
This review includes 22 studies from seven countries in Europe and two countries in North America, with a total of 1889 randomised parent‐child dyads or family units. Interventions targeted parents of children aged under five years, experiencing a wide range of difficulties (such as deafness or prematurity), or facing challenges that put them at risk of attachment issues (for example, parental depression). Nearly all studies reported some form of external funding, from a charitable organisation (n = 7) or public body, or both (n = 18). 
We considered most studies as being at low or unclear risk of bias across the majority of domains, with the exception of blinding of participants and personnel, where we assessed all studies as being at high risk of performance bias. For outcomes where self‐report measures were used, such as parental stress and anxiety, we rated all studies at high risk of bias for blinding of outcome assessors. 
Parental sensitivity. A meta‐analysis of 20 studies (1757 parent‐child dyads) reported evidence of that video feedback improved parental sensitivity compared with a control or no intervention from postintervention to six months' follow‐up (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 0.49, moderate‐certainty evidence). The size of the observed impact compares favourably to other, similar interventions. 
Parental reflective functioning. No studies reported this outcome. 
Attachment security. A meta‐analysis of two studies (166 parent‐child dyads) indicated that video feedback increased the odds of being securely attached, measured using the Strange Situation Procedure, at postintervention (odds ratio 3.04, 95% CI 1.39 to 6.67, very low‐certainty evidence). A second meta‐analysis of two studies (131 parent‐child dyads) that assessed attachment security using a different measure (Attachment Q‐sort) found no effect of video feedback compared with the comparator groups (SMD 0.02, 95% CI −0.33 to 0.38, very low‐certainty evidence). 
Adverse events. Eight studies (537 parent‐child dyads) contributed data at postintervention or short‐term follow‐up to a meta‐analysis of parental stress, and two studies (311 parent‐child dyads) contributed short‐term follow‐up data to a meta‐analysis of parental anxiety. There was no difference between intervention and comparator groups for either outcome. For parental stress the SMD between video feedback and control was −0.09 (95% CI −0.26 to 0.09, low‐certainty evidence), while for parental anxiety the SMD was −0.28 (95% CI −0.87 to 0.31, very low‐certainty evidence). 
Child behaviour. A meta‐analysis of two studies (119 parent‐child dyads) at long‐term follow‐up found no evidence of the effectiveness of video feedback on child behaviour (SMD 0.04, 95% CI −0.33 to 0.42, very low‐certainty evidence). 
A moderator analysis found no evidence of an effect for the three prespecified variables (intervention type, number of feedback sessions and participating carer) when jointly tested. However, parent gender (both parents versus only mothers or only fathers) potentially has a statistically significant negative moderation effect, though only at α (alpha) = 0.1 
Authors' conclusions
There is moderate‐certainty evidence that video feedback may improve sensitivity in parents of children who are at risk for poor attachment outcomes due to a range of difficulties. There is currently only little, very low‐certainty evidence regarding the impact of video feedback on attachment security, compared with control: results differed based on the type of measure used, and follow‐up was limited in duration. There is no evidence that video feedback has an impact on parental stress or anxiety (low‐ and very low‐certainty evidence, respectively). Further evidence is needed regarding the longer‐term impact of video feedback on attachment and more distal outcomes such as children's behaviour (very low‐certainty evidence). Further research is needed on the impact of video‐feedback on paternal sensitivity and parental reflective functioning, as no study measured these outcomes. This review is limited by the fact that the majority of included parents were mothers.","Video feedback for parental sensitivity and child attachment
Background 
Children who are securely attached to at least one parent are able to be comforted by that parent when they are distressed and more able to explore the world confidently by using that parent as a 'secure base'. Research suggests that a secure attachment enables children to function better across all aspects of their development. Promoting secure attachment, therefore, is a goal of many programmes that aim to support children and families in the first few years of the child's life. Video feedback involves showing a parent brief moments of videotaped interaction between them and their baby, in order to strengthen their sensitivity to signals from their baby, with the aim of improving attachment. 
Review question 
To assess the effects of video feedback on parental sensitivity and attachment security in children under five years old who are at risk of poor outcomes, compared to no intervention (no treatment), a mock treatment (such as a phone call) or treatment as usual. 
Included studies 
This review included 22 studies, made up of 1889 randomised parent‐child pairs or family units. Not all of these could be combined in a meta‐analysis (a statistical method of combining data from several studies to reach a single, more robust conclusion). We combined data from 20 studies (made up of 1757 parent‐child pairs) to examine the effects of video feedback on parental sensitivity. We combined data from fewer studies to look at attachment security, parental stress, parental anxiety and child behaviour. 
The included studies were mostly conducted in Canada, the Netherlands, UK and USA. Single studies were conducted in Italy, Germany, Lithuania, Norway and Portugal. 
Almost all studies reported some form of external funding, from either a charitable organisation (n = 7) and/or public body (n = 18). 
Results 
The results show evidence of an improvement in parental sensitivity following the use of video feedback. The results for attachment security were mixed: one meta‐analysis showed that the intervention group were more securely attached, while the second meta‐analysis, which measured the strength of attachment in a different way, showed no evidence of impact. There was no evidence of impact on parental anxiety or stress. No studies measured parental reflective functioning. There was no evidence of impact on child behaviour. 
Study certainty 
We rated the overall certainty of the evidence (the extent to which we believe that the results are correct or adequate) as moderate for parental sensitivity, and low or very low for the other outcomes. This means that we are reasonably certain that video feedback improves parental sensitivity in the short term, but we are not very certain of its impact on our other findings. 
Authors' conclusions 
Video feedback may be a helpful method of improving parental sensitivity, but there is currently little or no evidence that it improves child attachment security, parental stress, parental anxiety or child behaviour. More research is needed on the effects of video feedback on other outcomes, including parental reflective functioning, and in fathers.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Video Feedback to Help Parents and Young Children Bond

## What was this study about?

Researchers wanted to know if showing parents video clips of themselves interacting with their young children could help strengthen their relationship. When parents respond well to their child's needs, children feel more secure and confident. This is called ""attachment.""

## Who was studied?

The review looked at 22 studies involving nearly 1,900 families from Europe and North America. These families had young children (under 5 years old) who faced various challenges, such as:
- Being born early
- Having hearing loss
- Having parents with depression

These situations can make it harder for parents and children to form strong bonds.

## What was tested?

Parents received video feedback sessions where they watched short clips of themselves with their child. A trained person helped them notice positive moments and their child's signals. This was compared to families who received no special help or usual care.

## What did researchers find?

**Positive findings:**
- Parents who received video feedback became more sensitive and responsive to their children's needs. This improvement lasted up to 6 months after the sessions ended.
- Some evidence suggested children were more likely to feel securely attached to their parents, though results varied depending on how attachment was measured.

**No clear difference:**
- Video feedback didn't increase or decrease parent stress or anxiety
- No clear impact on children's behavior was found

## What does this mean?

Video feedback appears helpful for improving how parents respond to their young children, especially for families facing challenges. However, more research is needed to understand long-term effects and whether it works equally well for fathers and mothers.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the review

What was studied
- Whether “video feedback” can help parents be more sensitive to their young child’s signals and whether it improves secure attachment.
- Video feedback means recording short clips of parent–child play or daily moments and then reviewing them with a coach to notice and build on positive interactions.

Who took part
- 22 randomized studies from Europe and North America.
- 1,889 parent–child pairs or families.
- Children were under 5 years old.
- Families often faced challenges (for example, parental low mood, child prematurity, or hearing loss).
- Most participating parents were mothers.

What was compared
- Video feedback versus no treatment, usual care, or another inactive program.

Main findings
- Parent sensitivity: Improved. Across 20 studies (1,757 families), parents who got video feedback were more sensitive to their child right after the program and up to 6 months later. Certainty: moderate.
- Parent reflective functioning (how parents think about their child’s feelings and thoughts): Not reported in any study.
- Child attachment security: Mixed results. Two studies using one measure showed higher odds of secure attachment after video feedback; two other studies using a different measure showed no effect. Certainty: very low.
- Parent stress and anxiety: No clear difference between groups. Certainty: low (stress) to very low (anxiety).
- Child behavior: No clear difference at longer follow-up in two studies. Certainty: very low.

Safety
- Studies measuring parent stress and anxiety found no increase with video feedback.
- Other harms were not reported.

Timing
- Most follow-ups were short term (up to 6 months). There is little long-term information.

What this means
- Video feedback likely helps parents become more sensitive to their young child.
- It is unclear if it reliably improves secure attachment or child behavior, and it does not seem to change parent stress or anxiety.
- More research is needed, especially longer-term studies and studies including fathers or both parents."
55,"Background
Older patients with multiple health problems (multi‐morbidity) value being involved in decision‐making about their health care. However, they are less frequently involved than younger patients. To maximise quality of life, day‐to‐day function, and patient safety, older patients require support to identify unmet healthcare needs and to prioritise treatment options. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of interventions for older patients with multi‐morbidity aiming to involve them in decision‐making about their health care during primary care consultations. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; all years to August 2018), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1966 to August 2018); Embase (OvidSP) (1988 to August 2018); PsycINFO (OvidSP) (1806 to August 2018); the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (Ovid) (1982 to September 2008), then in Ebsco (2009 to August 2018); Centre for Reviews and Dissemination Databases (Database of Abstracts and Reviews of Effects (DARE)) (all years to August 2018); the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Database (all years to August 2018); the Ongoing Reviews Database (all years to August 2018); and Dissertation Abstracts International (1861 to August 2018). 
Selection criteria
We sought randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs, and quasi‐RCTs of interventions to involve patients in decision‐making about their health care versus usual care/control/another intervention, for patients aged 65 years and older with multi‐morbidity in primary care. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Meta‐analysis was not possible; therefore we prepared a narrative synthesis. 
Main results
We included three studies involving 1879 participants: two RCTs and one cluster‐RCT. Interventions consisted of: 
· patient workshop and individual coaching using behaviour change techniques;
· individual patient coaching utilising cognitive‐behavioural therapy and motivational interviewing; and 
· holistic patient review, multi‐disciplinary practitioner training, and organisational change. 
No studies reported the primary outcome ‘patient involvement in decision‐making’ or the primary adverse outcome ‘less patient involvement as a result of the intervention’. 
Comparing interventions (patient workshop and individual coaching, holistic patient review plus practitioner training, and organisational change) to usual care: we are uncertain whether interventions had any effect on patient reports of high self‐rated health (risk ratio (RR) 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 5.49; very low‐certainty evidence) or on patient enablement (mean difference (MD) 0.60, 95% CI ‐9.23 to 10.43; very low‐certainty evidence) compared with usual care. Interventions probably had no effect on health‐related quality of life (adjusted difference in means 0.00, 95% CI ‐0.02 to 0.02; moderate‐certainty evidence) or on medication adherence (MD 0.06, 95% CI ‐0.05 to 0.17; moderate‐certainty evidence) but probably improved the number of patients discussing their priorities (adjusted odds ratio 1.85, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.38; moderate‐certainty evidence) and probably increased the number of nurse consultations (incident rate ratio from adjusted multi‐level Poisson model 1.37, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.61; moderate‐certainty evidence) compared with usual care. Practitioner outcomes were not measured. Interventions were not reported to adversely affect rates of participant death or anxiety, emergency department attendance, or hospital admission compared with usual care. 
Comparing interventions (patient workshop and coaching, individual patient coaching) to attention‐control conditions: we are uncertain whether interventions affect patient‐reported high self‐rated health (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.00, favouring attention control, with very low‐certainty evidence; RR 2.17, 95% CI 0.85 to 5.52, favouring the intervention, with very low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether interventions affect patient enablement and engagement by increasing either patient activation (MD 1.20, 95% CI ‐8.21 to 10.61; very low‐certainty evidence) or self‐efficacy (MD 0.29, 95% CI ‐0.21 to 0.79; very low‐certainty evidence); or whether interventions affect the number of general practice visits (MD 0.51, 95% CI ‐0.34 to 1.36; very low‐certainty evidence), compared to attention‐control conditions. The intervention may however lead to more patient‐reported changes in management of their health conditions (RR 1.82, 95% CI 1.35 to 2.44; low‐certainty evidence). Practitioner outcomes were not measured. Interventions were not reported to adversely affect emergency department attendance nor hospital admission when compared with attention control. 
Comparing one form of intervention with another: not measured. 
There was 'unclear' risk across studies for performance bias, detection bias, and reporting bias; however, no aspects were 'high' risk. Evidence was downgraded via GRADE, most often because of 'small sample size' and 'evidence from a single study'. 
Authors' conclusions
Limited available evidence does not allow a robust conclusion regarding the objectives of this review. Whilst patient involvement in decision‐making is seen as a key mechanism for improving care, it is rarely examined as an intervention and was not measured by included studies. Consistency in design, analysis, and evaluation of interventions would enable a greater likelihood of robust conclusions in future reviews.","Interventions for involving older patients with more than one long‐term health problem in decision‐making during primary care consultations 
Background 
The number of older people with more than one long‐term health problem is steadily increasing worldwide. Such individuals can have complicated healthcare needs. Although they frequently want to be involved in making decisions about their health care, they are less often involved than younger, healthier people. As a result, they may not be offered the same treatment options. 
Review question 
We reviewed available evidence about the effects of interventions intended to involve older people with more than one long‐term health problem in decision‐making about their health care during primary care consultations. 
Study characteristics 
We included research published up until August 2018. We found three relevant studies involving 1879 participants. These studies were reported from three countries. Participants were over 65 years of age with three or more long‐term health problems on average. Interventions investigated included: 
· patient workshops and individual patient coaching;
· patient coaching including cognitive‐behavioural therapy; and
· whole‐person patient review, practitioner training, and organisational changes.
All studies were funded by national research bodies.
Key results 
None of the studies reported the main outcome ‘patient involvement in decision‐making about their health care’ nor whether there was less patient involvement as a result of the intervention. Interventions were not found to increase adverse outcomes such as death, anxiety, emergency department attendance, or hospital admissions.. 
We are uncertain whether interventions for involving older people with more than one long‐term health problem in decision‐making about their health care can improve their self‐rated health or healthcare engagement, or make any difference in self‐efficacy (one's belief in one's ability to succeed in specific situations) or in the overall number of general practice visits. We can report that these interventions probably make little or no difference in patients' quality of life but probably increase the number of patients discussing their priorities, and are associated with more patient consultations with nurses, when compared to usual care. Interventions may be associated with more changes in the management of health conditions when considered from the patient’s perspective when compared with a control group. 
The quality of the evidence was limited by small studies, and by studies choosing to measure different outcomes, resulting in lack of data that could be combined in analyses. 
Conclusions 
Further research in this developing area is required before firm conclusions can be drawn.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Helping Older Adults with Multiple Health Conditions Participate in Healthcare Decisions

## What was this review about?

Researchers wanted to find out if special programs could help older adults with multiple health conditions become more involved in making decisions about their healthcare during doctor visits. Being involved in these decisions is important for quality of life and safety, but older adults are often left out of these conversations more than younger people.

## What did the researchers look for?

The team searched medical databases through August 2018 for studies testing programs designed to help patients aged 65 and older with multiple health conditions participate more in healthcare decisions at primary care clinics.

## What did they find?

The researchers found only 3 studies involving 1,879 older adults. These studies tested different approaches:
- Patient workshops combined with one-on-one coaching
- Individual coaching sessions using specific counseling techniques
- Complete patient reviews combined with training healthcare staff and changing how clinics operate

## What were the results?

The studies did not directly measure whether patients became more involved in decision-making. However:

**Compared to regular care:**
- Programs probably helped more patients discuss their priorities with doctors
- Programs probably led to more nurse visits
- Programs likely did not change quality of life or how well patients took their medications
- Programs did not increase emergency room visits, hospital stays, deaths, or anxiety

**Compared to attention-control groups** (where patients received some attention but not the full program):
- Results were unclear for most measures
- Programs may have led to more patients reporting changes in how their health conditions were managed

## What does this mean?

There is not enough evidence to determine whether these programs successfully help older adults with multiple health conditions participate more in healthcare decisions. More research using consistent methods is needed.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What is this study about?
- This review looked at ways to help older adults be more involved in making decisions about their health during primary care visits.

Who was included?
- People aged 65 and older who had more than one long-term health problem.
- The review included 3 studies with 1,879 participants seen in primary care.

What did the programs do?
- Patient workshop plus one-on-one coaching using behavior change techniques.
- One-on-one patient coaching using cognitive behavioral therapy and motivational interviewing.
- A broad program with a full patient review, training for the care team, and clinic-level changes.

What was measured?
- Main goal: patient involvement in decision-making (not reported in the included studies).
- Other outcomes: self-rated health, ability to manage health (enablement/activation/self-efficacy), quality of life, medication taking, how often priorities were discussed, number of clinic or nurse visits, emergency department visits, hospital stays, anxiety, and deaths.

Key findings
- Patient involvement in decisions: not measured.
- Compared with usual care:
  - Unclear effects on self-rated health and enablement (very low certainty).
  - Probably no effect on health-related quality of life or medication adherence (moderate certainty).
  - Probably more patients discussed their priorities with clinicians (moderate certainty).
  - Probably more nurse consultations (moderate certainty).
  - No reported increase in deaths, anxiety, emergency visits, or hospital admissions.
- Compared with attention-control programs (such as extra contact without decision-making support):
  - Mixed and uncertain effects on self-rated health, enablement/activation/self-efficacy, and general practice visits (very low certainty).
  - May lead to more patient-reported changes in how they manage their conditions (low certainty).
  - No reported increase in emergency visits or hospital admissions.

Timing and methods
- The review searched medical databases up to August 2018.
- It included two randomized controlled trials and one cluster randomized trial.
- Results could not be combined in a meta-analysis; a narrative summary was used.

Safety
- Across the studies, these programs were not reported to increase anxiety, emergency visits, hospital stays, or deaths.

What does this mean?
- There is limited and uncertain evidence about whether these programs help older adults be more involved in decision-making.
- Some programs likely help patients discuss their priorities more, without added harm.

Ischaemia reperfusion injury can lead to kidney dysfunction or failure. Ischaemic preconditioning is a short period of deprivation of blood supply to particular organs or tissue, followed by a period of reperfusion. It has the potential to protect kidneys from ischaemia reperfusion injury. 
Objectives
This review aimed to look at the benefits and harms of local and remote ischaemic preconditioning to reduce ischaemia and reperfusion injury among people with renal ischaemia reperfusion injury. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 5 August 2016 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials measuring kidney function and the role of ischaemic preconditioning in patients undergoing a surgical intervention that induces kidney injury. Kidney transplantation studies were excluded. 
Data collection and analysis
Studies were assessed for eligibility and quality; data were extracted by two independent authors. We collected basic study characteristics: type of surgery, remote ischaemic preconditioning protocol, type of anaesthesia. We collected primary outcome measurements: serum creatinine and adverse effects to remote ischaemic preconditioning and secondary outcome measurements: acute kidney injury, need for dialysis, neutrophil gelatinase‐associated lipocalin, hospital stay and mortality. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random‐effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. 
Main results
We included 28 studies which randomised a total of 6851 patients. Risk of bias assessment indicated unclear to low risk of bias for most studies. For consistency regarding the direction of effects, continuous outcomes with negative values, and dichotomous outcomes with values less than one favour remote ischaemic preconditioning. Based on high quality evidence, remote ischaemic preconditioning made little or no difference to the reduction of serum creatinine levels at postoperative days one (14 studies, 1022 participants: MD ‐0.02 mg/dL, 95% CI ‐0.05 to 0.02; I2 = 21%), two (9 studies, 770 participants: MD ‐0.04 mg/dL, 95% CI ‐0.09 to 0.02; I2 = 31%), and three (6 studies, 417 participants: MD ‐0.05 mg/dL, 95% CI ‐0.19 to 0.10; I2 = 68%) compared to control. 
Serious adverse events occurred in four patients receiving remote ischaemic preconditioning by iliac clamping. It is uncertain whether remote ischaemic preconditioning by cuff inflation leads to increased adverse effects compared to control because the certainty of the evidence is low (15 studies, 3993 participants: RR 3.47, 95% CI 0.55 to 21.76; I2 = 0%); only two of 15 studies reported any adverse effects (6/1999 in the remote ischaemic preconditioning group and 1/1994 in the control group), the remaining 13 studies stated no adverse effects were observed in either group. 
Compared to control, remote ischaemic preconditioning made little or no difference to the need for dialysis (13 studies, 2417 participants: RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.94; I2 = 60%; moderate quality evidence), length of hospital stay (8 studies, 920 participants: MD 0.17 days, 95% CI ‐0.46 to 0.80; I2 = 49%, high quality evidence), or all‐cause mortality (24 studies, 4931 participants: RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.37; I2 = 0%, high quality evidence). 
Remote ischaemic preconditioning may have slightly improved the incidence of acute kidney injury using either the AKIN (8 studies, 2364 participants: RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.00; I2 = 61%, high quality evidence) or RIFLE criteria (3 studies, 1586 participants: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.12; I2 = 0%, moderate quality evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Remote ischaemic preconditioning by cuff inflation appears to be a safe method, and probably leads to little or no difference in serum creatinine, adverse effects, need for dialysis, length of hospital stay, death and in the incidence of acute kidney injury. Overall we had moderate‐high certainty evidence however the available data does not confirm the efficacy of remote ischaemic preconditioning in reducing renal ischaemia reperfusion injury in patients undergoing major cardiac and vascular surgery in which renal ischaemia reperfusion injury may occur.","Short periods of limb blood flow obstruction to reduce kidney injury
What is the issue? 
The kidney is highly sensitive to shortage in blood flow and thus oxygen supply. This may cause irreversible kidney injury leading to haemodialysis or death. Kidney injury does not only relate to the temporary lack of oxygen supply, but is also due to the re‐saturation of blood flow. At this stage, toxic products are released and initiate a reaction of the body causing further cellular damage within the kidney, the so called ‘ischaemia‐reperfusion injury’. A lack of oxygen supply to the kidney injury may have many different causes, for example blood pressure changes that may occur during major surgery. 
What did we do? 
Our hypothesis is that short harmless periods (5 minutes) of blood flow obstruction to an organ can reduce injury in this particular organ (local ischaemic preconditioning), but can also reduce injury in other organs at a distance (remote ischaemic preconditioning). A blood flow obstruction can easily and safely be achieved in a limb by inflating blood pressure cuff around the upper arm or leg. The mechanism of this remote ischaemic preconditioning is not precisely known, it is assumed that a protective signal from the remote organ to the kidney is transferred through the blood stream or nervous system. 
In this analysis our primary goal is to investigate whether remote ischaemic preconditioning is safe and effective in reducing kidney injury in patients undergoing a (surgical) procedure in which kidney injury may occur. Kidney injury after kidney transplantation may have a different underlying pathophysiology and therefore these studies are not taken into account. The impact of remote ischaemic preconditioning on the need for dialysis, hospital stay and mortality will be assessed. 
What did we find? 
We performed a search off all available literature on 8 August 2016 to find all randomised controlled studies. 28 studies including 6851 patients were included in this analysis. Five studies included children undergoing cardiac surgery. Adult studies included patients undergoing major vascular surgery (three studies), cardiac surgery (nine studies), coronary bypass surgery (10 studies) and partial kidney resection (one study). The overall quality of the studies was acceptable. 
Twenty studies were funded without economical interest. One study was funded from a source with commercial interest. The other seven studies did not report funding. 
Remote ischaemic preconditioning performed with a blood pressure cuff appears to be safe as only two of 15 studies reported adverse effects (6/1999 in the remote ischaemic preconditioning group and 1/1994 in the control group). However remote ischaemic preconditioning by vascular clamping may cause vascular complications. Kidney injury in patients undergoing (surgical) procedures in which kidney injury may occur, was not reduced by remote Ischaemic preconditioning measured at day one, two or three after surgery. The need for dialysis, hospital stay and death were not reduced by remote ischaemic preconditioning. 
Conclusion 
Although remote ischaemic preconditioning by cuff inflation is safe, available data do not confirm the efficacy of remote ischaemic preconditioning in reducing kidney injury.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Testing a Technique to Protect Kidneys During Surgery

## What was studied?

Researchers reviewed studies about a technique called ""ischaemic preconditioning"" to see if it could protect kidneys during surgeries that might temporarily reduce blood flow to the kidneys. This technique involves briefly restricting blood flow to an area of the body (usually by inflating a blood pressure cuff on the arm or leg), then releasing it. The idea is that this might prepare the kidneys to better handle reduced blood flow during surgery.

## Who was studied?

The review included 6,851 patients having major heart or blood vessel surgeries where kidney injury might occur. Studies involving kidney transplants were not included.

## What did researchers look for?

They measured:
- Kidney function through blood tests
- Side effects from the technique
- Whether patients needed dialysis (kidney filtering treatment)
- How long patients stayed in the hospital
- Deaths from any cause
- Rates of sudden kidney injury

## What did they find?

The review included 28 studies and found:

- **Kidney function tests**: The technique made little to no difference in blood test results measuring kidney function in the days after surgery.

- **Safety**: The cuff inflation method appeared safe. Only 2 out of 15 studies reported any side effects (7 patients total had side effects with the technique versus 1 patient in comparison groups). A different method using surgical clamping caused problems in 4 patients.

- **Other outcomes**: The technique made little to no difference in:
  - Need for dialysis treatment
  - Length of hospital stay
  - Death rates
  - Rates of sudden kidney injury

## What does this mean?

This technique of briefly restricting blood flow before surgery appears safe when done with a blood pressure cuff, but the evidence doesn't show it clearly helps protect kidneys during major surgeries. More research may be needed to determine if this approach is helpful.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

Background
- When blood flow to the kidney is cut off and then returns, it can harm the kidney.
- “Ischaemic preconditioning” means briefly stopping blood flow to an arm or leg, then letting it return. This may prepare the body to handle a longer cut in blood flow during surgery.

Study goal
- To see if ischaemic preconditioning helps protect the kidneys during surgeries that can stress the kidneys.

Who was studied
- 28 randomized studies with 6,851 people having major surgery (often heart or blood vessel surgery). Kidney transplant studies were not included.
- Research searched up to August 5, 2016.

What was done
- Most studies used “remote” ischaemic preconditioning: inflating a blood pressure cuff on a limb for short cycles before surgery, then releasing it.
- A few studies used surgical clamping (iliac clamping).

What the studies measured
- Main kidney blood test (serum creatinine) on days 1–3 after surgery.
- Acute kidney injury (AKI), need for dialysis.
- Length of hospital stay and death from any cause.
- Side effects from preconditioning.

Key results
- Kidney blood test: Little or no difference on day 1, 2, or 3 after surgery.
- Need for dialysis: Little or no difference.
- Length of hospital stay: Little or no difference.
- Death: Little or no difference.
- Acute kidney injury: May be slightly lower with preconditioning, but the effect was small and uncertain across studies.

Safety
- Cuff inflation method: Very few side effects reported; appears safe in the studies.
- Surgical clamping: 4 serious side effects reported in people who had iliac clamping.

Bottom line
- Using a blood pressure cuff to do remote ischaemic preconditioning seems safe.
- It probably does not make a meaningful difference in kidney function, dialysis need, hospital stay, or death after major surgery.
- Current evidence (up to 2016) does not confirm that it protects the kidneys in these settings."
57,"Background
Surgery has been the treatment of choice for patients with rectal cancer. For locally advanced cancer results were poor, with high rates of locoregional recurrences and poor overall survival data. Adding (chemo)radiotherapy upfront improved results mainly in locoregional control. Adding hyperthermia to radiotherapy preoperatively might have an equivalent beneficial effect. 
Objectives
To quantify the potential beneficial effect of thermo radiation compared to chemo‐radiation with respect to pathological complete responses, overall survival and toxicity in rectal cancer therapy. 
Search methods
We identified the relevant phase II and III randomised controlled trials in any language trough electronic searches May 2007 of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2007), the Cochrane Colorectal Cancer Groups Specialised Register, MEDLINE (from 1966), EMBASE (from 1974), CINAHL (from 1982). Furthermore, various trial databases were searched for the identification of recent completed and ongoing trials (metaRegister of Controlled Trials, Cancer Research UK, Cancer.gov, The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Trials Database). All studies identified until May 2007 were considered for inclusion in the present study. 
Selection criteria
Only phase II and III randomised controlled clinical trials were included in the analysis.
Data collection and analysis
All identified studies were assessed by two independent reviewers. A weighted estimate of the treatment effect was computed for 2, 3, 4 and 5‐year survival, for local tumour recurrence, severe acute and late toxicity and complete tumour response (CR). CR was defined either clinically by disappearance of all pretreatment signs of local tumour or pathologically by microscopically free margins. The risk ratio (RR) and hazard ratio (HR) were used. Analyses were performed with the Reference Manager (RevMan). 
Main results
Six RCTs published between 1990 and 2007 were identified. A total number of 520 patients was treated, 258 in the radiotherapy only arm (RT) and 262 in the radiotherapy‐hyperthermia arm (RHT).  Four studies (424 patients) reported overall survival (OS) rates. After 2 years, OS was significantly better in the RHT group (HR 2.06; 95% CI 1.33‐3.17; p=.001), but this difference disappeared after a longer period (3, 4 and 5 year OS).  All but one studies reported CR rates. A significant higher CR rate was observed in the RHT group (RR 2.81; 95% CI 1.22‐6.45; p=.01).  Only 2 studies reported on acute toxicity. In these 2 studies no significant differences were observed between the RT and the RHT group. Late toxicity data were not reported. 
Authors' conclusions
Further studies are needed to compare chemoradiation versus thermoradiation versus chemoradiation plus hyperthermia in well selected/conducted and quality controlled randomised trials.","Hyperthermia seems to have an additional effect when added to radiotherapy in the treatment of advanced rectal cancer. 
In the past decades, radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy followed by surgery has become standard treatment for advanced rectal cancer. Chemotherapy is often added, because it enhances the effect of radiotherapy. Another method to amplify radiotherapy is heating the tumor (hyperthermia). In larger tumours there are often regions with a low oxygen concentration. Low oxygen concentrations may hamper the effect of radiotherapy. Hyperthermia can overcome this problem and is able to improve the efficacy of radiotherapy. This systematic review of the literature was done to study the additional value of hyperthermia if added to radiotherapy in advanced rectal cancer, 
Six studies were found in which 520 patients were included. Of them 258 patients were treated with radiotherapy only and 262 with the combination of chemotherapy and radiation. Four of the six studies containing 424 patients reported overall survival rates (i.e. also patients who died from other causes than cancer were reported). Overall survival after 2 years was significantly better in the group treated with the combination of hyperthermia and radiotherapy, but this difference disappeared after a longer period (3, 4 and 5 years). Five studies reported complete remission rates, i.e. a complete disappearance of the tumour. The chance to develop a complete remission was significantly higher in the combined treated patient group. Only 2 studies reported on acute toxicity (that is in general any adverse effect that develops within 3 months during and after treatment). In these 2 studies no significant differences were observed between both treatment groups. Late toxicity data (adverse effects that developed during the years following treatment) were not reported. 
In conclusion hyperthermia seems to have an additional effect when added to radiotherapy in the treatment of advanced rectal cancer. It is not possible to say if this effect is as strong as the combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. More well conducted studies are needed to draw firm conclusions.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Heat Therapy Plus Radiation to Standard Treatment for Rectal Cancer

## What was this study about?

Researchers reviewed past studies to see if adding heat therapy (called hyperthermia) to radiation treatment works better than standard treatment for people with rectal cancer that has spread locally but not to distant parts of the body.

## What treatments were compared?

The researchers looked at studies comparing:
- Radiation therapy alone
- Radiation therapy plus heat therapy

They wanted to see which approach worked better before surgery.

## Who was studied?

The review included 520 adults with locally advanced rectal cancer from 6 different studies conducted between 1990 and 2007. About half (258 people) received radiation only, and half (262 people) received radiation plus heat therapy.

## What did the researchers find?

**Survival:**
- After 2 years, people who received radiation plus heat therapy were more likely to be alive
- However, this benefit disappeared when looking at survival after 3, 4, or 5 years

**Tumor response:**
- People who received radiation plus heat therapy were nearly 3 times more likely to have their tumors completely disappear

**Side effects:**
- Only 2 studies reported on immediate side effects, and there was no significant difference between the two treatment groups
- Information about long-term side effects was not available

## What does this mean?

While adding heat therapy to radiation showed some promising short-term results, more research is needed to understand if this approach is truly better than current standard treatments, which often include chemotherapy combined with radiation.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

Purpose
Researchers wanted to see if adding gentle heat (hyperthermia) to radiation before surgery for rectal cancer works as well or better than radiation alone. They looked at survival, how often the tumor fully went away (complete response), and side effects.

Who was studied
- Adults with rectal cancer being treated before surgery
- Only randomized phase II and III trials were included

Treatments compared
- Radiation therapy alone
- Radiation therapy plus hyperthermia (heat applied to the tumor area)

What the researchers measured
- Survival at 2, 3, 4, and 5 years
- Complete tumor response (no tumor found by exam or under a microscope)
- Side effects during treatment (acute) and long-term side effects (late)
- Local tumor control (if the tumor came back in the pelvis) was planned, but main results did not report it

Study size and dates
- 6 randomized trials published between 1990 and 2007
- 520 people total: 258 had radiation alone; 262 had radiation plus hyperthermia
- Studies searched up to May 2007

Key results
- Survival: After 2 years, more people were alive in the radiation plus hyperthermia group. This benefit did not continue at 3, 4, or 5 years.
- Complete response: More people had a complete response with radiation plus hyperthermia than with radiation alone.
- Side effects: Only 2 studies reported short-term side effects. They found no clear difference between the two groups. Long-term side effects were not reported.

Safety
- Short-term side effects appeared similar in the two groups in the few studies that reported them.
- There is not enough information on long-term side effects.

What this means
Adding heat to radiation before surgery may increase the chance the tumor goes away and may improve survival at 2 years, but not later years. We don’t know enough about long-term side effects.

Gaps and next steps
More high-quality trials are needed to compare:
- Chemoradiation (chemotherapy plus radiation)
- Thermoradiation (radiation plus hyperthermia)
- Chemoradiation plus hyperthermia"
58,"Background
The use of peri‐implantation glucocorticoids has been advocated to improve embryo implantation during assistive reproductive technology (ART) cycles such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). It has been proposed that glucocorticoids may improve the intrauterine environment by acting as immunomodulators to reduce the uterine natural killer (NK) cell count and activity, normalising the cytokine expression profile in the endometrium and by suppression of endometrial inflammation. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of glucocorticoids versus no glucocorticoids administered around the time of anticipated implantation in women undergoing IVF or ICSI. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility (CGF) Group specialised register, CENTRAL (now also containing output from two trial registers and CINAHL), MEDLINE and Embase, on 20 December 2021, together with reference checking, contact with experts in the field and relevant conference proceedings to identify additional studies. This review is an update of the review first published in  2007 and last updated in 2012. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy of supplementary systemic administration of glucocorticoids in the peri‐implantation period with a placebo or no glucocorticoids in subfertile women undergoing IVF or ICSI were included. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. The primary review outcomes were live birth rate and multiple pregnancy. 
Main results
We included 16 RCTs (2232 couples analysed). We are uncertain whether glucocorticoids improved live birth rates (odds ratio (OR) 1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 2.71; 2 RCTs, n = 366; I2 = 7%; very low‐certainty evidence). This suggests that if the chance of live birth following no glucocorticoids/placebo is assumed to be 9%, the chance following glucocorticoids would be between 6% and 21%. We are also uncertain whether there was a difference between peri‐implantation glucocorticoids on multiple pregnancy rates per couple (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.20; 4 RCTs, n = 504; I2 = 53%; very low‐certainty evidence). The I2 of 53% may represent moderate statistical heterogeneity and results have to be interpreted with caution. With regard to pregnancy rates, we are uncertain whether there was a difference between ongoing pregnancy rates after glucocorticoids versus no glucocorticoids/placebo (OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.76; 3 RCTs, n = 476; I2 = 0%; very low‐certainty evidence) and clinical pregnancy rates after glucocorticoids versus no glucocorticoids/placebo (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.44; 13 RCTs, n = 1967; I2 = 0%; low‐certainty evidence). This suggests that if the chance of clinical pregnancy following no glucocorticoids/placebo is assumed to be 25%, the chance following glucocorticoids would be between 24% and 32%. Furthermore, we are also uncertain whether peri‐implantation glucocorticoids influenced miscarriage rates per couple (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.87; 6 RCTs, n = 821; I2 = 0%; very low‐certainty evidence), the incidence of ectopic pregnancies per couple (OR 2.28, 95% CI 0.33 to 15.62; 3 RCTs, n = 320; I2 = 0%; very low‐certainty evidence) and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) per couple (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.90; 3 RCTs, n = 370; I2 = 0%; very low‐certainty evidence) compared to no glucocorticoids/placebo. The evidence was very low to low certainty: the main limitations were serious risk of bias due to poor reporting of study methods, and serious imprecision. 
Authors' conclusions
Overall, there was insufficient evidence that administration of peri‐implantation glucocorticoids in IVF/ICSI cycles influenced clinical outcomes. These findings were limited to the routine use of glucocorticoids in subfertile women undergoing IVF or ICSI.","Peri‐implantation glucocorticoid administration for assisted reproductive technology cycles 
Review question 
This review investigated whether the administration of glucocorticoids around the time of embryo implantation improved the chance of pregnancy in women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) when compared to no glucocorticoid administration. IVF and ICSI are both treatments to help achieve pregnancy. 
Background 
Glucocorticoids are a class of medicines that are similar to the steroid hormones that are naturally made in the body. These medicines reduce inflammation and suppress the body's immune system. Glucocorticoids suppress the inflammation of the endometrium (the tissue in the womb where the embryo implants). Therefore, glucocorticoids have been suggested to improve the chance of embryo implantation and pregnancy in women undergoing IVF or ICSI cycles. 
Study characteristics 
We found 16 randomised controlled trials (studies where treatments are decided at random; these usually give the most reliable evidence about treatment effects) comparing glucocorticoids around the time of embryo implantation versus no glucocorticoids or placebo (dummy treatment), in 2232 couples undergoing IVF/ICSI. The evidence is current to 20 December 2021. 
Key results 
Considering the quality of evidence, we are uncertain whether there was a difference in live birth rates after glucocorticoids. The evidence suggests that if the chance of live birth following no glucocorticoids or placebo is assumed to be 9%, the chance following glucocorticoids would be between 6% and 21%. We are also uncertain whether there was a difference in multiple pregnancy rates (more than one embryo per pregnancy). With regard to ongoing pregnancy and clinical pregnancy rates, we are also uncertain whether there was a difference between glucocorticoids versus no glucocorticoids or placebo. The evidence suggests that if the chance of clinical pregnancy following no glucocorticoids or placebo is assumed to be 25%, the chance following glucocorticoids would be between 24% and 32%. We are also uncertain whether there was a difference in adverse events such as ectopic pregnancy, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (pain and swelling of the ovaries and tummy), but these were poorly and inconsistently reported. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was very low to low quality. The main limitations were poor reporting of study methods and the small size of included studies. More research is needed to work out the possible role of this therapy in well‐defined patient groups.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Steroid Medication Around Embryo Implantation During Fertility Treatment

## What was this study about?

Researchers wanted to find out if giving steroid medications (called glucocorticoids) around the time an embryo implants in the uterus could help women get pregnant during fertility treatments like IVF (in vitro fertilization) or ICSI (a procedure where sperm is injected directly into an egg).

Some doctors thought these medications might help by calming the immune system in the uterus and reducing inflammation, which could make it easier for an embryo to implant and grow.

## What did the researchers do?

The research team looked at 16 studies that included 2,232 couples. These studies compared women who received glucocorticoid medications around the time of embryo implantation to women who received either a placebo (fake medication) or no medication at all.

The researchers looked at several outcomes, including:
- Live birth rates (the most important outcome)
- Pregnancy rates
- Multiple pregnancies (twins, triplets, etc.)
- Miscarriages
- Side effects

## What did they find?

The researchers could not determine whether glucocorticoids made a difference because the evidence quality was very low. Specifically:

- **Live births**: It's unclear if the medication increased the chances of having a baby
- **Pregnancy rates**: It's unclear if the medication helped women get pregnant
- **Multiple pregnancies**: It's unclear if the medication affected the chances of having twins or more
- **Miscarriages**: It's unclear if the medication affected miscarriage rates
- **Side effects**: It's unclear if the medication caused more complications

## What does this mean?

Based on current evidence, there is not enough proof that giving glucocorticoid medications around embryo implantation time helps women undergoing IVF or ICSI treatments. More high-quality research is needed before doctors can recommend this treatment as a routine part of fertility care.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

Purpose
Researchers wanted to see if taking glucocorticoids (a type of steroid) around the time an embryo is expected to implant can help people undergoing IVF or ICSI.

Who was studied
- Adults having IVF or ICSI for infertility
- 16 randomized controlled trials
- 2,232 couples total
- Studies found by December 20, 2021

What was tested
- Glucocorticoids taken by mouth or injection around the time of embryo implantation
- Compared to placebo or no glucocorticoids

Main outcomes measured
- Live birth
- Multiple pregnancy (twins or more)
- Ongoing or clinical pregnancy
- Miscarriage
- Ectopic pregnancy
- Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)
- Side effects and safety

Key results
- Live birth: It is unclear if glucocorticoids help. If the chance of live birth without them is about 9%, with them it might be between 6% and 21%.
- Clinical pregnancy: It is unclear if they help. If the chance without them is about 25%, with them it might be between 24% and 32%.
- Multiple pregnancy, miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, and OHSS: No clear differences.
- Overall, the evidence was low to very low certainty. Many studies had weak methods or too few participants, so results are uncertain.

Safety
- Reported safety outcomes (miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, OHSS) did not clearly differ between groups.
- Because evidence is limited, uncommon side effects may not be well known.

Timing
- Studies looked at glucocorticoids given around the time the embryo would implant during the IVF/ICSI cycle.

What this means
- There is not enough good-quality evidence to support routine use of glucocorticoids during IVF/ICSI to improve outcomes.
- People considering this medicine should discuss potential benefits and risks with their fertility team."
59,"Background
Studies consistently show a relationship between social disadvantage and low birthweight. Many countries have programmes offering special assistance to women thought to be at risk for giving birth to a low birthweight infant. These programmes, collectively referred to in this review as additional social support, may include emotional support, which gives a person a feeling of being loved and cared for, tangible/instrumental support, in the form of direct assistance/home visits, and informational support, through the provision of advice, guidance and counselling. The programmes may be delivered by multidisciplinary teams of health professionals, specially trained lay workers, or a combination of lay and professional workers. This is an update of a review first published in 2003 and updated in 2010. 
Objectives
The primary objective was to assess the effects of programmes offering additional social support (emotional, instrumental/tangible and informational) compared with routine care, for pregnant women believed to be at high risk for giving birth to babies that are either preterm (less than 37 weeks' gestation) or weigh less than 2500 g, or both, at birth. Secondary objectives were to determine whether the effectiveness of support was mediated by timing of onset (early versus later in pregnancy) or type of provider (healthcare professional or lay person). 
Search methods
For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 5 February 2018, and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials of additional social support during at‐risk pregnancy by either a professional (social worker, midwife, or nurse) or specially trained lay person, compared to routine care. We defined additional social support as some form of emotional support (e.g. caring, empathy, trust), tangible/instrumental support (e.g. transportation to clinic appointments, home visits complemented with phone calls, help with household responsibilities) or informational support (advice and counselling about nutrition, rest, stress management, use of alcohol/recreational drugs). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
This updated review includes a total of 25 studies, with outcome data for 11,246 mothers and babies enrolled in 21 studies. We assessed the overall risk of bias of included studies to be low or unclear, mainly because of limited reporting or uncertainty in how randomisation was generated or concealed (which led us to downgrade the quality of most outcomes to moderate), and the impracticability of blinding participants. 
When compared with routine care, programmes offering additional social support for at‐risk pregnant women may slightly reduce the number of babies born with a birthweight less than 2500 g from 127 per 1000 to 120 per 1000 (risk ratio (RR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.04; 16 studies, n = 11,770; moderate‐quality evidence), and the number of babies born with a gestational age less than 37 weeks at birth from 128 per 1000 to 117 per 1000 (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.01, 14 studies, n = 12,282; moderate‐quality evidence), though the confidence intervals for the pooled effect for both of these outcomes just crossed the line of no effect, suggesting any effect is not large. There may be little or no difference between interventions for stillbirth/neonatal death (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.41; 15 studies, n = 12,091; low‐quality evidence). Secondary outcomes of moderate quality suggested that there is probably a reduction in caesarean section (from 215 per 1000 to 194 per 1000; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.97; 15 studies, n = 9550), a reduction in the number of antenatal hospital admissions per participant (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.91; 4 studies; n = 787), and a reduction in the mean number of hospitalisation episodes (mean difference −0.05, 95% CI −0.06 to −0.04; 1 study, n = 1525) in the social support group, compared to the controls. 
Postnatal depression and women's satisfaction were reported in different ways in the studies that considered these outcomes and so we could not include data in a meta‐analysis. In one study postnatal depression appeared to be slightly lower in the support group in women who screened positively on the Edinbugh Postnatal Depression Scale at eight to 12 weeks postnatally (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.01; 1 study, n = 1008; moderate‐quality evidence). In another study, again postnatal depression appeared to be slightly lower in the support group and this was a self‐report measure assessed at six weeks postnatally (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.05; 1 study, n = 458; low‐quality evidence). A higher proportion of women in one study reported that their prenatal care was very helpful in the supported group (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.30; 1 study, n = 223; moderate‐quality evidence), although in another study results were similar. Another study assessed satisfaction with prenatal care as being ""not good"" in 51 of 945 in the additional support group, compared with 45 of 942 in the usual care group. 
No studies considered long‐term morbidity for the infant. No single outcome was reported in all studies. Subgroup analysis demonstrated consistency of effect when the support was provided by a healthcare professional or a trained lay worker. 
The descriptions of the additional social support were generally consistent across all studies and included emotional support, tangible support such as home visits, and informational support. 
Authors' conclusions
Pregnant women need the support of caring family members, friends, and health professionals. While programmes that offer additional social support during pregnancy are unlikely to have a large impact on the proportion of low birthweight babies or birth before 37 weeks' gestation and no impact on stillbirth or neonatal death, they may be helpful in reducing the likelihood of caesarean birth and antenatal hospital admission.","Support during pregnancy for women at increased risk of low birthweight babies
What is the issue? 
Babies can have a low birthweight if they are born early, before 37 weeks gestational age, or are born small because the mother was poorly nourished through the pregnancy. Poverty can lead to malnutrition, unhealthy living environments, increased risk of infection, and increased stress in daily life. The social stigma associated with being marginalised in society is also a cause of stress. Babies whose growth has been restricted during pregnancy are more likely to die around the time of birth or to suffer from health problems. 
Why is this important? 
Many countries offer programmes giving special assistance to women thought to be at risk of giving birth to low birthweight babies. These programmes can include emotional support, direct assistance such as home visits, transportation to clinic appointments or help with household responsibilities, and informational support such as guidance and counselling. We set out to assess the effects of programmes offering additional social support compared with routine care, for pregnant women believed to be at high risk of giving birth to low birthweight babies. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence on 5 February 2018. We identified 21 randomised controlled trials from which 11,246 mother‐baby pairs contributed results for this review. Examples of the additional social support include information, home visits, telephone calls and stress management. The overall quality of evidence for most outcomes was moderate. It was not possible to blind women to which group they were in. 
We found that women who received additional social support during pregnancy may be slightly less likely to have a baby with low birthweight (16 studies, 11,770 babies), or give birth too early (14 studies, 12,282 babies). The number of babies that died around the time of birth was similar for both groups of women (15 studies, 12,091 babies). Women who received the additional social support were, however, probably less likely to be admitted to hospital during their pregnancy (4 studies, 787 women), or to have a caesarean birth (15 studies, 9550 women). Women with additional social support may be less likely to be depressed (1 study, 1008 women). Findings around satisfaction with care were mixed, with one study reporting the support group being more satisfied, whilst another study suggested women in the usual care group were more satisfied. The findings did not appear to be different if the social support was provided by trained lay people or health professionals. 
What does this mean? 
Although programmes that offer additional social support during pregnancy are unlikely to prevent the pregnancy from resulting in a low birthweight or early birth, before 37 weeks of pregnancy, they may be helpful in reducing the likelihood of antenatal hospital admissions and the need for caesarean births. 
Additional social support is not powerful enough to improve the outcomes of the pregnancy during which it is provided, as measured by the outcomes considered in this review. The factors contributing to deprivation require social change in order to bring about improvements in health for mothers and their newborn babies.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Extra Support Programs for Pregnant Women at Risk

## What was this study about?

Researchers reviewed programs that provide extra support to pregnant women who may be at higher risk of having babies born too early or with low birth weight. These support programs go beyond regular prenatal care and can include:

- **Emotional support** – helping women feel cared for and valued
- **Practical help** – such as rides to appointments, home visits, or help with household tasks
- **Information and advice** – guidance on nutrition, rest, managing stress, and avoiding alcohol or drugs

The support was provided by healthcare workers (like nurses or social workers) or by specially trained community members.

## What did the researchers find?

The review included 25 studies with information from over 11,000 mothers and babies.

**Main findings:**
- Extra support programs may slightly reduce the number of babies born weighing less than 5.5 pounds (from about 13 out of 100 to 12 out of 100)
- These programs may slightly reduce the number of babies born before 37 weeks (from about 13 out of 100 to 12 out of 100)
- There was little to no difference in stillbirths or newborn deaths

**Other benefits:**
- Fewer cesarean sections (from about 22 out of 100 to 19 out of 100)
- Fewer hospital admissions during pregnancy
- Some women reported feeling less depressed after birth
- Some women felt their prenatal care was more helpful

## What does this mean?

While extra support programs during pregnancy are unlikely to make large changes in birth weight or early births, they may help reduce cesarean births and hospital stays during pregnancy. These programs appear to work equally well whether provided by healthcare professionals or trained community members.",0,Plano,"Plain-Language Summary of the Research

What was the goal?
- To see if giving extra social support to pregnant women at higher risk can improve birth outcomes compared with routine care.

Who was in the studies?
- Pregnant women thought to be at higher risk for having a baby born early (before 37 weeks) or with low birthweight (under 2500 g).
- The review included 25 studies; outcome data were available for about 11,000–12,000 mothers and babies.

What was the support?
- Extra help in addition to routine prenatal care, such as:
  - Emotional support (caring, empathy).
  - Practical help (home visits, help with transport, phone check-ins).
  - Information and advice (nutrition, rest, stress, substance use).
- Support was given by health professionals (nurses, midwives, social workers), trained lay workers, or both.

What was it compared to?
- Usual prenatal care without the added support program.

Main findings
- Low birthweight: May be slightly reduced (about 127 per 1000 with usual care vs 120 per 1000 with extra support). Any benefit is small.
- Preterm birth (before 37 weeks): May be slightly reduced (about 128 per 1000 vs 117 per 1000). Any benefit is small.
- Stillbirth or newborn death: Little to no difference between groups.
- Cesarean birth: Probably reduced (about 215 per 1000 vs 194 per 1000) with extra support.
- Hospital stays during pregnancy: Fewer admissions and fewer episodes with extra support.
- Postnatal depression: Two studies suggested a small decrease, but results were not consistent.
- Satisfaction with prenatal care: Mixed results; one study found higher satisfaction with extra support.

Timing and who provided support
- Benefits were similar whether support came from a healthcare professional or a trained lay worker.
- Studies started support at different times in pregnancy; no clear difference by timing.

Safety
- No increase in serious harms was found.
- No studies reported long-term health outcomes for babies.

Quality of the evidence
- Overall evidence was moderate for many key outcomes. Blinding was not possible, and study reporting varied.

Bottom line
- Extra social support in pregnancy is unlikely to make a large difference in low birthweight or early birth, and does not change the risk of stillbirth or newborn death.
- It likely reduces cesarean births and hospital stays before birth, and may improve some mothers’ experience of care."
60,"Background
Cultural competence education for health professionals aims to ensure all people receive equitable, effective health care, particularly those from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds. It has emerged as a strategy in high‐income English‐speaking countries in response to evidence of health disparities, structural inequalities, and poorer quality health care and outcomes among people from minority CALD backgrounds. However there is a paucity of evidence to link cultural competence education with patient, professional and organisational outcomes. To assess efficacy, for this review we developed a four‐dimensional conceptual framework comprising educational content, pedagogical approach, structure of the intervention, and participant characteristics to provide consistency in describing and assessing interventions. We use the term 'CALD participants' when referring to minority CALD populations as a whole. When referring to participants in included studies we describe them in terms used by study authors. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of cultural competence education interventions for health professionals on patient‐related outcomes, health professional outcomes, and healthcare organisation outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched: MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1946 to June 2012); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library) (June 2012); EMBASE (OvidSP) (1988 to June 2012); CINAHL (EbscoHOST) (1981 to June 2012); PsycINFO (OvidSP) (1806 to June 2012); Proquest Dissertations and Theses database (1861 to October 2011); ERIC (CSA) (1966 to October 2011); LILACS (1982 to March 2012); and Current Contents (OvidSP) (1993 Week 27 to June 2012). 
Searches in MEDLINE, CENTRAL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Proquest Dissertations and Theses, ERIC and Current Contents were updated in February 2014. Searches in CINAHL were updated in March 2014. 
There were no language restrictions.
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs, and controlled clinical trials of educational interventions for health professionals working in health settings that aimed to improve: health outcomes of patients/consumers of minority cultural and linguistic backgrounds; knowledge, skills and attitudes of health professionals in delivering culturally competent care; and healthcare organisation performance in culturally competent care. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the conceptual framework as the basis for data extraction. Two review authors independently extracted data on interventions, methods, and outcome measures and mapped them against the framework. Additional information was sought from study authors. We present results in narrative and tabular form. 
Main results
We included five RCTs involving 337 healthcare professionals and 8400 patients; at least 3463 (41%) were from CALD backgrounds. Trials compared the effects of cultural competence training for health professionals, with no training. Three studies were from the USA, one from Canada and one from The Netherlands. They involved health professionals of diverse backgrounds, although most were not from CALD minorities. Cultural background was determined using a validated scale (one study), self‐report (two studies) or not reported (two studies). The design effect from clustering meant an effective minimum sample size of 3164 CALD participants. No meta‐analyses were performed. The quality of evidence for each outcome was judged to be low. 
Two trials comparing cultural competence training with no training found no evidence of effect for treatment outcomes, including the proportion of patients with diabetes achieving LDL cholesterol control targets (risk difference (RD) ‐0.02, 95% CI ‐0.06 to 0.02; 1 study, USA, 2699 ""black"" patients, moderate quality), or change in weight loss (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.07, 95% CI ‐0.41 to 0.55, 1 study, USA, effective sample size (ESS) 68 patients, low quality). 
Health behaviour (client concordance with attendance) improved significantly among intervention participants compared with controls (relative risk (RR) 1.53, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.27, 1 study, USA, ESS 28 women, low quality). Involvement in care by ""non‐Western"" patients (described as ""mainly Turkish, Moroccan, Cape Verdean and Surinamese patients"") with largely ""Western"" doctors improved in terms of mutual understanding (SMD 0.21, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.42, 1 study, The Netherlands, 109 patients, low quality). Evaluations of care were mixed (three studies). Two studies found no evidence of effect in: proportion of patients reporting satisfaction with consultations (RD 0.14, 95% CI ‐0.03 to 0.31, 1 study, The Netherlands, 109 patients, low quality); patient scores of physician cultural competency (SMD 0.11 95% CI ‐0.63 to 0.85, 1 study, USA, ESS 68 ""Caucasian"" and ""non‐Causcasian"" patients (described as Latino, African American, Asian and other, low quality). Client perceptions of health professionals were significantly higher in the intervention group (SMD 1.60 95% CI 1.05 to 2.15, 1 study, USA, ESS 28 ""Black"" women, low quality). 
No study assessed adverse outcomes.
There was no evidence of effect on clinician awareness of ""racial"" differences in quality of care among clients at a USA health centre (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.94. P = 0.07) with no adjustment for clustering. Included studies did not measure other outcomes of interest. Sensitivity analyses using different values for the Intra‐cluster coefficient (ICC) did not substantially alter the magnitude or significance of summary effect sizes. 
All four domains of the conceptual framework were addressed, suggesting agreement on core components of cultural competence education interventions may be possible. 
Authors' conclusions
Cultural competence continues to be developed as a major strategy to address health inequities. Five studies assessed the effects of cultural competence education for health professionals on patient‐related outcomes. There was positive, albeit low‐quality evidence, showing improvements in the involvement of CALD patients. Findings either showed support for the educational interventions or no evidence of effect. No studies assessed adverse outcomes. The quality of evidence is insufficient to draw generalisable conclusions, largely due to heterogeneity of the interventions in content, scope, design, duration, implementation and outcomes selected. 
Further research is required to establish greater methodological rigour and uniformity on core components of education interventions, including how they are described and evaluated. Our conceptual framework provides a basis for establishing consensus to improve reporting and allow assessment across studies and populations. Future studies should measure the patient outcomes used: treatment outcomes; health behaviours; involvement in care and evaluations of care. Studies should also measure the impact of these types of interventions on healthcare organisations, as these are likely to affect uptake and sustainability.","Cultural competence education for health professionals
This review assessed the effects of cultural competence education for health professionals. Five studies were included involving 337 health professionals (including general practitioners, primary care teams and counsellors) and 8400 patients. Three studies were conducted in the USA, one in Canada and one in The Netherlands. At least 3000 patients were from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds and some of the health professional groups were also from CALD backgrounds. Due to differences in terminology and their cultural meanings, and the evolving nature of concepts and practices in this area, in this review we use the term 'CALD participants' when referring to minority, CALD populations as a whole. When referring to participants in included studies we describe them in the terms used by the relevant study authors. 
The studies differed in how the education was provided and which outcome measures were used. Involvement in care improved in one study in The Netherlands measuring mutual understanding between minority CALD background patients and their doctors. Health behaviour also changed in one small study in the USA, in which women whose counsellors had received education were three times more likely to attend planned counselling sessions. However there was no evidence of an effect on a range of treatment outcomes or evaluations of care. None of the five included studies examined the effect of cultural competence education on healthcare organisations, or assessed adverse outcomes. 
The review findings showed some support for cultural competence education for health professionals. These findings are tentative, however, as the quality of the evidence was low and more data are needed. Future research on cultural competence education for health professionals should seek greater consensus on the core components of cultural competence education, how participants are described and the outcomes assessed.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Training Healthcare Workers to Better Care for People from Different Cultural Backgrounds

## What was this study about?

Researchers wanted to know if special training helps healthcare workers provide better care to patients from different cultural and language backgrounds. They looked at studies where some healthcare workers received this training and others did not, then compared the results.

## Who was studied?

The review included 5 studies with:
- 337 healthcare workers (mostly not from minority backgrounds)
- 8,400 patients (at least 3,463 from diverse cultural and language backgrounds)

Studies took place in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands.

## What did the training involve?

Healthcare workers received education on how to provide care that respects and responds to different cultural needs and communication styles. The training varied in what was taught, how it was taught, and how long it lasted.

## What did researchers measure?

They looked at whether the training improved:
- **Health outcomes** – like blood sugar control in diabetes patients
- **Patient involvement** – how well patients and doctors understood each other
- **Patient satisfaction** – how patients felt about their care
- **Healthcare worker awareness** – whether workers better recognized differences in care quality

## What were the results?

- **No clear improvement** in health outcomes like cholesterol control or weight loss
- **Some improvement** in patient attendance at appointments and how well patients and doctors understood each other
- **Mixed results** for patient satisfaction – one study showed improvement, while others showed no change
- **No harmful effects** were reported, though studies didn't specifically look for them

## What does this mean?

The evidence is limited and not strong enough to make firm conclusions. More high-quality research is needed using similar methods so results can be compared. Future studies should focus on patient outcomes and how these programs affect entire healthcare organizations.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary: Cultural competence training for health workers

What was the goal?
- To see if training health professionals in cultural competence helps improve care for people from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds.

Who was studied?
- 5 randomized controlled trials.
- 337 health professionals.
- About 8,400 patients; at least 41% were from CALD backgrounds.
- Studies took place in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands.

What was the training?
- Education to help health workers provide respectful, effective care to people from different cultures and languages.
- Compared training vs. no training.
- Training content and length varied by study.

What outcomes were measured?
- Patient treatment results (for example, cholesterol control in diabetes, weight change).
- Health behaviors (such as keeping appointments).
- Involvement in care (mutual understanding between patient and clinician).
- Patient evaluations of care (satisfaction and views of clinician cultural competence).
- Clinician awareness of differences in care quality.
- No studies measured effects on healthcare organizations.
- No studies reported harmful effects.

Main findings
- No clear improvement in medical results:
  - No difference in diabetes cholesterol targets.
  - No difference in weight loss.
- Some positive changes:
  - Better appointment attendance in one small study.
  - Slight improvement in mutual understanding between “non‑Western” patients and mostly “Western” doctors in one study.
  - Mixed results for patient satisfaction; one small study found higher patient ratings of clinicians.
- No adverse events were reported.
- Overall evidence quality was low, and the trainings differed a lot, so results are uncertain.

Timing
- Research databases were searched up to early 2014.

Bottom line
- Cultural competence training may improve patient involvement and some behaviors, but clear benefits on medical results were not shown.
- More high‑quality, consistent studies are needed, including measures of effects on healthcare organizations."
61,"Background
Each year approximately 350,000 women in the United Kingdom and millions more worldwide, experience perineal suturing following childbirth. The postpartum management of perineal trauma is a core component of routine maternity care. However, for those women whose perineal wound dehisces (breaks down), the management varies depending on individual practitioners preferences as there is limited scientific evidence and no clear guidelines to inform best practice. For most women the wound will be managed expectantly whereas, others may be offered secondary suturing. 
Objectives
To evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of secondary suturing of dehisced perineal wounds compared to non‐suturing (healing by secondary intention, expectancy). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 July 2013) and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of secondary suturing of dehisced perineal wounds (second‐, third‐ or fourth‐degree tear or episiotomy), following wound debridement and the removal of any remaining suture material within the first six weeks following childbirth compared with non‐suturing. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion. Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. 
Main results
Two small studies of poor methodological quality including 52 women with a dehisced and/or infected episiotomy wound at point of entry have been included. 
Only one small study presented data in relation to wound healing at less than four weeks, (the primary outcome measure for this review), although no reference was made to demonstrate how healing was measured. There was a trend to favour this outcome in the resuturing group, however, this difference was not statistically significant (risk ratio (RR) 1.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 3.88, one study, 17 women). 
Similarly, only one trial reported on rates of dyspareunia (a secondary outcome measure for this review) at two months and six months with no statistically significant difference between both groups; two months, (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.11, one study, 26 women) and six months, (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.87, one study 32 women). This trial also included data on the numbers of women who resumed sexual intercourse by two months and six months. Significantly more women in the secondary suturing group had resumed intercourse by two months (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.89, one study, 35 women), although by six months there was no significant difference between the two groups (RR 1.08, 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.28). 
Neither of the trials included data in relation to the following prespecified secondary outcome measures: pain at any time interval; the woman's satisfaction with the aesthetic results of the perineal wound; exclusive breastfeeding; maternal anxiety or depression. 
Authors' conclusions
Based on this review, there is currently insufficient evidence available to either support or refute secondary suturing for the management of broken down perineal wounds following childbirth. There is an urgent need for a robust randomised controlled trial to evaluate fully the comparative effects of both treatment options.","Re‐stitching broken down perineal (the area between the vagina and back passage) wounds compared with non‐stitching 
It is estimated that 350,000 women per year in the United Kingdom and millions more worldwide experience perineal stitches because of a childbirth‐related natural tear or cut (episiotomy). Sometimes the perineal wound breaks down (opens up). This may be because it becomes infected, which could lead to systemic infection and sepsis. The current management of broken down wounds varies widely between individual health practitioners and hospitals. For most women the broken down perineal wound is left to heal naturally (managed expectantly). This is a slow process and it can take several weeks for the wound to heal completely resulting in persistent pain and discomfort at the perineal wound site, also possible urinary retention and defecation problems. The alternative is re‐stitching. Due to the lack of research evidence, we do not know the best way to treat this type of complication. This review looked at randomised controlled trials of re‐stitching broken down wounds compared with non‐stitching. Two small studies were identified. One study, involving 17 women, showed a marginal tendency to improved healing in the women who were re‐stitched, however, this evidence was not conclusive. In the other study involving 35 women, more women had resumed intercourse in the re‐suturing group at two months. As the studies were small and of poor quality, it is not possible to draw conclusions about the best way to manage wound breakdown after childbirth. Therefore, there is an urgent need to conduct further studies to compare fully the benefits and risks of both treatments.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Two Ways to Treat Perineal Wounds That Break Down After Childbirth

## What is this study about?

After giving birth, many women need stitches in the area between the vagina and anus (called the perineum). Sometimes these stitches don't heal properly and the wound breaks open. Doctors aren't sure about the best way to treat this problem. Some let the wound heal on its own, while others put in new stitches. This review looked at studies comparing these two approaches.

## What did researchers look for?

Researchers searched for studies that compared:
- **Re-stitching the wound** (putting in new stitches after cleaning the area)
- **Letting the wound heal on its own** (no new stitches)

They only included studies where women were randomly assigned to one treatment or the other within the first six weeks after giving birth.

## What did they find?

Researchers found only 2 small studies with a total of 52 women. Both studies had quality problems, making it hard to trust the results.

The studies looked at:
- **Wound healing:** One study suggested wounds might heal faster with new stitches, but the difference wasn't clear enough to be certain
- **Pain during sex:** One study found no clear difference between groups at 2 months or 6 months
- **Returning to sex:** More women who got new stitches had resumed sex by 2 months, but by 6 months both groups were similar

The studies didn't measure pain levels, how women felt about how their wound looked, breastfeeding, or emotional well-being.

## What does this mean?

There isn't enough good evidence to know whether re-stitching or letting wounds heal on their own works better. Larger, better-quality studies are needed to help doctors and women make informed decisions about treatment.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

Purpose
- To compare two ways to treat a perineal wound that has opened after childbirth: resuturing the wound versus letting it heal on its own.

Who this is about
- Women who had a perineal tear or episiotomy that later opened (dehisced) within the first 6 weeks after giving birth. This included second-, third-, or fourth-degree tears.

What was compared
- Secondary suturing: cleaning the wound, removing old stitches, and closing it again with new stitches.
- No suturing: cleaning and care, then allowing the wound to heal on its own (healing by secondary intention).

What the researchers looked for
- Main outcome: wound healing within 4 weeks.
- Other outcomes: pain, painful sex (dyspareunia), when sexual activity resumed, satisfaction with how the area looked, breastfeeding, and maternal anxiety or depression.
- Safety or side effects.

What the studies showed
- Evidence came from 2 small studies with 52 women. The studies were low quality.
- Healing within 4 weeks: one small study (17 women) showed a trend favoring resuturing, but the difference was not statistically significant.
- Painful sex: one study found no clear difference at 2 months or 6 months.
- Resuming sexual activity: more women in the resuturing group resumed by 2 months; by 6 months there was no difference.
- Pain, appearance/satisfaction, breastfeeding, and mental health were not reported.
- Safety and side effects were not reported clearly.

Timing
- Women were included within 6 weeks after birth.
- Follow-up included checks at about 2 months and 6 months.

Bottom line
- There is not enough good-quality evidence to say whether resuturing is better or worse than letting the wound heal on its own after it opens.
- Better, larger clinical trials are needed to guide care."
62,"Background
Tuberculous pericarditis can impair the heart's function and cause death; long term, it can cause the membrane to fibrose and constrict causing heart failure. In addition to antituberculous chemotherapy, treatments include corticosteroids, drainage, and surgery. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of treatments for tuberculous pericarditis.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (27 March 2017); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library (2017, Issue 2); MEDLINE (1966 to 27 March 2017); Embase (1974 to 27 March 2017); and LILACS (1982 to 27 March 2017). In addition we searched the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal using 'tuberculosis' and 'pericard*' as search terms on 27 March 2017. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and contacted researchers in the field of tuberculous pericarditis. This is a new version of the original 2002 review. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened search outputs, evaluated study eligibility, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data; and we resolved any discrepancies by discussion and consensus. One trial assessed the effects of both corticosteroid and Mycobacterium indicus pranii treatment in a two‐by‐two factorial design; we excluded data from the group that received both interventions. We conducted fixed‐effect meta‐analysis and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
Seven trials met the inclusion criteria; all were from sub‐Saharan Africa and included 1959 participants, with 1051/1959 (54%) HIV‐positive. All trials evaluated corticosteroids and one each evaluated colchicine, M. indicus pranii immunotherapy, and open surgical drainage. Four trials (1841 participants) were at low risk of bias, and three trials (118 participants) were at high risk of bias. 
In people who are not infected with HIV, corticosteroids may reduce deaths from all causes (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.09; 660 participants, 4 trials, low certainty evidence) and the need for repeat pericardiocentesis (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.04; 492 participants, 2 trials, low certainty evidence). Corticosteroids probably reduce deaths from pericarditis (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.80; 660 participants, 4 trials, moderate certainty evidence). However, we do not know whether or not corticosteroids have an effect on constriction or cancer among HIV‐negative people (very low certainty evidence). 
In people living with HIV, only 19.9% (203/1959) were on antiretroviral drugs. Corticosteroids may reduce constriction (RR 0.55, 0.26 to 1.16; 575 participants, 3 trials, low certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether corticosteroids have an effect on all‐cause death or cancer (very low certainty evidence); and may have little or no effect on repeat pericardiocentesis (RR 1.02, 0.89 to 1.18; 517 participants, 2 trials, low certainty evidence). 
For colchicine among people living with HIV, we found one small trial (33 participants) which had insufficient data to make any conclusions about any effects on death or constrictive pericarditis. 
Irrespective of HIV status, due to very low certainty evidence from one trial, it is uncertain whether adding M. indicus pranii immunotherapy to antituberculous drugs has an effect on any outcome. 
Open surgical drainage for effusion may reduce repeat pericardiocentesis In HIV‐negative people (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.76; 122 participants, 1 trial, low certainty evidence) but may make little or no difference to other outcomes. We did not find an eligible trial that assessed the effects of open surgical drainage in people living with HIV. 
The review authors found no eligible trials that examined the length of antituberculous treatment needed nor the effects of other adjunctive treatments for tuberculous pericarditis. 
Authors' conclusions
For HIV‐negative patients, corticosteroids may reduce death. For HIV‐positive patients not on antiretroviral drugs, corticosteroids may reduce constriction. For HIV‐positive patients with good antiretroviral drug viral suppression, clinicians may consider the results from HIV‐negative patients more relevant. 
Further research may help evaluate percutaneous drainage of the pericardium under local anaesthesia, the timing of pericardiectomy in tuberculous constrictive pericarditis, and new antibiotic regimens.","Treatment for tuberculosis infection of the membrane around the heart
What is the issue? 
Tuberculosis infection of the pericardium surrounding the heart is uncommon but life‐threatening.
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to assess the effects of treatments for people with tuberculous pericarditis. 
What is this important? 
Doctors prescribe antituberculous drugs for six months, drain fluid from the pericardium if the patient has heart failure, and sometimes remove the pericardium if it is thick and making the patient ill and sometimes give corticosteroids to reduce the effects of the inflammation. 
What are the main results of the review? 
Cochrane researchers collected and examined all potentially relevant studies and found seven trials, all conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa. Six trials evaluated corticosteroids. Other treatments evaluated included Mycobacterium indicus pranii immunotherapy, colchicine, and surgical removal of fluid under general anaesthesia. This review is a new edition of the 2002 review. 
In people not infected with HIV, six trials found that additional steroids may reduce deaths overall (low certainty evidence) and probably reduce deaths caused by pericarditis (moderate certainty evidence). Steroids may prevent reaccumulation of fluid in the pericardial space (low certainty evidence). However, we do not know whether or not corticosteroids have an effect on constriction or cancer among HIV‐negative people (very low certainty evidence). 
In people living with HIV, most people evaluated in the included trials were not on antiretroviral drugs. For these patients, corticosteroids may reduce constrictive pericarditis (low certainty evidence), but we do not know if this translates into a reduction in the number of deaths or cancer (very low certainty evidence). Corticosteroids may have little or no effect on reaccumulation of fluid in the pericardial space (low certainty evidence). 
Colchicine was evaluated in one trial of 33 people, with insufficient data to make any conclusions about an effect. 
Based on one trial, it is uncertain whether adding M. indicus pranii immunotherapy to antituberculous drugs has an effect on any outcome in people with tuberculous pericarditis regardless of their HIV status (very low certainty evidence). 
Open surgical drainage of the fluid accumulating between the heart and the membrane using general anaesthesia may be associated with less life‐threatening reaccumulation of fluid in people who are not infected with HIV, but conclusions are not possible as the number of participants studied was too small. We did not find an eligible trial that assessed the effects of open surgical drainage in people living with HIV. 
The review authors found no eligible trials that examined the length of antituberculous treatment needed nor the effects of other adjunctive treatments for tuberculous pericarditis. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for trials published up to 27 March 2017.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Treatments for Tuberculosis of the Heart's Lining

## What is the health problem?
Tuberculosis (TB) can infect the pericardium—the protective sac around the heart. This infection can cause fluid buildup, make the heart work poorly, and may lead to death. Over time, the sac can become thick and tight, squeezing the heart and causing heart failure.

## What treatments were studied?
Researchers looked at different treatments used along with standard TB antibiotics:
- **Corticosteroids** (anti-inflammatory medicines)
- **Draining fluid** from around the heart
- **Surgery** to remove fluid
- Other medicines like colchicine and an immune therapy

## What did the researchers find?
The review included 7 studies with 1,959 people from sub-Saharan Africa. About half were living with HIV.

### For people without HIV:
- Corticosteroids may reduce deaths overall and probably reduce deaths specifically from pericarditis
- Corticosteroids may reduce the need for repeat fluid drainage procedures
- Surgical drainage may reduce the need for repeat drainage procedures

### For people living with HIV:
- Most people in these studies were not taking HIV medicines
- Corticosteroids may help prevent the heart sac from becoming tight and constricting
- Results were less clear for other outcomes

### Other treatments:
- There wasn't enough information to draw conclusions about colchicine or immune therapy
- No studies looked at how long TB treatment should last for this condition

## What does this mean?
Corticosteroids may help people with TB pericarditis, especially those without HIV or those with well-controlled HIV. More research is needed on drainage procedures, surgery timing, and newer antibiotic combinations.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary: Treatments for tuberculous pericarditis

Purpose
- To find out which treatments help people with tuberculous pericarditis live longer and prevent heart-related problems.

Who was studied
- 7 clinical trials from sub-Saharan Africa
- 1,959 adults total; 54% were living with HIV
- Most trials tested steroids (corticosteroids). Single trials tested colchicine, a vaccine-like immune treatment (Mycobacterium indicus pranii), and open surgical drainage.
- Searches included studies up to March 27, 2017.

Treatments tested
- Corticosteroids (added to standard TB medicines)
- Colchicine (added to standard TB medicines)
- Mycobacterium indicus pranii (added to standard TB medicines)
- Open surgical drainage of fluid around the heart

Main results

For people NOT living with HIV
- Steroids may lower deaths from any cause. Certainty: low.
- Steroids probably lower deaths caused by pericarditis. Certainty: moderate.
- Steroids may reduce the need for repeat fluid drainage with a needle. Certainty: low.
- It’s unclear if steroids affect later scarring around the heart or cancer. Certainty: very low.

For people living with HIV
- Few were on HIV medicines (about 20%).
- Steroids may lower the chance of later scarring around the heart (constriction). Certainty: low.
- It’s unclear if steroids change the risk of death or cancer. Certainty: very low.
- Steroids may make little or no difference in the need for repeat fluid drainage. Certainty: low.

Other treatments
- Colchicine: One small study (33 people with HIV). Not enough data to tell if it helps.
- Mycobacterium indicus pranii: One study. Effects are uncertain.
- Open surgical drainage (in people without HIV): May reduce the need for repeat needle drainage. Certainty: low. May not change other outcomes. No trials in people with HIV.

Safety
- Cancer was checked in some trials, but results were unclear, especially in people with HIV. Other side effects were not well reported.

What this means
- For people without HIV: Adding steroids to TB treatment may help reduce death, especially deaths from pericarditis.
- For people with HIV: Steroids may help prevent later scarring. Effects on survival are unclear, especially when not on HIV treatment.
- For people with well-controlled HIV on medicines, doctors may use results from people without HIV to guide care.

Research gaps
- Best ways to drain fluid using less invasive methods
- When to do surgery to remove the heart lining if it becomes stiff
- Best antibiotic (TB) treatment plans and lengths of treatment"
63,"Background
Panic disorder is common and deleterious to mental well‐being. Psychological therapies and pharmacological interventions are both used as treatments for panic disorder with and without agoraphobia. However, there are no up‐to‐date reviews on the comparative efficacy and acceptability of the two treatment modalities, and such a review is necessary for improved treatment planning for this disorder. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and acceptability of psychological therapies versus pharmacological interventions for panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group Specialised Register on 11 September 2015. This register contains reports of relevant randomised controlled trials from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1950 to present), Embase (1974 to present), and PsycINFO (1967 to present). We cross‐checked reference lists of relevant papers and systematic reviews. We did not apply any restrictions on date, language, or publication status. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials comparing psychological therapies with pharmacological interventions for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia as diagnosed by operationalised criteria in adults. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and resolved any disagreements in consultation with a third review author. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed continuous data using standardised mean differences (with 95% CI). We used the random‐effects model throughout. 
Main results
We included 16 studies with a total of 966 participants in the present review. Eight of the studies were conducted in Europe, four in the USA, two in the Middle East, and one in Southeast Asia. 
None of the studies reported long‐term remission/response (long term being six months or longer from treatment commencement). 
There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.17; 6 studies; 334 participants) or short‐term response (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.86; 5 studies; 277 participants) (very low‐quality evidence), and no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and SSRIs in treatment acceptability as measured using dropouts for any reason (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.22; 6 studies; 334 participants; low‐quality evidence). 
There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and tricyclic antidepressants in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.09; 3 studies; 229 participants), short‐term response (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.10; 4 studies; 270 participants), or dropouts for any reason (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.30; 5 studies; 430 participants) (low‐quality evidence). 
There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and other antidepressants in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.67; 3 studies; 135 participants; very low‐quality evidence) and evidence that psychological therapies did not significantly increase or decrease the short‐term response over other antidepressants (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.37; 3 studies; 128 participants) or dropouts for any reason (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.65; 3 studies; 180 participants) (low‐quality evidence). 
There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and benzodiazepines in terms of short‐term remission (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.65; 3 studies; 95 participants), short‐term response (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.70 to 3.58; 2 studies; 69 participants), or dropouts for any reason (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.36; 3 studies; 116 participants) (very low‐quality evidence). 
There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and either antidepressant alone or antidepressants plus benzodiazepines in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.05; 11 studies; 663 participants) and short‐term response (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18; 12 studies; 800 participants) (low‐quality evidence), and there was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and either antidepressants alone or antidepressants plus benzodiazepines in terms of treatment acceptability as measured by dropouts for any reason (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.51; 13 studies; 909 participants; very low‐quality evidence). The risk of selection bias and reporting bias was largely unclear. Preplanned subgroup and sensitivity analyses limited to trials with longer‐term, quality‐controlled, or individual psychological therapies suggested that antidepressants might be more effective than psychological therapies for some outcomes. 
There were no data to contribute to a comparison between psychological therapies and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and subsequent adverse effects. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence in this review was often imprecise. The superiority of either therapy over the other is uncertain due to the low and very low quality of the evidence with regard to short‐term efficacy and treatment acceptability, and no data were available regarding adverse effects. 
The sensitivity analysis and investigation of the sources of heterogeneity indicated three possible influential factors: quality control of psychological therapies, the length of intervention, and the individual modality of psychological therapies. 
Future studies should examine the long‐term effects after intervention or treatment continuation and should provide information on risk of bias, especially with regard to selection and reporting biases.","Psychological therapies versus medication for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults 
Why is this review important? 
Panic disorder is common and harmful to mental well‐being. Psychological therapies and medication (usually antidepressants or benzodiazepines) are effective against panic disorder. However, there are no up‐to‐date reviews on the superiority and acceptability of these two forms of treatment, and such a review is necessary to improve treatment planning for this disorder. 
Who will be interested in this review? 
Adult patients, professionals working in mental health services, and general practitioners.
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
The present review aims to answer the following questions:
• Are psychological therapies more effective than antidepressants or benzodiazepines?
• Are psychological therapies more acceptable than antidepressants or benzodiazepines?
Which studies were included in the review? 
We searched databases to find all trials published between 1950 and September 2015 comparing psychological therapies with antidepressants or benzodiazepines for the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults. To be included in the review, the studies had to be randomised controlled trials and had to include people with a clear diagnosis of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. 
We included 16 studies with a total of 966 participants in the review. We rated the overall quality of the evidence from these studies as very low to moderate. 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
The superiority or inferiority of psychological therapies over drugs remains unclear with regard to treatment effectiveness and acceptability. 
None of the studies reported information regarding long‐term effectiveness and quality of life. 
What should happen next? 
The review authors recommend that future research should use less biased psychological therapies, evaluate long‐term outcomes, and report information related to the risk of study bias.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Talk Therapy and Medications for Panic Disorder

## What is this study about?

Researchers wanted to find out whether talk therapy (psychological treatment) or medications work better for treating panic disorder in adults. Panic disorder causes sudden episodes of intense fear and physical symptoms like rapid heartbeat and shortness of breath. Some people with panic disorder also develop agoraphobia, which is fear of places or situations where escape might be difficult.

## What did the researchers do?

The research team looked at 16 studies involving 966 adults from different countries. These studies compared talk therapy with various medications, including:
- SSRIs (a common type of antidepressant)
- Tricyclic antidepressants (an older type of antidepressant)
- Other antidepressants
- Benzodiazepines (anti-anxiety medications)

## What did they find?

The researchers found no clear winner between talk therapy and medications. Both approaches showed similar results for:
- How well they reduced panic symptoms in the short term
- How many people completed treatment without dropping out

The quality of the evidence was generally low, meaning the findings are uncertain. The studies didn't provide information about:
- Long-term results (6 months or more after starting treatment)
- Side effects from treatments

## What does this mean?

Based on current research, neither talk therapy nor medications appear clearly better than the other for treating panic disorder. More high-quality studies are needed, especially ones that track people's progress over longer periods and report more complete information about treatment effects.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

Purpose
- To compare “talk” therapies (psychological therapies) with medicines for adults who have panic symptoms, with or without fear of open or crowded places.

Who was included
- Adults in 16 randomized studies (total 966 people).
- Studies took place in Europe, the USA, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.

Treatments studied
- Psychological therapies (for example, structured talk therapies).
- Medicines:
  - SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors)
  - Tricyclic antidepressants
  - Other antidepressants
  - Benzodiazepines
  - Some studies used antidepressants plus benzodiazepines
- No studies compared psychological therapies with SNRIs.

What the researchers measured
- Short-term results (during treatment; long-term was defined as 6 months or more from when treatment started).
  - Remission: symptoms getting much better.
  - Response: symptoms improving.
- Acceptability: how many people stopped treatment for any reason (dropouts).
- Safety: side effects and harms.

Key findings
- Short term:
  - Psychological therapies and medicines worked about the same for remission and response.
  - Dropout rates were also about the same.
- Long term:
  - No study reported results 6 months or later.
- Safety:
  - Studies did not report side effects, so safety could not be compared.
- Evidence quality:
  - Most evidence was low or very low quality, so results are uncertain.
- In planned extra analyses, medicines sometimes looked better for some outcomes, especially when therapy quality, length, or one-on-one format were considered.

Timing of the search
- The evidence came from studies found up to September 11, 2015.

Limits of the evidence
- Few people in each comparison.
- Missing long-term results.
- Not enough information about side effects.
- Possible risks of bias in how some studies were done and reported.

What this means
- For short-term care, talk therapies and medicines seem similarly helpful, and people stop them at similar rates. We do not know which works better in the long term or which is safer, because that information was not reported.
- Future studies should track long-term results, report side effects, and ensure high-quality, well-described therapy and study methods."
64,"Background
Sedation reduces patient levels of anxiety and stress, facilitates the delivery of care and ensures safety. Alpha‐2 agonists have a range of effects including sedation, analgesia and antianxiety. They sedate, but allow staff to interact with patients and do not suppress respiration. They are attractive alternatives for long‐term sedation during mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients. 
Objectives
To assess the safety and efficacy of alpha‐2 agonists for sedation of more than 24 hours, compared with traditional sedatives, in mechanically‐ventilated critically ill patients. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 10, 2014), MEDLINE (1946 to 9 October 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 9 October 2014), CINAHL (1982 to 9 October 2014), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (1982 to 9 October 2014), ISI Web of Science (1987 to 9 October 2014), Chinese Biological Medical Database (1978 to 9 October 2014) and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (1979 to 9 October 2014), the World Health Organization international clinical trials registry platform (to 9 October 2014), Current Controlled Trials metaRegister of controlled trials active registers (to 9 October 2014), the ClinicalTrials.gov database (to 9 October 2014), the conference proceedings citation index (to 9 October 2014) and the reference lists of included studies and previously published meta‐analyses and systematic reviews for relevant studies. We imposed no language restriction. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials comparing alpha‐2 agonists (clonidine or dexmedetomidine) versus alternative sedatives for long‐term sedation (more than 24 hours) during mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We performed meta‐analyses when more than three studies were included, and selected a random‐effects model due to expected clinical heterogeneity. We calculated the geometric mean difference for continuous outcomes and the risk ratio for dichotomous outcomes. We described the effects by values and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We considered two‐sided P < 0.05 to be statistically significant. 
Main results
Seven studies, covering 1624 participants, met the inclusion criteria. All included studies investigated adults and compared dexmedetomidine with traditional sedatives, including propofol, midazolam and lorazepam. Compared with traditional sedatives, dexmedetomidine reduced the geometric mean duration of mechanical ventilation by 22% (95% CI 10% to 33%; four studies, 1120 participants, low quality evidence), and consequently the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) by 14% (95% CI 1% to 24%; five studies, 1223 participants, very low quality evidence). There was no evidence that dexmedetomidine decreased the risk of delirium (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.14; seven studies, 1624 participants, very low quality evidence) as results were consistent with both no effect and appreciable benefit. Only one study assessed the risk of coma, but lacked methodological reliability (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.86, very low quality evidence). Of all the adverse events included, the most commonly reported one was bradycardia, and we observed a doubled (111%) increase in the incidence of bradycardia (RR 2.11; 95% CI 1.39 to 3.20; six studies, 1587 participants, very low quality evidence). Our meta‐analysis provided no evidence that dexmedetomidine had any impact on mortality (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.24; six studies, 1584 participants, very low quality evidence). We observed high levels of heterogeneity in risk of delirium (I² = 70%), but due to the limited number of studies we were unable to determine the source of heterogeneity through subgroup analyses or meta‐regression. We judged six of the seven studies to be at high risk of bias. 
Authors' conclusions
In this review, we found no eligible studies for children or for clonidine. Compared with traditional sedatives, long‐term sedation using dexmedetomidine in critically ill adults reduced the duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay. There was no evidence for a beneficial effect on risk of delirium and the heterogeneity was high. The evidence for risk of coma was inadequate. The most common adverse event was bradycardia. No evidence indicated that dexmedetomidine changed mortality. The general quality of evidence ranged from very low to low, due to high risks of bias, serious inconsistency and imprecision, and strongly suspected publication bias. Future studies could pay more attention to children and to using clonidine.","Dexmedetomidine and clonidine for long‐term sedation during mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine and clonidine (known as alpha‐2 agonists) for long‐term sedation during mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). 
Background 
Sedation is an important treatment for critically ill patients who need a machine to support breathing, because it reduces anxiety and stress and facilitates the delivery of nursing care. However, some commonly‐used sedatives, such as propofol, midazolam and lorazepam, might decrease blood pressure, depress breathing, and delay awakening after a long‐term infusion. They may prolong breathing support time and length of stay in hospital. Dexmedetomidine and clonidine sedate but allow staff to interact with patients, and they ease pain but do not depress breathing. Those treated with them could be more easy to awake, and more able to communicate their discomfort and pain. These drugs are therefore attractive alternatives for long‐term sedation, and we planned to assess their efficacy and safety for long‐term (more than 24 hours) sedation, compared with traditional sedatives. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the databases until October 2014. We included seven randomized controlled trials, with a total of 1624 participants, comparing dexmedetomidine versus traditional sedatives. All the studies required participants to have an anticipated need for sedation of more than 24 hours. The alternative sedatives included propofol, midazolam and lorazepam. We found no eligible studies in children or for clonidine. Of the seven studies, six were funded by the drug manufacturer, and one did not state any conflict of interest. 
Key results 
Compared with traditional sedatives, dexmedetomidine reduced the breathing support time by approximately one‐fifth, and the length of stay time in ICU by one‐seventh. Dexmedetomidine was at least as effective as traditional sedatives for producing sedation and maintaining a light sedation level. There was no clear evidence in support of dexmedetomidine reducing the risk of delirium (a kind of acute confusion state), as results were consistent with both no effect and appreciable benefit. We had insufficient information to draw conclusions about reducing the risk of coma. Dexmedetomidine doubled the incidence of slow heartbeat, which was the most commonly reported adverse event. Our review provides no evidence that dexmedetomidine changed the overall death rate. 
Quality of the evidence 
The general quality of evidence ranged from very low to low, as most of the studies were at high risk of bias, serious inconsistency and imprecision, or strongly suspected publication bias.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Different Sedation Medications for Patients on Breathing Machines

## What was this study about?

Researchers reviewed studies comparing different types of sedation (calming) medications for critically ill patients who need breathing machines in intensive care units (ICUs). They specifically looked at a type of medication called alpha-2 agonists (like dexmedetomidine) compared to commonly used sedatives.

## Why is this important?

Patients on breathing machines often need medication to help them stay calm and comfortable. The medication should keep patients relaxed but still allow doctors and nurses to interact with them. Finding the best sedation medication could help patients recover faster and have fewer side effects.

## What did the researchers find?

The researchers reviewed 7 studies with 1,624 adult patients. All studies tested dexmedetomidine against traditional sedatives like propofol, midazolam, or lorazepam.

**Key findings:**
- Patients given dexmedetomidine spent about 22% less time on breathing machines
- They also spent about 14% less time in the ICU
- The medication did not clearly reduce confusion (delirium)
- Patients had twice as many episodes of slow heart rate (bradycardia)
- The medication did not change survival rates

## What are the limitations?

- The quality of evidence was low to very low
- Most studies had problems with how they were designed
- No studies looked at children or another similar medication called clonidine
- Results varied significantly between studies

## What does this mean?

Dexmedetomidine may help adult ICU patients get off breathing machines sooner, but it can cause slow heart rate. More high-quality research is needed, especially for children.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What is this study about?
- Doctors use medicines to help people relax and stay calm while on a breathing machine (ventilator) in the ICU. This review looked at alpha-2 agonists, mainly dexmedetomidine, to see if they are safe and work well for sedation longer than 24 hours compared with common sedatives like propofol, midazolam, or lorazepam.

Who was studied?
- Critically ill adults on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.
- No studies in children were found.
- No trials of clonidine met the criteria.

What treatments were compared?
- Dexmedetomidine versus traditional sedatives (propofol, midazolam, lorazepam).

Key results
- Time on the ventilator: Shorter with dexmedetomidine by about 22% (4 studies, 1120 people).
- ICU stay: Shorter with dexmedetomidine by about 14% (5 studies, 1223 people).
- Delirium (confusion): No clear difference (7 studies, 1624 people).
- Coma: Evidence too weak to judge.
- Deaths: No difference (6 studies, 1584 people).

Safety
- The most common side effect was bradycardia (slow heart rate). It happened about twice as often with dexmedetomidine (6 studies, 1587 people).
- No sign that dexmedetomidine changed the risk of death.

How strong is the evidence?
- Seven studies with 1624 adults were included.
- Overall evidence quality was low to very low because many studies had a high risk of bias, results varied between studies, and numbers were sometimes small.

Timing
- Sedation was for more than 24 hours.
- The search included studies up to October 9, 2014.

Bottom line
- In adults on ventilators, dexmedetomidine may help shorten time on the ventilator and in the ICU, but it may increase slow heart rate. It did not change death rates, and its effect on delirium is unclear. More, better-quality studies—especially in children and with clonidine—are needed."
65,"Background
Human milk is the best enteral nutrition for preterm infants. However, human milk, given at standard recommended volumes, is not adequate to meet the protein, energy, and other nutrient requirements of preterm or low birth weight infants. One strategy that may be used to address the potential nutrient deficits is to give a higher volume of enteral feeds. High volume feeds may improve nutrient accretion and growth, and in turn may improve neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, there are concerns that high volume feeds may cause feed intolerance, necrotising enterocolitis, or complications related to fluid overload such as patent ductus arteriosus and chronic lung disease. 
This is an update of a review published in 2017.
Objectives
To assess the effect on growth and safety of high versus standard volume enteral feeds in preterm or low birth weight infants. In infants who were fed fortified human milk or preterm formula, high and standard volume feeds were defined as > 180 mL/kg/day and ≤ 180 mL/kg/day, respectively. In infants who were fed unfortified human milk or term formula, high and standard volume feeds were defined as > 200 mL/kg/day and ≤ 200 mL/kg/day, respectively.

We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2020 Issue 6) in the Cochrane Library; Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to June 2020); Embase (1974 to June 2020); and CINAHL (inception to June 2020); Maternity & Infant Care Database (MIDIRS) (1971 to April 2020); as well as previous reviews, and trial registries.

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared high versus standard volume enteral feeds for preterm or low birth weight infants. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias and independently extracted data. We analysed treatment effects in individual trials and reported risk ratio (RR) and risk difference for dichotomous data, and mean difference (MD) for continuous data, with respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. The primary outcomes were weight gain, linear and head growth during hospital stay, and extrauterine growth restriction at discharge. 
Main results
We included two new RCTs (283 infants) in this update. In total, we included three trials (347 infants) in this updated review. 
High versus standard volume feeds with fortified human milk or preterm formula 
Two trials (283 infants) met the inclusion criteria for this comparison. Both were of good methodological quality, except for lack of masking. Both trials were performed in infants born at < 32 weeks' gestation. Meta‐analysis of data from both trials showed high volume feeds probably improves weight gain during hospital stay (MD 2.58 g/kg/day, 95% CI 1.41 to 3.76; participants = 271; moderate‐certainty evidence). High volume feeds may have little or no effect on linear growth (MD 0.05 cm/week, 95% CI ‐0.02 to 0.13; participants = 271; low‐certainty evidence), head growth (MD 0.02 cm/week, 95% CI ‐0.04 to 0.09; participants = 271; low‐certainty evidence), and extrauterine growth restriction at discharge (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.02; participants = 271; low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effect of high volume feeds with fortified human milk or preterm formula on the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.12 to 4.51; participants = 283; very‐low certainty evidence). 
High versus standard volume feeds with unfortified human milk or term formula 
One trial with 64 very low birth weight infants met the inclusion criteria for this comparison. This trial was unmasked but otherwise of good methodological quality. High volume feeds probably improves weight gain during hospital stay (MD 6.2 g/kg/day, 95% CI 2.71 to 9.69; participants = 61; moderate‐certainty evidence). The trial did not provide data on linear and head growth, and extrauterine growth restriction at discharge. We are uncertain as to the effect of high volume feeds with unfortified human milk or term formula on the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.78; participants = 61; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
High volume feeds (≥ 180 mL/kg/day of fortified human milk or preterm formula, or ≥ 200 mL/kg/day of unfortified human milk or term formula) probably improves weight gain during hospital stay. The available data is inadequate to draw conclusions on the effect of high volume feeds on other growth and clinical outcomes. A large RCT is needed to provide data of sufficient quality and precision to inform policy and practice.","High versus standard volume feeds to promote growth in preterm or low birth weight infants 
Review question Does giving preterm (born at < 37 weeks) or low birth weight (< 2500 grams) infants a greater volume of feeds than is usually given, promote growth without causing feeding problems or other side effects? 
BackgroundInfants born early (preterm) need extra nutrients for growth. One way to deliver extra nutrition is to give infants a greater volume of feeds than usual (high volume feeds, equal to or greater than 180 to 200 mL/kg/day of milk). Although giving high volumes of milk to preterm or low birth weight infants might increase growth rates, there are concerns that infants may not tolerate high volume feeds and may experience side effects including severe bowel problems. We have looked for evidence from clinical trials that assessed whether high volume feeds are beneficial or harmful for preterm or low birth weight infants. 
Study characteristicsSearch is up‐to‐date as of June 2020. We found three studies that addressed this question. 
Key resultsEvidence from two studies showed that high volume feeds (≥ 180 mL/kg/day) with fortified human milk (human milk with added human milk fortifier) or preterm formula probably improves weight gain during hospital stay, when compared to standard volume of the same. Similarly, evidence from one small study showed that high volume feeds (≥ 200 mL/kg/day) with unfortified human milk or preterm formula probably improves weight gain during hospital stay. The evidence is insufficient to comment on the effect of high volume feeds on increase in length or head size during hospital stay, long‐term growth and development, and the effect on gut problems or other side effects. 
Conclusions 
High volume feeds probably improve weight gain during hospital stay. The available data is inadequate to draw conclusions on the effect of high volume feeds on other growth and clinical outcomes.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Higher Volume Feedings for Premature and Low Birth Weight Babies

## What was this review about?

Researchers looked at whether giving premature or low birth weight babies larger amounts of milk each day helps them grow better compared to standard feeding amounts.

## Why is this important?

Breast milk is the best food for premature babies, but the usual amounts given may not provide enough protein, calories, and other nutrients these babies need to grow properly. Giving more milk might help babies grow better, but doctors worry it could cause problems like:
- Trouble digesting food
- Serious intestinal problems
- Fluid buildup affecting the heart or lungs

## What did the researchers do?

The review team searched medical databases and found 3 studies involving 347 babies. They compared:
- **Higher volume feeding**: More than 180 mL per kilogram of body weight per day (for fortified milk or special preterm formula), or more than 200 mL/kg/day (for regular breast milk or standard formula)
- **Standard volume feeding**: 180 mL/kg/day or less (for fortified milk), or 200 mL/kg/day or less (for regular milk)

## What did they find?

**Weight gain:**
Higher volume feedings likely help babies gain more weight while in the hospital.

**Length and head growth:**
Higher volume feedings may make little to no difference in how fast babies grow in length or head size.

**Safety concerns:**
The studies didn't provide enough information to know whether higher volume feedings increase or decrease the risk of serious intestinal problems.

## What does this mean?

Giving premature babies more milk each day likely helps them gain weight faster. However, more research is needed to understand whether this affects other aspects of growth and whether it's completely safe.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

Purpose
- To see if giving preterm or low birth weight babies a higher amount of milk each day helps them grow better and stay safe compared with the usual amount.

Who was studied
- Preterm or low birth weight infants, mostly born before 32 weeks.
- Total: 3 randomized studies with 347 infants.

What was compared
- High-volume feeds vs. standard-volume feeds given through the gut (enteral feeding).
- If milk was fortified human milk or preterm formula: high >180 mL per kg per day; standard ≤180 mL/kg/day.
- If milk was unfortified human milk or term formula: high >200 mL/kg/day; standard ≤200 mL/kg/day.

What researchers measured
- Growth in the hospital: weight gain, length, and head growth.
- Growth problems by discharge.
- Safety, including a serious bowel problem called necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).

Main findings
- Weight gain: High-volume feeds probably lead to faster weight gain during the hospital stay.
- Length and head growth: High-volume feeds may make little or no difference.
- Growth problems by discharge: May be little or no difference.
- Safety (NEC): It is unclear if high-volume feeds change the risk. The evidence is very uncertain.

Timing and methods
- This is an update of earlier work.
- The research team searched medical databases through June 2020.
- Only randomized controlled trials were included.

Safety
- No clear signal of harm or benefit for NEC; more data are needed.
- Other safety outcomes were limited or not well reported.

Bottom line
- Feeding preterm babies higher volumes likely helps them gain weight faster in the hospital.
- We do not know if it helps with other growth measures or affects safety risks.
- Larger, high-quality studies are needed to guide practice."
66,"Background
Fertility problems are very common, as subfertility affects about 10% to 15% of couples trying to conceive. There are many factors that may impact a couple's ability to conceive and one of these may be incorrect timing of intercourse. Conception is only possible from approximately five days before up to several hours after ovulation. Therefore, to be effective, intercourse must take place during this fertile period. 'Timed intercourse' is the practice of prospectively identifying ovulation and, thus, the fertile period to increase the likelihood of conception. Whilst timed intercourse may increase conception rates and reduce unnecessary intervention and costs, there may be associated adverse aspects including time consumption and stress. Ovulation prediction methods used for timing intercourse include urinary hormone measurement (luteinizing hormone (LH), estrogen), tracking basal body temperatures, cervical mucus investigation, calendar charting and ultrasonography. This review considered the evidence from randomised controlled trials for the use of timed intercourse on positive pregnancy outcomes. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and risks of ovulation prediction methods for timing intercourse on conception in couples trying to conceive. 
Search methods
We searched the following sources to identify relevant randomised controlled trials, the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed, LILACS, Web of Knowledge, the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Trials Register Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. Furthermore, we manually searched the references of relevant articles. The search was not restricted by language or publication status. The last search was on 5 August 2014. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing timed intercourse versus intercourse without ovulation prediction or comparing different methods of ovulation prediction for timing intercourse against each other in couples trying to conceive. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias and extracted the data. The primary review outcomes were cumulative live birth and adverse events (such as quality of life, depression and stress). Secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy, pregnancy (clinical or self‐reported pregnancy, not yet confirmed by ultrasound) and time to conception. We combined data to calculate pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for the main comparisons using GRADE methods. 
Main results
We included five RCTs (2840 women or couples) comparing timed intercourse versus intercourse without ovulation prediction. Unfortunately one large study (n = 1453) reporting live birth and pregnancy had not published outcome data by randomised group and therefore could not be analysed. Consequently, four RCTs (n = 1387) were included in the meta‐analysis. The evidence was of low to very low quality. Main limitations for downgrading the evidence included imprecision, lack of reporting clinically relevant outcomes and the high risk of publication bias. 
One study reported live birth, but the sample size was too small to draw any relevant conclusions on the effect of timed intercourse (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.16 to 3.41, 1 RCT, n = 17, very low quality). One study reported stress as an adverse event. There was no evidence of a difference in levels of stress (mean difference 1.98, 95 CI% ‐0.87 to 4.83, 1 RCT, n = 77, low level evidence). No other studies reported adverse events. Two studies reported clinical pregnancy. There was no evidence of a difference in clinical pregnancy rates (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.12, 2 RCTs, n = 177, I2 = 0%, low level evidence). This suggested that if the chance of a clinical pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction is assumed to be 16%, the chance of success following timed intercourse would be between 9% and 33%.Four studies reported pregnancy rate (clinical or self‐reported pregnancy). Timed intercourse was associated with higher pregnancy rates compared to intercourse without ovulation prediction in couples trying to conceive (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.71, 4 RCTs, n = 1387, I2 = 0%, very low level evidence). This suggests that if the chance of a pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction is assumed to be 13%, the chance following timed intercourse would be between 14% and 23%. Subgroup analysis by duration of subfertility showed no difference in effect between couples trying to conceive for < 12 months versus couples trying for ≥ 12 months. One trial reported time to conception data and showed no evidence of a difference in time to conception. 
Authors' conclusions
There are insufficient data available to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of timed intercourse for the outcomes of live birth, adverse events and clinical pregnancy. Timed intercourse may improve pregnancy rates (clinical or self‐reported pregnancy, not yet confirmed by ultrasound) compared to intercourse without ovulation prediction. The quality of this evidence is low to very low and therefore findings should be regarded with caution. There is a high risk of publication bias, as one large study remains unpublished 8 years after recruitment finished. Further research is required, reporting clinically relevant outcomes (live birth, clinical pregnancy rates and adverse effects), to determine if timed intercourse is safe and effective in couples trying to conceive.","Timed intercourse for couples with subfertility
Review question 
Researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration reviewed the evidence about the effect of timed intercourse versus spontaneous intercourse in couples trying to conceive. 
Background 
Many couples find it difficult to achieve a pregnancy and have concerns about their fertility. Each cycle, a woman is fertile from approximately five days before ovulation until several hours after ovulation, due to limited survival times of the sperm and egg. Therefore, prospectively identifying this fertile period of a woman's menstrual cycle, to guide timing of intercourse, may improve conception rates. This may reduce unnecessary medical treatment and costs of advanced infertility treatment, but could also cause adverse events such as stress. The fertile period can be identified by different methods including urinary fertility monitoring, calendar charting, observing changes in cervical mucous and basal body temperatures or follicular maturation on ultrasound. The aim of this review was to assess the benefits and risks of timed intercourse on pregnancy outcomes in couples trying to conceive. 
Study characteristics 
We found five randomised controlled trials comparing timed intercourse versus intercourse without ovulation prediction, in a total of 2840 women or couples trying to conceive. The evidence was current to August 2014. 
Key results 
One large included study (1453 women) has not published usable results and could therefore not be analysed. One study reported live birth rates and found no evidence of a difference; however, the study was too small to have any clinical value. Only one study reported levels of stress and showed no evidence of a difference between timed intercourse with urinary fertility monitoring and intercourse without urinary fertility monitoring. No other adverse events were reported. Only two studies reported clinical pregnancy rates, and showed no evidence of a difference in pregnancy rates in couples with subfertility. The evidence suggested that if the chance of a clinical pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction was assumed to be 16%, the chance of a clinical pregnancy following timed intercourse would be between 9% and 33%. However, if including self‐reported pregnancies (not confirmed by ultrasound), pregnancy rates were higher after timed intercourse. The evidence suggested that if the chance of a pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction was 13%, the chance following timed intercourse would be between 14% and 23%. 
No difference in effect was found between couples trying to conceive for less than 12 months versus 12 months or more. One trial reported time to conception data and showed no evidence of a difference in time to conception. 
Quality of the evidence 
The overall quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low for all outcomes. The main limitations of the evidence were imprecision, poor reporting of clinically relevant outcomes and a high risk of publication bias, as one large study remains unpublished. Therefore, the findings should be regarded with caution.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Timing Intercourse to Improve Chances of Getting Pregnant

## What was studied?
Researchers looked at whether timing intercourse around ovulation (when an egg is released) helps couples get pregnant compared to having intercourse without tracking ovulation.

## Why is this important?
About 10-15% of couples have difficulty getting pregnant. Pregnancy can only happen during a short window each month—roughly 5 days before ovulation until several hours after. Some couples use various methods to predict ovulation, such as:
- Home urine test strips
- Tracking body temperature
- Checking cervical mucus
- Calendar tracking
- Ultrasound

While timing intercourse might help couples conceive faster and avoid unnecessary medical treatments, it could also cause stress and take extra time.

## What did researchers find?
The review included 5 studies with 2,840 women or couples. However, one large study couldn't be included in the analysis because results weren't properly reported.

**Key findings:**
- **Live births:** Only one very small study (17 women) reported this outcome—too small to draw conclusions
- **Stress levels:** One study found no difference in stress between groups
- **Clinical pregnancy:** Two studies found no clear difference
- **Any pregnancy:** Four studies suggested timing intercourse may increase pregnancy rates from 13% to somewhere between 14-23%

## What does this mean?
The evidence is too limited and low-quality to know for certain whether timing intercourse helps couples have babies. While it might increase pregnancy rates, researchers need better studies that track what matters most: live births, confirmed pregnancies, and effects on couples' well-being.

## Bottom line
More research is needed before doctors can confidently recommend timing intercourse as a way to improve chances of pregnancy.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What is this study about?
- Researchers looked at whether using tools to predict ovulation (to time sex during the fertile window) helps couples get pregnant and whether it causes any harms.

Who was in the study?
- Couples trying to conceive without medical treatments.

What did they compare?
- Timed intercourse using ovulation prediction methods (urine hormone tests for LH or estrogen, basal body temperature, checking cervical mucus, calendar tracking, or ultrasound)
- Versus having intercourse without using ovulation prediction
- Some studies also compared different prediction methods with each other.

How was the research done?
- This was a review of randomized controlled trials.
- Databases and trial registers were searched up to August 5, 2014.
- Five trials with 2,840 women/couples were found. Four trials (1,387 people) could be combined for the main analyses.

Main outcomes they looked at
- Primary: live birth; adverse events (such as stress, depression, quality of life)
- Secondary: clinical pregnancy (confirmed by ultrasound), any reported pregnancy (not yet confirmed), and time to conception

What did they find?
- Live birth: Only one very small study reported this. It was too small to show if timed intercourse helps.
- Adverse events: One study measured stress. It found no clear difference between groups. No other harms were reported.
- Clinical pregnancy (ultrasound confirmed): Two studies showed no clear difference.
- Any reported pregnancy (not yet confirmed): Four studies showed higher pregnancy rates with timed intercourse. Estimated effect: about 1.35 times as many pregnancies as without timing. For example, if 13 out of 100 get pregnant without timing, about 14 to 23 out of 100 might get pregnant with timing.
- Time to conception: One study found no clear difference.

How strong is the evidence?
- Overall quality was low to very low.
- Reasons: small sample sizes, limited reporting of key outcomes, and risk of publication bias (a large trial with 1,453 participants did not publish results by group).

Safety
- Limited data. One study showed no clear difference in stress. Other side effects were not well reported.

Bottom line
- There is not enough good-quality evidence to know if timed intercourse improves live birth or clinical pregnancy or affects stress.
- Timed intercourse may increase the chance of reporting a pregnancy, but confidence in this finding is low.
- Better, larger studies are needed that report live births, confirmed pregnancies, and side effects."
67,"Background
Pressure ulcers, which are a localised injury to the skin, or underlying tissue, or both, occur when people are unable to reposition themselves to relieve pressure on bony prominences. Pressure ulcers are often difficult to heal, painful, expensive to manage and have a negative impact on quality of life. While individual patient safety and quality care stem largely from direct healthcare practitioner‐patient interactions, each practitioner‐patient wound‐care contact may be constrained or enhanced by healthcare organisation of services. Research is needed to demonstrate clearly the effect of different provider‐orientated approaches to pressure ulcer prevention and treatment. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of different provider‐orientated interventions targeted at the organisation of health services, on the prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers. 
Search methods
In April 2018 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched three clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs, non‐RCTs, controlled before‐and‐after studies and interrupted time series, which enrolled people at risk of, or people with existing pressure ulcers, were eligible for inclusion in the review. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment, data extraction and GRADE assessment of the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
The search yielded a total of 3172 citations and, following screening and application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, we deemed four studies eligible for inclusion. These studies reported the primary outcome of pressure ulcer incidence or pressure ulcer healing, or both. 
One controlled before‐and‐after study explored the impact of transmural care (a care model that provided activities to support patients and their family/partners and activities to promote continuity of care), among 62 participants with spinal cord injury. It is unclear whether transmural care leads to a difference in pressure ulcer incidence compared with usual care (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 1.64; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded twice for very serious study limitations and twice for very serious imprecision). 
One RCT explored the impact of hospital‐in‐the‐home care, among 100 older adults. It is unclear whether hospital‐in‐the‐home care leads to a difference in pressure ulcer incidence risk compared with hospital admission (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.98; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded twice for very serious study limitations and twice for very serious imprecision). 
A third study (cluster‐randomised stepped‐wedge trial), explored the impact of being cared for by enhanced multidisciplinary teams (EMDT), among 161 long‐term‐care residents. The analyses of the primary outcome used measurements of 201 pressure ulcers from 119 residents. It is unclear if EMDT reduces the pressure ulcer incidence rate compared with usual care (hazard ratio (HR) 1.12, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.68; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded twice for very serious study limitations and twice for very serious imprecision). It is unclear whether there is a difference in the number of wounds healed (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.87; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded twice for very serious study limitations and twice for very serious imprecision). It is unclear whether there is a difference in the reduction in surface area, with and without EMDT, (healing rate 1.006; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.03; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded twice for very serious study limitations and twice for very serious imprecision). It is unclear if EMDT leads to a difference in time to complete healing (HR 1.48, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.78, very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded twice for very serious study limitations and twice for very serious imprecision). 
The final study (quasi‐experimental cluster trial), explored the impact of multidisciplinary wound care among 176 nursing home residents. It is unclear whether there is a difference in the number of pressure ulcers healed between multidisciplinary care, or usual care (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.42; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded twice for very serious study limitations and twice for very serious imprecision). It is unclear if this type of care leads to a difference in time to complete healing compared with usual care (HR 1.73, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.50; very low‐certainty evidence; downgraded twice for very serious study limitations and twice for very serious imprecision). 
In all studies the certainty of the evidence is very low due to high risk of bias and imprecision. We downgraded the evidence due to study limitations, which included selection and attrition bias, and sample size. Secondary outcomes, such as adverse events were not reported in all studies. Where they were reported it was unclear if there was a difference as the certainty of evidence was very low. 
Authors' conclusions
Evidence for the impact of organisation of health services for preventing and treating pressure ulcers remains unclear. Overall, GRADE assessments of the evidence resulted in judgements of very low‐certainty evidence. The studies were at high risk of bias, and outcome measures were imprecise due to wide confidence intervals and small sample sizes, meaning that additional research is required to confirm these results. The secondary outcomes reported varied across the studies and some were not reported. We judged the evidence from those that were reported (including adverse events), to be of very low certainty.","Organisation of health services for preventing and treating pressure ulcers
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this review was to find out whether the way in which health services are organised can affect prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found four relevant studies. 
Key messages 
We cannot be certain whether transmural care (a way of providing care that delivers activities to support patients and their family/partners, and activities to promote continuity of care), hospital‐in‐the‐home care, care provided by a team of different disciplines or care that is usually provided, make any difference to whether people develop pressure ulcers, how fast existing ulcers heal, or whether people with ulcers are admitted or readmitted to hospital. 
What was studied in the review? 
Pressure ulcers, sometimes known as bedsores or pressure sores, are injuries that develop as a result of continued pressure on bony parts of the body such as the hips, heels or lower back. It is thought that the way health services are organised can influence the development of pressure ulcers among people at risk, and may also influence the healing of these wounds. 
Care can be delivered to people with pressure ulcers in various ways. We wanted to find out whether different types of care delivery affected the number of people developing pressure ulcers and how fast existing ulcers healed. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We found four studies dating from 1999 to 2014, that compared alternative types of care delivery to the way care is usually provided. The mean number of participants in the studies was 140, and the ages of participants ranged from 36.5 years to 83 years. In the studies 198 participants were men and 301 were women. All studies were funded by government agencies. Two studies focused on prevention of pressure ulcers, one on prevention and treatment, and one on treatment only. 
It is unclear whether any alternative type of care delivery is better than care that is usually provided at reducing risk of pressure ulcers, or improving pressure ulcer healing. It is also unclear whether the way healthcare services are organised improves quality of life, patient and staff satisfaction, reduces hospital admissions, emergency room visits, or death at 28 days. This is because we are very uncertain about the evidence in all studies. 
This Plain language summary is up to date as of 18 April 2018.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: How Healthcare Organization Affects Pressure Ulcer Prevention and Treatment

## What are pressure ulcers?

Pressure ulcers (also called bedsores) are injuries to the skin and tissue underneath. They happen when someone stays in one position too long, putting constant pressure on parts of the body like the heels, hips, or back. These wounds can be painful, hard to heal, and costly to treat.

## What did researchers want to know?

Researchers wanted to find out if changing how healthcare services are organized could help prevent pressure ulcers or help them heal faster. They looked at different ways of organizing care teams and services, rather than specific treatments or products.

## What did they find?

Researchers searched medical databases in 2018 and found 4 studies involving about 500 people. These studies tested different ways of organizing care:

- **Transmural care** (62 people with spinal cord injuries): A program that supported patients and families and improved communication between different care providers
- **Hospital-in-the-home care** (100 older adults): Providing hospital-level care at home instead of in the hospital
- **Enhanced multidisciplinary teams** (161 nursing home residents): Specialized teams with extra training working together
- **Multidisciplinary wound care** (176 nursing home residents): Teams of different healthcare professionals working together on wound care

## What were the results?

For all four approaches tested, researchers could not tell whether these ways of organizing care made a difference in preventing pressure ulcers or helping them heal. The studies had significant limitations, including small numbers of participants and design problems that made the results unreliable.

## What does this mean?

More and better research is needed to understand whether changing how healthcare services are organized can help prevent or treat pressure ulcers.",0,Plano,"Plain language summary: How care organization may affect pressure ulcer prevention and healing

What this review asked
- Do different ways of organizing health services help prevent pressure ulcers or help them heal faster?

Who was studied
- Adults at risk for pressure ulcers or already living with them.
- Settings included hospitals, long‑term care, and nursing homes.
- Four studies with a total of several hundred participants were included.

What was tested (provider‑focused approaches)
- Transmural care: added support for patients and families and better care continuity after leaving the hospital.
- Hospital‑in‑the‑home: care at home instead of staying in the hospital.
- Enhanced multidisciplinary teams (EMDT): teams with added wound‑care expertise.
- Multidisciplinary wound‑care programs in nursing homes.

How the research was done
- The review looked for studies in several databases and trial registries (search date: April 2018).
- It included randomized trials and other controlled study designs.
- Main outcomes: getting a new pressure ulcer, healing of existing ulcers, wound size change, and time to full healing.
- Safety (harms or adverse events) was also checked when reported.

Main findings
- It is unclear if transmural care lowers the chance of getting a pressure ulcer compared to usual care.
- It is unclear if hospital‑in‑the‑home changes the chance of getting a pressure ulcer compared to hospital care.
- It is unclear if enhanced multidisciplinary teams reduce new ulcers, increase healing, shrink wound size faster, or speed up full healing.
- It is unclear if multidisciplinary wound‑care programs in nursing homes improve healing or shorten time to full healing compared with usual care.

Safety
- Not all studies reported side effects or harms.
- Where reported, differences were unclear.
- Overall certainty for safety findings was very low.

Why the results are unclear
- Very small study sizes.
- Study design problems (risk of bias).
- Wide ranges of possible results (imprecision).
- Because of these issues, the certainty of evidence was rated very low for all main outcomes.

What this means
- We do not know yet whether organizing care in these specific ways helps prevent or heal pressure ulcers.
- Better, larger, well‑designed studies are needed to answer these questions."

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2016, Issue 8), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to 22 August 2016), Embase (January 1980 to 22 August 2016), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (January 1982 to 22 August 2016), Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐ Science (CPCI‐S) (January 1990 to 22 August 2016), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 22 August 2016. We requested or examined relevant conference proceedings for appropriate trials. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing endonasal and external DCRs. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility and extracted data on reported outcomes. We attempted to contact investigators to clarify the methodological quality of the studies. We graded the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We included two trials in this review. One trial from Finland compared laser‐assisted endonasal DCR with external DCR, and one trial from India compared mechanical endonasal DCR (using punch forceps) with external DCR. The trials were poorly reported and it was difficult to judge the extent to which bias had been avoided. 
Anatomic success was defined as the demonstration of a patent lacrimal passage on syringing, or endoscopic visualisation of fluorescein dye at the nasal opening of the anastomoses after a period of at least six months following surgery. Subjective success was defined as the resolution of symptoms of watering following surgery after a period of at least six months. Both included trials used anatomic patency demonstrated by irrigation as a measure of anatomic success. Different effects were seen in these two trials (I2 = 76%). People receiving laser‐assisted endonasal DCR were less likely to have a successful operation compared with external DCR (63% versus 91%; risk ratio (RR) 0.69, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.52 to 0.92; 64 participants). There was little or no difference in success comparing mechanical endonasal DCR and external DCR (90% in both groups; RR 1.00, CI 0.81 to 1.23; 40 participants). We judged this evidence on success to be very low‐certainty, downgrading for risk of bias, imprecision and inconsistency. The trial from Finland also assessed subjective improvement in symptoms following surgery. Resolution of symptoms of watering in outdoor conditions was reported by 84% of the participants in the external DCR group and 59% of those in the laser‐assisted endonasal DCR group (RR 0.70, CI 0.51 to 0.97; 64 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
There were no cases of intraoperative bleeding in any participant in the trial that compared laser‐assisted endonasal DCR to external DCR. This was in contrast to the trial comparing mechanical endonasal DCR to external DCR in which 45% of participants in both groups experienced intraoperative bleeding (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.98; 40 participants). We judged this evidence on intraoperative bleeding to be very low‐certainty, downgrading for risk of bias, imprecision and inconsistency. 
There were only two cases of postoperative bleeding, both in the external DCR group (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.10; participants = 104; studies = 2). There were only two cases of wound infection/gaping, again both in the external DCR group (RR 0.20, CI 0.01 to 3.92; participants = 40; studies = 1). We judged this evidence on complications to be very low‐certainty, downgrading one level for risk of bias and two levels for imprecision due to the very low number of cases. 
Authors' conclusions
There is uncertainty as to the relative effects of endonasal and external DCR. Differences in effect seen in the two trials included in this review may be due to variations in the endonasal technique, but may also be due to other differences between the trials. Future larger RCTs are required to further assess the success and complication rates of endonasal and external DCR. Different techniques of endonasal DCR should also be assessed, as the choice of endonasal technique can influence the outcome. Strict outcome criteria should be adopted to assess functional and anatomical outcomes with a minimal follow‐up of six months.","Different surgical techniques for treating blockage of the tear duct
What is the aim of this review?  The aim of this Cochrane Review was to compare two different surgical techniques for treating blockage of the tear (nasolacrimal) duct. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found two studies. 
Key messages  It is unclear whether or not endonasal dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) is a better way of treating tear duct obstruction than external DCR (very low‐certainty evidence), nor is it clear whether endonasal DCR reduces the chance of complications such as bleeding or wound infection (very low‐certainty evidence). 
What was studied in the review?  The tear duct, or nasolacrimal passage, allows excess tears to drain away from the eye. If the tear duct gets blocked then the eye can water too much. Doctors can use a surgical procedure known as dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) to treat the blocked tear duct. This operation creates a way for the tears to drain from the eye that bypasses the blockage. There are two ways of doing this operation: either by making a cut on the outside of the nose (external DCR); or by operating inside the nose, using an endoscope (a flexible tube with a light at the end) to see inside the nose (endonasal DCR) and creating an alternate drainage pathway using instruments (such as forceps or drill) or laser. 
What are the main results of the review?  The review authors found two relevant studies. One study was from Finland and compared laser‐assisted endonasal DCR with external DCR. One study was from India and compared mechanical endonasal DCR (using punch forceps) with external DCR. 
The Cochrane researchers are uncertain whether endonasal DCR increases the chance of success compared with external DCR, or whether endonasal DCR reduces the chance of complications such as bleeding or wound infection. They judged the certainty of the evidence to be very low. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?  The Cochrane researchers searched for studies that had been published up to 22 August 2016.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Two Surgical Approaches for Blocked Tear Ducts

## What is this review about?

Some people have blocked tear ducts that prevent tears from draining properly, causing watery eyes. Doctors perform a surgery called DCR to fix this problem. The surgery creates a new pathway for tears to drain from the eye into the nose, going around the blockage.

There are two main ways to do this surgery:
- **External DCR**: The surgeon makes a small cut on the outside of the nose near the eye
- **Endonasal DCR**: The surgeon works through the inside of the nose without making an outside cut

## What did researchers want to find out?

Researchers wanted to know which surgical approach works better and which one causes fewer problems.

## What did they find?

Researchers found only 2 studies comparing these surgeries:
- One study from Finland (64 people) compared laser endonasal DCR to external DCR
- One study from India (40 people) compared mechanical endonasal DCR to external DCR

**Success rates:**
- In the Finland study, external DCR worked better (91% success) than laser endonasal DCR (63% success)
- In the India study, both approaches worked equally well (90% success for both)
- More people in the external DCR group reported their watery eyes improved

**Complications:**
- Very few people had bleeding after surgery or wound infections
- When complications occurred, they were mostly in the external DCR group

## What does this mean?

The evidence is too limited to say which approach is definitely better. The two studies showed different results, possibly because they used different endonasal techniques. More research with larger groups of people is needed to better compare these two surgical approaches.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What was studied
- This review looked at two ways to do surgery for a blocked tear duct (dacryocystorhinostomy, or DCR):
  - Endonasal DCR: done through the nose.
  - External DCR: done through a small cut on the skin near the nose.
- The goal was to see which method works better and which has more problems.

Who was included
- Two randomized controlled trials were found.
  - 1 trial from Finland used laser-assisted endonasal DCR.
  - 1 trial from India used mechanical endonasal DCR (surgical tools, not laser).
- Total people in the studies: 104 (64 in Finland; 40 in India).

What treatments were compared
- Laser-assisted endonasal DCR vs external DCR (Finland).
- Mechanical endonasal DCR vs external DCR (India).

Main outcomes measured
- Anatomic success: tear duct open on testing at least 6 months after surgery.
- Symptom success: watering of the eye got better at least 6 months after surgery.
- Safety: bleeding during or after surgery, and wound infection or wound opening.

Key results
- Anatomic success
  - Laser endonasal vs external: 63% vs 91% success (64 people). External did better.
  - Mechanical endonasal vs external: 90% vs 90% success (40 people). About the same.
- Symptom improvement (Finland only)
  - External: 84% reported less watering outdoors.
  - Laser endonasal: 59% reported less watering outdoors.
- Safety
  - Bleeding during surgery:
    - Laser endonasal vs external (Finland): none in either group.
    - Mechanical endonasal vs external (India): 45% in both groups.
  - After surgery:
    - Bleeding: 2 cases, both in external groups (across both trials).
    - Wound infection/opening: 2 cases, both in an external group (one trial).
- Note: These safety numbers are small, so results are uncertain.

Timing
- Success and symptom outcomes were checked at least 6 months after surgery.

Certainty of the evidence
- Overall certainty was low to very low because the trials were small and not well reported. Results should be viewed with caution.

What this means
- It is unclear which approach is better overall.
- Results may depend on the type of endonasal technique (laser vs mechanical).
- Larger, better-designed studies are needed to confirm which method works best and is safest."
69,"Background
Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE) is the second most common entrapment neuropathy after carpal tunnel syndrome. Treatment may be conservative or surgical, but optimal management remains controversial. This is an update of a review first published in 2010 and previously updated in 2012. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness and safety of conservative and surgical treatment in ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE). We intended to test whether: 
‐ surgical treatment is effective in reducing symptoms and signs and in increasing nerve function; 
‐ conservative treatment is effective in reducing symptoms and signs and in increasing nerve function; 
‐ it is possible to identify the best treatment on the basis of clinical, neurophysiological, or nerve imaging assessment. 
Search methods
On 31 May 2016 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, CINAHL Plus, and LILACS. We also searched PEDro (14 October 2016), and the papers cited in relevant reviews. On 4 July 2016 we searched trials registries for ongoing or unpublished trials. 
Selection criteria
The review included only randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs evaluating people with clinical symptoms suggesting the presence of UNE. We included trials evaluating all forms of surgical and conservative treatments. We considered studies regarding therapy of UNE with or without neurophysiological evidence of entrapment. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts of references retrieved from the searches and selected all potentially relevant studies. The review authors independently extracted data from included trials and assessed trial quality. We contacted trial investigators for any missing information. 
Main results
We identified nine RCTs (587 participants) for inclusion in the review, of which three studies were found at this update. The sequence generation was inadequate in one study and not described in three studies. We performed two meta‐analyses to evaluate the clinical (3 trials, 261 participants) and neurophysiological (2 trials, 101 participants) outcomes of simple decompression versus decompression with submuscular or subcutaneous transposition; four trials in total examined this comparison. 
We found no difference between simple decompression and transposition of the ulnar nerve for both clinical improvement (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.08; moderate‐quality evidence) and neurophysiological improvement (mean difference (in m/s) 1.47, 95% CI ‐0.94 to 3.87). The number of participants to clinically improve was 91 out of 131 in the simple decompression group and 97 out of 130 in the transposition group. Transposition showed a higher number of wound infections (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.85; moderate‐quality evidence). 
In one trial (47 participants), the authors compared medial epicondylectomy with anterior transposition and found no difference in clinical and neurophysiological outcomes. 
In one trial (48 participants), the investigators compared subcutaneous transposition with submuscular transposition and found no difference in clinical outcomes. 
In one trial (54 participants for 56 nerves treated), the authors found no difference between endoscopic and open decompression in improving clinical function. 
One trial (51 participants) assessed conservative treatment in clinically mild or moderate UNE. Based on low‐quality evidence, the trial authors found that information on avoiding prolonged movements or positions was effective in improving subjective discomfort. Night splinting and nerve gliding exercises in addition to information provision did not result in further improvement. 
One trial (55 participants) assessed the effectiveness of corticosteroid injection and found no difference versus placebo in improving symptoms at three months' follow‐up. 
Authors' conclusions
We found only two studies of treatment of ulnar neuropathy using conservative treatment as the comparator. The available comparative treatment evidence is not sufficient to support a multiple treatment meta‐analysis to identify the best treatment for idiopathic UNE on the basis of clinical, neurophysiological, and imaging characteristics. We do not know when to treat a person with this condition conservatively or surgically. Moderate‐quality evidence indicates that simple decompression and decompression with transposition are equally effective in idiopathic UNE, including when the nerve impairment is severe. Decompression with transposition is associated with more deep and superficial wound infections than simple decompression, also based on moderate‐quality evidence. People undergoing endoscopic surgery were more likely to have a haematoma. Evidence from one small RCT of conservative treatment showed that in mild cases, information on movements or positions to avoid may reduce subjective discomfort.","Treatment for ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE)
Review question 
What are the effects of treatments for ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE)?
Background 
Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow is the second most common type of condition in which a nerve becomes trapped or compressed (the most common affects the wrist). The ulnar nerve travels down the side of the elbow. This nerve is important for movement and the sense of touch in the hand at the little finger side. Symptoms of UNE are tingling of the fourth and fifth finger at night, pain at the elbow, and a change in sense of touch if the elbow is bent for a long time. When UNE is severe, some hand muscles can become weak. Diagnosis is by the symptoms and signs of the condition, as well as neurophysiological tests. Treatment of UNE can be surgical or nonsurgical (e.g. splints, physical therapy, and rehabilitation). The best way to treat UNE remains unclear. 
Study characteristics 
We found two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of nonsurgical treatment. One RCT compared three groups of people with mild or moderate UNE (51 people in total). All three groups received written instructions to avoid movements or positions that provoked symptoms. The second group had the same information with elbow splints at night for three months. The third group had the same information with nerve gliding exercises. The other nonsurgical study (55 people) compared a corticosteroid injection with a sham injection. 
Seven RCTs compared different surgical methods:
• simple decompression or transposition of the nerve (submuscular or subcutaneous transposition) (4 trials, 327 participants); 
• medial epicondylectomy or anterior transposition (1 trial, 47 participants);
• anterior subcutaneous transposition or anterior submuscular transposition (1 trial, 48 participants); 
• keyhole or open surgery (1 trial, 54 participants with 56 trapped nerves).
Key results and quality of the evidence 
Written information alone was as effective in improving work activities and reducing pain at night as when people also used splints or did exercises. 
Researchers found no evidence that corticosteroid injection was effective in improving symptoms of UNE. 
We were able to combine results from three trials comparing two surgical techniques: simple decompression and transposition of the ulnar nerve (subcutaneous or submuscular). We found no important difference in symptom scores between the techniques at 6 to 12 months. Decompression with transposition may result in more deep and superficial wound infections. Trialists found no clinical differences between surgical techniques in the other surgical trials. People undergoing endoscopic surgery were more likely to have a haematoma (an abnormal collection of blood) after surgery. 
Evidence was insufficient for us to choose the best treatment for UNE. However, we did find that in mild cases, information on movements and positions to avoid may reduce discomfort. Moreover, the combined results from three surgical trials provided moderate‐quality evidence that simple decompression surgery and decompression with transposition may be equally effective, but that decompression with transposition may result in more deep and superficial wound infections. 
The evidence is up to date to 31 May 2016.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Treatments for Ulnar Nerve Problems at the Elbow

## What is this condition?

The ulnar nerve runs along the inside of your elbow. When this nerve gets compressed or irritated at the elbow, it can cause numbness, tingling, or weakness in your hand and fingers (especially the ring and pinky fingers). This is called ulnar neuropathy at the elbow, and it's the second most common nerve compression problem in the arm.

## What did researchers want to find out?

Researchers wanted to know:
- Which treatments work best for this nerve problem
- Whether surgery or non-surgical treatments are more effective
- How safe different treatments are

## What did they do?

Researchers searched medical databases through May 2016 for studies that tested different treatments. They found 9 studies involving 587 people with this nerve problem.

## What did they find?

**Comparing different surgeries:**
- Two common surgical approaches (simple decompression and transposition) worked equally well for improving symptoms and nerve function
- However, the transposition procedure had more wound infections
- Other surgical techniques showed no clear differences in results

**Non-surgical treatments:**
- One small study found that teaching people to avoid certain arm positions and movements helped reduce discomfort in mild cases
- Adding night splints or nerve exercises didn't provide extra benefit
- Steroid injections didn't improve symptoms after 3 months

## What does this mean?

The evidence doesn't clearly show when surgery versus non-surgical treatment is best. For people who need surgery, simpler procedures appear to work as well as more complex ones and have fewer infection risks. For people with mild symptoms, learning which positions to avoid may help. More research is needed to better guide treatment decisions.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the research

What was studied
- The review looked at treatments for ulnar nerve problems at the elbow (sometimes called “ulnar nerve entrapment”).
- Goal: To see how well different treatments work and how safe they are. Treatments included surgery and non-surgical (conservative) care.

Who was included
- 9 randomized studies with 587 adults who had symptoms of ulnar nerve problems at the elbow.
- Some had mild to moderate symptoms; some had more severe nerve changes.

Treatments compared
- Simple decompression surgery (freeing the nerve).
- Decompression with moving the nerve (transposition), either under the skin or under the muscle.
- Medial epicondylectomy (removing part of a small bone at the elbow) vs moving the nerve.
- Endoscopic (scope) vs open decompression surgery.
- Conservative care: education on avoiding certain positions or movements, night splints, nerve-gliding exercises.
- Corticosteroid injection vs placebo.

What the researchers did
- Searched medical databases up to July 2016 for high-quality trials.
- Combined results when possible to compare outcomes like symptom improvement and nerve function.

Main findings
- Simple decompression vs transposition: No clear difference in symptom relief or nerve test results. Both helped a similar number of people.
- Medial epicondylectomy vs transposition: No clear difference.
- Subcutaneous vs submuscular transposition: No clear difference.
- Endoscopic vs open decompression: No clear difference in function.
- Conservative care (mild cases): Education on avoiding long, bent-elbow positions and repeated elbow movements reduced discomfort. Adding night splints or nerve-gliding did not show extra benefit in that trial.
- Corticosteroid injection: No better than placebo at 3 months.

Safety
- Transposition surgery had more wound infections than simple decompression.
- Endoscopic surgery had more hematomas (bruising/bleeding under the skin).
- No major safety advantage was shown for one surgical method over another, except the higher infection risk with transposition.

Timing
- Studies followed people for short to medium terms (one injection study reported results at 3 months). Follow-up times varied by trial.

What this means
- For many people, simple decompression and transposition work about the same. Because transposition had more infections, simple decompression may be safer.
- In mild cases, learning which positions and activities to avoid may help. Splints and nerve-gliding did not add clear benefit in the one study.
- Steroid shots did not help more than placebo at 3 months.
- There isn’t enough evidence to say which treatment is best for each person. Decisions should consider symptoms, test results, and risks."
70,"Background
Prostaglandins have been used for induction of labour since the 1960s. This is one of a series of reviews evaluating methods of induction of labour. This review focuses on prostaglandins given per vaginam, evaluating these in comparison with placebo (or expectant management) and with each other; prostaglandins (PGE2 and PGF2a); different formulations (gels, tablets, pessaries) and doses. 
Objectives
To determine the effects of vaginal prostaglandins E2 and F2a for third trimester cervical ripening or induction of labour in comparison with placebo/no treatment or other vaginal prostaglandins (except misoprostol). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (1 March 2014) and bibliographies of relevant papers. 
Selection criteria
Clinical trials comparing vaginal prostaglandins used for third trimester cervical ripening or labour induction with placebo/no treatment, with each other, or other methods listed above it on a predefined list of labour induction methods. 
Data collection and analysis
We assessed studies and extracted data independently.
Main results
Seventy randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (11,487 women) are included. In this update seven new RCTs (778 women) have been added. Two of these new trials compare PGE2 with no treatment, four compare different PGE2 formulations (gels versus tablets, or sustained release pessaries) and one trial compares PGF2a with placebo. The majority of trials were at unclear risk of bias for most domains. 
Overall, vaginal prostaglandin E2 compared with placebo or no treatment probably reduces the likelihood of vaginal delivery not being achieved within 24 hours. The risk of uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate changes is increased (4.8% versus 1.0%, risk ratio (RR) 3.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 5.98, 15 trials, 1359 women). The caesarean section rate is probably reduced by about 10% (13.5% versus 14.8%, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.02, 36 trials, 6599 women). The overall effect on improving maternal and fetal outcomes (across a variety of measures) is uncertain. 
PGE2 tablets, gels and pessaries (including sustained release preparations) appear to be as effective as each other, small differences are detected between some outcomes, but these maybe due to chance. 
Authors' conclusions
Prostaglandins PGE2 probably increase the chance of vaginal delivery in 24 hours, they increase uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart changes but do not effect or may reduce caesarean section rates. They increase the likelihood of cervical change, with no increase in operative delivery rates. PGE2 tablets, gels and pessaries appear to be as effective as each other, any differences between formulations are marginal but may be important.","Vaginal prostaglandin (PGE2 and PGF2a) for induction of labour at term
Induction of labour is offered to pregnant women when it is thought the outcome will be better for the mother and/or baby if the baby is born than if the pregnancy continues. Common reasons include prolonged pregnancy, prelabour rupture of the membranes, concerns about the health of the mother such as pre‐eclampsia or the baby such as poor growth. Prostaglandins are hormones, produced throughout the body and can be used to start (induce) labour. They are applied locally to the vagina as tablets, gels, suppositories and pessaries to reduce side‐effects. The dose, number of doses, and time between doses vary considerably. Sustained release pessaries reduce the need for repeat doses and so the number of vaginal examinations. 
This review set out to determine the effectiveness and safety of vaginal prostaglandins for third trimester cervical ripening and induction of labour (the cervix softens, shortens and opens, the uterus starts to contract regularly). Eight different comparisons were made, different vaginal prostaglandins were compared with placebos or no treatment, or other vaginal prostaglandins (PGE2, PGF2a, except misoprostol) and different preparations and dosages were compared. We identified 70 studies involving a total of 11,487 women. Vaginal prostaglandins increase the likelihood of vaginal birth within 24 hours, but they can also stimulate the uterus to contract too much and this may cause the baby's heart to slow, however they did not increase the caesarean section rate and may reduce it. Overall, the trials do not show any effect (improvement or worsening) of many important outcomes. Prostaglandin E2 tablets, gels, or pessaries including sustained release preparations appear to be as good as each other or the differences between them are small and have not yet been detected in the trials. Lower‐dose regimens, as defined in the review, appeared to be as good as higher‐dose regimens (eight trials, 1615 women). 
Very limited data were available in the included trials on time in labour and patient satisfaction. Few studies have addressed issues relating to the safety of using vaginal prostaglandins for induction of labour as outpatients.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Using Prostaglandins to Help Start Labor

## What was this study about?

Researchers reviewed studies on medications called prostaglandins (specifically types E2 and F2a) that are placed in the vagina to help start labor in pregnant women at the end of pregnancy. They wanted to see how well these medications work compared to no treatment or compared to different forms of the same medication.

## Who was studied?

The review included 70 studies with 11,487 pregnant women who were at the end of their pregnancies (third trimester) and needed help starting labor.

## What did researchers find?

**When prostaglandin E2 was compared to no treatment:**
- Women were more likely to give birth vaginally within 24 hours
- About 5 out of 100 women had very strong contractions that affected the baby's heart rate (compared to 1 out of 100 women without treatment)
- C-section rates were slightly lower (about 14 out of 100 women compared to 15 out of 100)
- The medication helped the cervix (opening to the womb) prepare for labor

**When different forms of prostaglandin E2 were compared:**
- Tablets, gels, and pessaries (inserts) all worked about the same
- Any differences between the forms were very small

## What does this mean?

Prostaglandin E2 placed in the vagina can help start labor and may reduce the need for C-sections. However, it can cause stronger contractions that may affect the baby's heart rate during labor. The different forms of the medication (tablets, gels, or inserts) work similarly.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the study

Purpose
- To see how well vaginal prostaglandins (mainly PGE2) help start labor in the third trimester, and how safe they are.

Who was studied
- 70 randomized controlled trials
- 11,487 pregnant women needing help to start labor
- Evidence searched up to March 1, 2014

What was compared
- Vaginal prostaglandins (PGE2 and some PGF2α) vs no treatment or placebo
- Different forms of PGE2: gels, tablets, and pessaries (including slow-release)

Main findings
- Faster labor: PGE2 probably increases the chance of having a vaginal birth within 24 hours (vs no treatment/placebo).
- Cesarean section: PGE2 may slightly lower the chance of a C‑section (about 13.5% vs 14.8%).
- Cervix changes: PGE2 helps the cervix soften and open.
- Mode of birth: No increase seen in forceps or vacuum births.

Safety
- Uterine hyperstimulation with changes in the baby’s heart rate happened more often with PGE2: about 4.8% with PGE2 vs 1.0% with no treatment/placebo.
- Overall effects on mothers’ and babies’ health were uncertain across studies.

Forms and doses
- PGE2 gels, tablets, and pessaries worked about the same.
- Any differences between forms were small and may be due to chance.

Timing
- Used for starting labor in the third trimester.
- Goal includes achieving vaginal birth within 24 hours.

Notes
- Most trials had some unclear risk of bias, so results should be interpreted with care.
- A few studies looked at PGF2α, but most results are about PGE2."
71,"Background
Tuberculosis (TB) of the gastrointestinal tract and any other organ within the abdominal cavity is abdominal TB, and most guidelines recommend the same six‐month regimen used for pulmonary TB for people with this diagnosis. However, some physicians are concerned whether a six‐month treatment regimen is long enough to prevent relapse of the disease, particularly in people with gastrointestinal TB, which may sometimes cause antituberculous drugs to be poorly absorbed. On the other hand, longer regimens are associated with poor adherence, which could increase relapse, contribute to drug resistance developing, and increase costs to patients and health providers. 
Objectives
To compare six‐month versus longer drug regimens to treat people that have abdominal TB. 
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases up to 2 September 2016: the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase (accessed via OvidSP), LILACS, INDMED, and the South Asian Database of Controlled Clinical Trials. We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials. We also checked article reference lists. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared six‐month regimens versus longer regimens that consisted of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol to treat adults and children that had abdominal TB. The primary outcomes were relapse, with a minimum of six‐month follow‐up after completion of antituberculous treatment (ATT), and clinical cure at the end of ATT. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias in the included trials. For analysis of dichotomous outcomes, we used risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where appropriate, we pooled data from the included trials in meta‐analyses. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included three RCTs, with 328 participants, that compared six‐month regimens with nine‐month regimens to treat adults with intestinal and peritoneal TB. All trials were conducted in Asia, and excluded people with HIV, those with co‐morbidities and those who had received ATT in the previous five years. Antituberculous regimens were based on isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, and these drugs were administered daily or thrice weekly under a directly observed therapy programme. The median duration of follow‐up after completion of treatment was between 12 and 39 months. 
Relapse was uncommon, with two cases among 140 participants treated for six months, and no events among 129 participants treated for nine months. The small number of participants means we do not know whether or not there is a difference in risk of relapse between the two regimens (very low quality evidence). At the end of therapy, there was probably no difference in the proportion of participants that achieved clinical cure between six‐month and nine‐month regimens (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.08; 294 participants, 3 trials, moderate quality evidence). For death, there were 2/150 (1.3%) in the six‐month group and 4/144 (2.8%) in the nine‐month group. All deaths occurred in the first four months of treatment, so was not linked to the duration of treatment in the included trials. Similarly, the number of participants that defaulted from treatment was small in both groups, and there may be no difference between them (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.59; 294 participants, 3 trials, low quality evidence). Only one trial reported on adherence to treatment, with only one participant allocated to the nine‐month regimen presenting poor adherence to treatment. We do not know whether six‐month regimens are associated with fewer people experiencing adverse events that lead to treatment interruption (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.55; 318 participants, 3 trials, very low quality evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
We found no evidence to suggest that six‐month treatment regimens are inadequate for treating people that have intestinal and peritoneal TB, but numbers are small. We did not find any incremental benefits of nine‐month regimens regarding relapse at the end of follow‐up, or clinical cure at the end of therapy, but our confidence in the relapse estimate is very low because of size of the trials. Further research is required to make confident conclusions regarding the safety of six‐month treatment for people with abdominal TB. Larger studies that include HIV‐positive people, with long follow‐up for detecting relapse with reliability, would help improve our knowledge around this therapeutic question.","Six‐month therapy for people with abdominal tuberculosis
What is abdominal tuberculosis and why is duration of treatment important? 
Abdominal tuberculosis (TB) is a type of TB that affects the gut, the peritoneum (the lining of the abdominal cavity), abdominal lymph nodes, and, more rarely, the solid organs in the abdomen (liver, pancreas, and spleen). Abdominal TB leads to severe illness in adults and children, and can cause complications, such as bowel rupture, which can lead to death. 
Most current guidelines recommend treating people that have abdominal TB with antituberculous treatment (ATT) for six months, but some clinicians treat for longer periods due to concerns that six months is not adequate to achieve cure and prevent relapse of the disease after the end of treatment. Longer ATT regimens have disadvantages: patients may find it more difficult to adhere to the tablets; patients are exposed to the risk of side effects of ATT for longer periods; and the cost to health systems and to patients is greater. 
What the evidence shows 
Cochrane researchers examined the available evidence up to the 2 September 2016. We included three trials with 328 participants that compared six‐month ATT with nine‐month ATT; two were from India and one was from South Korea. The trials were mostly of high quality, although two had concerns of risk of bias for detecting relapse of the disease. All the trials included HIV‐negative adults with TB of the gut (gastrointestinal TB), and one also included TB of the peritoneum (peritoneal TB). 
The results show that relapse was an uncommon event, but we are uncertain whether or not there is a difference between the six‐month and nine‐month groups as numbers of participants are small (very low quality evidence). Six‐month and nine‐month regimens are probably similarly effective in terms of the chances of achieving cure (moderate quality evidence). Death was uncommon in both groups, and all deaths occurred during the first four months of ATT, which suggests that duration of treatment did not have an effect on risk of death. Few people had poor treatment compliance, and few participants experienced side effects that led to their treatment being stopped or changed, and it was not possible to detect a difference between the groups. 
Six‐month regimens are probably as good as nine‐month regimens in terms of numbers of people cured. We found no evidence to suggest that six‐month regimens are less safe for gastrointestinal and peritoneal TB than nine‐month regimens, but we still do not know whether there is a difference in risk of relapse between the two regimens. Further studies are needed to increase our confidence as to whether six‐month regimens are as good as nine‐month regimens for preventing relapse; and to provide information about treating abdominal TB in children and in people with HIV.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Treatment Lengths for Abdominal Tuberculosis

## What is this study about?

Researchers wanted to find out if 6 months of medication is enough to treat tuberculosis (TB) that affects the stomach, intestines, or other organs in the belly area (called abdominal TB). Some doctors worry that 6 months might not be long enough and that patients might get sick again. However, longer treatment periods can be harder for patients to complete.

## What did the researchers do?

They searched for studies that compared:
- 6 months of TB medication versus
- 9 months of TB medication

They found 3 studies with 328 adult patients from Asia who had TB in their intestines or the lining of their belly. All patients took the same types of TB medicines (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol). The studies followed patients for 1 to 3 years after treatment ended.

## What did they find?

- **Getting sick again (relapse):** Very few patients got sick again after treatment. Only 2 out of 140 people treated for 6 months had TB return, and none of the 129 people treated for 9 months had TB return. Because so few people got sick again, researchers cannot say for certain if one treatment length is better than the other.

- **Recovery:** About the same number of patients got better with both treatment lengths.

- **Deaths:** A small number of patients died during treatment (2 with 6-month treatment, 4 with 9-month treatment), but all deaths happened in the first 4 months, so treatment length didn't make a difference.

- **Completing treatment:** Similar small numbers of patients stopped treatment early in both groups.

- **Side effects:** The study couldn't determine if one treatment length caused fewer side effects.

## What does this mean?

The researchers found no clear evidence that 6 months of treatment is worse than 9 months for abdominal TB, but the studies were small. Larger studies with more patients, including people with HIV, are needed to be more confident about these findings.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

Purpose
- To see if 6 months of standard TB medicines works as well as longer treatment (9 months) for people with abdominal tuberculosis.

Who was studied
- 3 randomized studies from Asia with 328 adults who had intestinal or peritoneal TB.
- People with HIV, other serious illnesses, or recent TB treatment (past 5 years) were not included.

Treatments
- Standard TB drugs: isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol.
- Given daily or three times a week under direct observation.
- Groups: 6-month treatment vs 9-month treatment.

What researchers measured
- Relapse of TB after finishing treatment (at least 6 months of follow-up; actual follow-up after treatment ranged from about 12 to 39 months).
- Clinical cure at the end of treatment.
- Death during treatment.
- Stopping or missing treatment (default, adherence).
- Side effects that made people stop treatment.

Key results
- Relapse: Rare in both groups (2 out of 140 with 6 months; 0 out of 129 with 9 months). There were too few relapses to know if one plan is better.
- Cure at end of treatment: About the same with 6 months and 9 months.
- Deaths: 2/150 (6 months) vs 4/144 (9 months); all happened in the first 4 months, so not due to treatment length.
- Default/adherence: Few people stopped treatment in either group; no clear difference.
- Side effects leading to stopping treatment: Not enough data to tell if there is a difference.

What this means
- These studies did not show a benefit to extending treatment from 6 to 9 months for abdominal TB.
- However, the number of people studied was small, and people with HIV were not included.
- Larger studies, including people with HIV and with longer follow-up, are needed to be sure about relapse and safety."
72,"Background
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive, life‐limiting, multisystem disease affecting over 70,000 individuals worldwide. Between 80% and 90% of people with CF suffer with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, which if left untreated, leads to a poor nutritional status. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) has been shown to be effective in improving nutritional status and subsequently associated with improved lung function. However, the timings of PERT administration in relation to a meal are subjective and not standardised, meaning that variations in the timing of PERT dosing persist. 
Objectives
The primary objective of the review is to compare the efficacy (fat absorption) and effectiveness (nutritional status, lung function and quality of life) of different PERT dosing strategies in terms of timing of administration for treating dietary malabsorption in all individuals with CF. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. 
Date of last search: 24 June 2021.
We also searched ongoing trials registers on 09 July 2021.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cross‐over RCTs with a minimum washout period of two weeks, and quasi‐RCTs of PERT dosing regimens in people (of any age) with CF. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed and screened the studies identified from the searches. We planned to use GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for our pre‐specified critical outcomes, but we did not identify any eligible studies. 
Main results
No studies met the eligibility criteria and therefore we did not include any in this review. The excluded studies were either cross‐over in design (but lacking a sufficient washout period between treatments) or did not assess the timing of PERT. One study which was terminated early is awaiting assessment pending further information. 
Authors' conclusions
We were unable to determine whether one dosing schedule for PERT is better than another since we identified no eligible RCTs. While the introduction of PERT to people with CF can improve their nutritional status, there are a limited number of studies which address this review question, and none met our eligibility criteria. Since malnutrition and adverse gastrointestinal symptoms remain a common feature in CF, the assessment of the relative performance of dosing schedules may provide evidence to improve outcomes in people with CF who are pancreatic insufficient. 
Further research is needed to fully evaluate the role of dosing schedules for PERT in fat absorption. Research should also establish reliable outcome measures and minimal clinically important differences. While RCTs with a cross‐over design may have advantages over a parallel group design, an adequate washout period between intervention periods is essential.","Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy timings in cystic fibrosis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the different timings of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) in people (of any age) with cystic fibrosis (CF). 
Background 
CF is an inherited condition affecting over 70,000 individuals worldwide. Between 80% and 90% of people with CF are not able to produce enough pancreatic enzymes to breakdown and absorb fat, protein and fat‐soluble vitamins from food. This can lead to fatty stools (poo) and weight loss. It is thought that if fat is not digested properly, it could contribute to a higher risk of developing constipation or other serious gut complications such as distal intestinal obstruction syndrome. 
PERT provides the enzymes required to breakdown fat and the dosage is based upon the fat content of a meal or the person's body weight. PERT has been shown to improve weight and is associated with improved lung function. Despite current dose guidance, there are differences in PERT doses and there is no set guidance for when the therapy should be taken in relation to a meal (i.e. before, during or after eating). 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 24 June 2021.
Study characteristics 
We did not find any studies where PERT was given to people with CF who were pancreatic insufficient at different timings relative to their meals. We excluded nine studies. Four of these assessed the timing of PERT administration, but they had a cross‐over design where participants had one intervention and then swapped to the second intervention. We excluded these studies because they did not leave enough time between the different interventions to be sure that the effects of the first intervention were not affecting the results from the second intervention. Four studies did not look at the timing of PERT and one study evaluated a new educational program for PERT. One study was terminated early and we will assess this again at the first update of this review if we are able to obtain more information from the investigators. 
Key results 
No studies met the eligibility criteria. Further research is needed to work out the best time to take PERT in relation to a meal.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Timing of Pancreatic Enzyme Supplements for People with Cystic Fibrosis

## What is this review about?

Many people with cystic fibrosis have trouble digesting food because their pancreas doesn't work properly. They need to take pancreatic enzyme supplements with meals to help break down food and absorb nutrients. However, there's no clear guidance on the best time to take these enzymes — whether before, during, or after eating.

Researchers wanted to find out if the timing of taking these enzyme supplements makes a difference in:
- How well the body absorbs fat from food
- Overall nutrition and growth
- Lung function
- Quality of life

## What did the researchers look for?

The research team searched medical databases through June 2021 for studies that compared different timing schedules for taking pancreatic enzyme supplements. They looked for high-quality studies that tested different timing approaches in people with cystic fibrosis of any age.

## What did they find?

The researchers found no studies that met their requirements. Some studies they reviewed had problems with their design, such as not allowing enough time between different treatments. Other studies didn't actually test the timing of enzyme supplements.

## What does this mean?

Without any suitable studies to review, researchers cannot say whether one timing schedule for taking pancreatic enzyme supplements is better than another. While these supplements do help people with cystic fibrosis get better nutrition, more research is needed to determine the best time to take them with meals.",0,Plano,"Plain-Language Summary

What was the goal?
- To find out if taking pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) at different times around meals works better for people with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have trouble absorbing fat.
- The review looked at fat absorption, nutrition, lung function, and quality of life.

Who was this about?
- People of any age with CF who need PERT to help digest food.

What was compared?
- Different timing strategies for taking PERT (for example, before, during, or after meals).

How was the research done?
- Researchers searched medical databases, journals, and trial registers.
- Last database search: June 24, 2021.
- Search of ongoing trial registers: July 9, 2021.
- They planned to include randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including cross-over RCTs with at least a 2-week washout period between treatments.

What did they find?
- No eligible studies were found.
- Some studies were excluded because they did not test timing, or the cross-over studies did not have a long enough break between treatments.
- One study ended early and is awaiting more information.

Safety
- This review did not find eligible trials, so it could not assess safety related to timing strategies.
- PERT is commonly used in CF and can improve nutrition, but this review did not compare safety across different timing schedules.

What does this mean?
- We do not know if taking PERT before, during, or after meals works best.
- Better studies are needed to compare timing strategies and to use clear, reliable outcome measures.

Why more research is needed
- Many people with CF still have nutrition and gut symptoms.
- Well-designed RCTs, especially cross-over trials with a proper washout period, could show which timing approach helps most with fat absorption and overall health."
73,"Background
Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) (bleeding from the genital tract after childbirth) is a major cause of maternal mortality and disability, particularly in under‐resourced areas. In these settings, uterotonics are often not accessible. There is a need for simple, inexpensive techniques which can be applied in low‐resourced settings to prevent and treat PPH. Uterine massage is recommended as part of the routine active management of the third stage of labour. However, it is not known whether it is effective. If shown to be effective, uterine massage would represent a simple intervention with the potential to have a major effect on PPH and maternal mortality in under‐resourced settings. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness of uterine massage after birth and before or after delivery of the placenta, or both, to reduce postpartum blood loss and associated morbidity and mortality. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 April 2013). 
Selection criteria
All published, unpublished and ongoing randomised controlled trials comparing uterine massage alone or in addition to uterotonics before or after delivery of the placenta, or both, with non‐massage. 
Data collection and analysis
Two researchers independently considered trials for eligibility, assessed risk of bias and extracted the data using the agreed form. Data were checked for accuracy. The effect of uterine massage commenced before or after placental delivery were first assessed separately, and then the combined for an overall result. 
Main results
This review included two randomised controlled trials. The first trial included 200 women who were randomised to receive uterine massage or no massage following delivery of the placenta, after active management of the third stage of labour including use of oxytocin. The numbers of women with blood loss more than 500 mL was small, with no statistically significant difference (risk ratio (RR) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 1.67). There were no cases of retained placenta in either group. The mean blood loss was significantly less in the uterine massage group at 30 minutes (mean difference (MD) ‐41.60 mL, 95% CI ‐75.16 to ‐8.04) and 60 minutes after trial entry (MD ‐77.40 mL, 95% CI ‐118.71 to ‐36.09). The need for additional uterotonics was significantly reduced in the uterine massage group (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.50). 
For use of uterine massage before and after delivery of the placenta, one trial recruited 1964 women in Egypt and South Africa. Women were assigned to receive oxytocin, uterine massage or both after delivery of the baby but before delivery of the placenta. There was no added benefit for uterine massage plus oxytocin over oxytocin alone as regards blood loss greater than or equal to 500 mL (average RR 1.56, 95% CI 0.44, 5.49; random‐effects) or need for additional use of uterotonics (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.85). 
The two trials were combined to examine the effect of uterine massage commenced either before or after delivery of the placenta. There was substantial heterogeneity with respect to the blood loss 500 mL or more after trial entry. The average effect using a random‐effects model found no statistically significant differences between groups (average RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.39 to 3.32; random‐effects). 
Authors' conclusions
The results of this review are inconclusive, and should not be interpreted as a reason to change current practice. Due to the limitations of the included trials, more trials with sufficient numbers of women are needed in order to estimate the effects of sustained uterine massage. All the women compared in this review received oxytocin as part of the active management of labour. Recent research suggests that once an oxytocic has been given, there is limited scope for further reduction in postpartum blood loss. Trials of uterine massage in settings where uterotonics are not available, and which measure women's experience of the procedure, are needed.","Uterine massage for preventing postpartum haemorrhage
Bleeding after childbirth (postpartum haemorrhage) is the leading cause of maternal deaths in Sub‐Saharan Africa and Egypt, and yet it is largely preventable. Possible causes of heavy bleeding directly following childbirth or within the first 24 hours are that the uterus fails to contract after delivery (uterine atony), a retained placenta, inverted or ruptured uterus, and cervical, vaginal, or perineal tears. 
In well‐resourced settings haemorrhage is reduced by routine active management of delivery of the placenta, called the third stage of labour, using a drug to stimulate contraction of the uterus such as oxytocin. Uterine massage after delivery of the placenta can also promote contraction of the uterus. This involves placing a hand on the woman's lower abdomen and stimulating the uterus by repetitive massaging or squeezing movements. 
This review included two controlled trials in which women were randomly assigned to receive uterine massage or no massage with active management of the third stage of labour, including the routine use of oxytocin. 
In one trial involving 200 women, uterine massage was given every 10 minutes for 60 minutes after delivery of the placenta effectively reduced blood loss, and the need for additional uterotonics, by some 80%. The numbers of women losing more than 500 mL of blood were too small for meaningful comparison. Two women in the control group and none in the uterine massage group needed blood transfusions. 
The second trial involved 1964 women who were assigned to receive oxytocin, uterine massage or both after delivery of the baby and before delivery of the placenta. There was no added benefit for uterine massage when oxytocin was used. 
The results of this review are inconclusive. The methodological quality of the two included trials was high but it is possible that there were differences in the procedures used in the study sites. Disadvantages of uterine massage include the use of staff time, and discomfort caused to women. The findings should not change the recommended practice. It is likely that any reduction in blood loss was limited with the use of oxytocin in these trials. Uterine massage may also have increased apparent blood loss by pressing pooled blood out from the uterine cavity. There is a need for more trials, especially in settings where uterotonics are not available. Uterine massage could be a simple inexpensive intervention if proved effective.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Uterine Massage to Reduce Bleeding After Childbirth

## What is this study about?

Heavy bleeding after giving birth is a serious problem that can be life-threatening, especially in areas with limited medical resources. Researchers wanted to find out if massaging the uterus (womb) after birth could help reduce this bleeding.

## Why is this important?

In many parts of the world, medications to control bleeding after birth are not available. Uterine massage is a simple technique that doesn't require special equipment or medicines, so it could potentially help save lives in these settings.

## What did researchers look for?

The research team searched for studies that compared women who received uterine massage after giving birth to women who did not receive massage. They wanted to see if massage reduced the amount of bleeding.

## What did they find?

The review included 2 studies with a total of 2,164 women:

- **First study (200 women):** Women received massage after the placenta was delivered. All women also received standard medication (oxytocin). Women who received massage had less bleeding overall and needed less additional medication to control bleeding.

- **Second study (1,964 women):** Women received massage before the placenta was delivered. Adding massage to standard medication did not provide extra benefit compared to medication alone.

## What does this mean?

The results don't clearly show whether uterine massage helps reduce bleeding after birth. All women in these studies received standard medication, which may already effectively control bleeding. More research is needed, especially in settings where medications are not available, to better understand if uterine massage is helpful on its own.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What is the study about?
- Heavy bleeding after birth (postpartum hemorrhage) can be dangerous. In many places, medicines to prevent bleeding are hard to get.
- Uterine massage (rubbing the top of the womb after birth) is a simple method that might help reduce bleeding.
- This review looked at whether uterine massage works to reduce bleeding after birth.

Who was studied?
- Women giving birth in hospital settings.
- All women in these trials received oxytocin (a medicine that helps the womb contract).
- Trials took place in Egypt, South Africa, and one other hospital setting.
- Total participants: 2,164 women across two randomized controlled trials.

What treatments were tested?
- Uterine massage done:
  - After the placenta was delivered.
  - Before and after the placenta was delivered.
- Compared with:
  - No massage.
  - Oxytocin alone.
  - Massage plus oxytocin.

Main outcomes measured
- Amount of blood loss (including blood loss of 500 mL or more).
- Need for extra medicines to control bleeding (uterotonics).
- Retained placenta.
- Blood loss measured at 30 and 60 minutes after starting the study treatment.

Key results
- Trial 1 (200 women; massage after placenta, with oxytocin): 
  - Average blood loss was lower with massage at 30 and 60 minutes.
  - Fewer women needed extra medicines.
  - Very few had blood loss over 500 mL; no clear difference between groups.
  - No retained placentas in either group.
- Trial 2 (1,964 women; massage before/after placenta, with or without oxytocin):
  - Adding massage to oxytocin did not reduce heavy bleeding (≥500 mL) or the need for extra medicines compared with oxytocin alone.
- When both trials were combined:
  - Results were mixed and not statistically clear.

Safety
- No serious safety problems were reported.
- No cases of retained placenta were seen in the smaller trial.
- Overall safety data were limited.

Timeline and methods
- Evidence search date: up to April 30, 2013.
- Only randomized controlled trials were included.
- Two researchers independently checked study quality and data.

What does this mean?
- The evidence is inconclusive. It does not clearly show that uterine massage reduces heavy bleeding when oxytocin is already used.
- These results do not support changing current practice.
- More good-quality trials are needed, especially in places where oxytocin and other uterotonics are not available, and that also ask women about their experience with massage."
74,"Background
The majority of people with hip fracture are treated surgically, requiring anaesthesia.
Objectives
The main focus of this review is the comparison of regional versus general anaesthesia for hip (proximal femoral) fracture repair in adults. We did not consider supplementary regional blocks in this review as they have been studied in another review. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; the Cochrane Library; 2014, Issue 3), MEDLINE (Ovid SP, 2003 to March 2014) and EMBASE (Ovid SP, 2003 to March 2014). We reran the search in February 2017. Potential new studies of interest were added to a list of ""Studies awaiting Classification"" and will be incorporated into the formal review findings during the review update. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized trials comparing different methods of anaesthesia for hip fracture surgery in adults. The primary focus of this review was the comparison of regional anaesthesia versus general anaesthesia. The use of nerve blocks preoperatively or in conjunction with general anaesthesia is evaluated in another review. The main outcomes were mortality, pneumonia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, acute confusional state, deep vein thrombosis and return of patient to their own home. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We analysed data with fixed‐effect (I2 < 25%) or random‐effects models. We assessed the quality of the evidence according to the criteria developed by the GRADE working group. 
Main results
In total, we included 31 studies (with 3231 participants) in our review. Of those 31 studies, 28 (2976 participants) provided data for the meta‐analyses. For the 28 studies, 24 were used for the comparison of neuraxial block versus general anaesthesia. Based on 11 studies that included 2152 participants, we did not find a difference between the two anaesthetic techniques for mortality at one month: risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 1.06; I2 = 24% (fixed‐effect model). Based on six studies that included 761 participants, we did not find a difference in the risk of pneumonia: RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.31; I2 = 0%. Based on four studies that included 559 participants, we did not find a difference in the risk of myocardial infarction: RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.22 to 3.65; I2 = 0%. Based on six studies that included 729 participants, we did not find a difference in the risk of cerebrovascular accident: RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.83; I2 = 0%. Based on six studies that included 624 participants, we did not find a difference in the risk of acute confusional state: RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.40; I2 = 49%. Based on laboratory tests, the risk of deep vein thrombosis was decreased when no specific precautions or just early mobilization was used: RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.78; I2 = 0%; (number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 3, 95% CI 2 to 7, based on a basal risk of 76%) but not when low molecular weight heparin was administered: RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.84; I2 for heterogeneity between the two subgroups = 58%. For neuraxial blocks compared to general anaesthesia, we rated the quality of evidence as very low for mortality (at 0 to 30 days), pneumonia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, acute confusional state, decreased rate of deep venous thrombosis in the absence of potent thromboprophylaxis, and return of patient to their own home. The number of studies comparing other anaesthetic techniques was limited. 
Authors' conclusions
We did not find a difference between the two techniques, except for deep venous thrombosis in the absence of potent thromboprophylaxis. The studies included a wide variety of clinical practices. The number of participants included in the review is insufficient to eliminate a difference between the two techniques in the majority of outcomes studied. Therefore, large randomized trials reflecting actual clinical practice are required before drawing final conclusions.","Regional or general anaesthesia for hip fracture surgery in adults
Background: The majority of people with hip fracture are elderly and are treated surgically, which requires anaesthesia. The fracture usually results from a simple fall. These patients often have many other medical problems associated with ageing, which places them at high risk of mortality after anaesthesia. The most common types of anaesthesia are 'general' and 'regional anaesthesia'. General anaesthesia involves a loss of consciousness (induced sleep). Regional anaesthesia involves an injection of a solution containing local anaesthetic inside the spine (neuraxial block) or around the nerves outside the spine (peripheral nerve block) to prevent pain in the leg with the hip fracture. We reviewed the evidence about the effect of regional anaesthesia on patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture. 
Study characteristics: The evidence is current to March 2014. In total, we included 31 studies (with 3231 participants) in our review. Of those 31 studies, 28 (2976 participants) provided data for the meta‐analyses. The mean age of the participants varied from 75 to 86 years. Those studies were published between 1977 and 2013 and so covering a wide range of clinical practices and improvements in techniques over time. Two studies were funded by the anaesthetic drug manufacturer or by an agency with a commercial interest, one received charitable funding, and one was funded by a government agency. We reran the search in February 2017. Potential new studies of interest were added to a list of ""Studies awaiting Classification"" and will be incorporated into the formal review findings during the review update. 
Key results : The trial reports of many of the studies indicated a sub‐suboptimal level of methodological rigour and the number of participants included was often insufficient to allow us to draw a definitive conclusion on many of the outcomes studied. We did not find any difference in mortality at one month (11 trials with 2152 participants) between neuraxial blocks and general anaesthesia. We also did not find a difference for pneumonia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, acute confusional state, congestive heart failure, acute kidney injury, pulmonary embolism, number of patients transfused with red blood cells, length of surgery and length of hospital stay between these two anaesthetic techniques in two to twelve studies. Likewise, when potent prophylactic drugs (such as low molecular weight heparin) were used against postoperative clot formation, we did not find a difference in the risk of deep venous thrombosis. Without prophylaxis with potent anticoagulant drugs the risk of deep venous thrombosis was less with neuraxial block. 
Quality of the evidence: The level of evidence was very low for mortality, pneumonia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, acute confusional state, decrease in the incidence of deep venous thrombosis in the absence of potent prophylaxis, and return of patient to their own home. This means that any estimate of effect is very uncertain.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Types of Anesthesia for Hip Fracture Surgery

## What was this review about?

Researchers looked at different types of anesthesia (medicine that prevents pain during surgery) used when older adults have surgery to repair a broken hip. They wanted to know if one type works better than another.

## What types of anesthesia were compared?

The main comparison was between:
- **Regional anesthesia** (also called neuraxial block): numbing medicine injected near the spine that blocks pain in the lower body while the person stays awake or lightly sedated
- **General anesthesia**: medicine that puts the person completely to sleep during surgery

## How was the review done?

Researchers found 31 studies with 3,231 people who had hip fracture surgery. Most studies compared regional anesthesia to general anesthesia. The researchers looked at what happened to patients after surgery, including whether they:
- Died within one month
- Developed pneumonia (lung infection)
- Had a heart attack
- Had a stroke
- Became confused
- Developed blood clots in their legs
- Were able to return home

## What did they find?

The researchers found **no clear difference** between regional and general anesthesia for most outcomes, including death, pneumonia, heart attack, stroke, or confusion.

**One exception:** Patients who received regional anesthesia had fewer blood clots in their legs, but only when they weren't already receiving strong blood clot prevention medicine.

## What does this mean?

The evidence wasn't strong enough to say one type of anesthesia is definitely better than the other for hip fracture surgery. More research with larger groups of patients is needed.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the review

What was studied
- Adults having surgery to fix a broken hip.
- Two types of anesthesia were compared: regional (spinal/epidural) vs general anesthesia.
- Main questions: Which method is safer? Does one lower the risk of death or problems after surgery?

How the review was done
- Researchers looked at randomized trials.
- 31 studies with 3,231 people were included; 28 studies (2,976 people) had usable data.
- Most results compared regional (neuraxial) vs general anesthesia.
- Searches covered studies up to 2017.
- Key outcomes looked at around 0–30 days after surgery.

Key results
- Death within about 1 month: No clear difference between regional and general anesthesia.
- Lung infection (pneumonia): No clear difference.
- Heart attack: No clear difference.
- Stroke: No clear difference.
- Post-surgery confusion: No clear difference.
- Blood clots in the leg (deep vein thrombosis, DVT):
  - Lower with regional anesthesia when patients did not receive strong blood thinners.
  - No difference when patients received a common blood thinner (low molecular weight heparin).
- Return to living at home: No clear difference.

Safety and quality of evidence
- Overall, results suggest similar safety between the two methods for most outcomes measured.
- The quality of the evidence was rated very low for most outcomes, meaning we are not very certain about these findings.
- More large, modern studies are needed.

What this means for patients
- For hip fracture surgery, regional and general anesthesia appear similarly safe for most short-term outcomes.
- Regional anesthesia may help lower blood clot risk if strong blood thinners are not used, but not when they are used.
- Decisions can be guided by patient preference, medical history, and surgeon/anesthesiologist advice."
75,"Background
Thalassaemia is a genetic disorder of the haemoglobin protein in red blood cells. It has been historically classified into thalassaemia minor, intermedia and major, depending on the genetic defect and severity of the disease. The clinical presentation of β‐thalassaemia varies widely from a mild asymptomatic form in thalassaemia minor, to a severe disease in thalassaemia major where individuals are dependant on life‐long blood transfusions. The hallmark of thalassaemia syndromes is the production of defective red blood cells that are removed by the spleen resulting in an enlarged hyperfunctioning spleen (splenomegaly). Removal of the spleen may thus prolong red blood cell survival by reducing the amount of red blood cells removed from circulation and may ultimately result in the reduced need for blood transfusions. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of splenectomy in people with β‐thalassaemia major or intermedia. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Review Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from searches of electronic databases and the handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched online trial registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews (27 July 2018). 
Date of the most recent search of the Group's trials register: 02 August 2019.
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled and quasi‐randomised controlled studies of people of any age with thalassaemia major or intermedia, evaluating splenectomy in comparison to conservative treatment (transfusion therapy and iron chelation) or other forms of splenectomy compared to each other (laparoscopic, open, radio‐frequency). 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently selected and extracted data from the single included study using a customised data extraction form and assessed the risk of bias. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. 
Main results
One study, including 28 participants was included in the review; the results were described, primarily, in a narrative manner. This study assessed the feasibility of splenectomy using a laparoscopic approach versus open surgery. Given the lack of detail regarding the study methods beyond randomisation, the overall risk of bias for this study was unclear. The study was carried out over a period of 3.5 years, with each participant followed up only until discharge (less than one week after the intervention); it did not assess the majority of the outcomes outlined in this review (including two of the three primary outcomes, frequency of transfusion and quality of life). A total of three serious post‐operative adverse events (the review's third primary outcome) were reported in the laparoscopic splenectomy group (one case of atelectasis and two cases of bleeding), compared to two events of atelectasis in the open surgery group; however, there were no significant differences between the groups for either atelectasis, risk ratio (RR) 0.50 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 4.90) or for bleeding, RR 5.00 (95% CI 0.26 to 95.61) (very low‐quality evidence). In addition, the study also reported three serious cases of intra‐operative bleeding in the laparoscopic group which mandated conversion to open surgery, although the difference between groups was not statistically significant, RR 7.00 (95% CI 0.39 to 124.14) (very low‐quality evidence). These effect estimates are based on very small numbers and hence are unreliable and imprecise. From this small study, there appeared to be an advantage for the laparoscopic approach, in terms of post‐operative hospital stay, although the group difference was not large (median difference of 1.5 days, P = 0.03). 
Authors' conclusions
The review was unable to find good quality evidence, in the form of randomised controlled studies, regarding the efficacy of splenectomy for treating thalassaemia major or intermedia. The single included study provided little information about the efficacy of splenectomy, and compared open surgery and laparoscopic methods. Further studies need to evaluate the long‐term effectiveness of splenectomy and the comparative advantages of surgical methods. Due to a lack of high quality evidence from randomised controlled studies, well‐conducted observational studies may be used to answer this question.","Removal of the spleen in people with thalassaemia major and intermedia
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence comparing the removal of the spleen (splenectomy) to other treatments (such as blood transfusions and chelation (removal of excess iron) in people with thalassaemia major and intermedia. 
Background 
Thalassaemia is a genetic disease, caused by a defect in production of haemoglobin ‐ which carries oxygen in red blood cells to all the tissues of the body. The clinical presentation of thalassaemia varies widely from a mild asymptomatic form to being dependant on life long blood transfusions. The genetic defect in thalassaemia also results in formation of ineffective red blood cells, which are removed by the spleen which in turn becomes enlarged. Removing the spleen can lengthen the lifespan of red blood cells and reduce the need for transfusions. We wanted to evaluate whether current evidence showed that removing the spleen was safe and effective in the long term and compare different surgical methods of removing the spleen. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 02 August 2019.
Study characteristics 
One study with a total of 28 participant was included in the review. This study compared two methods of splenectomy ‐ laparoscopic (keyhole) versus an open surgical approach. Study participants were recruited over a period of 3.5 years, but participants were only followed up to the end of their hospital stay (usually less than one week). 
Key results 
The study evaluated the two types of surgical methods. Only one of our three primary outcomes were reported, the number of people experiencing major adverse events (bleeding during and after the operation and complete or partial collapse of a lung). However, the amount of information available is not sufficient to draw any reliable conclusions (very‐low quality evidence). Hence, we were unable to provide recommendations regarding the use of splenectomy in people with thalassaemia. Appropriate clinical judgement, in view of the various risks and benefits described by other lower quality sources of evidence (e.g. observational studies), may be necessary when considering splenectomy in people with thalassaemia. 
Quality of the evidence 
While we are satisfied that the participants had equal chances of undergoing either type of surgery, there is not enough information on other aspects of the study to make any overall judgement on its quality.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Spleen Removal Surgery for People with Thalassaemia

## What is the health issue?
Thalassaemia is an inherited blood condition that affects how the body makes red blood cells. People with thalassaemia have red blood cells that don't work properly. The spleen (an organ in the belly) removes these damaged cells, which can cause the spleen to become very large. Some people with thalassaemia need regular blood transfusions throughout their lives. Removing the spleen might help red blood cells last longer in the body and possibly reduce the need for blood transfusions.

## What did the researchers want to find out?
The researchers wanted to know if removing the spleen is safe and helpful for people with thalassaemia. They also wanted to compare different surgical methods for removing the spleen.

## What did they find?
The researchers found only one small study with 28 people that met their standards. This study compared two surgical methods:
- Laparoscopic surgery (using small cuts and a camera)
- Open surgery (using one larger cut)

The study followed participants for less than one week after surgery. It did not measure important outcomes like how often people needed blood transfusions or their quality of life.

**Safety findings:**
- Both surgical methods had some complications, but the differences between groups were too small to draw firm conclusions
- Three people in the laparoscopic group had serious complications (one breathing problem and two cases of bleeding)
- Two people in the open surgery group had breathing problems
- Three people who started with laparoscopic surgery needed to switch to open surgery due to bleeding during the operation

**Hospital stay:**
- People who had laparoscopic surgery went home about 1.5 days earlier than those who had open surgery

## What does this mean?
There is not enough quality research to know whether spleen removal helps people with thalassaemia or which surgical method is better. More long-term studies are needed.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the clinical trial review

Purpose
- To find out if removing the spleen (splenectomy) helps people with beta‑thalassemia major or intermedia, and to check safety.

Who was studied
- People of any age with beta‑thalassemia major or intermedia.
- Only one small randomized study was found, with 28 participants.

What was tested
- Surgery to remove the spleen by two methods:
  - Laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery
  - Open surgery
- Compared to each other. No studies compared splenectomy to no surgery.

What outcomes were measured
- Main goals of the review: transfusion needs, quality of life, and serious side effects.
- The single study did not measure transfusion needs or quality of life.
- It reported short‑term side effects after surgery and length of hospital stay.

Key results
- Side effects within about a week after surgery:
  - Laparoscopic group: 1 case of lung collapse (atelectasis), 2 cases of bleeding.
  - Open surgery group: 2 cases of lung collapse.
  - Three people in the laparoscopic group had heavy bleeding during surgery and needed to switch to open surgery.
- Hospital stay was a little shorter with laparoscopic surgery (median 1.5 days shorter).
- Because the study was very small and follow‑up was only until hospital discharge, the results are uncertain.

Safety
- Reported short‑term risks included lung problems (atelectasis) and bleeding.
- No clear difference in risk between the two surgery types, but evidence quality was very low.

Timeline
- The included study ran over about 3.5 years; follow‑up lasted less than one week (until discharge).
- Search dates for this review: July 27, 2018 (databases) and August 2, 2019 (trial register).

What this means
- There is no good quality evidence from randomized trials to show whether splenectomy helps reduce transfusions or improves quality of life in beta‑thalassemia major or intermedia.
- More, better studies with longer follow‑up are needed to test benefits and compare surgery methods."
76,"Background
Postoperative pain is a common consequence of surgery and can have deleterious effects. It has been suggested that the administration of opioid analgesia before a painful stimulus may improve pain control. This can be done in two ways. We defined 'preventive opioids' as opioids administered before incision and continued postoperatively, and 'pre‐emptive opioids' as opioids given before incision but not continued postoperatively. Both pre‐emptive and preventive analgesia involve the initiation of an analgesic agent prior to surgical incision with the aim of reducing intraoperative nociception and therefore postoperative pain. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy of preventive and pre‐emptive opioids for reducing postoperative pain in adults undergoing all types of surgery. 
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, and CINAHL (up to 18 March 2018). In addition, we searched for unpublished studies in three clinical trial databases, conference proceedings, grey literature databases, and reference lists of retrieved articles. We did not apply any restrictions on language or date of publication. 
Selection criteria
We included parallel‐group randomized controlled trials (RCTs) only. We included participants aged over 15 years old undergoing any type of surgery. We defined postincision opioids as the same intervention administered after incision whether single dose (as comparator with pre‐emptive analgesia) or continued postoperatively (as comparator with preventive analgesia) (control group). We considered studies that did and did not use a double‐dummy placebo (e.g. intervention group received active drug before incision and placebo after incision; control group received placebo before incision and active drug after incision). 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were: early acute postoperative pain (measured within six hours and reported on a 0‐to‐10 scale) and respiratory depression. Our secondary outcomes included: late acute postoperative pain (24 to 48 hours and reported on a 0‐to‐10 scale), 24‐hour morphine consumption, and adverse events (intraoperative bradycardia and hypotension). We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome. 
Main results
We included 20 RCTs, including one unpublished study with 1343 participants. Two studies were awaiting classification as the full text for these studies was not available. One study evaluated pre‐emptive opioids, and 19 studies evaluated preventive opioids. We considered only one study to be at low risk of bias for most domains. The surgeries and opioids used varied, although roughly half of the included studies were conducted in abdominal hysterectomy, and around a quarter used morphine as the intervention. All studies were conducted in secondary care. 
Pre‐emptive opioids compared to postincision opioids 
For pre‐emptive opioids in dental surgery, there may be a reduction in early acute postoperative pain (mean difference (MD) ‐1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.75 to ‐0.65; 40 participants; 1 study; low‐quality evidence). This study did not report on adverse events (respiratory depression, bradycardia, or hypotension). There may be a reduction in late acute postoperative pain (MD ‐2.10, 95% CI ‐2.57 to ‐1.63; 40 participants; 1 study; low‐quality evidence). This study did not report 24‐hour morphine consumption. 
Preventive opioids compared to postincision opioids 
For preventive opioids, there was probably no reduction in early acute postoperative pain (MD 0.11, 95% CI ‐0.32 to 0.53; 706 participants; 10 studies; I2 = 61%; moderate‐quality evidence). There were no events of respiratory depression in four studies (433 participants). There was no important reduction in late acute postoperative pain (MD ‐0.06, 95% CI ‐0.13 to 0.01; 668 participants; 9 studies; I2 = 0%; moderate‐quality evidence). There may be a small reduction in 24‐hour morphine consumption (MD ‐4.91 mg, 95% CI ‐9.39 mg to ‐0.44 mg; 526 participants; 11 studies; I2 = 82%; very low‐quality evidence). There may be similar rates of bradycardia (risk ratio (RR) 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.88; 112 participants; 2 studies; I2 = 0%; low‐quality evidence) and hypotension (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.25 to 4.73; 88 participants; 2 studies; I2 = 0%; low‐quality evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Due to the low quality of the evidence, we are uncertain whether pre‐emptive opioids reduce postoperative pain. Based on the trials conducted thus far, there was no clear evidence that preventive opioids result in reductions in pain scores. It was unclear if there was a reduction in morphine consumption due to very low‐quality of evidence. Too few studies reported adverse events to be able to draw any definitive conclusions. Once assessed, the two studies awaiting classification may alter the conclusions of the review.","Pre‐emptive and preventive opioids for postoperative pain in adults undergoing all types of surgery 
To assess the ability of a single dose of opioid given before making the first cut during surgery (pre‐emptive opioids) and preventive opioids that are given before the first cut and continued after surgery for reducing pain due to surgery in adults. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence for opioid painkillers (strong painkillers) when given before surgery, compared to the same painkiller given only after the surgeon has cut the skin. 
Background 
Most people experience pain after surgery that requires strong opioid painkillers. These medications are associated with a number of side effects including depressed breathing, a slow heart rate, and low blood pressure, as well as vomiting, drowsiness, itching, and constipation. Reducing the amount of opioid needed can limit these side effects and improve the patient experience. Compared to starting painkillers later, beginning painkillers before making the first cut for surgery may reduce pain sensitivity, and so lessen the postoperative pain experienced. We wanted to find out whether giving opioid painkillers before surgery was more effective than giving the same painkiller after surgery. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the medical literature for randomized controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to a treatment group using a random method) in March 2018. Participants were randomly allocated to one of two groups. One group was treated with opioids before the surgeon cut the skin, whilst the other group was given the same medication after the surgeon cut the skin. We identified 20 trials involving a total of 1343 participants aged over 15 years who were undergoing a variety of surgeries. In all but one trial, participants received general anaesthetic. Nearly all participants were low‐risk patients. Only one of the trials used a pre‐emptive dose of opioid. 
Key results 
In one small trial (40 participants) involving people undergoing dental surgery, use of pre‐emptive opioids resulted in a small reduction in pain experienced in the first six hours after surgery and at 24 to 48 hours based on low‐quality evidence. This study did not report on adverse events or 24‐hour morphine consumption. 
For preventive opioids started before the first cut was made and continued over the first day after surgery, pain in the first six hours after surgery was similar to when the first opioid dose was given after the first cut to the skin (10 studies; 706 participants). Postoperative pain 24 to 48 hours after surgery was similar between groups (9 studies; 668 participants). The evidence for both these findings was of moderate quality. The following findings were supported by low‐ or very low‐quality evidence. A reduction in 24‐hour morphine consumption was too small to be clinically relevant (11 studies; 526 participants). Not all studies reported on adverse events, but the numbers of participants with respiratory depression (4 studies; 433 participants), low heart rate (2 studies; 112 participants), or low blood pressure (2 studies; 88 participants) were similar between groups. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The main issues concerning the included trials were high risk of bias due to limitations in how the findings were presented, the design and conduct of the studies, and wide variations in the findings, which led to uncertainty in the results. Consequently, we found no convincing evidence that starting opioids before the beginning of surgery reduces levels of pain after surgery or the need for continuing opioids.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Giving Pain Medicine Before vs. After Surgery

## What was this study about?

Researchers wanted to find out if giving opioid pain medicine before surgery starts is better than giving it after surgery begins. They looked at two approaches:

- **Pre-emptive**: Giving opioids before the first surgical cut, but not continuing them after surgery
- **Preventive**: Giving opioids before the first surgical cut AND continuing them after surgery

The goal was to see if either approach works better for controlling pain after surgery.

## Who was studied?

The researchers reviewed 20 studies involving 1,343 adults (age 16 and older) having various types of surgery. About half the studies looked at abdominal hysterectomy patients. All surgeries took place in hospitals.

## What did they find?

**Pre-emptive opioids (1 study, 40 people having dental surgery):**
- May reduce pain in the first 6 hours after surgery
- May reduce pain at 24-48 hours after surgery
- More research is needed to be certain

**Preventive opioids (19 studies, over 1,300 people):**
- Probably does NOT reduce pain in the first 6 hours after surgery
- Does NOT meaningfully reduce pain at 24-48 hours after surgery
- May slightly reduce the amount of morphine needed in the first 24 hours, but researchers are uncertain
- No serious breathing problems were reported
- Similar rates of slow heart rate and low blood pressure compared to giving opioids after surgery starts

## What does this mean?

Based on current evidence, giving opioid pain medicine before surgery (rather than after surgery begins) does not appear to provide clear benefits for pain control. However, the quality of evidence was limited, so more high-quality studies are needed before making firm conclusions.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the clinical trial review

Purpose
- To see if giving opioid pain medicine before surgery cut (with or without continuing it after surgery) helps reduce pain after surgery in adults.

Who was studied
- Adults (age 15+) having many types of surgery.
- 20 randomized controlled trials (1 unpublished), with 1343 people total.
- Most studies were in hospitals; many involved abdominal hysterectomy. Several used morphine.

What treatments were tested
- Pre-emptive opioids: given before the surgical cut, not continued after surgery.
- Preventive opioids: given before the cut and continued after surgery.
- These were compared to starting the same opioid after the cut (usual timing).

What outcomes were measured
- Early pain: within 6 hours after surgery (0–10 scale).
- Late pain: 24–48 hours after surgery (0–10 scale).
- Amount of morphine used in the first 24 hours.
- Safety: breathing problems (respiratory depression), slow heart rate (bradycardia), and low blood pressure (hypotension).

Key findings
Pre-emptive opioids (before cut, not continued)
- Based on 1 small dental surgery study (40 people), early and late pain scores were lower. 
- This evidence was low quality.
- No data on safety or morphine use.

Preventive opioids (before cut and continued)
- Early pain (within 6 hours): probably no meaningful reduction compared with starting after the cut (moderate-quality evidence).
- Late pain (24–48 hours): no important difference (moderate-quality evidence).
- 24-hour morphine use: may be slightly lower, but results were very uncertain (very low-quality evidence).
- Safety: No breathing problems were reported in 4 studies (433 people). Slow heart rate and low blood pressure were similar between groups in small studies, but evidence was low quality.

What this means
- We are unsure if giving opioids only before surgery (pre-emptive) helps, due to limited, low-quality data.
- Giving opioids before and continuing after surgery (preventive) did not clearly improve pain scores compared to starting after the cut.
- Any reduction in extra morphine use is uncertain.
- Too few studies reported side effects to be sure about safety, though no breathing problems were seen in the studies that reported them.

Timing
- Early pain: measured within 6 hours after surgery.
- Late pain: measured 24–48 hours after surgery.
- Opioid use: total morphine in the first 24 hours.

Notes
- Two additional studies were not fully assessed; their results could change these conclusions."
77,"Background
Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonists have been shown to have a neuroprotectant effect in reducing infarct size and improving functional outcome in animal models of cerebrovascular disease. However, the sedative effects of GABA receptor agonists have limited their wider application in people with acute stroke, due to the potential risk of stupor. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2013, and previously updated in 2014 and 2016. 
Objectives
To determine the efficacy and safety of GABA receptor agonists in the treatment of acute stroke. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (accessed May 2018), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2018, Issue 4 (accessed May 2018), MEDLINE (from 1949 to May 2018), Embase (from 1980 to May 2018), CINAHL (from 1982 to May 2018), AMED (from 1985 to May 2018), and 11 Chinese databases (accessed May 2018). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished, and ongoing trials we searched ongoing trial registers, reference lists, and relevant conference proceedings, and contacted authors and pharmaceutical companies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating GABA receptor agonists versus placebo for people with acute stroke (within 12 hours after stroke onset), with the primary outcomes of efficacy and safety. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of identified records, selected studies for inclusion, extracted eligible data, cross‐checked the data for accuracy, and assessed the risk of bias. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
We included five trials with 3838 participants (acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke patients, 3758 analyzed). Most of the participants recruited had acute ischaemic stroke, with limited data available from participants with other stroke subtypes, including total anterior circulation syndrome (TACS). The methodological quality of the included trials was generally good, with an unclear risk for selection bias only. For death and dependency at three months, pooled results did not find a significant difference for chlormethiazole versus placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.11; four trials; 2909 participants; moderate‐quality evidence) and for diazepam versus placebo (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.07; one trial; 849 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). The most frequent adverse events related to chlormethiazole were somnolence (RR 4.56, 95% CI 3.50 to 5.95; two trials; 2527 participants; moderate‐quality evidence) and rhinitis (RR 4.75, 95% CI 2.67 to 8.46; two trials; 2527 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
This review provides moderate‐quality evidence that fails to support the use of GABA receptor agonists (chlormethiazole or diazepam) for the treatment of people with acute stroke. More well‐designed RCTs with large samples of participants with total anterior circulation syndrome are required to determine if there are benefits for this subgroup. Somnolence and rhinitis are frequent adverse events related to chlormethiazole.","Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonists for acute stroke
Question: Are GABA receptor agonist drugs effective and safe in the treatment of acute stroke?  Background: GABA receptor agonists are a type of drug that may help protect the brain in acute stroke. This group of drugs, which includes diazepam and chlormethiazole, has been used as traditional sedatives for several decades, and have been found to be beneficial in stroke studies in animals. However, the sedative effect of GABA receptor agonists could be harmful for people with acute stroke.  Study characteristics: We identified five studies to May 2018 that met our inclusion criteria; they randomized 3838 participants (acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke patients) and analyzed 3758. The quality of all the studies was generally good, with a low risk of bias. One study tested the effects and safety of diazepam for acute stroke in 849 participants within 12 hours of stroke onset. Four studies tested the effects and safety of chlormethiazole in 2909 participants with acute stroke, within 12 hours of stroke onset; 95 participants had stroke caused by bleeding and were analyzed separately.  Key results: All five trials reported death and dependency at three months. There was no significant difference between the chlormethiazole and placebo groups or between the diazepam and placebo groups. The most frequent side effects caused by chlormethiazole were drowsiness and nasal irritation.  Quality of the evidence: In conclusion, moderate‐quality evidence did not support the use of GABA receptor agonists for the treatment of people with acute stroke.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: GABA Receptor Agonists for Acute Stroke

## What was this study about?

Researchers reviewed existing studies to see if certain medications called GABA receptor agonists could help people who just had a stroke. These medications include drugs like chlormethiazole and diazepam. In animal studies, these drugs seemed to protect the brain and reduce damage from strokes, but they can also make people very sleepy.

## Who was studied?

The review looked at 5 studies involving 3,838 adults who had just experienced a stroke (within 12 hours of stroke starting). Most people in these studies had strokes caused by blood clots blocking blood vessels in the brain. Some had strokes caused by bleeding in the brain.

## What did researchers find?

After 3 months of treatment:
- People taking chlormethiazole did about the same as people taking placebo (inactive treatment) in terms of death or disability
- People taking diazepam also did about the same as people taking placebo

**Side effects:** People taking chlormethiazole commonly experienced:
- Sleepiness (about 4.5 times more likely than placebo)
- Runny nose (about 4.8 times more likely than placebo)

## What does this mean?

The evidence does not support using GABA receptor agonists like chlormethiazole or diazepam to treat people who just had a stroke. These medications did not improve outcomes and caused noticeable side effects. More research might be needed for specific types of severe strokes.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What was studied
- Medicines called GABA receptor agonists (such as chlormethiazole and diazepam). These drugs calm brain activity and helped animals after stroke, but can cause sleepiness in people.
- Goal: to see if these medicines help people who just had a stroke and if they are safe.

Who was included
- Adults with acute stroke treated within 12 hours of stroke start.
- 5 randomized controlled trials, 3838 people (3758 analyzed).
- Most had ischemic stroke. Few had a severe type called total anterior circulation syndrome (TACS).

What treatments were compared
- GABA agonists (chlormethiazole or diazepam) versus placebo (no active drug).

Main outcomes measured
- Death or dependency in daily activities at 3 months after stroke.
- Side effects.

Key results
- No clear benefit:
  - Chlormethiazole did not reduce death or dependency at 3 months compared with placebo.
  - Diazepam did not reduce death or dependency at 3 months compared with placebo.
- Side effects:
  - Chlormethiazole often caused sleepiness (somnolence).
  - Chlormethiazole also increased runny or stuffy nose (rhinitis).

Evidence quality
- Overall, moderate-quality evidence.
- Study methods were generally good.

What this means
- Current evidence does not support using chlormethiazole or diazepam to treat people right after a stroke.
- More large, well-designed trials are needed, especially in people with TACS, to know if any group might benefit.

Timing and sources
- This is an update of a Cochrane Review (first in 2013; updates in 2014, 2016, and searches through May 2018)."
78,"Background
Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common bacterial infection among young children in the United States. There are limitations and concerns over its treatment with antibiotics and surgery and so effective preventative measures are attractive. A potential preventative measure is xylitol, a natural sugar substitute that reduces the risk of dental decay. Xylitol can reduce the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae (S pneumoniae) and Haemophilus influenzae (H influenzae) to nasopharyngeal cells in vitro. This is an update of a review first published in 2011. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of xylitol to prevent AOM in children aged up to 12 years. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (to Issue 12, 2015), MEDLINE (1950 to January 2016), Embase (1974 to January 2016), CINAHL (1981 to January 2016), LILACS (1982 to January 2016), Web of Science (2011 to January 2016) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (2000 to January 2016). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs of children aged 12 years or younger where xylitol supplementation was compared with placebo or no treatment to prevent AOM. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials from search results, assessed and rated study quality and extracted relevant data for inclusion in the review. We contacted trial authors to request missing data. We noted data on any adverse events of xylitol. We extracted data on relevant outcomes and estimated the effect size by calculating risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI). 
Main results
We identified five clinical trials that involved 3405 children for inclusion. For this 2016 update, we identified one new trial for inclusion. This trial was systematically reviewed but due to several sources of heterogeneity, was not included in the meta‐analysis. The remaining four trials were of adequate methodological quality. In three RCTs that involved a total of 1826 healthy Finnish children attending daycare, there is moderate quality evidence that xylitol (in any form) can reduce the risk of AOM from 30% to around 22% compared with the control group (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.88). Among the reasons for dropouts, there were no significant differences in abdominal discomfort and rash between the xylitol and the control groups. Xylitol was not effective in reducing AOM among healthy children during a respiratory infection (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.53; moderate quality evidence) or among otitis‐prone healthy children (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.21; low‐quality evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
There is moderate quality evidence showing that the prophylactic administration of xylitol among healthy children attending daycare centres can reduce the occurrence of AOM. There is inconclusive evidence with regard to the efficacy of xylitol in preventing AOM among children with respiratory infection, or among otitis‐prone children. The meta‐analysis was limited because data came from a small number of studies, and most were from the same research group.","Xylitol sugar supplement for preventing middle ear infection in children up to 12 years of age  
Review question  We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of xylitol to prevent acute middle ear infection (acute otitis media; AOM) in children up to 12 years old. 
Background  AOM is the most common bacterial infection among young children in the United States. Although serious complications are rare, this common childhood ailment imposes a huge impact on the healthcare system. In the United States, it accounted for almost 20 million office visits. Antibiotic treatment of AOM is costly and raises concerns about the development of antibiotic‐resistant strains of bacteria. Surgery is invasive and costly, and because of these factors, effective measures for preventing AOM are sought. An alternative treatment is xylitol or birch sugar. Xylitol has been used for decades as a natural non‐sugar sweetener principally in chewing gums, confectionery, toothpaste and medicines, and can reduce the risk of tooth decay. 
Search date 
We searched the literature up to January 2016. This is an update of a review that was last published in 2011. 
Study characteristics  We identified five clinical trials that involved 3405 children, mostly from the same research group. Four trials were conducted in Finland and enrolled healthy children (three trials) or children with an acute respiratory infection (one trial). The fifth trial was conducted in the USA and enrolled otitis‐prone children who were recruited from attendance at general medical practices. 
Study funding sources 
All five trials received governmental funding; and the Finnish study investigators have a US patent for the use of xylitol to treat respiratory infections. 
Key results 
Xylitol, administered in chewing gum, lozenges or syrup, can reduce the occurrence of AOM among healthy children with no acute upper respiratory infection from 30% to 22%. There is no difference in side effects (namely, abdominal discomfort and rash). Based on these results we would expect that out of 1000 children up to 12 years of age, 299 would experience an AOM compared with between 194 and 263 children who would experience an AOM if they are provided with xylitol chewing gum. The preventive effect among healthy children with respiratory infection or among otitis‐prone children is inconclusive. 
Quality of the evidence  The quality of evidence was moderate for healthy children and children with respiratory infections but low for otitis‐prone children.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Xylitol for Preventing Ear Infections in Children

## What was studied?
Researchers reviewed studies to see if xylitol (a natural sweetener) can help prevent ear infections in children up to 12 years old.

## Why is this important?
Ear infections are very common in young children in the United States. Since antibiotics and surgery have some downsides, finding ways to prevent ear infections is important. Xylitol, which is already used to prevent tooth decay, might also help prevent ear infections by stopping certain bacteria from sticking to cells in the nose and throat.

## What did researchers find?
The review included 5 studies with 3,405 children total. The main findings were:

**For healthy children in daycare:**
- Xylitol reduced ear infections from about 30% to 22%
- This means about 8 fewer children out of 100 got ear infections when using xylitol

**For other groups of children:**
- Xylitol did not clearly help children who already had a cold or respiratory infection
- Xylitol did not clearly help children who get frequent ear infections

## Side effects
Children taking xylitol had similar rates of stomach discomfort and rashes as children not taking it.

## What does this mean?
Xylitol may help prevent ear infections in healthy children who attend daycare. However, more research is needed because most studies came from the same research team. The evidence is less clear for children with colds or those who get frequent ear infections.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

Purpose
- To see if xylitol, a common sugar substitute, can safely help prevent ear infections (acute otitis media) in children up to 12 years old.

Who was studied
- Children 12 years and younger.
- Most data came from healthy children in daycare in Finland.
- Some studies also looked at children with colds and children who often get ear infections.

What was tested
- Xylitol given as a supplement (in various forms) compared with a placebo or no treatment.

Main outcomes
- How many children got an ear infection.
- Side effects such as stomach upset or rash.

Key results
- 5 trials with 3405 children were included (searches up to January 2016).
- In three good-quality trials of 1826 healthy daycare children, xylitol lowered ear infections from about 30% to about 22% (risk ratio 0.75; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.88).
- Xylitol did not help:
  - Children who had a respiratory infection at the time (RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.53).
  - Children who often get ear infections (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.67 to 1.21).

Safety
- No important differences in side effects between xylitol and control groups.
- Reported issues like stomach discomfort and rash were similar in both groups.

Timing and methods
- This is an update of a review first published in 2011.
- Databases were searched through January 2016.
- Only randomized or quasi-randomized trials were included.
- One newer trial was reviewed but not combined with others due to differences in methods.

Limits
- Few studies overall, and many were done by the same research group.
- Results may best apply to healthy children in daycare, not to sick or ear infection–prone children.

Bottom line
- Xylitol can modestly reduce ear infections in healthy children attending daycare.
- It has not shown benefit for children who currently have a respiratory infection or who frequently get ear infections.
- Side effects appear similar to placebo."
79,"Background
This an update of a Cochrane Review.
Paraquat is a widely used herbicide, but is also a lethal poison. In some low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs) paraquat is commonly available and inexpensive, making poisoning prevention difficult. Most of the people poisoned by paraquat have taken it as a means of self‐poisoning. 
Standard treatment for paraquat poisoning prevents further absorption and reduces the load of paraquat in the blood through haemoperfusion or haemodialysis. The effectiveness of standard treatments is extremely limited. 
The immune system plays an important role in exacerbating paraquat‐induced lung fibrosis. Immunosuppressive treatment using glucocorticoid and cyclophosphamide in combination has been developed and studied as an intervention for paraquat poisoning. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of glucocorticoid with cyclophosphamide for moderate to severe oral paraquat poisoning. 
Search methods
The most recent searches were run in September 2020. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Injuries Trials Register), Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily and Ovid OLDMEDLINE, Embase Classic + Embase (Ovid), ISI WOS (SCI‐EXPANDED, SSCI, CPCI‐S, and CPSI‐SSH), and trials registries. We also searched the following three resources: China National Knowledge Infrastructure database (CNKI 数据库); Wanfang Data (万方数据库); and VIP (维普数据库) on 12 November 2020. We examined the reference lists of included studies and review papers. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs). For this update, in accordance with Cochrane Injuries' Group policy (2015), we included only prospectively registered RCTs for trials published after 2010. We included trials which assessed the effects of glucocorticoid with cyclophosphamide delivered in combination. Eligible comparators were standard care (with or without a placebo), or any other therapy in addition to standard care. Outcomes of interest included mortality and infections. 
Data collection and analysis
We calculated the mortality risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Where possible, we summarised data for all‐cause mortality at relevant time periods (from hospital discharge to three months after discharge) in meta‐analysis, using a fixed‐effect model. We conducted sensitivity analyses based on factors including whether participants were assessed at baseline for plasma paraquat levels. We also reported data on infections within one week after initiation of treatment. 
Main results
We included four trials with a total of 463 participants. The included studies were conducted in Taiwan (Republic of China), Iran, and Sri Lanka. Most participants were male. The mean age of participants was 28 years. 
We judged two of the four included studies, including the largest and most recently conducted study (n = 299), to be at low risk of bias for key domains including sequence generation. We assessed one study to be at high risk of selection bias and another at unclear risk, since allocation concealment was either not mentioned in the trial report or explicitly not undertaken. We assessed three of the four studies to be at unclear risk of selective reporting, as no protocols could be identified. An important source of heterogeneity amongst the included studies was the method of assessment of participants' baseline severity using analysis of plasma levels (two studies employed this method, whilst the other two did not). 
No studies assessed the outcome of mortality at 30 days following ingestion of paraquat.
Low‐certainty evidence from two studies indicates that glucocorticoids with cyclophosphamide in addition to standard care may slightly reduce the risk of death in hospital compared to standard care alone ((RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.99; participants = 322); results come from sensitivity analysis excluding studies not assessing plasma at baseline). However, we have limited confidence in this finding as heterogeneity was high (I2 = 77%) and studies varied in terms of size and comparators. A single large study provided data showing that there may be little or no effect of treatment at three months post discharge from hospital (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.13; 1 study, 293 participants; low‐certainty evidence); however, analysis of long‐term results amongst participants whose injuries arose from self‐poisoning must be interpreted with caution. 
We remain uncertain of the effect of glucocorticoids with cyclophosphamide on infection within one week after initiation of the treatment; this outcome was assessed by two small studies only (31 participants, very low‐certainty evidence) that considered leukopenia as a proxy or risk factor for infection. Neither study reported infections in any participants. 
Authors' conclusions
Low‐certainly evidence suggests that glucocorticoids with cyclophosphamide in addition to standard care may slightly reduce mortality in hospitalised people with oral paraquat poisoning. However, we have limited confidence in this finding because of substantial heterogeneity and concerns about imprecision. Glucocorticoids with cyclophosphamide in addition to standard care may have little or no effect on mortality at three months after hospital discharge. We are uncertain whether glucocorticoid with cyclophosphamide puts patients at an increased risk of infection due to the limited evidence available for this outcome. Future research should be prospectively registered and CONSORT‐compliant. Investigators should attempt to ensure an adequate sample size, screen participants for inclusion rigorously, and seek long‐term follow‐up of participants. Investigators may wish to research the effects of glucocorticoid in combination with other treatments.","What are the benefits and risks of treating paraquat poisoning with a combination of steroids and cyclophosphamide (an anti‐cancer medicine)? 
Key messages 
‐ Steroids given with cyclophosphamide (an anti‐cancer medicine) are unlikely to reduce the risk of death after paraquat poisoning in the short term, or at three months after hospital discharge. 
‐ We are uncertain whether these medicines increase the risk of infection.
‐ Future studies need to be larger, measure the level of paraquat poisoning of patients accurately, and monitor patients in the long term. Research into steroids combined with other treatments could be useful. 
What happens in people with paraquat poisoning? 
Paraquat is used as a herbicide, but is also a deadly poison. Most people who are poisoned by paraquat have taken it as a means of self‐poisoning. 
Treatment for paraquat poisoning focuses on the physical removal (via stomach pumping and other methods) of as much paraquat as possible from the person's digestive system (stomach) and blood. Any paraquat that remains inside the body causes inflammation that can damage the lungs severely and lead to death. 
Steroids and cyclophosphamide (a medicine normally used in cancer treatment) are medicines that fight inflammation and so are also used to treat paraquat poisoning. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find out if a combination of steroids and cyclophosphamide (plus usual care) works better than usual care alone to reduce the number of people who die from paraquat poisoning. 
We also wanted to find out if treatment with steroids plus cyclophosphamide causes an increased number of infections in patients. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that investigated the use of steroids and cyclophosphamide (plus usual care) compared with usual care alone in people poisoned with paraquat. 
We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. 
What did we find? 
We found four studies that involved 463 people with confirmed paraquat poisoning. Two studies were conducted in Taiwan (Republic of China), one in Iran, and one in Sri Lanka. 
All participants were given either:
‐ usual care only, or
‐ steroids (methylprednisolone alone, or with dexamethasone) plus cyclophosphamide, as well as usual care. Cyclophosphamide was given before the steroid(s) or at the same time as them. 
Two of the studies measured the severity of poisoning by testing patients’ plasma (a component of blood) at the start of the study. Plasma tests provide the best assessment of how seriously a person is affected by paraquat poisoning. 
One study used a placebo (sham) treatment in addition to usual care. Two studies gave patients a steroid (dexamethasone) as part of the usual care. 
Death while in hospital 
The combined results of two studies showed that steroids plus cyclophosphamide (plus usual care) may slightly reduce the risk of death compared to usual care alone (with, or without, placebo) in people with paraquat poisoning. 
Death 3 months after hospital discharge 
One large study showed that at 3 months after discharge from hospital there may be no difference in the number of deaths between the people treated with steroids plus cyclophosphamide (plus usual care) and those treated with usual care alone. 
Infection 
Two small studies checked levels of white blood cells in patients (low levels can increase risk of infection). Neither study reported any infections in the week following treatment with steroids and cyclophosphamide. Due to the small size of the studies, we are very uncertain about whether the treatment affects the risk of infection within one week of treatment. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
The four studies differed in terms of the number of people in them, assessment of level of paraquat poisoning, and types of treatment. This limited our ability to draw firm conclusions from the evidence. 
Overall, the studies we found were too small to provide answers to our questions.
How up to date is this evidence? 
This review updates our previous review on this subject. The evidence is up to date to September 2020.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Treatment for Paraquat Poisoning

## What is this review about?

Paraquat is a weed killer that is also a deadly poison. In some countries, it is easy to buy and inexpensive. Most people who are poisoned by paraquat have swallowed it intentionally to harm themselves.

Current treatments try to remove paraquat from the body, but they don't work very well. Paraquat damages the lungs, and the body's immune system can make this damage worse. Researchers have studied whether using two medicines together—a steroid (glucocorticoid) and another immune-suppressing drug (cyclophosphamide)—might help people who have been poisoned.

## What did the researchers look for?

The researchers searched for studies that tested whether giving glucocorticoid and cyclophosphamide together, along with standard care, helps people who have swallowed paraquat. They wanted to know if this treatment reduces deaths and whether it increases the risk of infections.

## What did they find?

The review included 4 studies with 463 people from Taiwan, Iran, and Sri Lanka. Most participants were male, with an average age of 28 years.

**Key findings:**
- The combined treatment may slightly reduce the chance of dying in the hospital compared to standard care alone, but the researchers have limited confidence in this finding.
- Three months after leaving the hospital, the treatment may make little or no difference in survival.
- The researchers are uncertain whether the treatment increases the risk of infections because only 2 small studies looked at this, and neither reported any infections.

## What does this mean?

The combined treatment might help reduce deaths while people are in the hospital, but more research is needed to be sure. The long-term benefits are unclear. Future studies should include more people and follow them for longer periods to better understand if this treatment is helpful and safe.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the evidence review

What was studied
- Paraquat is a common weed killer that can be deadly if swallowed.
- Standard care tries to stop more poison from being absorbed and to remove it from the blood. These methods often do not work well.
- This review looked at whether adding two immune‑suppressing medicines (a glucocorticoid plus cyclophosphamide) to standard care helps people who swallowed paraquat.

Who was included
- 4 randomized trials with 463 people treated in hospitals in Taiwan, Iran, and Sri Lanka.
- Most were men. Average age was 28 years.

What treatments were compared
- Glucocorticoid + cyclophosphamide given together, added to standard care
- Versus standard care alone (sometimes with a placebo or other therapies)

Main outcomes measured
- Death during the hospital stay
- Death up to 3 months after hospital discharge
- Infections within 1 week after starting treatment

Key findings
- In-hospital deaths: Adding the two medicines may slightly lower the chance of dying in the hospital compared with standard care alone. The evidence is uncertain and results varied between studies.
- Death by 3 months after discharge: There may be little or no difference. This comes from one large study.
- Infections within 1 week: We do not know if the treatment changes infection risk. Only two very small studies reported on this, and no infections were recorded.

Timing of the evidence
- Trials were identified in searches up to November 2020.
- No study reported deaths exactly at 30 days after ingestion.

How certain is the evidence
- Overall certainty is low. Some studies were small, methods differed, and not all trials clearly showed how people were assigned to treatments.

Safety
- It is unclear if the treatment increases infections in the first week. More data are needed.

Bottom line
- Adding a glucocorticoid plus cyclophosphamide to standard care may slightly reduce deaths in the hospital, but the evidence is uncertain.
- There may be little or no effect on deaths by 3 months after discharge.
- We need larger, well‑run trials that track patients for longer and report safety clearly."
80,"Background
Cystic fibrosis is the most common life‐limiting autosomal recessive genetic disorder in white populations. Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) is an important morbidity in cystic fibrosis. It is the result of the accumulation of viscid faecal material within the bowel which combines with thick, sticky mucus produced in the intestines of people with cystic fibrosis. The intestine may be completely blocked (complete DIOS) or only partially blocked (incomplete DIOS). Once a diagnosis of DIOS has been made, the goal of therapy is to relieve the acute complete or incomplete faecal obstruction and ultimately prevent the need for surgical intervention. 
Objectives
This review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different treatment regimens for the treatment of DIOS (complete and incomplete) in children and adults with cystic fibrosis. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of search: 09 September 2021. 
We also searched online trial registries. Date of last search: 12 October 2021.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials, quasi‐randomised controlled trials (including cross‐over trials (to be judged on an individual basis)) comparing the use of laxative agents or surgery for treating DIOS in children, young people and adults with cystic fibrosis to each other, placebo or no intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently screened papers, extracted trial details and assessed for risk of bias. The authors assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
There was one trial with 20 participants (16 females) included in the review. The mean age of participants was 13.1 years. The trial was a double‐blinded, randomised cross‐over trial which had a duration of 12 months in total and compared high‐dose and low‐dose pancreatic enzyme therapy. As only the abstract of the trial was available, the overall risk of bias was judged to be unclear. The trial did not address either of our primary outcomes (time until resolution of DIOS and treatment failure rate), but reported episodes of acute DIOS, presence of abdominal mass and abdominal pain. There were no numerical data available for these outcomes, but the authors stated that there was no difference between treatment with high‐dose or low‐dose pancreatic enzymes. The overall certainty of the evidence was found to be very low. 
Authors' conclusions
There is a clear lack of evidence for the treatment of DIOS in people with cystic fibrosis. The included abstract did not address our primary outcome measures and did not provide numerical data for the two secondary outcomes it did address. Therefore, we cannot justify the use of high‐dose pancreatic enzymes for treating DIOS, nor can we comment on the efficacy and safety of other laxative agents. From our findings, it is clear that more randomised controlled trials need to be conducted in this area.","Interventions for treating distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) in cystic fibrosis 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of different treatments for distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) in children and adults with cystic fibrosis. 
Background 
Cystic fibrosis is a common, life‐limiting, inherited disease. One of the main features of cystic fibrosis is the thick, sticky mucus produced by many organs including the lungs, pancreas and intestine. DIOS occurs when mucus in the intestine combines with faeces and builds up to produce a mass. This mass can partially or completely block the intestine and cause symptoms such as vomiting, severe abdominal pain and a swollen stomach (abdominal distension). Once a diagnosis of DIOS has been made, the goal of therapy is to relieve the complete or partial blockage and ultimately prevent the need for any surgical intervention. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 12 October 2021.
Trial characteristics 
The review included one trial with 20 people with cystic fibrosis who were aged between 7.1 and 23.2 years of age (average 13.1 years old). The 12‐month trial compared a high dose of pancreatic enzymes with a low dose of pancreatic enzymes for treating chronic DIOS. 
Key results 
The trial did not report on our primary outcomes (time until DIOS successfully treated and treatment failure rate), but addressed two of our secondary outcomes; episodes of acute DIOS and the harmful effects that might occur in participants (the presence of an abdominal mass and abdominal pain). There were no numerical data available for these results, but the authors reported that there was no difference between high‐dose or low‐dose pancreatic enzymes. 
Certainty of the evidence 
We found the overall certainty of the evidence to be very low. The trial itself was only published as an abstract from a conference which did not include numerical data and it was not published as a full report. This meant that we do not know many details about the trial. We thought that the overall risk of bias was unclear, as the trial authors did not describe how participants were put into the treatment groups, whether any participants dropped out or whether the planned outcomes were the same as the reported outcomes. The trial also had a very small number of participants and a limited age range, making it difficult to draw conclusions about the relevance of the treatment for all people with cystic fibrosis.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Treatments for Bowel Blockages in People with Cystic Fibrosis

## What was this review about?

People with cystic fibrosis can develop a problem called distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS). This happens when thick, sticky stool and mucus build up in the intestines and cause a blockage. The blockage can be complete (nothing can pass through) or partial (some material can still pass through).

Researchers wanted to find out which treatments work best and are safest for clearing these blockages in children and adults with cystic fibrosis.

## What did the researchers do?

They searched medical databases through September 2021 looking for studies that tested different treatments for DIOS. They looked for studies that compared:
- Different laxatives (medicines that help move stool through the intestines)
- Surgery
- These treatments compared to each other, fake treatments, or no treatment

## What did they find?

The researchers found only one small study with 20 people (mostly females, average age 13 years). This study lasted 12 months and compared high doses versus low doses of pancreatic enzymes (medicines that help digest food).

The study had several limitations:
- Only the summary was available, not the full study
- It didn't measure how long it took for blockages to clear up
- It didn't report how often treatments failed
- It didn't provide detailed numbers for the results

The study authors said there was no difference between high-dose and low-dose enzymes for preventing DIOS episodes, abdominal masses, or stomach pain, but they didn't provide the actual data.

## What does this mean?

There isn't enough evidence to know which treatments work best for DIOS in people with cystic fibrosis. More research studies are needed to find safe and effective treatments for this condition.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What is this review about?
- Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) can happen in people with cystic fibrosis when thick stool and mucus block part of the intestine.
- The goal of treatment is to clear the blockage and avoid surgery.
- This review looked at how well different treatments work and how safe they are for children and adults with cystic fibrosis who have DIOS.

Who was studied?
- Researchers searched for trials in children, teens, and adults with cystic fibrosis and DIOS.
- They looked for studies that compared laxatives or surgery to each other, to placebo, or to no treatment.
- Search dates: up to September 9, 2021 (databases) and October 12, 2021 (trial registries).

What treatments were tested?
- Only one study met the criteria.
- It compared high-dose versus low-dose pancreatic enzyme capsules.
- No trials of laxatives or surgery were included in the results.

Study details
- 20 participants (16 female), average age 13.1 years.
- Double-blind, randomized, cross-over design.
- Total duration: 12 months.

What outcomes were measured?
- The review planned to look at:
  - Time until DIOS got better
  - Treatment failure (needing more treatment or surgery)
- The included study did not report these main outcomes.
- It reported episodes of acute DIOS, feeling a mass in the belly, and belly pain, but gave no numbers.
- The study said there was no difference between high-dose and low-dose enzymes for these reported outcomes.

Safety
- The study did not provide enough safety data.
- The overall certainty of the evidence was very low.

What do the results mean?
- There is not enough good evidence to support using high-dose pancreatic enzymes to treat DIOS.
- There is not enough evidence to judge how well laxatives or surgery work for DIOS from randomized trials.

What’s next?
- More well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to test treatments for DIOS, measure how quickly symptoms improve, how often treatment fails, and safety."
81,"Background
Lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication is one of the most commonly diagnosed and treated pathological spinal conditions. It frequently afflicts the elderly population. 
Objectives
To systematically review the evidence for the effectiveness of nonoperative treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication. 
Search methods
CENTRAL, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Index to Chiropractic Literature (ICL) databases were searched up to June 2012. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials published in English, in which at least one arm provided data on nonoperative treatments 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Risk of bias in each study was independently assessed by two review authors using the 12 criteria recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group (Furlan 2009). Dichotomous outcomes were expressed as relative risk, continuous outcomes as mean difference or standardized mean difference; uncertainty was expressed with 95% confidence intervals. If possible a meta‐analysis was performed, otherwise results were described qualitatively. GRADE was used to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
From the 8635 citations screened, 56 full‐text articles were assessed and 21 trials (1851 participants) were included. There was very low‐quality evidence from six trials that calcitonin is no better than placebo or paracetamol, regardless of mode of administration or outcome assessed. From single small trials, there was low‐quality evidence for prostaglandins, and very low‐quality evidence for gabapentin or methylcobalamin that they improved walking distance. There was very low‐quality evidence from a single trial that epidural steroid injections improved pain, function, and quality of life, up to two weeks, compared with home exercise or inpatient physical therapy. There was low‐quality evidence from a single trial that exercise is of short‐term benefit for leg pain and function compared with no treatment. There was low and very low‐quality evidence from six trials that multimodal nonoperative treatment is less effective than indirect or direct surgical decompression with or without fusion. A meta‐analysis of two trials comparing direct decompression with or without fusion to multimodal nonoperative care found no significant difference in function at six months (mean difference (MD) ‐3.66, 95% CI ‐10.12 to 2.80) and one year (MD ‐6.18, 95% CI ‐15.03 to 2.66), but at 24 months a significant difference was found favouring decompression (MD ‐4.43, 95% CI ‐7.91 to ‐0.96). 
Authors' conclusions
Moderate and high‐quality evidence for nonoperative treatment is lacking and thus prohibits recommendations for guiding clinical practice. Given the expected exponential rise in the prevalence of lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication, large high‐quality trials are urgently needed.","Non‐surgical treatment for spinal stenosis with leg pain
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness of non‐surgical treatments for people with leg pain caused by pressure on the nerves in the spine. 
Background 
If the spinal canal becomes narrow and presses on nerves (spinal stenosis) it can cause pain in the legs or buttocks (neurogenic claudication). Spinal stenosis is treated with a variety of non‐surgical methods, including painkillers and other medications, injections into the spine, exercise, physiotherapy and similar treatments. We wanted to discover whether using non‐surgical methods was better or worse than other alternatives. 
Study characteristics 
We included 21 randomised controlled trials that compared non‐surgical treatments to placebo, no treatment, or to surgery. All the participants had leg pain and a confirmed diagnosis of lumbar stenosis. There were 1851 people, with an average age of 50 years, equally divided between men and women. The follow‐up time ranged from one week to six years. The evidence was current to June 2012. 
Key results 
Overall, the review suggests that surgery is more effective at relieving pain than non‐surgical treatments. 
Medicines taken by mouth. One small trial each of prostaglandins (compared to another medicine), gabapentin (compared to placebo), and vitamin B1 (compared to a variety of treatments) suggested improvements in pain and walking distance. Some digestive problems were reported with both medicines in the prostaglandins trial; and some people in the gabapentin trial reported dizziness or sleepiness. 
Epidural injections. Two small trials showed short‐term improvements in pain and quality of life (up to two weeks) and two showed no difference compared with placebo injections. No trial reported bad reactions or problems. 
Calcitonin injections. Six small trials indicated that calcitonin is no better than paracetemol or placebo. A number of people reported feeling sick or developed a rash. 
Mixed approaches compared to surgery. Five trials compared results from surgery with results from a variety of non‐surgical treatments. One trial found that after two years there was no difference between treatments as far as pain was concerned. The other four found that surgery improved pain more than non‐surgical treatments over different time periods, but not necessarily walking ability. Between 5% and 18% suffered unwanted side effects from surgery, some serious. 
Physical therapy. Four small trials, all including some form of exercise, failed to demonstrate improved walking ability after physical therapy. One trial each suggested that exercise is better than no treatment for leg pain, and that treadmill walking and stationary cycling produce similar, limited results. 
Quality of evidence 
The findings of all the trials in this study were based on low or very low‐quality evidence. The studies were poorly designed, or they failed to give enough information about what was done. This means that we cannot be confident that the findings are reliable, and further research may well come to a different conclusion.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Treatments for Lower Back Narrowing That Causes Leg Pain

## What was this study about?

Researchers looked at different non-surgical treatments for a common back condition in older adults. This condition happens when the spaces in the lower spine become narrow and press on nerves, causing leg pain and difficulty walking.

## What did the researchers do?

They searched medical databases through June 2012 and found 21 studies involving 1,851 people. They examined how well different treatments worked, including:
- Medications (calcitonin, prostaglandins, gabapentin, methylcobalamin)
- Steroid injections into the spine
- Exercise programs
- Combinations of different treatments

They also compared these non-surgical treatments to surgery.

## What did they find?

**Medications:**
- Calcitonin did not work better than fake pills or regular pain relievers
- Some other medications might help people walk farther, but the evidence was weak

**Steroid injections:**
- May help with pain and daily activities for up to 2 weeks, but the evidence was limited

**Exercise:**
- May help reduce leg pain and improve daily activities in the short term

**Surgery vs. non-surgical treatment:**
- After 2 years, people who had surgery reported better results than those who received non-surgical treatments

## What does this mean?

The researchers found that most studies on non-surgical treatments were small or had quality issues. They could not make strong recommendations about which treatments work best. More high-quality research is needed to help doctors and patients make better treatment decisions.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What was studied
- Question: How well do non-surgery treatments help people with lumbar spinal stenosis that causes leg pain and trouble walking?
- Who: Adults with this condition (often older adults).
- Study type: A review of randomized controlled trials.
- Timeframe: Studies searched up to June 2012.
- Size: 21 trials with 1,851 participants.

What treatments were tested
- Medicines: calcitonin; prostaglandins; gabapentin; methylcobalamin (vitamin B12).
- Injections: epidural steroid injections.
- Exercise: supervised exercise programs.
- Combined non-surgery care: “multimodal” programs (mix of therapies).
- Comparisons included placebo, acetaminophen (paracetamol), home exercise, inpatient physical therapy, and surgery (spinal decompression with or without fusion).

Main results
- Calcitonin: Very low-quality evidence showed no better results than placebo or acetaminophen for any outcome.
- Prostaglandins: Low-quality evidence from one small study suggested better walking distance.
- Gabapentin or methylcobalamin: Very low-quality evidence from single small studies suggested better walking distance.
- Epidural steroid injections: Very low-quality evidence from one study showed short-term improvements in pain, function, and quality of life for up to 2 weeks compared with home exercise or inpatient physical therapy.
- Exercise: Low-quality evidence from one study showed short-term benefits for leg pain and function compared with no treatment.
- Multimodal non-surgery care vs surgery: Low to very low-quality evidence from six trials suggested non-surgery care was less effective than surgical decompression (with or without fusion).
- Pooled data from two trials: No clear difference in function at 6 months or 1 year between surgery and non-surgery care; surgery was better at 24 months.

Outcomes measured
- Pain, ability to function, walking distance, and quality of life.

Safety
- This review focused on effectiveness; safety reporting was limited in the included trials.

Quality of the evidence
- Most evidence was low or very low quality.
- There is a lack of moderate- or high-quality evidence to guide non-surgery care.

Bottom line
- There is not enough strong evidence to recommend specific non-surgery treatments for this condition.
- Some options may offer short-term relief, but results are uncertain.
- More large, high-quality studies are needed."
82,"Background
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a distressing and common neurological disorder that may have a huge impact in the quality of life of those with frequent and intense symptoms. Patients complain of unpleasant sensations in the legs, at or before bedtime, and feel an urge to move the legs, which improves with movement, such as walking. Symptoms start with the patient at rest (e.g. sitting or lying down), and follow a circadian pattern, increasing during the evening or at night. Many pharmacological intervention are available for RLS, including drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease (L‐Dopa and dopaminergic agonists), epilepsy (anticonvulsants), anxiety (benzodiazepines), and pain (opioids). Dopaminergic drugs are those most frequently used for treatment of RLS, but some patients do not respond effectively and require other medication. Opioids, a class of medications used to treat severe pain, seem to be effective in treating RLS symptoms, and are recommended for patients with severe symptoms, because RLS and pain appear to share the same mechanism in the central nervous system. All available drugs are associated to some degree with side effects, which can impede treatment. Opioids are associated with adverse events such as constipation, tolerance, and dependence. This justifies the conduct of a systematic review to ascertain whether opioids are safe and effective for treatment of RLS. 
Objectives
To asses the effects of opioids compared to placebo treatment for restless legs syndrome in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials, CENTRAL 2016, issue 4 and MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS up to April 2016, using a search strategy adapted by Cochraneto identify randomised clinical trials. We checked the references of each study and established personal communication with other authors to identify any additional studies. We considered publications in all languages. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled clinical trials of opioid treatment in adults with idiopathic RLS. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened articles, independently extracted data into a standard form, and assessed for risk of bias. If necessary, they discussed discrepancies with a third researcher to resolve any doubts. 
Main results
We included one randomised clinical trial (N = 304 randomised; 204 completed; 276 analysed) that evaluated opioids (prolonged release oxycodone/naloxone) versus placebo. After 12 weeks, RSL symptoms had improved more in the drug group than in the placebo group (using the IRLSSS: MD ‐7.0; 95% CI ‐9.69 to ‐4.31 and the CGI: MD ‐1.11; 95% CI ‐1.49 to ‐0.73). More patients in the drug group than in the placebo group were drug responders (using the IRLSSS: RR 1.82; 95% CI 1.37 to 2.42 and the CGI: RR1.92; 95% ICI 1.49 to 2.48). The proportion of remitters was greater in the drug group than in the placebo group (using the IRLSSS: RR 2.14; 95% CI 1.45 to 3.16). Quality of life scores also improved more in the drug group than in the placebo group (MD ‐0.73; 95% CI ‐1.1 to ‐0.36). Quality of sleep was improved more in the drug group measured by sleep adequacy (MD ‐0.74; 95% CI ‐1.15 to ‐0.33), and sleep quantity (MD 0.89; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.26). 
There was no difference between groups for daytime somnolence, trouble staying awake during the day, or naps during the day. More adverse events were reported in the drug group (RR 1.22; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.39). The major adverse events were gastrointestinal problems, fatigue, and headache. 
Authors' conclusions
Opioids seem to be effective for treating RLS symptoms, but there are no definitive data regarding the important problem of safety. This conclusion is based on only one study with a high dropout rate (low quality evidence).","Opiods for restless legs syndrome
Background 
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a very common neurological disorder in which patients complain of an intense need to move their legs, and unpleasant sensations felt deep in their legs, all occurring while at rest, mostly at bedtime. The number of patients complaining of RLS varies according to race, gender, age, country, and health status. About 5% to 10% of people are affected; , and, among these, 2% to 5% need continual pharmacological treatment (medication). When RLS does not respond to medications generally used for Parkinsons Disease and epilepsy, their doctors often prescribe opioids. 
Question 
Are opioids effective and safe for people with RLS?
Methods 
We searched the literature for studies in any language, published or not, that considered opioids for the treatment of RLS 
Results 
We included one randomised controlled clinical trial with moderate risk of bias that tested a combination of oxycodone and naloxone against placebo capsules, taken twice daily in participants whodid not respond to more usual medications. Researchers used the International RLS severity scale to find out if patients were improved after 12 weeks of treatment. Particpants receiving the combined oxycodone and naloxone reported improvement in RLS symptoms, Quality of life, and sleep quality; 42% of the drug group were symptom‐free. 
Discussion 
The study was well designed overall, but was at a high risk of bias due to the high percentage of participants who withdrew from treatment (attrition bias). Eighty‐four percent of the drug group developed adverse events, which were mostly related to the gastrointestinal system, headache, fatigue, and sleepiness (somnolence); 9.8% left the study because of the adverse events. 
Conclusion 
The use of opioids for the treatment of RLS in patients resistant to conventional treatment is supported by low‐quality evidence. Prescription of these medications should be based on clinical experience, and caution used due to the potential for abuse, dependency, and adverse events. No patient on opioids complained that their symptoms worsened.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Opioid Medications for Restless Legs Syndrome

## What is the health issue?
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) causes uncomfortable feelings in the legs, especially during rest or at bedtime. People with RLS feel a strong need to move their legs to get relief. Walking or moving helps, but symptoms get worse in the evening and at night. This condition can make it hard to sleep and affects daily life.

## What treatments are available?
Doctors use several types of medications to treat RLS, including drugs normally used for other conditions like Parkinson's disease, seizures, anxiety, and pain. Opioids are strong pain medications that may help with RLS symptoms. Doctors sometimes prescribe them for people with severe RLS.

## What did researchers want to find out?
Researchers wanted to know if opioid medications work better than inactive pills (placebo) for treating RLS in adults, and whether they are safe to use.

## What did they find?
Researchers found only one study that met their standards. This study included 304 adults with RLS who were randomly assigned to take either an opioid medication (oxycodone/naloxone) or a placebo for 12 weeks.

**Results after 12 weeks:**
- People taking the opioid had greater improvement in RLS symptoms
- More people in the opioid group responded well to treatment
- Sleep quality improved more in the opioid group
- Quality of life improved more in the opioid group
- Side effects were more common in the opioid group, mainly stomach problems, tiredness, and headaches

## What does this mean?
Opioids may help reduce RLS symptoms and improve sleep and quality of life. However, this conclusion is based on only one study, and many participants dropped out before finishing. The researchers could not fully determine if opioids are safe for long-term use. More research is needed to better understand the benefits and risks of using opioids for RLS.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

Purpose

83,"Background
Antenatal day care units have been widely used as an alternative to inpatient care for women with pregnancy complications including mild and moderate hypertension, and preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes. 
Objectives
The objective of this review is to compare day care units with routine care or hospital admission for women with pregnancy complications in terms of maternal and perinatal outcomes, length of hospital stay, acceptability, and costs to women and health services providers. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (February 2009). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing day care with inpatient or routine care for women with complicated pregnancy. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently carried out data extraction and assessed studies for risk of bias. 
Main results
Three trials with a total of 504 women were included. For most outcomes it was not possible to pool results from trials in meta‐analyses as outcomes were measured in different ways. 
Compared with women in the ward/routine care group, women attending day care units were less likely to be admitted to hospital overnight (risk ratio 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.34 to 0.62). The average length of antenatal admission was shorter for women attending for day care, although outpatient attendances were increased for this group. There was evidence from one study that women attending for day care were significantly less likely to undergo induction of labour, but mode of birth was similar for women in both groups. For other outcomes there were no significant differences between groups.The evidence regarding the costs of different types of care was mixed; while the length of antenatal hospital stays were reduced, this did not necessarily translate into reduced health service costs. 
While most women tended to be satisfied with whatever care they received, women preferred day care compared with hospital admission. 
Authors' conclusions
Small studies suggest that there are no major differences in clinical outcomes for mothers or babies between antenatal day units or hospital admission, but women may prefer day care.","Antenatal day care units versus hospital admission for women with pregnancy complications
Many women experience complications during pregnancy such as high blood pressure, threatened early labour or abnormal and heavy bleeding (haemorrhage). Admission to hospital may be necessary but can be disruptive to the mother and her family. Often tests and monitoring are needed so that the condition of the mother and baby can be assessed and treatment can be provided. Sometimes this care can be given in day care units to avoid the need for an overnight stay in hospital. The review compares day care units with hospital admission or routine care. Three trials, involving 504 pregnant women with high blood pressure or preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes, were included in the review. The findings were that women receiving day care had to make more visits to hospital as outpatients but were less likely to stay in hospital overnight. Care in day units did not seem to affect other outcomes for mothers and babies or increase or reduce interventions in labour; although women in one trial were less likely to have their labours induced if they received day care. Two studies provided evidence that women preferred day care to hospital admission and no women expressed a preference for more inpatient care; most women in both groups felt they had received good care and were satisfied with it. 
The aim of antenatal care is to reduce adverse outcomes for mothers and babies but these are relatively infrequent and could not be investigated in this review. A proportion of women attending for day care require subsequent inpatient care, and a range of non‐medical considerations such as travelling distance to emergency facilities, social factors and women's emotional wellbeing may lead to admission to hospital. All studies included in the review were carried out as part of evaluations of new services.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Day Care vs. Hospital Stays for Pregnant Women with Complications

## What was this study about?

Researchers wanted to find out if pregnant women with certain complications could safely attend a day care unit instead of staying overnight in the hospital. Day care units allow women to come in during the day for monitoring and treatment, then return home at night.

## Who was studied?

This review looked at 504 pregnant women who had complications during pregnancy, such as:
- Mild to moderate high blood pressure
- Early water breaking before labor

## What was compared?

Researchers compared two types of care:
- **Day care units**: Women visited during the day for monitoring and went home at night
- **Hospital stays**: Women were admitted overnight or received standard hospital care

## What were the main findings?

**Hospital stays:**
- Women using day care were less likely to need overnight hospital stays
- When hospital stays were needed, they were shorter for the day care group
- However, women in day care had more outpatient visits

**Labor and delivery:**
- One study found women in day care were less likely to need labor induction
- The method of delivery (vaginal or cesarean) was similar for both groups

**Safety:**
- No major differences were found in health outcomes for mothers or babies between the two types of care

**Cost:**
- Results were mixed—shorter hospital stays didn't always mean lower overall costs

**Satisfaction:**
- Most women were satisfied with whichever care they received
- Women generally preferred day care over hospital admission

## What does this mean?

For pregnant women with certain complications, day care units appear to be a safe alternative to hospital stays, with no major differences in health outcomes. Women may prefer this option because they can return home at night.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What was studied
- Care for pregnant women with some complications, such as mild to moderate high blood pressure or waters breaking early.
- Comparing two types of care: going to an antenatal day care unit versus being admitted to the hospital or getting routine ward care.

Who was in the studies
- 3 randomized trials with a total of 504 pregnant women.

How the research was done
- Researchers looked for trials in February 2009.
- They compared results on mothers and babies, hospital use, costs, and how women felt about their care.

What they found
- Hospital nights: Women in day care were less likely to stay in the hospital overnight.
- Length of stay: Antenatal hospital stays were shorter with day care. However, these women had more outpatient visits.
- Labor and birth: In one study, women in day care were less likely to have labor induced. The way babies were born (vaginal or cesarean) was similar between groups.
- Health outcomes: No major differences were found for mothers or babies between the two types of care.
- Satisfaction: Most women were satisfied with their care, but more women preferred day care.

Safety
- Based on these small trials, day care and hospital admission had similar health results for mothers and babies.

Costs
- Results were mixed. Shorter hospital stays with day care did not always lower total health service costs.

What this means
- For some pregnancy complications, antenatal day care may be a safe alternative to hospital admission and is often preferred by women. It may reduce hospital nights but increase clinic visits. More and larger studies would help confirm these findings.

Timeframe
- Evidence includes trials found up to February 2009."
84,"Background
Despite the availability of effective drug therapies that reduce low‐density lipoprotein (LDL)‐cholesterol (LDL‐C), cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains an important cause of mortality and morbidity. Therefore, additional LDL‐C reduction may be warranted, especially for people who are unresponsive to, or unable to take, existing LDL‐C‐reducing therapies. By inhibiting the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) enzyme, monoclonal antibodies (PCSK9 inhibitors) reduce LDL‐C and CVD risk. 
Objectives
Primary 
To quantify the effects of PCSK9 inhibitors on CVD, all‐cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke, compared to placebo or active treatment(s) for primary and secondary prevention. 
Secondary 
To quantify the safety of PCSK9 inhibitors, with specific focus on the incidence of influenza, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and cancer, compared to placebo or active treatment(s) for primary and secondary prevention. 
Search methods
We identified studies by systematically searching CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science in December 2019. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform in August 2020 and screened the reference lists of included studies. This is an update of the review first published in 2017. 
Selection criteria
All parallel‐group and factorial randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a follow‐up of at least 24 weeks and adult participants with or without a history of CVD were eligible if they compared PCSK9 inhibitors alirocumab or evolocumab to placebo or active treatments such as statins, ezetimibe, or a combination of these. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently reviewed and extracted data. Where data were available, we calculated pooled effect estimates. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence and in 'Summary of findings' tables. 
Main results
We included 24 studies with data on 60,997 participants. Eighteen trials randomised participants to alirocumab and six to evolocumab. All participants received background lipid‐lowering treatment or lifestyle counselling. Six alirocumab studies used  an active treatment comparison group (the remaining used placebo), compared to three evolocumab active comparison trials. Follow‐up ranged from 6 to 36 months for the comparisons with placebo and from 6 to 12 months for comparisons with active treatment. Most of the available studies preferentially enrolled people with either established CVD or at a high risk already, and evidence in low‐ to medium‐risk settings is minimal. 
Alirocumab compared with placebo decreased the risk of CVD events, with an absolute risk difference (RD) of –2% (odds ratio (OR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 0.94; 10 studies, 23,868 participants; high‐certainty evidence), decreased the risk of mortality (RD –1%; OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.96; 12 studies, 24,797 participants; high‐certainty evidence), and MI (RD –2%; OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.94; 9 studies, 23,352 participants; high‐certainty evidence) and for any stroke (RD 0%; OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.91; 8 studies, 22,835 participants; high‐certainty evidence). 
Alirocumab compared with ezetimibe and statins: for CVD, the RD was 1% (OR 1.37, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.87; 3 studies, 1379 participants; low‐certainty evidence); for mortality, RD was –1% (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.40; 5 studies, 1333 participants; low‐certainty evidence); for MI, RD was 1% (OR 1.45, 95% CI 0.64 to 3.28, 5 studies, 1734 participants; low‐certainty evidence); and for any stroke, RD was less than 1% (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.13 to 5.61; 5 studies, 1734 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Evolocumab compared with placebo: for CVD, the RD was –2% (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.91; 3 studies, 29,432 participants; high‐certainty evidence); for mortality, RD was less than 1% (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.19; 3 studies, 29,432 participants; high‐certainty evidence); for MI, RD was –1% (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.82; 3 studies, 29,432 participants; high‐certainty evidence); and for any stroke RD was less than –1% (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.94; 2 studies, 28,531 participants; high‐certainty evidence).  
Evolocumab compared with ezetimibe and statins: for any CVD event RD was less than –1% (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.14 to 3.04; 1 study, 218 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); for all‐cause mortality, the RD was less than 1% (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.30; 3 studies, 5223 participants; very low‐certainty evidence); and for MI, RD was less than 1% (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.85; 3 studies, 5003 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). There were insufficient data on any stroke.  
Authors' conclusions
The evidence for the clinical endpoint effects of  evolocumab and alirocumab versus placebo were graded as high. There is a strong evidence base for the benefits of PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies to people who might not be eligible for other lipid‐lowering drugs, or to people who cannot meet their lipid goals on more traditional therapies, which was the main patient population of the available trials.  
The evidence base of PCSK9 inhibitors compared with ezetimibe and statins is much weaker (low very‐ to low‐certainty evidence) and it is unclear whether evolocumab or alirocumab might be effectively used as replacement therapies.  
Finally, there is very limited evidence on any potential safety issues of both evolocumab and alirocumab. While the current evidence synthesis does not reveal any adverse signals, neither does it provide evidence against such signals. This suggests careful consideration of alternative lipid lowering treatments before prescribing PCSK9 inhibitors.","PCSK9 inhibitors for prevention of cardiovascular disease
Research question 
What is the effectiveness and safety of PCSK9 inhibitors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention? 
Background 
Despite the availability of effective medicines (such as statins (which works by blocking a substance your body needs to make cholesterol) or ezetimibe (which stops your body taking in cholesterol from food), or both) that reduce low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL‐C) (sometimes called 'bad' cholesterol), CVD remains an important cause of death and illness. Additional LDL‐C reduction may be needed, especially for people who are unresponsive to, or are unable to use, existing LDL‐C‐reducing therapies. Medicines called PCSK9 inhibitors are another way of lowering LDL‐C and CVD risk. 
Study characteristics 
Review authors identified 23 studies that evaluated the effects of the PCSK9 inhibitors, alirocumab and evolocumab, in people at high risk of CVD. Studies were conducted in outpatient clinics. Review authors identified the studies included in this review through electronic literature searches conducted up to December 2019. This is an update of the review first published in 2017. 
Key results 
Both alirocumab and evolocumab decreased the risk of CVD when added to other LDL‐C‐lowering medicines (e.g. statins or ezetimibe). Alirocumab additionally showed a decrease in death from any cause; with insufficient evidence for evolocumab. Limited data, often of lower quality, was available comparing these PCSK9 inhibitors against other LDL‐C‐lowering drugs. Differences in risk between people treated with and without PCSK9 inhibitors suggest the absolute treatment benefit will likely be modest (e.g. less than 1% change in risk). 
Quality of evidence 
We found high‐quality evidence when adding PCSK9 inhibitors to existing LDL‐C‐lowering treatments and low‐ to very low‐quality evidence when replacing existing LDL‐C‐reducing medicines with PCSK9 inhibitors.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: PCSK9 Inhibitor Medications for Heart Health

## What was studied?
Researchers reviewed studies on two newer cholesterol-lowering medications called PCSK9 inhibitors (alirocumab and evolocumab). These drugs work differently than older cholesterol medications like statins. The review looked at whether these drugs help prevent heart attacks, strokes, and death in adults.

## Who was studied?
The review included 60,997 adults from 24 studies. Most participants already had heart disease or were at high risk for heart problems. All participants were also taking other cholesterol-lowering treatments or following lifestyle advice. There was limited information about people at lower risk for heart disease.

## What did participants receive?
Participants received either:
- A PCSK9 inhibitor (alirocumab or evolocumab)
- A placebo (inactive treatment)
- Other cholesterol medications (statins or ezetimibe)

Studies lasted between 6 months and 3 years.

## What were the main findings?

**Compared to placebo:**
- Both PCSK9 inhibitors reduced the risk of heart disease events by about 2%
- Alirocumab reduced the risk of death by 1%
- Both drugs reduced heart attacks by 1-2%
- Both drugs reduced strokes

**Compared to other cholesterol medications:**
- Results were less clear due to limited data
- It's uncertain whether PCSK9 inhibitors work better than or could replace other cholesterol medications

## What about safety?
The review found no clear safety concerns with these medications, but there wasn't enough long-term data to rule out potential problems.

## What does this mean?
PCSK9 inhibitors may help people who cannot take other cholesterol medications or whose cholesterol remains high despite other treatments. However, more research is needed before recommending them as replacements for existing cholesterol medications.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What was the goal?
- To find out if PCSK9 inhibitor medicines (alirocumab and evolocumab) lower the chance of heart and blood vessel problems and death.
- To check their safety compared to placebo or other cholesterol-lowering drugs (statins and ezetimibe).

Who was studied?
- 24 randomized trials with 60,997 adults.
- Most people had heart disease already or were at high risk.
- Evidence in people at low or medium risk was limited.

What treatments were tested?
- PCSK9 inhibitors: alirocumab or evolocumab (injections).
- Compared to placebo or to statins/ezetimibe.
- Everyone also got usual care like lifestyle advice and often other cholesterol medicines.

How long did studies last?
- 6 to 36 months with placebo comparisons.
- 6 to 12 months with active drug comparisons.
- Studies were found up to August 2020.

What outcomes were measured?
- Heart and blood vessel problems (like heart attack and stroke).
- Death from any cause.
- Safety issues, including flu, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and cancer.

Main findings

Alirocumab vs placebo (high-certainty evidence):
- Fewer cardiovascular events (about 2% fewer).
- Fewer deaths (about 1% fewer).
- Fewer heart attacks (about 2% fewer).
- Fewer strokes (small reduction).

Evolocumab vs placebo (high-certainty evidence):
- Fewer cardiovascular events (about 2% fewer).
- Heart attacks: fewer (about 1% fewer).
- Strokes: fewer (small reduction).
- Deaths: no clear difference.

PCSK9 inhibitors vs statins/ezetimibe:
- Evidence was weak or very limited.
- It is unclear if PCSK9 inhibitors work better than these standard drugs when used instead of them.

Safety
- No clear safety problems were found in the available data.
- Evidence on side effects (flu, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, cancer) was limited, so risks are uncertain.

What does this mean?
- For people who cannot take enough standard cholesterol medicines or still have high LDL (“bad”) cholesterol, PCSK9 inhibitors can lower heart events, heart attacks, and strokes compared to placebo.
- It is not clear if they should replace statins or ezetimibe.
- Because long-term safety evidence is limited, doctors should weigh other options before prescribing these drugs."
85,"Background
Most cancer survivors receive follow‐up care after completion of treatment with the primary aim of detecting recurrence. Traditional follow‐up consisting of fixed visits to a cancer specialist for examinations and tests are expensive and may be burdensome for the patient. Follow‐up strategies involving non‐specialist care providers, different intensity of procedures, or addition of survivorship care packages have been developed and tested, however their effectiveness remains unclear. 
Objectives
The objective of this review is to compare the effect of different follow‐up strategies in adult cancer survivors, following completion of primary cancer treatment, on the primary outcomes of overall survival and time to detection of recurrence. Secondary outcomes are health‐related quality of life, anxiety (including fear of recurrence), depression and cost. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases and two trials registries on 11 December 2018 together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised trials comparing different follow‐up strategies for adult cancer survivors following completion of curatively‐intended primary cancer treatment, which included at least one of the outcomes listed above. We compared the effectiveness of: 1) non‐specialist‐led follow‐up (i.e. general practitioner (GP)‐led, nurse‐led, patient‐initiated or shared care) versus specialist‐led follow‐up; 2) less intensive versus more intensive follow‐up (based on clinical visits, examinations and diagnostic procedures) and 3) follow‐up integrating additional care components relevant for detection of recurrence (e.g. patient symptom education or monitoring, or survivorship care plans) versus usual care. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological guidelines by Cochrane and Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. For each comparison, we present synthesised findings for overall survival and time to detection of recurrence as hazard ratios (HR) and for health‐related quality of life, anxiety and depression as mean differences (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). When meta‐analysis was not possible, we reported the results from individual studies. For survival and recurrence, we used meta‐regression analysis where possible to investigate whether the effects varied with regards to cancer site, publication year and study quality. 
Main results
We included 53 trials involving 20,832 participants across 12 cancer sites and 15 countries, mainly in Europe, North America and Australia. All the studies were carried out in either a hospital or general practice setting. Seventeen studies compared non‐specialist‐led follow‐up with specialist‐led follow‐up, 24 studies compared intensity of follow‐up and 12 studies compared patient symptom education or monitoring, or survivorship care plans with usual care. Risk of bias was generally low or unclear in most of the studies, with a higher risk of bias in the smaller trials. 
Non‐specialist‐led follow‐up compared with specialist‐led follow‐up 
It is uncertain how this strategy affects overall survival (HR 1.21, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.15; 2 studies; 603 participants), time to detection of recurrence (4 studies, 1691 participants) or cost (8 studies, 1756 participants) because the certainty of the evidence is very low. 
Non‐specialist‐ versus specialist‐led follow up may make little or no difference to health‐related quality of life at 12 months (MD 1.06, 95% CI −1.83 to 3.95; 4 studies; 605 participants; low‐certainty evidence); and probably makes little or no difference to anxiety at 12 months (MD −0.03, 95% CI −0.73 to 0.67; 5 studies; 1266 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). We are more certain that it has little or no effect on depression at 12 months (MD 0.03, 95% CI −0.35 to 0.42; 5 studies; 1266 participants; high‐certainty evidence). 
Less intensive follow‐up compared with more intensive follow‐up 
Less intensive versus more intensive follow‐up may make little or no difference to overall survival (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.14; 13 studies; 10,726 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and probably increases time to detection of recurrence (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.92; 12 studies; 11,276 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Meta‐regression analysis showed little or no difference in the intervention effects by cancer site, publication year or study quality. 
It is uncertain whether this strategy has an effect on health‐related quality of life (3 studies, 2742 participants), anxiety (1 study, 180 participants) or cost (6 studies, 1412 participants) because the certainty of evidence is very low. None of the studies reported on depression. 
Follow‐up strategies integrating additional patient symptom education or monitoring, or survivorship care plans compared with usual care: 
None of the studies reported on overall survival or time to detection of recurrence.
It is uncertain whether this strategy makes a difference to health‐related quality of life (12 studies, 2846 participants), anxiety (1 study, 470 participants), depression (8 studies, 2351 participants) or cost (1 studies, 408 participants), as the certainty of evidence is very low. 
Authors' conclusions
Evidence regarding the effectiveness of the different follow‐up strategies varies substantially. Less intensive follow‐up may make little or no difference to overall survival but probably delays detection of recurrence. However, as we did not analyse the two outcomes together, we cannot make direct conclusions about the effect of interventions on survival after detection of recurrence. The effects of non‐specialist‐led follow‐up on survival and detection of recurrence, and how intensity of follow‐up affects health‐related quality of life, anxiety and depression, are uncertain. There was little evidence for the effects of follow‐up integrating additional patient symptom education/monitoring and survivorship care plans.","Follow‐up strategies after completion of primary cancer treatment
What is the aim of this review? 
In this Cochrane Review, we aimed to find out if cancer survivors who received three different types of follow‐up care, after they were treated for their cancer, have better medical and personal outcomes. We collected and assessed all relevant studies and found 53 studies. 
Key messages 
Non‐specialist‐led follow‐up, such as follow‐up provided by a general practitioner (GP) or nurse, makes little or no difference to health‐related quality of life, anxiety or depression, when compared to specialist‐led follow‐up. We cannot be sure about its effects on overall survival and detection of a cancer returning after treatment (recurrence). 
Less intensive follow‐up, such as follow‐up with fewer examinations or tests, may make little or no difference to overall survival but probably delays detection of recurrence when compared to more intensive follow‐up. However, other types of studies are needed before we can be certain about the effects of early detection of recurrence on survival. We also cannot be sure about its effect on health‐related quality of life, anxiety and depression. 
There was little evidence for the final type of follow‐up, which integrated additional components relevant for detection of recurrence, such as patient symptom education or monitoring, or survivorship care plans. 
What was studied in the review? 
After being treated for cancer, most patients receive follow‐up care to look for signs of recurrence. If the cancer returns, it is thought to be better to detect it earlier, as it allows earlier treatment, which is expected to improve survival for the patient. Traditional follow‐up involving fixed visits to a cancer specialist in a hospital setting for examinations and tests can be expensive and burdensome for the patient. Newer follow‐up strategies involving non‐specialist care providers, different intensity of examinations, or the addition of survivorship care plans have been developed and tested but their effectiveness remains unclear. 
The aim of our review was to find out if three types of aftercare increased survival, decreased the time until recurrence is detected, and improved patient outcomes such as health‐related quality of life, anxiety and depression, as well as cost. The types of aftercare were: 1) non‐specialist‐led (e.g. GP‐led, nurse‐led, patient‐initiated or shared care) versus specialist‐led follow‐up; 2) less intensive versus more intensive follow‐up (based on frequency or intensity of clinical visits, examinations or diagnostic procedures); and 3) follow‐up integrating additional care components relevant for detection of recurrence (e.g. patient symptom education or monitoring, or survivorship care plans) versus usual care. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We analysed 53 studies, involving 20,832 participants with 12 types of cancer in 15 different countries, mainly in Europe, North America and Australia. All the studies were carried out in either a hospital or general practice setting. 
When cancer survivors receive aftercare led by non‐specialists, such as GPs and nurses:  
‐ We are not sure if overall survival is affected or if cancer recurrence is detected earlier; 
‐ It probably makes little or no difference to health‐related quality of life and anxiety and it makes no difference for depression at 12 months of follow‐up; 
‐ We are not sure there is a difference in costs between these two types of follow‐up strategies. 
When cancer survivors receive less intensive aftercare, such as fewer examinations and tests:  
‐ It may make little or no difference to overall survival but it probably delays detection of recurrence; 
‐ We are not sure if makes a difference to health‐related quality of life, anxiety and costs. We did not find any studies assessing depression. 
When cancer survivors receive aftercare with additional education about their symptoms or survivorship care plans:  
‐ We are not sure about how this type of aftercare improves health‐related quality of life, anxiety or depression, or if increases the costs of care. We did not find any studies that assessed overall survival or if cancer recurrence is detected earlier. 
How up to date is this review? 
We reviewed studies that had been published up to 11 December 2018.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Different Ways to Follow Up with Cancer Survivors After Treatment

## What was this review about?

After cancer treatment ends, patients typically have regular follow-up appointments to check if the cancer comes back. Researchers reviewed studies to see if different ways of doing these follow-ups work just as well as traditional appointments with cancer specialists.

## What did the researchers look at?

They examined 53 studies involving over 20,000 cancer survivors from 15 countries. The studies tested three different approaches:

1. **Who provides the follow-up care**: Having a regular doctor, nurse, or the patient themselves manage follow-up instead of a cancer specialist
2. **How often appointments happen**: Fewer visits and tests versus more frequent visits and tests
3. **Extra support added to follow-up**: Adding things like teaching patients about symptoms to watch for or providing care plans

## What did they find?

**When regular doctors or nurses provided follow-up instead of specialists:**
- The effect on survival and detecting cancer recurrence is unclear
- Quality of life, anxiety, and depression were similar between both approaches

**When patients had fewer appointments and tests:**
- Survival rates appeared similar
- Cancer recurrence was detected slightly later (but we don't know if this affected survival)
- Effects on quality of life and anxiety are unclear

**When extra support was added to follow-up:**
- Not enough clear evidence to know if this helps

## What does this mean?

Less intensive follow-up may not affect survival, though cancer might be found slightly later if it returns. More research is needed to understand which follow-up approaches work best for cancer survivors.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of a research review on cancer follow-up care

What was the goal?
- To compare different ways to provide follow-up care to adults after finishing main cancer treatment.
- Main outcomes: overall survival and how quickly a return of cancer is found.
- Other outcomes: quality of life, anxiety (including fear of cancer returning), depression, and cost.

Who was included?
- 53 randomized studies with 20,832 adults.
- Across 12 cancer types and 15 countries.
- Studies were done in hospitals or general practice clinics.
- Searches were done up to December 11, 2018.

What types of follow-up were compared?
1) Non-specialist-led care (by a GP, nurse, shared care, or patient-initiated) vs specialist-led care.
2) Less intensive vs more intensive follow-up (fewer vs more visits/tests).
3) Extra support added to usual care (patient symptom education or monitoring, or survivorship care plans) vs usual care.

Main findings

1) Non-specialist-led vs specialist-led
- Survival: Uncertain (evidence very limited).
- Time to find a return of cancer: Uncertain.
- Quality of life at 12 months: Likely similar.
- Anxiety at 12 months: Probably similar.
- Depression at 12 months: Similar.
- Cost: Uncertain.

2) Less intensive vs more intensive
- Survival: May be similar.
- Time to find a return of cancer: Probably slower with less intensive care (recurrence found later).
- Quality of life, anxiety, cost: Uncertain.
- Depression: Not reported.

3) Extra education/monitoring or survivorship care plans vs usual care
- Survival and time to find a return of cancer: Not reported.
- Quality of life, anxiety, depression, cost: Uncertain.

Timing
- Several studies reported mental health and quality of life at about 12 months after starting the follow-up plan.

Safety or harms
- The review did not report on medical harms or safety issues related to the follow-up strategies.

What does this mean?
- Using fewer visits/tests may not change survival but may delay finding a return of cancer.
- Having follow-up led by non-specialists (like GPs or nurses) appears similar to specialist-led care for quality of life, anxiety, and depression at 12 months, but effects on survival and detection timing are unclear.
- Adding education/monitoring or survivorship care plans needs more and better research to show clear benefits.

Limits
- Evidence quality ranged from high to very low, and many results are uncertain.
- Not all studies reported on all outcomes."
86,"Background
Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a common cause of neurodegenerative dementia of old age. Its accurate recognition can be important in clinical management and is essential for the development of disease‐modifying treatments. The current clinical diagnostic criteria are limited particularly by relatively poor sensitivity. Dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging using single‐photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is the most highly developed supplementary test for DLB, and is now incorporated as a suggestive feature in the consensus diagnostic criteria. However, there is uncertainty about its accuracy and its place in clinical practice. It is most commonly used in people who are already suspected of having DLB. 
Objectives
We had two objectives in this review: (A) to estimate the accuracy of DAT imaging for the diagnosis of DLB in people with dementia in secondary care (specialist dementia services), and (B) to estimate the accuracy of DAT imaging for the diagnosis of DLB in people with dementia in secondary care who are already suspected of having DLB on the basis of a prior clinical work‐up. 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE (1946 to February 2013), Embase (1980 to February 2013), BIOSIS Previews (1926 to February 2013), PsycINFO (1806 to February 2013), CINAHL (1982 to February 2013), LILACS (February 2013) and Web of Science and Conference Proceedings (ISI Web of Science) (1945 to February 2013). Several of these sources contain conference abstracts. We also searched four specialised databases containing diagnostic reviews: Meta‐analyses van Diagnostisch Onderzoek (MEDION; February 2013), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE; February 2013), Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA; February 2013), and Aggressive Research Intelligence Facility (ARIF; February 2013). We checked reference lists of relevant studies and reviews for potential additional studies. Terms for electronic database searching were devised in conjunction with the team at the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group. 
Selection criteria
Study design: We included test accuracy studies with delayed verification, diagnostic case‐control studies, and two‐gate studies with alternative diagnosis controls. Participants: (A) participants with dementia in secondary care, (B) participants in secondary care meeting consensus clinical criteria (other than the DAT imaging criterion) for possible or probable DLB, or both. Index test: SPECT or positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of brain dopamine transporters. Reference standard: Neuropathological diagnosis at autopsy. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. We extracted results into a 2x2 table, showing the binary test results cross‐classified with the binary reference standard. We used this data to calculate sensitivities, specificities, and their 95% confidence intervals. We used the QUADAS‐2 tool plus some additional items to assess methodological quality. 
Main results
We included one study that was applicable to our first objective (A). It reported data on 22 participants who met consensus clinical criteria for DLB or National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS‐ADRDA) criteria for Alzheimer's disease, or both (a two‐gate design with alternative diagnosis controls). The index test was SPECT scanning using the ligand 123I‐FP‐CIT. We considered the study to be at high risk of bias in the participant selection and index test domains (QUADAS‐2). 123I‐FP‐CIT SPECT analysed semiquantitatively had a sensitivity of 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 1.00) and a specificity of 0.92 (95% CI 0.64 to 1.00) for the diagnosis of DLB (n = 22, 1 study). Analysed visually, the sensitivity was 0.86 (95% CI 0.42 to 1.00) and the specificity was 0.83 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.98) (n = 19, 1 study). 
We considered that the study also provided the best available data to address our second objective (B). At baseline, 15 participants were clinically suspected of having DLB. In this group, 123I‐FP‐CIT SPECT scanning analysed semiquantitatively had a sensitivity of 1.00 (95% CI 0.63 to 1.00) and a specificity of 1.00 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.00) for the diagnosis of DLB (n = 15, 1 study). Analysed visually, accuracy in this group was lower with a sensitivity of 0.83 (95% CI 0.36 to 1.00) and a specificity of 0.71 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.96) (n = 13, 1 study). 
Authors' conclusions
Only one study has used a neuropathological reference standard to assess the accuracy of DAT imaging for the diagnosis of DLB. The small size of the included study means that sensitivity and specificity estimates are imprecise. However, data from this study suggest that DAT imaging is more accurate than clinical diagnosis. Clinical diagnosis is therefore unsuitable to use as a reference standard for assessing the accuracy of DAT imaging. 
No studies using a neuropathological reference standard have directly addressed the common clinical scenario where the use of DAT imaging is considered as a diagnostic test in a person with possible DLB, or assessed the accuracy of DAT imaging in people with mild dementia. However, the data from the included study suggest that, where there is moderately severe dementia and a strong pre‐existing suspicion of DLB (probable DLB), then a normal (123)I‐FP‐CIT SPECT scan may be an accurate means of excluding the diagnosis. 
Semiquantitative ratings of 123I‐FP‐CIT SPECT scans appeared to be more accurate than visual ratings in all analyses.","Dopamine transporter imaging for the diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies
Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is one of the more common causes of dementia in old age. At present, it is diagnosed on the basis of the presence of characteristic symptoms, of which the most important are visual hallucinations, fluctuations in cognition, and Parkinsonism (movement symptoms like those seen in Parkinson's disease). However, many people who have DLB do not have all of these symptoms, and it can be hard to distinguish from other causes of dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is important to diagnose it accurately because people with DLB can have particularly severe side effects if given antipsychotic medication and, in the long term, so that treatments can be improved. Diagnosis of DLB using clinical symptoms alone has proven in some studies not to be very sensitive, that is cases of DLB are often missed. 
People with DLB have reduced levels of the dopamine transporter protein (DAT) in a part of the brain known as the corpus striatum. It is possible, using tracers that bind to the dopamine transporter, to identify this reduction on certain brain scans (PET or SPECT scans). This is known as DAT imaging. It has been suggested that DAT imaging may help in the accurate diagnosis of DLB. In this review, we aimed to assess how accurately DAT imaging can identify DLB among all people with dementia seen in specialist dementia services (secondary care). Because DAT scans are expensive, they are usually used in people in whom a doctor already suspects the presence of DLB, so we also aimed to see how accurately DAT imaging identified DLB among these people. We only looked for studies in which the diagnosis was confirmed by examining the person's brain after death. 
We found only one study of 22 participants to include in the review. The participants had been selected for the study because they had been diagnosed clinically with DLB or AD. This method of recruiting participants tends to exaggerate the accuracy of a test. The participants in the study had moderately severe dementia when they had the DAT imaging. Overall, the DAT imaging correctly classified 100% of the participants who had DLB and 92% of the participants who did not have DLB at postmortem. When we looked at only the 15 participants whom the doctors thought had DLB at the start of the study, then the DAT imaging correctly classified 100% of the participants who had DLB and 100% of the participants who did not have DLB at postmortem. The small size of the included study meant that we could not be very confident in these estimates of accuracy, and it is still possible that the test is considerably less accurate than this would suggest. We can conclude that DAT imaging is a promising test for diagnosing DLB, but it is important to note that we did not find any studies of participants in whom diagnosis may be more difficult, such as those with only mild dementia or those who have only one symptom to raise a suspicion of DLB.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Testing for Dementia with Lewy Bodies

## What was this review about?

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a common type of memory and thinking disorder in older adults. Doctors need better ways to identify it accurately. This review looked at whether a special brain scan called DAT imaging can help diagnose DLB.

## What is DAT imaging?

DAT imaging is a brain scan that shows how much dopamine (a brain chemical) is available in certain parts of the brain. People with DLB typically have lower dopamine levels in these areas. The scan uses a small amount of radioactive material to create pictures of the brain.

## What did the researchers want to find out?

The researchers wanted to know:
1. How accurate is DAT imaging for diagnosing DLB in people with memory problems?
2. How accurate is the scan when doctors already suspect someone might have DLB?

## What did they do?

The researchers searched medical databases from 1926 through February 2013 for studies that:
- Used DAT imaging scans on people with memory problems
- Confirmed the diagnosis by examining brain tissue after death (the most accurate way to diagnose DLB)

## What did they find?

The researchers found only one study that met their requirements. This study included 22 people and used a type of DAT scan called 123I-FP-CIT SPECT.

**Results:**
- The scan correctly identified DLB in all people who had it
- The scan correctly ruled out DLB in most people who didn't have it (92% when analyzed by computer, 83% when analyzed by eye)
- Computer analysis of the scans was more accurate than visual inspection by doctors

## What does this mean?

The scan appears to be more accurate than clinical judgment alone for diagnosing DLB. However, only one small study was available, so more research is needed. The scan may be most helpful when doctors strongly suspect DLB but want to confirm or rule out the condition.

## What are the limitations?

- Only one small study was available
- The study included only 22 people
- More research is needed with larger groups of people",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the review

Purpose
- To see how accurate a brain scan called DAT imaging (SPECT using 123I‑FP‑CIT) is for finding Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) in people who already have dementia.

Who was included
- Adults with dementia seen in specialist memory clinics (secondary care).
- Some were already thought to possibly have DLB based on symptoms before the scan.

What was tested
- A SPECT scan that looks at dopamine transporters in the brain (DAT imaging).
- Two ways to read the scan: by measurement (semiquantitative) and by eye (visual).

How accuracy was checked
- The scan results done during life were compared to the diagnosis confirmed after death by brain examination (autopsy), which is the most reliable standard.

What the review found
- Only one small study met the best standard for checking accuracy.
- Total people in that study: 22.
- When measured by numbers (semiquantitative):
  - Sensitivity (correctly finding DLB): 100% (but with wide uncertainty due to small size).
  - Specificity (correctly ruling out DLB): 92%.
- When read by eye (visual):
  - Sensitivity: 86%.
  - Specificity: 83%.
- In the subgroup already suspected of DLB (15 people):
  - Semiquantitative reading: Sensitivity 100%, Specificity 100%.
  - Visual reading: Sensitivity 83%, Specificity 71%.

Key takeaways
- Based on this small study, DAT imaging may be more accurate than a clinical exam alone.
- Using numbers to rate the scan (semiquantitative) seems more accurate than visual reading.
- A normal scan may help rule out DLB in people with more severe dementia who already strongly appear to have DLB. This was suggested by one small study only.

Timelines
- The review searched studies up to February 2013.
- The included study compared scans done during life with diagnosis at autopsy later.

Safety
- This review did not report on safety or side effects of the scan.

Gaps and limits
- Only one small study used autopsy to confirm the diagnosis, so results are uncertain.
- No autopsy-based studies looked at people with mild dementia.
- More and larger studies are needed to know how well this scan works in common clinic situations."
87,"Background
Long‐acting beta‐agonists are a common second line treatment in people with asthma inadequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids. Single device inhalers combine a long‐acting beta‐agonist with an inhaled steroid delivering both drugs as a maintenance treatment regimen. This updated review compares two fixed‐dose options, fluticasone/salmeterol FP/SALand budesonide/formoterol, since this comparison represents a common therapeutic choice. 
Objectives
To assess the relative effects of fluticasone/salmeterol and budesonide/formoterol in people with asthma. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Airways Group register of trials with prespecified terms. We performed additional hand searching of manufacturers' web sites and online trial registries. Search results are current to June 2011. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised studies comparing fixed dose fluticasone/salmeterol and budesonide/formoterol in adults or children with a diagnosis of asthma. Treatment in the studies had to last for a minimum of 12 weeks. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion in the review. We combined continuous data outcomes with a mean difference (MD), and dichotomous data outcomes with an odds ratio (OR). We assessed the quality of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. 
Main results
Five studies met the review entry criteria (5537 adults). Study populations entered the studies having previously been treated with inhaled steroids and had moderate or mild airway obstruction (mean FEV1 predicted between 65% and 84% at baseline). Most of the studies assessed treatment over a period of six months. The studies were at a low risk of selection and performance/detection bias, although we could not determine whether missing data had an impact on the results. Availablility of outcome data was satisfactory. 
Primary outcomes 
The odds ratio for exacerbations requiring oral steroids was lower with fluticasone/salmeterol but did not reach statistical significance (OR 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 1.07, four studies, N = 4949). With an assumed risk with budesonide/formoterol of 106/1000 participants requiring oral steroids, treatment with fluticasone/salmeterol would lead to between 25 fewer and seven more people per 1000 experiencing a course of oral steroids. Although the odds of hospital admission was higher with fluticasone/salmeterol, this did not reach statistical significance (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.47, four studies, 4879 participants). With an assumed risk in the budesonide/formoterol of 7/1000, between three fewer and nine more people per 1000 would be hospitalised on fluticasone/salmeterol. The odds of a serious adverse event related to asthma was higher with fluticasone/salmeterol but did not differ significantly between treatments (OR 1.47, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.86, three studies, 4054 participants). With an assumed risk in the budesonide/formoterol of 7/1000, between two fewer and 13 more people per 1000 would experience a serious adverse event on fluticasone/salmeterol. 
Secondary outcomes 
Lung function outcomes, symptoms, rescue medication, composite of exacerbations leading to either emergency department visit or hospital admission, withdrawals and adverse events did not differ statistically between treatments. Assessment of quality of life was limited to two studies, both of which gave results that did not reach statistical significance. One study reported one death out of 1000 participants on fluticasone/salmeterol and no deaths in a similar number of participants treated with budesonide/formoterol. No deaths were reported in the other studies. 
Authors' conclusions
Statistical imprecision in the effect estimates for exacerbations and serious adverse events do not enable us to conclude that either therapy is superior. The uncertainty around the effect estimates justify further trials to provide more definitive conclusions; the overall quality of evidence based on GRADE recommendations for the three primary outcomes and withdrawals due to serious adverse events was moderate. We rated the quality of evidence for mortality to be low. Results for lung function outcomes showed that the drugs were sufficiently similar that further research is unlikely to change the effects. No trials were identified in the under‐12s and research in this population is a high priority. Evaluation of quality of life is a priority for future research.","Different combinations of inhaled steroids and long‐acting beta‐agonists for chronic asthma (fluticasone/salmeterol versus budesonide/formoterol) 
People with persistent asthma often require an additional treatment to regular inhaled steroids. Some preparations of long‐acting beta‐agonists are delivered in the same inhaler device as the inhaled corticosteroids. Inhaled steroids help to treat inflammation of the airway and long‐acting beta‐agonists help the airway to relax, improving symptoms and lung function. This systematic review examined randomised controlled trials comparing two commonly available combinations administered at a fixed dose through a single inhaler, fluticasone/salmeterol and budesonide/formoterol. We included five studies which recruited 5537 people. The trials were generally well designed but only recruited adults and adolescents and not children. Participants were already taking regular inhaled steroids before the studies commenced and had mild or moderate asthma based on tests of their airway. We found that the number of people who required treatment with oral steroids and admission to hospital was similar between the treatments, but due to the statistical uncertainty of this result we could not rule out important differences in favour of either drug combination. Additional trials would enable us to draw more reliable conclusions about how well these drugs work compared with each other. We also looked at serious adverse events. Again, the results did not indicate that one combination was clearly better than the other, but again these results were imprecise so we cannot be certain. However, lung function and rescue medication use were similar between the treatments. We could not assess the relative effects of these drugs on mortality because there were so few deaths which leads to statistical uncertainty; out of the five studies, one person died. Quality of life was measured in different ways in two studies and we could not determine how the treatments compared in this respect. Further studies are needed to strengthen and better explain these findings. In particular studies which assess the effects of these therapies in children and studies which measure quality of life are a priority.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Two Combination Asthma Inhalers

## What was this study about?

Researchers compared two combination inhalers used to treat asthma. Both inhalers contain two medicines in one device:
- **Fluticasone/salmeterol** (one combination)
- **Budesonide/formoterol** (another combination)

These combination inhalers are commonly prescribed when asthma isn't well controlled with steroid inhalers alone.

## Who was studied?

The review included 5 studies with 5,537 adults who had asthma. All participants:
- Were already using inhaled steroids before the study
- Had mild to moderate breathing difficulties
- Were treated for at least 12 weeks (most studies lasted 6 months)

**Note:** No studies included children under 12 years old.

## What did researchers find?

The two combination inhalers worked **similarly** in most areas:

**Asthma flare-ups and safety:**
- Need for steroid pills during flare-ups: about the same for both inhalers
- Hospital visits: about the same for both inhalers
- Serious side effects: about the same for both inhalers

**Daily asthma control:**
- Lung function tests: similar results
- Asthma symptoms: similar results
- Need for rescue inhalers: similar results
- Side effects: similar results

One death occurred in the fluticasone/salmeterol group (1 out of 1,000 people), while no deaths occurred in the budesonide/formoterol group in that study.

## What does this mean?

The researchers couldn't determine if one inhaler works better than the other. The differences between them were too small to be certain. More studies are needed to provide clearer answers, especially in children under 12.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

Purpose
- To compare two common combination inhalers for asthma: fluticasone/salmeterol and budesonide/formoterol.

Who was studied
- 5 randomized studies with 5,537 adults.
- Most had been using inhaled steroids before and had mild to moderate breathing limits.
- No studies included children under 12.

What was compared
- Fixed doses of:
  - Fluticasone/salmeterol (FP/SAL)
  - Budesonide/formoterol
- Treatment lasted at least 12 weeks; most studies ran about 6 months.

Main results
- Asthma flare-ups needing oral steroid pills: slightly fewer with fluticasone/salmeterol, but the difference was not clear or proven.
  - Example: if 106 out of 1,000 people on budesonide/formoterol need steroid pills, fluticasone/salmeterol might lead to 25 fewer to 7 more per 1,000.
- Hospital stays: slightly more with fluticasone/salmeterol, but not a clear or proven difference.
  - Example: if 7 out of 1,000 on budesonide/formoterol are hospitalized, fluticasone/salmeterol might lead to 3 fewer to 9 more per 1,000.
- Serious asthma-related problems: slightly more with fluticasone/salmeterol, but not a clear or proven difference.
  - Example: if 7 out of 1,000 on budesonide/formoterol have a serious event, fluticasone/salmeterol might lead to 2 fewer to 13 more per 1,000.
- Lung function, symptoms, rescue inhaler use, emergency visits/hospitalizations combined, stopping treatment, and general side effects: no important differences between the two treatments.
- Quality of life: measured in 2 studies; no clear difference.
- Deaths: one death reported with fluticasone/salmeterol in one study; none with budesonide/formoterol in that study; no deaths in other studies.

Safety
- Overall side effects and serious problems were similar between the two inhalers. No clear winner on safety.

Timing
- Trials lasted about 6 months.
- The search for studies was current to June 2011.

Evidence quality
- Moderate quality for the main outcomes (flare-ups, hospital stays, serious events, stopping due to serious events).
- Low quality for deaths (very few events).
- Lung function results were so similar that new studies are unlikely to change that finding.

Bottom line
- In adults, fluticasone/salmeterol and budesonide/formoterol worked similarly and had similar safety.
- We cannot conclude that one is better.
- More research is needed in children under 12 and on quality of life."
88,"Background
Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is characterised by partial or complete upper airway obstruction during sleep. Approximately 1% to 4% of children are affected by OSA, with adenotonsillar hypertrophy being the most common underlying risk factor. Surgical removal of enlarged adenoids or tonsils is the currently recommended first‐line treatment for OSA due to adenotonsillar hypertrophy. Given the perioperative risk and an estimated recurrence rate of up to 20% following surgery, there has recently been an increased interest in less invasive alternatives to adenotonsillectomy. As the enlarged adenoids and tonsils consist of hypertrophied lymphoid tissue, anti‐inflammatory drugs have been proposed as a potential non‐surgical treatment option in children with OSA. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of anti‐inflammatory drugs for the treatment of OSA in children. 
Search methods
We identified trials from searches of the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL and MEDLINE (1950 to 2019). For identification of ongoing clinical trials, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing anti‐inflammatory drugs against placebo in children between one and 16 years with objectively diagnosed OSA (apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) ≥ 1 per hour). 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently performed screening, data extraction, and quality assessment. We separately pooled results for the comparisons 'intranasal steroids' and 'montelukast' against placebo using random‐effects models. The primary outcomes for this review were AHI and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes included the respiratory disturbance index, desaturation index, respiratory arousal index, nadir arterial oxygen saturation, mean arterial oxygen saturation, avoidance of surgical treatment for OSA, clinical symptom score, tonsillar size, and adverse events. 
Main results
We included five trials with a total of 240 children aged one to 18 years with mild to moderate OSA (AHI 1 to 30 per hour). All trials were performed in specialised sleep medicine clinics at tertiary care centres. Follow‐up time ranged from six weeks to four months. 
Three RCTs (n = 137) compared intranasal steroids against placebo; two RCTs compared oral montelukast against placebo (n = 103). We excluded one trial from the meta‐analysis since the patients were not analysed as randomised. We also had concerns about selective reporting in another trial. 
We are uncertain about the difference in AHI (MD −3.18, 95% CI −8.70 to 2.35) between children receiving intranasal corticosteroids compared to placebo (2 studies, 75 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In contrast, children receiving oral montelukast had a lower AHI (MD −3.41, 95% CI −5.36 to −1.45) compared to those in the placebo group (2 studies, 103 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
We are uncertain whether the secondary outcomes are different between children receiving intranasal corticosteroids compared to placebo: desaturation index (MD −2.12, 95% CI −4.27 to 0.04; 2 studies, 75 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), respiratory arousal index (MD −0.71, 95% CI −6.25 to 4.83; 2 studies, 75 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and nadir oxygen saturation (MD 0.59%, 95% CI −1.09 to 2.27; 2 studies, 75 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Children receiving oral montelukast had a lower respiratory arousal index (MD −2.89, 95% CI −4.68 to −1.10; 2 studies, 103 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and nadir of oxygen saturation (MD 4.07, 95% CI 2.27 to 5.88; 2 studies, 103 participants; high‐certainty evidence) compared to those in the placebo group. We are uncertain, however, about the difference in desaturation index (MD −2.50, 95% CI −5.53 to 0.54; 2 studies, 103 participants; low‐certainty evidence) between the montelukast and placebo group. 
Adverse events were assessed and reported in all trials and were rare, of minor nature (e.g. nasal bleeding), and evenly distributed between study groups. 
No study examined the avoidance of surgical treatment for OSA as an outcome.
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence for the efficacy of intranasal corticosteroids for the treatment of OSA in children; they may have short‐term beneficial effects on the desaturation index and oxygen saturation in children with mild to moderate OSA but the certainty of the benefit on the primary outcome AHI, as well as the respiratory arousal index, was low due to imprecision of the estimates and heterogeneity between studies. 
Montelukast has short‐term beneficial treatment effects for OSA in otherwise healthy, non‐obese, surgically untreated children (moderate certainty for primary outcome and moderate and high certainty, respectively, for two secondary outcomes) by significantly reducing the number of apnoeas, hypopnoeas, and respiratory arousals during sleep. In addition, montelukast was well tolerated in the children studied. The clinical relevance of the observed treatment effects remains unclear, however, because minimal clinically important differences are not yet established for polysomnography‐based outcomes in children. 
Long‐term efficacy and safety data on the use of anti‐inflammatory medications for the treatment of OSA in childhood are still not available. In addition, patient‐centred outcomes like concentration ability, vigilance, or school performance have not been investigated yet. 
There are currently no RCTs on the use of other kinds of anti‐inflammatory medications for the treatment of OSA in children. 
Future RCTs should investigate sustainability of treatment effects, avoidance of surgical treatment for OSA, and long‐term safety of anti‐inflammatory medications for the treatment of OSA in children and include patient‐centred outcomes.","Anti‐inflammatory medications for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea in children
Background 
Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is the partial or complete blockage of the upper airways during sleep. It affects about 1% to 4% of children. The most common underlying reason for OSA in childhood are enlarged adenoids or tonsils. The currently recommended treatment is surgical removal of the adenoids and tonsils. Treatment with anti‐inflammatory medications is an alternative, non‐surgical treatment in milder cases of OSA. 
Review question 
The aim of this review was to evaluate the evidence on the benefits and safety of anti‐inflammatory medications for the treatment of OSA in children between one and 16 years of age. The primary outcomes of the review were the number of breathing pauses and episodes of shallow breathing per hour of sleep (apnoea/hypopnoea index, AHI) and serious unintended effects of the medication. 
Study characteristics 
We included five studies in the review. These studies each included 25 to 62 children between one and 11 years of age with mild to moderate OSA treated at specialised sleep outpatient clinics. The included studies used two different types of anti‐inflammatory medications. Seventy‐five children were randomised to receive either intranasal corticosteroid nasal spray or placebo. One hundred and three children were randomised to either montelukast tablet or placebo. 
Study funding sources 
Three studies were supported by drug manufacturers.
Key results 
We are uncertain about the difference in the number of breathing pauses, episodes of shallow breathing, episodes with a lack of blood oxygen, or sleep disruption between children receiving corticosteroid nasal spray compared to placebo (2 studies involving 75 children). 
Children receiving montelukast tablets had fewer breathing pauses, fewer episodes of shallow breathing, and less sleep disruption compared to those treated with placebo (2 studies involving 103 children). However, we are uncertain about the difference in the number of episodes with a lack of blood oxygen between the montelukast and placebo group. 
Unintended effects were assessed in all trials, but were rare and of minor nature (e.g. nosebleeds). Serious unintended effects were not reported. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the evidence for corticosteroid nasal spray for the treatment of OSA was low for the primary outcome due to the wide range of the beneficial effect with some inconsistency of the effect between the two included studies. We excluded one study from the analysis due to serious concerns about the quality of the study results. 
The evidence for the use of montelukast tablets in the treatment of OSA was of moderate certainty for the primary outcome. There were concerns about the design and conduct of one study and some inconsistency of the effect between the two included studies. 
The evidence is current to October 2019.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Anti-Inflammatory Medications for Sleep Breathing Problems in Children

## What was studied?

Researchers looked at whether anti-inflammatory medications could help children who have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) – a condition where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep because the airway becomes blocked.

## Why is this important?

About 1 to 4 out of every 100 children have OSA. The most common cause is enlarged tonsils and adenoids. Doctors usually recommend surgery to remove them, but surgery has risks and the problem can come back in up to 1 in 5 children. Researchers wanted to see if medications might work instead.

## What did they do?

The researchers reviewed 5 studies that included 240 children ages 1 to 18 years with mild to moderate sleep breathing problems. The studies tested two types of anti-inflammatory medications:
- **Nasal steroid sprays** (3 studies, 137 children)
- **Montelukast pills** (2 studies, 103 children)

Children received either the medication or a placebo (inactive treatment) for 6 weeks to 4 months. All studies took place at specialized sleep clinics.

## What did they find?

**Nasal steroid sprays:**
- Results were unclear about whether these sprays helped reduce breathing pauses during sleep
- May help with oxygen levels during sleep, but more research is needed

**Montelukast pills:**
- Reduced the number of times breathing stopped or slowed during sleep
- Reduced nighttime awakenings related to breathing problems
- Improved oxygen levels during sleep

**Safety:**
- Side effects were rare and minor (like nosebleeds) in both groups
- Both medications appeared safe during the study period

## What's still unknown?

- Whether these medications work long-term
- Whether they help children avoid surgery
- Whether they improve daily life (like concentration or school performance)
- Long-term safety beyond 4 months

## Bottom line

Montelukast may help reduce breathing problems during sleep in children with mild to moderate OSA in the short term. More research is needed to understand if nasal steroid sprays help and whether either medication provides lasting benefits.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What was studied
- Question: Do anti-inflammatory medicines help children with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) sleep better and more safely?
- Who: 240 children ages 1–18 years with mild to moderate OSA, treated in sleep clinics.
- Treatments: 
  - Intranasal steroid sprays (into the nose)
  - Oral montelukast (a daily tablet)
  - Compared to placebo (a look‑alike with no active drug)
- Time: 6 weeks to 4 months of treatment.

Main outcomes measured
- Apnea–Hypopnea Index (AHI): number of breathing pauses per hour of sleep.
- Other sleep and oxygen measures: arousals from sleep, drops in oxygen, lowest oxygen level.
- Safety: side effects and serious problems.
- Whether medicine could help children avoid surgery (not reported).

Results
- Intranasal steroid sprays:
  - Effect on AHI: unclear.
  - Other measures (oxygen levels and arousals): results mixed and uncertain.
- Montelukast tablets:
  - Lowered AHI by about 3–4 events per hour compared with placebo.
  - Fewer breathing-related arousals.
  - Higher lowest oxygen level during sleep.
- Safety:
  - Side effects were rare and mostly mild (for example, brief nosebleeds).
  - No increase in serious problems compared with placebo.

What this means
- Montelukast showed short-term benefits for sleep breathing in otherwise healthy, non‑obese children who had not had surgery.
- The benefit of nasal steroid sprays is uncertain.
- It is not known if these medicines help children avoid surgery.

Gaps and next steps
- No long-term data on benefits or safety.
- No studies yet on school performance, attention, or daytime function.
- No trials of other anti-inflammatory drugs.
- Future studies should test how long benefits last, whether surgery can be avoided, long‑term safety, and effects that matter to families."
89,"Background
Worldwide at least 100 million people are thought to have prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD). This population has a five times greater chance of suffering a recurrent cardiovascular event than people without known CVD. Secondary CVD prevention is defined as action aimed to reduce the probability of recurrence of such events. Drug interventions have been shown to be cost‐effective in reducing this risk and are recommended in international guidelines. However, adherence to recommended treatments remains sub‐optimal. In order to influence non‐adherence, there is a need to develop scalable and cost‐effective behaviour‐change interventions. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of mobile phone text messaging in patients with established arterial occlusive events on adherence to treatment, fatal and non‐fatal cardiovascular events, and adverse effects. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the Conference Proceedings Citation Index ‐ Science on Web of Science on 7 November 2016, and two clinical trial registers on 12 November 2016. We contacted authors of included studies for missing information and searched reference lists of relevant papers. We applied no language or date restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised trials with at least 50% of the participants with established arterial occlusive events. We included trials investigating interventions using short message service (SMS) or multimedia messaging service (MMS) with the aim to improve adherence to medication for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. Eligible comparators were no intervention or other modes of communication. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. In addition, we attempted to contact all authors on how the SMS were developed. 
Main results
We included seven trials (reported in 13 reports) with 1310 participants randomised. Follow‐up ranged from one month to 12 months. Due to heterogeneity in the methods, population and outcome measures, we were unable to conduct meta‐analysis on these studies. All seven studies reported on adherence, but using different methods and scales. Six out of seven trials showed a beneficial effect of mobile phone text messaging for medication adherence. Dale 2015a, reported significantly greater medication adherence score in the intervention group (Mean Difference (MD) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.97; 123 participants randomised) at six months. Khonsari 2015 reported less adherence in the control group (Relative Risk (RR) 4.09, 95% CI 1.82 to 9.18; 62 participants randomised) at eight weeks. Pandey 2014 (34 participants randomised) assessed medication adherence through self‐reported logs with 90% adherence in the intervention group compared to 70% in the control group at 12 months. Park 2014a (90 participants randomised) reported a greater increase of the medication adherence score in the control group, but also measured adherence with an event monitoring system for a number of medications with adherence levels ranging from 84.1% adherence to 86.2% in the intervention group and 79.7% to 85.7% in the control group at 30 days. Quilici 2013, reported reduced odds of non‐adherence in the intervention group (Odds Ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.86, 521 participants randomised) at 30 days. Fang 2016, reported that participants given SMS alone had reduced odds of being non‐adherent compared to telephone reminders (OR 0.40 95% CI 0.18 to 0.63; 280 patients randomised). Kamal 2015 reported higher levels of adherence in the intervention arm (adjusted MD 0.54, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.85; 200 participants randomised). 
Khonsari 2015 was the only study to report fatal cardiovascular events and only reported two events, both in the control arm. No study reported on the other primary outcomes. No study reported repetitive thumb injury or road traffic crashes or other adverse events that were related to the intervention. 
Four authors replied to our questionnaire on SMS development. No study reported examining causes of non‐adherence or provided SMS tailored to individual patient characteristics. 
The included studies were small, heterogeneous and included participants recruited directly after acute events. All studies were assessed as having high risk of bias across at least one domain. Most of the studies came from high‐income countries, with two studies conducted in an upper middle‐income country (China, Malaysia), and one study from a lower middle‐income country (Pakistan). The quality of the evidence was found to be very low. There was no obvious conflicts of interest from authors, although only two declared their funding. 
Authors' conclusions
While the results of this systematic review are promising, there is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of text message‐based interventions for adherence to medications for secondary prevention of CVD. Sufficiently powered, high‐quality randomised trials are needed, particularly in low‐ and middle‐income countries.","Text messaging to help people suffering from heart disease adhere to medications
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of text messaging on medication adherence in people with heart disease. We found seven studies including 1310 participants. 
Background 
Worldwide, at least 100 million people suffer from heart disease. While there are numerous cost‐effective treatments, the majority of these individuals are not taking the medications that they need to keep themselves from suffering more heart problems. One possible method of helping people with heart disease to take their medications is through the use of text message‐based reminders. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to November 2016. We found seven studies that compared using text messages to not using text messages, with follow‐up ranging from one month to 12 months. 
Key results 
While the results of these studies appear promising that text messages can help people take their medicines, the studies were small and utilised very different methods and definitions. For that reason, we were not able to compile the findings of the studies. Most of the studies came from high‐income countries, and were primarily conducted on men. No studies reported any bad side effects from using text messages. There was no obvious conflicts of interest from authors, although only two declared their funding. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence from these studies was very low. Additional high‐quality studies on the use of text messages for encouraging people suffering from heart disease to take their medication regularly are needed, particularly in low‐ and middle‐income countries.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Text Messages to Help Heart Patients Take Their Medications

## What was this study about?

Researchers wanted to find out if sending text messages to people's phones could help them remember to take their heart medications. At least 100 million people worldwide live with heart and blood vessel disease. These individuals are five times more likely to have another serious heart problem compared to people without heart disease. Taking medications as prescribed can help prevent these problems, but many people struggle to take their medicines regularly.

## Who was studied?

The review looked at 1,310 adults who had already experienced a heart attack, stroke, or similar event affecting their arteries. These participants came from seven different studies conducted in various countries, including both wealthy nations and some middle-income countries like China, Malaysia, and Pakistan.

## What did the studies test?

Participants received text messages on their mobile phones reminding them to take their medications. These reminders were compared to either no messages or other types of communication. The studies lasted between one month and one year.

## What did researchers find?

Six out of seven studies showed that people who received text messages were better at taking their medications compared to those who didn't receive messages. However, the studies measured medication-taking in different ways, making it difficult to combine the results. Only one study reported on serious heart problems, and it was too small to draw conclusions. No studies reported harmful effects from receiving text messages.

## What does this mean?

While the results look encouraging, there isn't enough strong evidence yet to say for certain that text messages help heart patients take their medications better. The studies were small and had some quality concerns. More and larger studies are needed, especially in lower-income countries.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What is this study about?
- Researchers looked at whether text messages to patients’ phones can help people who already have heart or blood vessel disease take their medicines as prescribed to prevent another event.

Who was in the studies?
- Adults with known artery problems (at least half in each study had an arterial occlusive event).
- Most studies were done in high‑income countries; some were in China, Malaysia, and Pakistan.
- Many people were enrolled soon after an acute event.

What was tested?
- Interventions: Short text (SMS) or multimedia (MMS) messages sent to patients to support taking medicines.
- Compared with: No extra messages or other contact methods (such as phone calls).

What outcomes were measured?
- Main: How well people took their medicines (adherence).
- Others planned: Fatal and non‑fatal heart and blood vessel events, and any harms from the messaging.

How was the research done?
- The team searched several databases and trial registers in November 2016.
- They included 7 randomized trials with 1,310 total participants.
- Follow‑up lasted from 1 to 12 months.
- The studies used different methods, so results could not be combined.

What did the studies find?
- All 7 studies measured medicine adherence, but in different ways.
- 6 of 7 studies found that text messages improved adherence compared with control.
- One study found mixed results depending on how adherence was measured.
- Only one study reported deaths from cardiovascular causes (2 deaths, both in the control group). No other cardiovascular outcomes were reported.
- No study reported harms related to texting (for example, thumb injury or crashes).

Safety
- No messaging‑related adverse events were reported.

Quality of the evidence
- The studies were small and varied a lot.
- All had at least one area with high risk of bias.
- Overall evidence quality was very low.

Bottom line
- Text messages may help people take their heart medicines, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain.
- Larger, high‑quality trials are needed, especially in low‑ and middle‑income countries, and should also track health events and safety."
90,"Background
Miscarriage occurs in 10% to 15% of pregnancies. The traditional treatment, after miscarriage, has been to perform surgery to remove any remaining placental tissues in the uterus ('evacuation of uterus'). However, medical treatments, or expectant care (no treatment), may also be effective, safe, and acceptable. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness, safety, and acceptability of any medical treatment for incomplete miscarriage (before 24 weeks). 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (13 May 2016) and reference lists of retrieved papers. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials comparing medical treatment with expectant care or surgery, or alternative methods of medical treatment. We excluded quasi‐randomised trials. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and carried out data extraction. Data entry was checked. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included 24 studies (5577 women). There were no trials specifically of miscarriage treatment after 13 weeks' gestation. 
Three trials involving 335 women compared misoprostol treatment (all vaginally administered) with expectant care. There was no difference in complete miscarriage (average risk ratio (RR) 1.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 2.10; 2 studies, 150 women, random‐effects; very low‐quality evidence), or in the need for surgical evacuation (average RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.26; 2 studies, 308 women, random‐effects; low‐quality evidence). There were few data on 'deaths or serious complications'. For unplanned surgical intervention, we did not identify any difference between misoprostol and expectant care (average RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.26; 2 studies, 308 women, random‐effects; low‐quality evidence). 
Sixteen trials involving 4044 women addressed the comparison of misoprostol (7 studies used oral administration, 6 studies used vaginal, 2 studies sublingual, 1 study combined vaginal + oral) with surgical evacuation. There was a slightly lower incidence of complete miscarriage with misoprostol (average RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.94 to 0.98; 15 studies, 3862 women, random‐effects; very low‐quality evidence) but with success rate high for both methods. Overall, there were fewer surgical evacuations with misoprostol (average RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.11; 13 studies, 3070 women, random‐effects; very low‐quality evidence) but more unplanned procedures (average RR 5.03, 95% CI 2.71 to 9.35; 11 studies, 2690 women, random‐effects; low‐quality evidence). There were few data on 'deaths or serious complications'. Nausea was more common with misoprostol (average RR 2.50, 95% CI 1.53 to 4.09; 11 studies, 3015 women, random‐effects; low‐quality evidence). We did not identify any difference in women's satisfaction between misoprostol and surgery (average RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.00; 9 studies, 3349 women, random‐effects; moderate‐quality evidence). More women had vomiting and diarrhoea with misoprostol compared with surgery (vomiting: average RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.36 to 2.85; 10 studies, 2977 women, random‐effects; moderate‐quality evidence; diarrhoea: average RR 4.82, 95% CI 1.09 to 21.32; 4 studies, 757 women, random‐effects; moderate‐quality evidence). 
Five trials compared different routes of administration, or doses, or both, of misoprostol. There was no clear evidence of one regimen being superior to another.  
Limited evidence suggests that women generally seem satisfied with their care. Long‐term follow‐up from one included study identified no difference in subsequent fertility between the three approaches. 
Authors' conclusions
The available evidence suggests that medical treatment, with misoprostol, and expectant care are both acceptable alternatives to routine surgical evacuation given the availability of health service resources to support all three approaches. Further studies, including long‐term follow‐up, are clearly needed to confirm these findings. There is an urgent need for studies on women who miscarry at more than 13 weeks' gestation.","Medical treatments for incomplete miscarriage
What is the issue? 
Miscarriage is when a pregnant woman loses her baby before the baby would be considered able to survive outside the womb, i.e. before 24 weeks' gestation. Miscarriage occurs in about 10% to 15% of pregnancies and the signs are bleeding, usually with some abdominal pain and cramping. The traditional management of miscarriage was surgery but this Cochrane Review asks if medical treatments can be another management option for the woman. 
Why is this important?  
The cause of miscarriage is often unknown, but most are likely to be due to abnormalities in the baby’s chromosomes. Women experiencing miscarriage may be quite distressed, and there can be feelings of emptiness, guilt, and failure. Fathers can also be affected emotionally. Traditionally, surgery (curettage or vacuum aspiration) has been the treatment used to remove any retained tissue and it is quick to perform. It has now been suggested that medical treatments (usually misoprostol) may be as effective and may carry less risk of infection. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence on 13 May 2016 and identified 24 studies involving 5577 women, and all these studies were of women at less than 13 weeks' gestation. There were a number of different ways of giving the drugs and so there are limited data for each comparison.  
Overall, the review found no real difference in the success between misoprostol and waiting for spontaneous miscarriage (expectant care), nor between misoprostol and surgery. The overall success rate of treatment (misoprostol and surgery) was over 80% and sometimes as high as 99%, and one study identified no difference in subsequent fertility between methods of medication, surgery or expectant management. Vaginal misoprostol was compared with oral misoprostol in one study which found no difference in success, but there was an increase in the incidence of diarrhoea with oral misoprostol.  However, women on the whole seemed happy with their care, whichever treatment they were given. 
What does this mean? 
The review suggests that misoprostol or waiting for spontaneous expulsion of fragments are important alternatives to surgery, but women should be offered an informed choice. Further studies are clearly needed to confirm these findings and should include long‐term follow‐up. There is an urgent need for studies on women who miscarry at more than 13 weeks' gestation.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Treatment Options After Miscarriage

## What is this study about?

Researchers reviewed studies on different ways to treat incomplete miscarriage (when pregnancy tissue remains in the uterus after a miscarriage). They wanted to find out which treatments work best and are safest.

## What treatments were compared?

The researchers looked at three main approaches:
- **Surgery** to remove remaining tissue from the uterus
- **Medication** (a drug called misoprostol) to help the body pass the tissue naturally
- **Expectant care** (waiting without treatment to see if the body passes the tissue on its own)

## What did they find?

The review included 24 studies with 5,577 women. Most studies looked at miscarriages before 13 weeks of pregnancy.

**Medication vs. Waiting:**
- Both approaches worked similarly well
- There was little difference in how often women needed surgery afterward

**Medication vs. Surgery:**
- Both approaches had high success rates
- Surgery was slightly more successful at completing the miscarriage
- Women taking medication had fewer planned surgical procedures but sometimes needed unplanned procedures
- Women taking medication experienced more side effects like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea
- Women were equally satisfied with both approaches

## What does this mean?

All three treatment options—medication, surgery, or waiting—can be acceptable choices for treating incomplete miscarriage. The best choice may depend on individual circumstances and available healthcare resources.

## What's still needed?

More research is needed, especially for miscarriages that happen after 13 weeks of pregnancy.",0,Plano,"Plain-Language Summary

What was studied
- Researchers looked at ways to manage an incomplete miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy.
- They compared three options: medicine (misoprostol), surgery (removing tissue from the uterus), and expectant care (waiting to see if the body clears the tissue on its own).
- The review included 24 studies with 5,577 women. No trials focused on miscarriages after 13 weeks.

Goal
- To find out which option works best, is safest, and is acceptable to patients.

Who was included
- Women with incomplete miscarriage before 24 weeks (most studies were under 13 weeks).

What treatments were tested
- Misoprostol (by mouth, vaginal, or under the tongue)
- Surgery (uterine evacuation)
- Expectant care (no immediate treatment)

Key results
- Misoprostol vs expectant care: Both had similar chances of the body clearing the uterus without surgery. The need for surgery was also similar.
- Misoprostol vs surgery: Both were effective. Surgery had a slightly higher chance of complete clearing right away. Misoprostol led to fewer planned surgeries overall, but more unplanned procedures later.
- Different doses or ways to take misoprostol: No clear best method.
- Patient satisfaction: Similar between misoprostol and surgery.
- Future fertility: One study found no difference between the three approaches.

Safety
- Serious complications or deaths were rare, but there were not many data.
- Side effects were more common with misoprostol: more nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

Timing
- Studies were found up to May 13, 2016. More research is needed, especially after 13 weeks of pregnancy and for long-term outcomes.

Bottom line
- Medicine (misoprostol), surgery, and expectant care are all reasonable options for incomplete miscarriage before 13 weeks, when proper medical support is available.
- Choice can be guided by patient preference, access to care, and discussion of side effects and the chance of needing an unplanned procedure. More high-quality research is needed."
91,"Background
The use of technology in healthcare settings is on the increase and may represent a cost‐effective means of delivering rehabilitation. Reductions in treatment time, and delivery in the home, are also thought to be benefits of this approach. Children and adolescents with brain injury often experience deficits in memory and executive functioning that can negatively affect their school work, social lives, and future occupations. Effective interventions that can be delivered at home, without the need for high‐cost clinical involvement, could provide a means to address a current lack of provision. 
We have systematically reviewed studies examining the effects of technology‐based interventions for the rehabilitation of deficits in memory and executive functioning in children and adolescents with acquired brain injury. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of technology‐based interventions compared to placebo intervention, no treatment, or other types of intervention, on the executive functioning and memory of children and adolescents with acquired brain injury. 
Search methods
We ran the search on the 30 September 2015. We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid MEDLINE(R) In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid OLDMEDLINE(R), EMBASE Classic + EMBASE (OvidSP), ISI Web of Science (SCI‐EXPANDED, SSCI, CPCI‐S, and CPSI‐SSH), CINAHL Plus (EBSCO), two other databases, and clinical trials registers. We also searched the internet, screened reference lists, and contacted authors of included studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing the use of a technological aid for the rehabilitation of children and adolescents with memory or executive‐functioning deficits with placebo, no treatment, or another intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts identified by the search strategy. Following retrieval of full‐text manuscripts, two review authors independently performed data extraction and assessed the risk of bias. 
Main results
Four studies (involving 206 participants) met the inclusion criteria for this review.
Three studies, involving 194 participants, assessed the effects of online interventions to target executive functioning (that is monitoring and changing behaviour, problem solving, planning, etc.). These studies, which were all conducted by the same research team, compared online interventions against a 'placebo' (participants were given internet resources on brain injury). The interventions were delivered in the family home with additional support or training, or both, from a psychologist or doctoral student. The fourth study investigated the use of a computer program to target memory in addition to components of executive functioning (that is attention, organisation, and problem solving). No information on the study setting was provided, however a speech‐language pathologist, teacher, or occupational therapist accompanied participants. 
Two studies assessed adolescents and young adults with mild to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), while the remaining two studies assessed children and adolescents with moderate to severe TBI. 
Risk of bias 
We assessed the risk of selection bias as low for three studies and unclear for one study. Allocation bias was high in two studies, unclear in one study, and low in one study. Only one study (n = 120) was able to conceal allocation from participants, therefore overall selection bias was assessed as high. 
One study took steps to conceal assessors from allocation (low risk of detection bias), while the other three did not do so (high risk of detection bias). 
Primary outcome 1: Executive functioning: Technology‐based intervention versus placebo 
Results from meta‐analysis of three studies (n = 194) comparing online interventions with a placebo for children and adolescents with TBI, favoured the intervention immediately post‐treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.66 to ‐0.09; P = 0.62; I2 = 0%). (As there is no 'gold standard' measure in the field, we have not translated the SMD back to any particular scale.) This result is thought to represent only a small to medium effect size (using Cohen’s rule of thumb, where 0.2 is a small effect, 0.5 a medium one, and 0.8 or above is a large effect); this is unlikely to have a clinically important effect on the participant. 
The fourth study (n = 12) reported differences between the intervention and control groups on problem solving (an important component of executive functioning). No means or standard deviations were presented for this outcome, therefore an effect size could not be calculated. 
The quality of evidence for this outcome according to GRADE was very low. This means future research is highly likely to change the estimate of effect. 
Primary outcome 2: Memory 
One small study (n = 12) reported a statistically significant difference in improvement in sentence recall between the intervention and control group following an eight‐week remediation programme. No means or standard deviations were presented for this outcome, therefore an effect size could not be calculated. 
Secondary outcomes 
Two studies (n = 158) reported on anxiety/depression as measured by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and were included in a meta‐analysis. We found no evidence of an effect with the intervention (mean difference ‐5.59, 95% CI ‐11.46 to 0.28; I2 = 53%). The GRADE quality of evidence for this outcome was very low, meaning future research is likely to change the estimate of effect. 
A single study sought to record adverse events and reported none. Two studies reported on use of the intervention (range 0 to 13 and 1 to 24 sessions). One study reported on social functioning/social competence and found no effect. The included studies reported no data for other secondary outcomes (that is quality of life and academic achievement). 
Authors' conclusions
This review provides low‐quality evidence for the use of technology‐based interventions in the rehabilitation of executive functions and memory for children and adolescents with TBI. As all of the included studies contained relatively small numbers of participants (12 to 120), our findings should be interpreted with caution. The involvement of a clinician or therapist, rather than use of the technology, may have led to the success of these interventions. Future research should seek to replicate these findings with larger samples, in other regions, using ecologically valid outcome measures, and reduced clinician involvement.","Using technology to rehabilitate children and adolescents with acquired brain injury
Review question 
We aimed to assess the effects of technology‐based interventions in rehabilitating children and adolescents with acquired brain injury. 
Background 
Acquired brain injury is defined as any injury to the brain that occurs following birth and is the result of illness, medical conditions, or trauma. After acquired brain injury a person can experience difficulties with executive functions and memory. Executive functions are brain processes that involve planning and emotional control, which govern the ability to start and stop our actions. Memory processes allow us to store and recall information about our world. Executive functions also include an aspect of memory called working memory. Technology is increasingly being used to help children and adolescents recover from acquired brain injury. Technological aids used to rehabilitate memory and executive functions include pagers, smartphones, internet‐based interventions, and voice recorders. 
Search date 
We performed the searches in September 2015.
Study characteristics 
We identified four studies (including 206 participants) that investigated the effectiveness of technology‐based interventions to rehabilitate children and adolescents with traumatic brain injury. All four studies were conducted in North America, with three originating from the same research team. 
One study with 120 participants used an online Counselor‐Assisted Problem Solving (CAPS) intervention to rehabilitate executive functioning in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. 
One study with 35 participants used a Teen Online Problem‐Solving intervention to target the executive functioning of adolescents aged 11 to 18 years. 
One study with 40 participants used an online Family Problem Solving intervention to target outcomes such as behaviour and aspects of executive functioning in children aged 5 to 16 years. 
One study with 12 participants used a computer program to target cognitive‐communication skills including memory and aspects of executive functions in adolescents and young adults aged 12 to 21 years. 
Study funding sources 
All funding sources were in the USA or Canada. One study was funded by the Colorado Department of Human Services and two National Institutes of Health (NIH) awards. A second study was also funded by a NIH grant. One study was funded by a hospital charity in addition to the Easter Seal Research Institute and Apple Canada. The final study was supported by the Ohio Department of Safety. 
Key results 
This review found evidence that interventions employing technological aids did improve executive functions in adolescents with traumatic brain injury (i.e. a brain injury resulting from a road traffic accident, fall, or blow to the head). However, this result was relatively modest and is unlikely to have a clinically important effect on the child. One study employed technology to improve memory in adolescents with TBI and showed an improvement for the intervention group. It was not possible to determine how effective this approach was as the study failed to include adequate statistical information. Two studies examined the secondary outcomes of anxiety and depression but did not show any effect between the intervention and control groups at 6 months follow‐up. Only one study recorded adverse events, and reported that none occurred. Two studies reported on the amount of use the intervention received. One study reported improvements in social functioning/social competence for the intervention group. No data were reported which related to the review's other secondary outcomes. 
Quality of the evidence 
We found the quality of evidence for all outcomes to be low, which means future research is likely to change the estimate of effect. All four studies were small, and it was not always possible to conceal group allocation to participants. Three studies failed to conceal group allocation to those who measured the outcomes.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Technology-Based Programs for Memory and Thinking Skills After Brain Injury in Young People

## What was this review about?

Children and teenagers who have had a brain injury often struggle with memory and thinking skills like planning, problem-solving, and staying organized. These difficulties can affect their schoolwork, friendships, and future jobs. Researchers wanted to know if computer programs and online tools could help improve these skills.

## What did the researchers do?

The review team searched for studies that tested technology-based programs for young people (children and teenagers) with brain injuries. They looked for studies that compared these programs to either no treatment, fake treatment, or other types of help. They found 4 studies with 206 young people total.

## What did the studies test?

- **Three studies** (194 participants) tested online programs to help with thinking skills like planning and problem-solving. These programs were used at home with help from a psychologist or trained helper.
- **One study** (12 participants) tested a computer program for memory and attention skills, with support from a therapist or teacher.

All participants had experienced traumatic brain injury ranging from mild to severe.

## What did they find?

**Thinking Skills:** The three studies using online programs showed small improvements in thinking skills compared to giving families just internet information about brain injury. However, the improvement was small and may not make a noticeable difference in daily life.

**Memory:** One small study found improvements in remembering sentences after 8 weeks of using the program.

**Mood:** Two studies looked at anxiety and depression but found no clear changes.

**Safety:** One study specifically checked for problems and found none.

## What does this mean?

The evidence is limited and not strong enough to say for certain whether these technology programs work well. The studies were small, and it's unclear whether the technology itself or the help from therapists made the difference. More research with larger groups of young people is needed to know if these programs truly help.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the research

What was studied
- Researchers reviewed clinical trials to see if technology-based programs help with thinking skills (planning, problem solving, memory) in children and teens after a brain injury.
- They compared these programs to no treatment, placebo (general brain injury information), or other treatments.

Who was included
- 4 randomized studies with 206 participants.
- Ages: children, adolescents, and some young adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI), ranging from mild to severe.
- Two studies included moderate to severe TBI; two included mild to severe TBI.

What the treatments were
- Three studies tested online programs for executive functioning (planning, organizing, problem solving, monitoring behavior). These were used at home with support or training from a clinician or graduate student.
- One small study tested a computer program for memory plus attention and organization. Sessions were guided by a speech-language pathologist, teacher, or occupational therapist.
- Session use ranged from 0–13 or 1–24 sessions, depending on the study.
- One program lasted 8 weeks.

What outcomes were measured
- Main outcomes: executive functioning and memory.
- Other outcomes: mood (anxiety/depression), social functioning, quality of life, school performance, and any side effects.

Key findings
- Executive functioning: Across three studies (194 participants), the online programs led to small improvements right after treatment compared with placebo information. The size of the improvement was small to medium and likely not noticeable in daily life.
- Memory: One very small study (12 participants) found better sentence recall after 8 weeks in the program group compared with control.
- Mood (anxiety/depression): Two studies (158 participants) showed no clear benefit.
- Social functioning: No clear benefit.
- Quality of life and school performance: No data reported.

Safety
- One study checked for adverse events and reported none. Others did not report on safety.

How strong is the evidence
- Overall quality of evidence was very low.
- Studies were small (12–120 participants) and had design limits. Many could not hide group assignment from participants or assessors.
- Results may change with better, larger studies.

Timeline and search
- The research search was done on September 30, 2015.

Bottom line
- Technology-based programs may provide small short-term improvements in thinking skills for children and teens after TBI, but the evidence is weak.
- It is unclear if benefits are due to the technology or the support from clinicians.
- More, larger, higher-quality studies with less clinician involvement and real-life outcomes are needed."
92,"Background
Patellar tendinopathy is an overuse condition that commonly affects athletes. Surgery is usually offered if medical and physical therapies fail to treat it effectively. There is variation in the type of surgery performed for the condition. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of surgery for patellar tendinopathy in adults.
Search methods
We searched the following databases, to 17 July 2018: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Library, OVID MEDLINE, OVID Embase, clinical trial registries (www.ClinicalTrials.gov) and the WHO trials portal (www.who.int/ictrp/en/). 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared surgical techniques (open or arthroscopic) with non‐operative treatment (including placebo surgery, exercise or other non‐surgical modalities) in adults with patellar tendinopathy. 
Major outcomes assessed were knee pain, function, quality of life, participant global assessment of success, withdrawal rate, proportion with adverse events and proportion with tendon rupture. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors selected studies for inclusion, extracted trial characteristics and outcome data, assessed the risk of bias and assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
Two trials (92 participants) met our inclusion criteria. Participants in both trials were followed for 12 months. Neither trial compared surgery to placebo surgery. One trial (40 randomised participants) compared open surgical excision with eccentric exercises, and the other compared arthroscopic surgery with sclerosing injections (52 randomised participants). Due to the nature of the interventions, neither the participants or the investigators were blinded to the group allocation, resulting in the potential for performance and detection bias. Some outcomes were selectively not recorded, leading to reporting bias. Overall, the certainty of the evidence from these studies was low for all outcomes due to the potential for bias, and imprecision due to small sample sizes. 
Compared with eccentric exercises, low‐certainty evidence indicates that open surgical excision provides no clinically important benefits with respect to knee pain, function or global assessment of success. At 12 months, mean knee pain — measured by pain with standing jump on a 10‐point scale (lower scores indicating less pain) — was 1.7 points (standard deviation (SD) 1.6) in the eccentric training group and 1.3 (SD 0.8) in the surgical group (one trial, 40 participants). This equates to an absolute pain reduction of 4% (ranging from 4% worse to 12% better, the minimal clinically important difference being 15%) and a relative reduction in pain of 10% better (ranging from 30% better to 10% worse) in the treatment group. At 12 months, function on the zero‐ to 100‐point Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment (VISA) scale was 65.7 (SD 23.8) in the eccentric training group and 72.9 (SD 11.7) in the surgical group (one trial, 40 participants). This equates to an absolute change of 7% better function (ranging from 4% worse to 19% better) and relative change of 25% better (ranging from 15% worse to 65% better, the minimal clinically important difference being 13%). Participant global assessment of success was measured by the number of people with no pain at 12 months: 7/20 participants in the eccentric training group reported no pain, compared with 5/20 in the open surgical group (risk ratio (RR) 0.71 (95% CI 0.27 to 1.88); one trial, 40 participants). There were no withdrawals, but five out of 20 people from the eccentric exercise group crossed over to open surgical excision. Quality of life, adverse events and tendon ruptures were not measured. 
Compared with sclerosing injection, low‐certainty evidence indicates that arthroscopic surgery may provide a reduction in pain and improvement in participant global assessment of success, however further studies are likely to change these results. At 12 months, mean pain with activities, measured on a 100‐point scale (lower scores indicating less pain), was 41.1 (SD 28.5) in the sclerosing injection group and 12.8 (SD 19.3) in the arthroscopic surgery group (one trial, 52 participants). This equates to an absolute pain reduction of 28% better (ranging from 15% to 42% better, the minimal clinically important difference being 15%), and a relative change of 41% better (ranging from 21% to 61% better). At 12 months, the mean participant global assessment of success, measured by satisfaction on a 100‐point scale (scale zero to 100, higher scores indicating greater satisfaction), was 52.9 (SD 32.6) in the sclerosing injection group and 86.8 (SD 20.8) in the arthroscopic surgery group (one trial, 52 participants). This equates to an absolute improvement of 34% (ranging from 19% to 49%). In both groups, one participant (4%) withdrew from the study. Functional outcome scores, including the VISA score, were not reported. Quality‐of‐life assessment, adverse events, and specifically the proportion with a tendon rupture, were not reported. 
We did not perform subgroup analysis to assess differences in outcome between arthroscopic or open surgical excision, as we did not identify more than one study with a common comparator. 
Authors' conclusions
We are uncertain if surgery is beneficial over other therapeutic interventions, namely eccentric exercises or injectables. Low‐certainty evidence shows that surgery for patellar tendinopathy may not provide clinically important benefits over eccentric exercise in terms of pain, function or participant‐reported treatment success, but may provide clinically meaningful pain reduction and treatment success when compared with sclerosing injections. However, further research is likely to change these results. The evidence was downgraded two levels due to the small sample sizes and susceptibility to bias. We are uncertain if there are additional risks associated with surgery as study authors failed to report adverse events. Surgery seems to be embedded in clinical practice for late‐stage patella tendinopathy, due to exhaustion of other therapeutic methods rather than evidence of benefit.","Surgery for patella tendinopathy (jumper's knee)
Background 
Patella tendinopathy is a painful condition that commonly affects jumping athletes who train a lot, for example those who play volleyball and basketball. Many people with the condition are unable to continue their chosen sport at the same level of competition or intensity of training. There are many treatments for the condition, the most common of which is a particular type of exercise called eccentric exercise (where the tendon is under tension while the muscle lengthens). 
Other treatments for patella tendinopathy include oral and topical analgesia (pain‐relief medication taken orally or applied to the skin), various injectables (e.g. corticosteroids) and surgery. Surgery is used if other treatments fail, and is the treatment assessed in this review. 
Study characteristics 
This Cochrane Review is current to July 2018. We searched online databases for all studies (specifically randomised controlled trials) that compared surgical treatment with non‐operative treatment in adults with patellar tendinopathy. We found two studies; they compared open surgical removal to eccentric exercises (one study involving 40 people) and arthroscopic surgery to sclerosing injections (these scar and block the blood vessels supplying nerve fibres to the diseased tendon) (one study involving 56 people). The studies were performed in an outpatient setting in two countries (Norway and Sweden). The majority of people in the studies were male, with a mean age ranging from 27 to 31 years, and mean symptom duration of 24 to 33 months. Trials were conducted without funding (financial support) from industry (medical or device companies), but some authors from the one study received funding from pharmaceutical companies in addition to research funding from non‐industry sources. 
Key results 
Compared with eccentric exercises, open surgery offered little benefit at 12 months (results for individual outcomes as follows). 
Pain (lower scores mean less pain) 
Improved by 4% (ranging from 4% worse to 12% better) or by 0.4 points on a scale of zero to 10 points. 
People who had surgery rated their pain as 1.3 points.
People who had eccentric exercises rated their pain as 1.7 points.
Global assessment of success (those who reported no pain at 12 months) 
10% fewer people had no pain (ranging from 38% less to 18% more), or 10 fewer people out of 100. 
Twenty‐five out of 100 people had no pain with surgery.
Thirty‐five out of 100 people had no pain with eccentric exercises.
Withdrawals 
No participants in either group withdrew from the study.
The study did not report on quality‐of‐life improvements or adverse events (including tendon ruptures). 
Compared with sclerosing injections, arthroscopic (keyhole) surgery offered some reduction in pain and improvement in participant global assessment of success at 12 months (results for individual outcomes as follows; further studies are likely to change these results). 
Pain (lower scores mean less pain) 
Improved by 28% (ranging from 15% to 42% better) or by 28 points on a scale of zero to 100 points. 
People who had surgery rated their pain as 12.8 points.
People who had sclerosing injection rated their pain as 41.1 points.
Global assessment of success (participant‐reported success, higher score is better) 
Improved by 34% (ranging from 19% to 49% better) or by 33.9 points on a scale of zero to 100 points. 
People who had surgery rated their pain as 86.8 points.
People who had sclerosing injection rated their pain as 52.9 points.
Withdrawals 
One person from each group (4%) withdrew from the study for reasons unrelated to the treatment. 
The study did not report on quality‐of‐life improvements, functional score improvements or adverse events (including tendon ruptures). 
Quality of the evidence 
We decided the evidence was low‐certainty due to flaws in the design of the studies that may over‐estimate benefits of treatment. For example, people involved in the study were aware of which treatment they were receiving, the studies selectively reported some results but not others, and there was imprecision in the results due to the small number of participants and trials. Therefore, we are uncertain if surgery has any benefits over eccentric exercises or sclerosing injections for treating patellar tendinopathy in adults. Further studies are likely to change the results.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Surgery for Patellar Tendinopathy

## What was studied?

Researchers looked at whether surgery helps adults with patellar tendinopathy, a condition that causes pain in the tendon below the kneecap. This condition is common in athletes and comes from overuse. Surgery is sometimes offered when other treatments don't work.

## What did researchers find?

The review found only 2 small studies with a total of 92 people. Participants were followed for 12 months.

**Study 1** compared open surgery (40 people) to eccentric exercises (special strengthening exercises). Results showed:
- Pain levels were similar in both groups at 12 months
- Knee function was similar in both groups
- About the same number of people in each group reported having no pain
- 5 people switched from exercises to surgery during the study

**Study 2** compared arthroscopic surgery (52 people) to sclerosing injections (shots that target abnormal blood vessels). Results showed:
- People who had surgery reported less pain during activities at 12 months
- People who had surgery were more satisfied with their treatment
- One person from each group dropped out of the study

## What does this mean?

The evidence is limited and uncertain because:
- Only 2 small studies were found
- The studies had quality concerns
- Important information about side effects and complications wasn't reported

Based on current evidence, researchers cannot say for certain whether surgery works better than exercises or injections. Surgery appears to be used mainly when other treatments have been tried first, rather than because strong evidence shows it works better.

More research with larger groups of people is needed to understand if surgery truly helps this condition.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the research

What was studied
- Purpose: To see if surgery helps adults with patellar tendinopathy more than non-surgical care, and to check for harms.
- Who: Adults with patellar tendinopathy.
- What was compared:
  - Open surgery vs. eccentric exercise (40 people)
  - Arthroscopic surgery vs. sclerosing injections (52 people)
- How long: People were followed for 12 months.

What outcomes were measured
- Knee pain
- Function (ability to do activities)
- Overall treatment success (how satisfied people were or if they had no pain)
- Dropouts
- Safety (adverse events, tendon rupture) — note: not reported in these trials
- Quality of life — not reported

Key results
- Open surgery vs. eccentric exercise (1 small study, 40 people):
  - Pain at 12 months: very similar between groups.
  - Function at 12 months: small difference that was not clearly important.
  - Success (no pain at 12 months): similar numbers in both groups.
  - Takeaway: Surgery did not clearly beat exercise.

- Arthroscopic surgery vs. sclerosing injections (1 small study, 52 people):
  - Pain at 12 months: surgery group reported less pain.
  - Satisfaction at 12 months: surgery group reported higher satisfaction.
  - Function: not reported.
  - Takeaway: Surgery looked better than sclerosing injections for pain and satisfaction, but more studies are needed.

Safety
- These studies did not report adverse events or tendon ruptures, so possible harms are unknown.

Study quality and limits
- Only 2 small trials (total 92 people).
- Follow-up: 12 months.
- People and doctors knew which treatment they got (can bias results).
- Some outcomes were not reported.
- Overall certainty of the evidence: low.

Bottom line
- We are uncertain if surgery helps more than non-surgical care.
- Surgery did not clearly beat eccentric exercise.
- Surgery looked better than sclerosing injections for pain and satisfaction, but the evidence is weak.
- More, larger, and better-quality studies are needed."
93,"Background
There is accumulating evidence that steroid sex hormones have a beneficial effect on a number of risk factors for peripheral arterial disease. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to determine whether exogenous steroid sex hormones are an effective treatment for patients with lower limb atherosclerosis. 
Search methods
For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co‐ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched August 2012) and CENTRAL 2012, Issue 7. There were no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We selected randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials of steroid sex hormones in patients with lower limb atherosclerosis. 
Data collection and analysis
Both authors extracted data and assessed trial quality independently. Whenever possible investigators were contacted to obtain information needed for the review that could not be found in published reports. 
Main results
Four trials appeared to meet the inclusion criteria, but one was excluded because of poor methodology. The three remaining trials compared testosterone treatment with placebo in a total of 109 subjects with intermittent claudication or critical leg ischaemia. The most recent trial to meet the inclusion criteria dated from 1971. No trials were available which investigated the potentially beneficial effects of oestrogenic hormones in women with lower limb atherosclerosis. 
Testosterone therapy produced no significant improvement in tests of walking distance or in a variety of other objective tests for peripheral arterial disease, including venous filling time, muscle blood flow and plethysmography. The relative risk for subjective improvement in symptoms using the combined trial results was also non‐significant (relative risk (RR) 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.48). 
Authors' conclusions
There is no evidence to date that short‐term testosterone treatment is beneficial in subjects with lower limb atherosclerosis. However, this might reflect limited data rather than the lack of a real effect.","Testosterone and oestrogen steroid sex hormones for lower limb atherosclerosis
Atherosclerosis of the arteries of the legs can become symptomatic as people age. People affected may experience discomfort and cramping pain in the legs that is triggered by exercise and relieved with rest, termed intermittent claudication. Some people with claudication go on to require reconstructive surgery and even amputation of a leg. Risk factors for peripheral arterial disease include cigarette smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, low levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and blood flow problems. The steroid sex hormones oestrogens and testosterone affect a number of these risk factors, particularly cholesterol and blood clotting, and may be helpful in peripheral vascular disease. 
Although four randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria, one was excluded because of poor methodology. The three remaining trials compared testosterone treatment with placebo in a total of 109 middle‐aged to elderly people, predominantly men. The participants had symptoms of lower limb atherosclerosis, predominantly intermittent claudication. The trials were published from 1967 to 1971 and all took place in Denmark. Testosterone did not provide any clear improvement in the symptoms reported by the participants, walking distance or other objective tests for peripheral arterial disease including leg muscle blood flow. The dose of testosterone in the trials varied between 300 mg taken by mouth every two weeks for three months to a lower (100 mg) oral dose taken more often and 200 mg given by intramuscular injection, first weekly then every two weeks for six months. Side effects were poorly reported except for subjective sexual functioning, which did seem to improve with testosterone treatment. No trials investigated oestrogens in women with lower limb atherosclerosis. 
Trials by the Women's Health Initiative (published in 2004) have shown that oestrogen and progestin does not confer any protection against peripheral arterial disease in healthy postmenopausal women or reduce the risk of coronary events in postmenopausal women with coronary heart disease.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Hormone Treatment for Leg Artery Disease

## What was this review about?

Researchers wanted to find out if hormone treatments could help people with blocked arteries in their legs. This condition, called peripheral arterial disease, causes poor blood flow to the legs and can lead to pain when walking or more serious problems.

## What did the researchers look for?

They searched medical databases through August 2012 for studies that tested hormone treatments in people with leg artery disease. They were looking for well-designed studies that compared hormone treatment to inactive treatment (placebo).

## What did they find?

The researchers found only 3 usable studies, all testing testosterone (a male hormone). These studies included 109 people total who had leg pain when walking or severe leg circulation problems. The most recent study was from 1971. They found no studies testing estrogen (a female hormone) in women with this condition.

## What were the results?

Testosterone treatment did not show clear benefits. People taking testosterone did not:
- Walk farther in walking tests
- Show improvement in blood flow measurements
- Report feeling significantly better than those taking placebo

## What does this mean?

Based on the limited information available, there is no proof that short-term testosterone treatment helps people with blocked leg arteries. However, because there were so few studies and they were very old, researchers cannot say for certain whether hormones might help or not. More research would be needed to answer this question properly.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

Purpose
- To find out if steroid sex hormones can help people with lower limb artery disease.

Who was studied
- Adults with leg blood flow problems causing leg pain with walking (intermittent claudication) or very low leg blood flow (critical leg ischemia).

What was tested
- Testosterone medicine compared with a placebo (no active drug).
- No studies were found that tested estrogen in women for this condition.

Study design and size
- Review of randomized or quasi-randomized trials.
- Search covered medical databases through August 2012.
- 3 small trials from the past (most recent from 1971), with a total of 109 participants.
- 1 additional trial was excluded for poor methods.

Main outcomes measured
- Walking distance.
- Tests of leg blood flow (venous filling time, muscle blood flow, plethysmography).
- People’s reports of symptom improvement.

Key results
- Testosterone did not improve walking distance or blood flow test results.
- Reports of symptom improvement were not better with testosterone than with placebo (relative risk 1.10; 95% CI 0.81 to 1.48).

Safety
- The review did not provide clear safety results. No firm conclusions about side effects can be made from these small, older studies.

Timing
- The trials were short-term. No long-term effects were reported.

Bottom line
- Based on limited, older studies, short-term testosterone treatment did not show benefits for lower limb artery disease. More and better-quality research is needed, including studies in women and with estrogen."
94,"Background
Stroke affects millions of people every year and is a leading cause of disability, resulting in significant financial cost and reduction in quality of life. Rehabilitation after stroke aims to reduce disability by facilitating recovery of impairment, activity, or participation. One aspect of stroke rehabilitation that may affect outcomes is the amount of time spent in rehabilitation, including minutes provided, frequency (i.e. days per week of rehabilitation), and duration (i.e. time period over which rehabilitation is provided). Effect of time spent in rehabilitation after stroke has been explored extensively in the literature, but findings are inconsistent. Previous systematic reviews with meta‐analyses have included studies that differ not only in the amount provided, but also type of rehabilitation. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of 1. more time spent in the same type of rehabilitation on activity measures in people with stroke; 2. difference in total rehabilitation time (in minutes) on recovery of activity in people with stroke; and 3. rehabilitation schedule on activity in terms of: a. average time (minutes) per week undergoing rehabilitation, b. frequency (number of sessions per week) of rehabilitation, and c. total duration of rehabilitation. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, eight other databases, and five trials registers to June 2021. We searched reference lists of identified studies, contacted key authors, and undertook reference searching using Web of Science Cited Reference Search. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults with stroke that compared different amounts of time spent, greater than zero, in rehabilitation (any non‐pharmacological, non‐surgical intervention aimed to improve activity after stroke). Studies varied only in the amount of time in rehabilitation between experimental and control conditions. Primary outcome was activities of daily living (ADLs); secondary outcomes were activity measures of upper and lower limbs, motor impairment measures of upper and lower limbs, and serious adverse events (SAE)/death. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened studies, extracted data, assessed methodological quality using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool, and assessed certainty of the evidence using GRADE. For continuous outcomes using different scales, we calculated pooled standardised mean difference (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We expressed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% CIs. 
Main results
The quantitative synthesis of this review comprised 21 parallel RCTs, involving analysed data from 1412 participants.  
Time in rehabilitation varied between studies. Minutes provided per week were 90 to 1288. Days per week of rehabilitation were three to seven. Duration of rehabilitation was two weeks to six months. Thirteen studies provided upper limb rehabilitation, five general rehabilitation, two mobilisation training, and one lower limb training. Sixteen studies examined participants in the first six months following stroke; the remaining five included participants more than six months poststroke. Comparison of stroke severity or level of impairment was limited due to variations in measurement. 
The risk of bias assessment suggests there were issues with the methodological quality of the included studies. There were 76 outcome‐level risk of bias assessments: 15 low risk, 37 some concerns, and 24 high risk. 
When comparing groups that spent more time versus less time in rehabilitation immediately after intervention, we found no difference in rehabilitation for ADL outcomes (SMD 0.13, 95% CI −0.02 to 0.28; P = 0.09; I2 = 7%; 14 studies, 864 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), activity measures of the upper limb (SMD 0.09, 95% CI −0.11 to 0.29; P = 0.36; I2 = 0%; 12 studies, 426 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), and activity measures of the lower limb (SMD 0.25, 95% CI −0.03 to 0.53; P = 0.08; I2 = 48%; 5 studies, 425 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We found an effect in favour of more time in rehabilitation for motor impairment measures of the upper limb (SMD 0.32, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.58; P = 0.01; I2 = 10%; 9 studies, 287 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and of the lower limb (SMD 0.71, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.28; P = 0.01; 1 study, 51 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). There were no intervention‐related SAEs. More time in rehabilitation did not affect the risk of SAEs/death (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.85; P = 0.68; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 379 participants; low‐certainty evidence), but few studies measured these outcomes. 
Predefined subgroup analyses comparing studies with a larger difference of total time spent in rehabilitation between intervention groups to studies with a smaller difference found greater improvements for studies with a larger difference. This was statistically significant for ADL outcomes (P = 0.02) and activity measures of the upper limb (P = 0.04), but not for activity measures of the lower limb (P = 0.41) or motor impairment measures of the upper limb (P = 0.06). 
Authors' conclusions
An increase in time spent in the same type of rehabilitation after stroke results in little to no difference in meaningful activities such as activities of daily living and activities of the upper and lower limb but a small benefit in measures of motor impairment (low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence for all findings). If the increase in time spent in rehabilitation exceeds a threshold, this may lead to improved outcomes. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend a minimum beneficial daily amount in clinical practice. The findings of this study are limited by a lack of studies with a significant contrast in amount of additional rehabilitation provided between control and intervention groups. 
Large, well‐designed, high‐quality RCTs that measure time spent in all rehabilitation activities (not just interventional) and provide a large contrast (minimum of 1000 minutes) in amount of rehabilitation between groups would provide further evidence for effect of time spent in rehabilitation.","Time spent in rehabilitation and effect on measures of activity after stroke
Review questionDoes more time spent in rehabilitation improve activity? What matters? Is it the total time spent in rehabilitation that is important, or is it the way rehabilitation is delivered (the schedule)? Is it, for example, the amount of time spent per week? Or the frequency of sessions? 
BackgroundStroke rehabilitation helps people who have had a stroke to recover and resume their activities. Different countries have different guidelines about the amount of therapy they should receive. In England, a minimum of 45 minutes of each appropriate therapy, every day is recommended. In Canada, the guidelines recommend more – three hours of task‐specific training, five days per week. Previous research has found no clear evidence in favour of one approach or the other: the effect of total time spent in rehabilitation, or the schedule by which it is delivered. The English recommendation of 45 minutes is based on the results of studies that compared different types of rehabilitation as well as different amounts of the same type of rehabilitation – which is not the same thing. This is why our review compares only different amounts of the same type of stroke rehabilitation. 
Study characteristicsWe included 21 studies amounting to 1412 people with stroke. Each study compared groups of people who had received different amounts of the same type of rehabilitation. Different types of rehabilitation were included, but the comparison within each study was always only different amounts of the same type. We included rehabilitation of the arms, legs, walking, and general rehabilitation. In 16 studies, participants were in the first six months after stroke. In the remaining five studies, participants were more than six months after stroke. 
Search dateWe searched for studies up to June 2021. 
Key resultsWe found that, for measures of activities involved in daily living (e.g. washing and dressing), activity measures of the arm (e.g. picking up an item), and activity measures of the leg (e.g. walking) there was neither harm to nor benefit for groups that received more rehabilitation compared with groups that received less. For measures of movement of the arm and leg (e.g. strength or range of movement), there was a benefit from receiving more rehabilitation. However, when we compared only the studies that had a bigger contrast between groups, there was a beneficial effect from additional therapy in terms of daily living activities, activity measures of the arm and leg, and movement measures of the arm. This suggests that people with stroke need a large amount of extra rehabilitation for it to make a difference in their recovery and ability to do everyday activities. 
Certainty of the evidenceCertainty of the evidence, which is measured by the quality of each of the studies included in the review, was either low or very low. Therefore, we can only draw tentative conclusions from the findings of this review. It also indicates that more, better quality, studies are needed.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Does Spending More Time in Stroke Rehabilitation Help Recovery?

## What was this study about?

Researchers wanted to find out if spending more time in rehabilitation helps people recover better after a stroke. They looked at whether the total minutes, number of days per week, or length of time people spent in rehabilitation made a difference in their recovery.

## What did the researchers do?

The researchers reviewed 21 studies that included 1,412 stroke survivors. These studies compared groups of people who spent different amounts of time doing the same types of rehabilitation exercises. The studies looked at:
- Different amounts of time per week (ranging from 90 to 1,288 minutes)
- Different numbers of days per week (3 to 7 days)
- Different time periods (2 weeks to 6 months)

Most studies focused on arm exercises, while others looked at general rehabilitation or walking practice. Most participants had their stroke within the past 6 months.

## What did they find?

When comparing people who spent more time versus less time in rehabilitation:
- **Daily activities** (like dressing, eating, bathing): No clear difference
- **Arm function for daily tasks**: No clear difference
- **Leg function for daily tasks**: No clear difference
- **Arm movement ability**: Small improvement with more time
- **Leg movement ability**: Some improvement with more time
- **Safety**: No increase in serious health problems or deaths

The studies that had the biggest difference in time between groups showed better results, especially for daily activities and arm function.

## What does this mean?

Spending more time in rehabilitation may provide small benefits for movement ability, but doesn't clearly improve how well people can do everyday activities. If the extra time is substantial enough, it might help more. However, the researchers couldn't determine exactly how much extra time is needed to see meaningful improvements.

The evidence quality was limited, so more research with better-designed studies is needed to give clearer answers about the best amount of rehabilitation time after stroke.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the study

What was the goal?
- To find out if spending more time in the same type of stroke rehabilitation helps people improve daily activities and movement.

Who was studied?
- Adults after stroke.
- The review combined 21 randomized controlled trials with 1,412 people.

What did the studies compare?
- More time vs. less time in the same rehab approach (non-drug, non-surgery).
- Rehab types included upper limb, lower limb, general rehab, and walking/mobility training.
- Time in rehab varied:
  - 90 to 1,288 minutes per week
  - 3 to 7 days per week
  - 2 weeks to 6 months total

What outcomes were measured?
- Main: activities of daily living (ADLs), like dressing and bathing.
- Others: arm and leg activity, arm and leg motor impairment, serious side effects (including death).

Key findings
- Daily activities: Little to no difference with more time in rehab.
- Arm activity: Little to no difference.
- Leg activity: Little to no difference.
- Motor impairment:
  - Small benefit for the arm.
  - Possible benefit for the leg (based on very limited data).
- Safety: No rehab-related serious side effects were reported. Overall risk of serious events or death did not differ, but few studies measured this.

Important details
- Results are uncertain because many studies had quality issues and small differences in rehab time.
- Studies that had a larger gap in total rehab time between groups showed better results, especially for daily activities and arm activity.
- There isn’t enough evidence to recommend a minimum daily amount of rehab time.

What does this mean?
- Simply adding a little more time to the same rehab may not improve daily activities, but it may slightly improve motor function.
- Bigger increases in total rehab time might help, but stronger studies are needed.

Timeframe of evidence
- Studies were found through June 2021.
- Most participants were within 6 months after stroke; some were later than 6 months."
95,"Background
Water immersion during labour and birth is increasingly popular and is becoming widely accepted across many countries, and particularly in midwifery‐led care settings. However, there are concerns around neonatal water inhalation, increased requirement for admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), maternal and/or neonatal infection, and obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS). This is an update of a review last published in 2011. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of water immersion during labour and/or birth (first, second and third stage of labour) on women and their infants. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (18 July 2017), and reference lists of retrieved trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing water immersion with no immersion, or other non‐pharmacological forms of pain management during labour and/or birth in healthy low‐risk women at term gestation with a singleton fetus. Quasi‐RCTs and cluster‐RCTs were eligible for inclusion but none were identified. Cross‐over trials were not eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. Two review authors assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
This review includes 15 trials conducted between 1990 and 2015 (3663 women): eight involved water immersion during the first stage of labour; two during the second stage only; four during the first and second stages of labour, and one comparing early versus late immersion during the first stage of labour. No trials evaluated different baths/pools, or third‐stage labour management. All trials were undertaken in a hospital labour ward setting, with a varying degree of medical intervention considered as routine practice. No study was carried out in a midwifery‐led care setting. Most trial authors did not specify the parity of women. Trials were subject to varying degrees of bias: the intervention could not be blinded and there was a lack of information about randomisation, and whether analyses were undertaken by intention‐to‐treat. 
Immersion in water versus no immersion (first stage of labour) 
There is probably little or no difference in spontaneous vaginal birth between immersion and no immersion (83% versus 82%; risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.04; 6 trials; 2559 women; moderate‐quality evidence); instrumental vaginal birth (12% versus 14%; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.05; 6 trials; 2559 women; low‐quality evidence); and caesarean section (5% versus 4%; RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.79; 7 trials; 2652 women; low‐quality evidence). There is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of immersion on estimated blood loss (mean difference (MD) ‐14.33 mL, 95% CI ‐63.03 to 34.37; 2 trials; 153 women; very low‐quality evidence) and third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (3% versus 3%; RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.18; 4 trials; 2341 women; moderate‐quality evidence). There was a small reduction in the risk of using regional analgesia for women allocated to water immersion from 43% to 39% (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.99; 5 trials; 2439 women; moderate‐quality evidence). Perinatal deaths were not reported, and there is insufficient evidence to determine the impact on neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions (6% versus 6%; average RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.42 to 3.97; 2 trials; 1511 infants; I² = 36%; low‐quality evidence), or on neonatal infection rates (1% versus 1%; RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.50 to 7.94; 5 trials; 1295 infants; very low‐quality evidence). 
Immersion in water versus no immersion (second stage of labour) 
There were no clear differences between groups for spontaneous vaginal birth (98% versus 97%; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.08; 120 women; 1 trial; low‐quality evidence); instrumental vaginal birth (2% versus 2%; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.62; 1 trial; 120 women; very low‐quality evidence); caesarean section (0% versus 2%; RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.02; 1 trial; 120 women; very low‐quality evidence), and NICU admissions (8% versus 11%; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.59; 2 trials; 291 women; very low‐quality evidence). Use of regional analgesia was not relevant to the second stage of labour. Third‐ or fourth‐degree tears, and estimated blood loss were not reported in either trial. No trial reported neonatal infection but did report neonatal temperature less than 36.2°C at birth (9% versus 9%; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.30 to 3.20; 1 trial; 109 infants; very low‐quality evidence), greater than 37.5°C at birth (15% versus 6%; RR 2.62, 95% CI 0.73 to 9.35; 1 trial; 109 infants; very low‐quality evidence), and fever reported in first week (2% versus 5%; RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.82; 1 trial; 171 infants; very low‐quality evidence), with no clear effect between groups being observed. One perinatal death occurred in the immersion group in one trial (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.20; 1 trial; 120 infants; very low‐quality evidence). The infant was born to a mother with HIV and the cause of death was deemed to be intrauterine infection. 
There is no evidence of increased adverse effects to the baby or woman from either the first or second stage of labour. 
Only one trial (200 women) compared early and late entry into the water and there were insufficient data to show any clear differences. 
Authors' conclusions
In healthy women at low risk of complications there is moderate to low‐quality evidence that water immersion during the first stage of labour probably has little effect on mode of birth or perineal trauma, but may reduce the use of regional analgesia. The evidence for immersion during the second stage of labour is limited and does not show clear differences on maternal or neonatal outcomes intensive care. There is no evidence of increased adverse effects to the fetus/neonate or woman from labouring or giving birth in water. Available evidence is limited by clinical variability and heterogeneity across trials, and no trial has been conducted in a midwifery‐led setting.","Immersion in water in labour and birth
What is the issue? 
To assess the effects of water immersion (waterbirth) during labour and/or birth (first, second and third stage of labour) on women and their infants. 
Why is this important? 
Many women choose to labour and give birth in water (water immersion) and this practice is becoming more popular in many countries, particularly in midwifery‐led units. Therefore, it is important to understand more about the benefits of water immersion in labour and birth for women and their newborns, along with any risks. 
It is important to examine whether immersion in water during the first and/or the second stage of labour has the potential to maximise women's ability to manage labour pain, and to have a normal birth without increasing the risk of an adverse (harmful) event. Adverse events might be an increased risk of infection for women and/or their newborn; an increased likelihood of a serious tear to the perineum (the area between anus and vagina), and it may make estimating blood loss more difficult in the event of a haemorrhage. In assessing the benefits, we consider well‐being to cover both physical and psychological health. 
What evidence did we find? 
We included 15 trials (3663 women). All the trials compared immersion in water with no immersion in water: eight during the first stage of labour, two during the second stage of labour (waterbirth) only, four during the first and second stages of labour, and one early versus late immersion during the first stage of labour. The evidence was of moderate to very low quality. No trial compared immersion in water with other forms of pain management. 
Water immersion during the first stage of labour probably results in fewer women having an epidural, but probably makes little or no difference to the number of women who have a normal vaginal birth, instrumental birth, caesarean section or a serious perineal tear. We are uncertain about the effect on the amount of blood loss after birth because the quality of the evidence was very low. Labouring in water also may make little or no difference to babies being admitted to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) or developing infections. Stillbirths and baby deaths were not reported. 
Two trials compared water immersion during the second stage (birth) with no immersion. We found that immersion may make little or no difference in numbers of women who have a normal vaginal birth. It is uncertain whether immersion makes any difference to instrumental vaginal births, caesarean sections, numbers of babies admitted to NICU, babies' temperatures at birth and fever in babies during the first week, because the quality of the evidence was found to be very low for all of these outcomes. Epidurals were not relevant to this stage of labour. Serious perineal tears and blood loss after birth were not reported in either trial. 
Only one trial (200 women) compared women who got into the water early and late in their labour but there was not enough information to show any clear differences between the groups. 
What does this mean? 
Labouring in water may reduce the number of women having an epidural. Giving birth in water did not appear to affect mode of birth, or the number of women having a serious perineal tear. This review found no evidence that labouring in water increases the risk of an adverse outcome for women or their newborns. The trials varied in quality and further research is needed particularly for waterbirth and its use in birth settings outside hospital labour wards before we can be more certain of these effects. Research is also needed about women’s and caregivers experiences of labour and birth in water.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Water Immersion During Labor and Birth

## What was this review about?

Researchers looked at whether using water (like a birthing pool or tub) during labor and birth is safe and helpful for mothers and babies. More women are choosing to use water during childbirth, especially when midwives provide their care. However, some healthcare providers worry about possible risks, such as babies breathing in water, infections, or serious tears during birth.

## What did the researchers study?

The review included 15 studies with 3,663 healthy pregnant women who were expected to have normal births. The studies compared women who used water during labor with those who did not. Most studies looked at water use during early labor (when contractions start), while some looked at water use during the pushing stage. All studies took place in hospital labor wards between 1990 and 2015.

## What did they find?

**For water use during early labor:**
- Women who used water were just as likely to have a normal vaginal birth as those who didn't use water (about 83% in both groups)
- Women in water were slightly less likely to need an epidural or spinal pain medication (39% compared to 43%)
- There was little to no difference in cesarean births, assisted births with instruments, or serious tearing between the groups
- There was no clear evidence of increased infections or other problems for babies

**For water use during the pushing stage:**
- Only a small number of women were studied, so the results are less certain
- No clear differences were found in birth outcomes or baby health between groups

## What does this mean?

For healthy women with low-risk pregnancies, using water during early labor appears safe and may help reduce the need for epidural pain relief. The evidence doesn't show increased risks to mothers or babies. However, more research is needed, especially in settings where midwives lead the care.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the clinical trial evidence: Water immersion during labor and birth

What was studied
- Researchers reviewed randomized trials to see how laboring or giving birth in water affects parents and babies.
- Focus: Water immersion during the first and/or second stage of labor.
- Goal: Check effects on birth type, pain relief use, tears, bleeding, infections, and newborn health.

Who was included
- Healthy, low‑risk pregnant people at full term.
- Single babies (no multiples).
- All care was in hospital labor wards; no trials in midwifery‑led settings.

What was compared
- Water immersion vs no immersion (or other non‑drug pain methods).
- One trial looked at early vs late entry into water.

What outcomes were measured
- Mode of birth (spontaneous vaginal, assisted vaginal, cesarean).
- Use of epidural or spinal pain relief.
- Perineal tears (including severe tears), blood loss.
- Newborn outcomes: NICU admission, infection, temperature, deaths.

What the studies found
- First stage of labor (most data):
  - Mode of birth: Probably little or no difference between water and no water.
    - Spontaneous vaginal birth: 83% with water vs 82% without.
    - Assisted vaginal birth: 12% vs 14%.
    - Cesarean: 5% vs 4%.
  - Pain relief: Slightly fewer used regional anesthesia with water (39% vs 43%).
  - Severe perineal tears and blood loss: Not enough clear evidence of a difference.
  - Newborn outcomes (NICU, infection): Evidence too limited to show a clear difference.
- Second stage of labor:
  - No clear differences for mode of birth or NICU admissions.
  - One trial reported one newborn death in the water group; cause was judged to be an infection that began before birth.
- Early vs late entry to water:
  - Not enough data to show differences.

Safety
- Across first and second stages, the trials did not find evidence of increased harm to the parent or baby from water immersion.
- Some outcomes have low or very low‑quality evidence, so uncertainty remains.

Study size, dates, and setting
- 15 trials, 3,663 participants, conducted 1990–2015.
- Search date: July 18, 2017.
- All trials took place in hospital labor wards; none in midwifery‑led settings.

Quality of the evidence
- Overall moderate to low quality.
- Reasons: Can’t blind the intervention, and some trials lacked detailed methods.

Bottom line
- For healthy, low‑risk term pregnancies, using water during the first stage of labor probably does not change the type of birth or risk of severe tears, and may slightly reduce use of epidurals.
- Evidence for using water during the second stage of labor is limited and does not show clear differences.
- No sign of increased harm, but more high‑quality research—especially in midwifery‑led settings—is needed."

To assess the effectiveness and safety of long‐term use of MAO‐B inhibitors compared with other dopaminergic agents in early PD. 
Search methods
We searched several electronic databases including: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2009), MEDLINE (January 1950 to February 2009) and EMBASE (January 1980 to February 2009). We also handsearched neurology and movement disorders conference proceedings, checked reference lists of relevant studies and contacted other researchers. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials that compared a MAO‐B inhibitor with other dopaminergic agents (presently levodopa or dopamine agonists) in patients with early PD, where treatment and follow up lasted at least one year. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the methodological quality, and extracted the data. Additional data were provided by the original authors. Random‐effects models were used to analyse results, where appropriate. 
Main results
Only two eligible trials were included (593 patients), both of reasonable quality although one was unblinded. Both trials compared selegiline with a dopamine agonist, whilst one also compared selegiline with levodopa. MAO‐B inhibitors were not associated with a significant increase or decrease in deaths compared with levodopa (odds ratio (OR) 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 1.76) or dopamine agonists (OR 1.30; 95% CI 0.69 to 2.45). Those receiving MAO‐B inhibitors were more likely to require add‐on therapy during follow‐up than those receiving levodopa (OR 12.02; 95% CI 6.78 to 21.31) or dopamine agonist (OR 2.00; 95% CI 1.05 to 3.81). There was a reduction in motor fluctuations with MAO‐B inhibitors compared with levodopa (OR 0.55; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.94) but not dopamine agonists (OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.65 to 2.05). Withdrawals due to adverse events were less common with MAO‐B inhibitors than with dopamine agonists (OR 0.11; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.99). 
Authors' conclusions
MAO‐B inhibitors are one option for the early treatment of PD although they have weaker symptomatic effects than levodopa and dopamine agonists. They may reduce the rate of motor fluctuations compared with initial levodopa therapy and may have fewer significant adverse effects than the older agonists but data are too few to provide reliable conclusions.","Monoamine oxidase B inhibitors compared with other treatments in early Parkinson's
Many of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease are due to the loss of certain groups of nerves in the brain, which results in the lack of a chemical called dopamine. Currently, there are several different treatments available for people with newly diagnosed Parkinson's including levodopa (Sinemet or Madopar) which is converted into dopamine in the brain, dopamine agonists (for example, ropinirole and pramipexole) which mimic the action of dopamine, and monoamine oxidase B (MAO‐B) inhibitors (selegiline or rasagiline) which reduce the breakdown of dopamine in the brain. Each of these types of drugs has theoretical advantages and disadvantages. For example, although a very good treatment, levodopa can cause involuntary movements (dyskinesia), painful cramps (dystonia) and a shortened response to each dose (motor fluctuations) after a while, whilst MAO‐B inhibitors and dopamine agonists may reduce the risk of these complications but are not so good at improving the symptoms of Parkinson's. At present, therefore, it is not clear which of these three groups of drugs should be prescribed when people with early Parkinson's first need treatment. We reviewed the trials that compared giving MAO‐B inhibitors with other types of medication in people with early Parkinson's to see if there was good evidence that MAO‐B inhibitors were the best treatment to offer. However, unfortunately we only identified two trials (593 patients) so there was only limited evidence. The results showed that MAO‐B inhibitors were less good at improving the symptoms of Parkinson's than either levodopa or dopamine agonists but that they may reduce motor fluctuations compared with levodopa, though not compared with dopamine agonists. MAO‐B inhibitors did, however, have fewer major side effects than some dopamine agonists.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Comparing MAO-B Inhibitors with Other Parkinson's Medications

## What was this study about?

Researchers reviewed studies to see how well MAO-B inhibitors (a type of Parkinson's disease medication) work compared to other common Parkinson's medications when used early in treatment.

## Who was studied?

People with early-stage Parkinson's disease. The review included 593 patients from 2 studies.

## What treatments were compared?

The studies compared:
- MAO-B inhibitors (specifically selegiline)
- Levodopa (a common Parkinson's medication)
- Dopamine agonists (another type of Parkinson's medication)

Patients were followed for at least one year.

## What did the study find?

**Survival:** MAO-B inhibitors did not increase or decrease the risk of death compared to the other medications.

**Need for additional medication:** People taking MAO-B inhibitors were more likely to need additional medications added to their treatment compared to those taking levodopa or dopamine agonists.

**Movement problems:** People taking MAO-B inhibitors had fewer movement fluctuations (times when medication effects wear off) compared to those taking levodopa. However, there was no difference compared to dopamine agonists.

**Side effects:** Fewer people stopped taking MAO-B inhibitors due to side effects compared to dopamine agonists.

## What does this mean?

MAO-B inhibitors are one option for treating early Parkinson's disease, but they may not control symptoms as well as levodopa or dopamine agonists. They might help reduce certain movement problems and may cause fewer serious side effects than older dopamine agonists. However, more research is needed to draw firm conclusions.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

Purpose
- To see how well MAO-B inhibitor drugs work and how safe they are for people in the early stages of Parkinson’s disease, compared with levodopa or dopamine agonists.

Who was studied
- Adults with early Parkinson’s disease.
- Evidence came from 2 randomized trials with 593 people.

Treatments compared
- MAO-B inhibitors (mostly selegiline)
- Levodopa
- Dopamine agonists
- People were treated and followed for at least 1 year.

Main findings
- Survival: No clear difference in deaths between MAO-B inhibitors and levodopa or dopamine agonists.
- Need for extra medicine: People on MAO-B inhibitors were more likely to need an add-on drug later than those who started with levodopa or a dopamine agonist.
- Movement ups and downs (motor fluctuations): Fewer with MAO-B inhibitors than with starting levodopa; no clear difference compared with dopamine agonists.
- Stopping treatment due to side effects: Fewer people stopped MAO-B inhibitors than stopped dopamine agonists.

Safety
- No increase or decrease in deaths with MAO-B inhibitors.
- Fewer dropouts from side effects compared with dopamine agonists.
- Overall side effect details were limited.

Timing
- Results are based on at least 1 year of treatment and follow-up.

Limits of the evidence
- Only 2 trials, and one was not blinded.
- Most comparisons were with selegiline.
- Numbers were too small to be sure about some outcomes.

What this means
- MAO-B inhibitors are an option for early Parkinson’s disease.
- They may cause fewer movement ups and downs than starting with levodopa, but they usually control symptoms less strongly than levodopa or dopamine agonists.
- More research is needed to know the long-term benefits and risks."
97,"Background
Up to 80% of hospitalised patients receive intravenous therapy at some point during their admission. About 20% to 70% of patients receiving intravenous therapy develop phlebitis. Infusion phlebitis has become one of the most common complications in patients with intravenous therapy. However, the effects of routine treatments such as external application of 75% alcohol or 50% to 75% magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) are unsatisfactory. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new methods to prevent and alleviate infusion phlebitis. 
Objectives
To systematically assess the effects of external application of Aloe vera for the prevention and treatment of infusion phlebitis associated with the presence of an intravenous access device. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co‐ordinator (TSC) searched the Specialised Register (last searched February 2014) and CENTRAL (2014, Issue 1). In addition the TSC searched MEDLINE to week 5 January 2014, EMBASE to Week 6 2014 and AMED to February 2014. The authors searched the following Chinese databases until 28 February 2014: Chinese BioMedical Database; Traditional Chinese Medical Database System; China National Knowledge Infrastructure; Chinese VIP information; Chinese Medical Current Contents; Chinese Academic Conference Papers Database and Chinese Dissertation Database; and China Medical Academic Conference. Bibliographies of retrieved and relevant publications were searched. There were no restrictions on the basis of date or language of publication. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomised controlled trials (qRCTs) were included if they involved participants receiving topical Aloe vera or Aloe vera‐derived products at the site of punctured skin, with or without routine treatment at the same site. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted the data on the study characteristics, description of methodology and outcomes of the eligible trials, and assessed study quality. Data were analysed using RevMan 5.1. For dichotomous outcomes, the effects were estimated by using risk ratio (RR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous outcomes, mean differences (MD) with 95% CIs were used to estimate their effects. 
Main results
A total of 43 trials (35 RCTs and eight qRCTs) with 7465 participants were identified. Twenty‐two trials with 5546 participants were involved in prevention of Aloe vera for phlebitis, and a further 21 trials with 1919 participants were involved in the treatment of phlebitis. The included studies compared external application of Aloe vera alone or plus non‐Aloe vera interventions with no treatment or the same non‐Aloe vera interventions. The duration of the intervention lasted from one day to 15 days. Most of the included studies were of low methodological quality with concerns for selection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and publication bias. 
The effects of external application of fresh Aloe vera on preventing total incidence of phlebitis varied across the studies and we did not combine the data. Aloe vera reduced the occurrence of third degree phlebitis (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.11, P < 0.00001) and second degree phlebitis (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.31, P < 0.00001) compared with no treatment. Compared with external application of 75% alcohol, or 33% MgSO4 alone, Aloe vera reduced the total incidence of phlebitis (RR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.28, P = 0.004 and RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.78, P = 0.005 respectively) but there was no clear evidence of an effect when compared with 50% or 75% MgSO4 (total incidence of phlebitis RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.07, P = 0.07 and RR 1.10 95% CI 0.54 to 2.25, P = 0.79 respectively; third degree phlebitis (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.02, P = 0.051 and RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.08 to 18.73, P = 0.9 respectively; second degree phlebitis RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.23, P = 0.53 compared to 75% MgSO4) except for a reduction in second degree phlebitis when Aloe vera was compared with 50% MgSO4 (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.50, P < 0.0001). 
For the treatment of phlebitis, Aloe vera was more effective than 33% or 50% MgSO4 in terms of both any improvement (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.24, P < 0.0001 and RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.28, P < 0.0001 respectively) and marked improvement of phlebitis (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.70, P < 0.001 and RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.87, P = 0.0002 respectively). Compared with 50% MgSO4, Aloe vera also improved recovery rates from phlebitis (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.61, P < 0.0001). Compared with routine treatments such as external application of hirudoid, sulphonic acid mucopolysaccharide and dexamethasone used alone, addition of Aloe vera improved recovery from phlebitis (RR 1.75, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.46, P = 0.001) and had a positive effect on overall improvement (marked improvement RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.47, P = 0.0003; any improvement RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.35, P < 0.0001). Aloe vera, either alone or in combination with routine treatment, was more effective than routine treatment alone for improving the symptoms of phlebitis including shortening the time of elimination of red swelling symptoms, time of pain relief at the location of the infusion vein and time of resolution of phlebitis. Other secondary outcomes including health‐related quality of life and adverse effects were not reported in the included studies. 
Authors' conclusions
There is no strong evidence for preventing or treating infusion phlebitis with external application of Aloe vera. The current available evidence is limited by the poor methodological quality and risk of selective outcome reporting of the included studies, and by variation in the size of effect across the studies. The positive effects observed with external application of Aloe vera in preventing or treating infusion phlebitis compared with no intervention or external application of 33% or 50% MgSO4 should therefore be viewed with caution.","Aloe vera for prevention and treatment of infusion phlebitis
Infusion phlebitis is acute inflammation of a vein in the presence of intravenous therapy. In modern medical practice, more than 80% of inpatients will receive intravenous therapy during their admission, and about 20% to 70% of them may develop infusion phlebitis. Therefore infusion phlebitis is the most common complication of intravenous therapy. However, routine treatments for prevention or treatment of phlebitis such as external application of 75% alcohol or 50% to 75% magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) are unsatisfactory. 
This review examined 35 randomised controlled trials and eight quasi‐randomised controlled trials with 7465 participants. Twenty‐two trials with 5546 participants were involved in looking at prevention of phlebitis with Aloe vera, and a further 21 trials with 1919 participants were involved in looking at Aloe vera for the treatment of phlebitis. The included trials mainly compared external application of fresh Aloe vera alone or with another non‐Aloe vera treatment such as a wet compress of 75% alcohol or 33%, 50% or 75% MgSO4 with no treatment or the same non‐Aloe vera treatment. The duration of intervention lasted from one day to 15 days. Most of the included studies were of low methodological quality with concerns for selection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and publication bias. The incidence of phlebitis at varying degrees of severity as well as the resolution rate and level of improvement of phlebitis were investigated. 
The available evidence suggests that external application of fresh Aloe vera alone or combined with other non‐Aloe vera treatment may be effective for the prevention and treatment of infusion phlebitis resulting from the intravenous therapy. The conclusions should be cautiously interpreted due to the low methodological quality of the included trials.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Aloe Vera for Preventing and Treating Vein Inflammation from IV Lines

## What was this study about?

Researchers reviewed studies to see if applying aloe vera gel to the skin could help prevent or treat vein inflammation (called phlebitis) caused by IV lines in hospitals.

## Why is this important?

Most hospitalized patients receive fluids or medicine through an IV line at some point. Between 20% and 70% of these patients develop painful, swollen veins at the IV site. Current treatments like rubbing alcohol or magnesium sulfate don't always work well, so doctors are looking for better options.

## What did the researchers do?

They searched medical databases for studies testing aloe vera applied to the skin where IV lines were placed. They found 43 studies involving 7,465 people:
- 22 studies tested whether aloe vera could prevent vein inflammation
- 21 studies tested whether it could treat existing inflammation

The studies compared aloe vera (used alone or with other treatments) to no treatment or to standard treatments. Treatment lasted from 1 to 15 days.

## What did they find?

**For prevention:** Results varied widely between studies. Aloe vera appeared to reduce severe inflammation compared to no treatment, but results were mixed when compared to standard treatments like magnesium sulfate.

**For treatment:** Aloe vera seemed to work better than some standard treatments (like 33% or 50% magnesium sulfate) at improving symptoms and speeding recovery.

## What are the limitations?

Most studies had significant quality problems, making the results unreliable. The studies didn't report on quality of life or side effects.

## Bottom line

The evidence is too weak to recommend aloe vera for preventing or treating vein inflammation from IV lines. Better-quality research is needed before doctors can confidently use this treatment.",0,Plano,"Plain language summary

What is this study about?
- Researchers reviewed many trials to see if putting Aloe vera on the skin can help prevent or treat vein irritation and swelling caused by IV lines (infusion phlebitis).

Who was studied?
- Hospital patients with IV lines.
- 43 trials (35 randomized, 8 quasi-randomized) with 7,465 participants.

What treatments were tested?
- Gel or fresh Aloe vera applied to the skin at the IV site.
- Aloe vera alone, or Aloe vera plus usual treatments.
- Compared with no treatment or common treatments like alcohol swabs or magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) solutions (33%, 50%, 75%).
- Treatments lasted 1 to 15 days.

What did the review look for?
- Prevention: lowering the chance of getting IV-related vein irritation.
- Treatment: reducing swelling, pain, and helping the area heal.
- Time to symptom relief.
- Side effects and quality of life (not reported).

Main findings
- Prevention:
  - Aloe vera lowered more serious grades of vein irritation compared with no treatment.
  - Aloe vera worked better than 75% alcohol and 33% MgSO4.
  - Results were mixed when compared with 50% or 75% MgSO4.

- Treatment (once irritation had started):
  - Aloe vera worked better than 33% or 50% MgSO4 for overall improvement and “marked” improvement.
  - Adding Aloe vera to usual care helped more than usual care alone.
  - Aloe vera shortened time to reduce redness, swelling, and pain.

Safety
- The trials did not report side effects or quality-of-life outcomes.

How strong is the evidence?
- Caution is needed. Many studies were small or had design problems, and results varied.
- Because of this, there is no strong proof that Aloe vera prevents or treats IV-related vein irritation, even though some results look promising.

When was the evidence collected?
- Medical databases were searched up to February 2014."
98,"Background
People with atrial fibrillation (AF) often undergo cardiac surgery for other underlying reasons and are frequently offered concomitant AF surgery to reduce the frequency of short‐ and long‐term AF and improve short‐ and long‐term outcomes. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of concomitant AF surgery among people with AF who are undergoing cardiac surgery on short‐term and long‐term (12 months or greater) health‐related outcomes, health‐related quality of life, and costs. 
Search methods
Starting from the year when the first “maze” AF surgery was reported (1987), we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library (March 2016), MEDLINE Ovid (March 2016), Embase Ovid (March 2016), Web of Science (March 2016), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE, April 2015), and Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA, March 2016). We searched trial registers in April 2016. We used no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials evaluating the effect of any concomitant AF surgery compared with no AF surgery among adults with preoperative AF, regardless of symptoms, who were undergoing cardiac surgery for another indication. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data. We evaluated the risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We included outcome data on all‐cause and cardiovascular‐specific mortality, freedom from atrial fibrillation, flutter, or tachycardia off antiarrhythmic medications, as measured by patient electrocardiographic monitoring greater than three months after the procedure, procedural safety, 30‐day rehospitalisation, need for post‐discharge direct current cardioversion, health‐related quality of life, and direct costs. We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a fixed‐effect model when heterogeneity was low (I² ≤ 50%) and random‐effects model when heterogeneity was high (I² > 50%). We evaluated the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework to create a 'Summary of findings' table. 
Main results
We found 34 reports of 22 trials (1899 participants) with five additional ongoing studies and three studies awaiting classification. All included studies were assessed as having high risk of bias across at least one domain. The effect of concomitant AF surgery on all‐cause mortality was uncertain when compared with no concomitant AF surgery (7.0% versus 6.6%, RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.59, I² = 0%, 20 trials, 1829 participants, low‐quality evidence), but the intervention increased freedom from atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or atrial tachycardia off antiarrhythmic medications > three months (51.0% versus 24.1%, RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.63 to 2.55, I² = 0%, eight trials, 649 participants, moderate‐quality evidence). The effect of concomitant AF surgery on 30‐day mortality was uncertain (2.3% versus 3.1%, RR 1.25 95% CI 0.71 to 2.20, I² = 0%, 18 trials, 1566 participants, low‐quality evidence), but the intervention increased the risk of permanent pacemaker implantation (6.0% versus 4.1%, RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.54, I² = 0%, 18 trials, 1726 participants, moderate‐quality evidence). Investigator‐defined adverse events, including but limited to, need for surgical re‐exploration or mediastinitis, were not routinely reported but were not different between the two groups (other adverse events: 24.8% versus 23.6%, RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.34, I² = 45%, nine trials, 858 participants), but the quality of this evidence was very low. 
Authors' conclusions
For patients with AF undergoing cardiac surgery, there is moderate‐quality evidence that concomitant AF surgery approximately doubles the risk of freedom from atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or atrial tachycardia off anti‐arrhythmic drugs while increasing the risk of permanent pacemaker implantation. The effects on mortality are uncertain. Future, high‐quality and adequately powered trials will likely affect the confidence on the effect estimates of AF surgery on clinical outcomes.","Atrial fibrillation surgery for patients undergoing heart surgery
Review question  What is the evidence about potential benefits and harms of concomitant atrial fibrillation surgery in people who have atrial fibrillation and are undergoing heart surgery?  Background  People who undergo heart surgery may have an abnormal heart rhythm disorder known as atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of developing a stroke. Some patients may experience symptoms of palpitations, and many patients are recommended to take blood thinners to reduce their risk of having a stroke. Many surgeons will offer patients a procedure to treat this heart rhythm disorder at the same time of a heart surgery.  The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effects of this heart rhythm procedure, known as atrial fibrillation surgery, at the time of heart surgery.  Study characteristics  We searched scientific databases in March 2016 and found 22 randomised trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) including 1899 adults that met our inclusion criteria. Most trials had at least one methodological limitation. Funding for most trials was either not reported or came from intramural funds or national funding bodies, including professional and governmental organisations.  Key results  There is uncertainty about the effect of atrial fibrillation surgery on all‐cause mortality because rates were similar between individuals who underwent the additional procedure to treat their atrial fibrillation and those who did not. Individuals who underwent this additional procedure were twice as likely to be free from atrial fibrillation and off medications three months following the surgery (51% [range: 39% to 62%] compared with 24%), but these individuals were also more likely to need a pacemaker following the procedure (7% [range: 5% to 10%] compared with 4%). Other outcomes, including procedural safety, stroke risk, and health‐related quality of life were similar between the two groups, but there is uncertainty in the confidence of our estimates for these outcomes. We did not find any benefit of one type of atrial fibrillation surgical treatment compared with another.  Quality of the evidence  The quality of evidence supporting atrial fibrillation surgery to treat atrial fibrillation is low to moderate because of the limitations of the original studies. It is likely that further research may influence these results.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Surgery for Irregular Heart Rhythm During Other Heart Operations

## What was studied?
Researchers looked at whether performing an additional procedure to fix irregular heart rhythm (called atrial fibrillation or AF) during other planned heart surgery helps patients in the short and long term.

## Who was studied?
Adults with atrial fibrillation who were already scheduled to have heart surgery for other reasons.

## What did researchers do?
They reviewed 22 studies involving 1,899 people. They compared patients who had the extra AF procedure during their heart surgery to those who only had their planned heart surgery without the AF procedure. Researchers tracked outcomes for at least 12 months after surgery.

## What did they find?

**Possible benefits:**
- About twice as many people who had the AF procedure maintained normal heart rhythm without needing medications (51% compared to 24%)

**Possible risks:**
- More people who had the AF procedure needed a permanent pacemaker implanted afterward (6% compared to 4%)

**Unclear effects:**
- The procedure's effect on survival rates was uncertain
- Serious complications like infection or needing additional surgery were similar in both groups, but the evidence quality was limited

## What does this mean?
For people with irregular heart rhythm who need heart surgery anyway, adding the AF procedure may help restore normal heart rhythm but increases the chance of needing a pacemaker. More high-quality studies are needed to better understand the full benefits and risks.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What was studied
- Adults who already had atrial fibrillation (AF) and were having heart surgery for another reason.
- Doctors sometimes add AF surgery during the same operation (“concomitant AF surgery”) to help keep a normal heart rhythm.

Goal
- To see if adding AF surgery during heart surgery helps people stay in normal rhythm and affects health, quality of life, and costs in the short term and long term (12 months or more).

How the research was done
- Review of 22 randomized studies (1,899 people) published up to March/April 2016.
- Compared heart surgery with AF surgery added vs. heart surgery without AF surgery.
- Follow-up included checks more than 3 months after surgery and up to at least 12 months in some studies.

Main outcomes measured
- Death (within 30 days and longer term)
- Staying free of AF/flutter/tachycardia without rhythm drugs after 3+ months
- Need for a permanent pacemaker
- Other side effects (such as need for repeat surgery or infections)
- 30-day rehospitalization, need for cardioversion
- Quality of life and costs (not often reported)

Key findings
- Staying in normal rhythm without rhythm drugs after 3+ months:
  • With AF surgery: about 51%
  • Without AF surgery: about 24%
- Death:
  • Within 30 days: about 2% with AF surgery vs. 3% without (difference uncertain)
  • Longer term: about 7% with AF surgery vs. 7% without (difference uncertain)
- Need for a permanent pacemaker:
  • With AF surgery: about 6%
  • Without AF surgery: about 4%
- Other reported side effects: similar between groups, but not well reported.
- Data on quality of life, rehospitalization, cardioversion, and costs were limited.

Safety
- AF surgery increased the chance of needing a permanent pacemaker.
- Other complications appeared similar, but reporting was incomplete.

Evidence quality
- Many studies had some risk of bias.
- Confidence in results ranged from moderate (for rhythm success and pacemaker risk) to low/very low (for deaths and other side effects).

What this means
- Adding AF surgery during heart surgery makes it more likely to stay in normal rhythm without rhythm drugs after 3 months, but also makes needing a pacemaker more likely.
- Effects on survival are uncertain.
- Better, larger studies are needed to confirm these results."
99,"Background
An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an abnormal ballooning of the major abdominal artery. Some AAAs present as emergencies and require surgery; others remain asymptomatic. Treatment of asymptomatic AAAs depends on many factors, but the size of the aneurysm is important, as risk of rupture increases with aneurysm size. Large asymptomatic AAAs (greater than 5.5 cm in diameter) are usually repaired surgically; very small AAAs (less than 4.0 cm diameter) are monitored with ultrasonography. Debate continues over the roles of early repair versus surveillance with repair on subsequent enlargement in people with asymptomatic AAAs of 4.0 cm to 5.5 cm diameter. This is the fourth update of the review first published in 1999. 
Objectives
To compare mortality and costs, as well as quality of life and aneurysm rupture as secondary outcomes, following early surgical repair versus routine ultrasound surveillance in people with asymptomatic AAAs between 4.0 cm and 5.5 cm in diameter. 
Search methods
The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, two other databases, and two trials registers to 10 July 2019. We handsearched conference proceedings and checked reference lists of relevant studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials where people with asymptomatic AAAs of 4.0 cm to 5.5 cm were randomly allocated to early repair or imaging‐based surveillance at least every six months. Outcomes had to include mortality or survival. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently extracted data, which were cross‐checked by other team members. Outcomes were mortality, costs, quality of life, and aneurysm rupture. For mortality, we estimated risk ratios (RR) (endovascular aneurysm repair only), hazard ratios (HR) (open repair only), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on Mantel‐Haenszel Chi2 statistics at one and six years (open repair only) following randomisation. 
Main results
We found no new studies for this update. Four trials with 3314 participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Two trials compared early open repair with surveillance and two trials compared early endovascular repair (EVAR) with surveillance. We used GRADE to access the certainty of the evidence for mortality and cost, which ranged from high to low. We downgraded the certainty in the evidence from high to moderate and low due to risk of bias concerns and imprecision (some outcomes were only reported by one study). 
All four trials showed an early survival benefit in the surveillance group (due to 30‐day operative mortality with repair) but no evidence of differences in long‐term survival. One study compared early open repair with surveillance with an adjusted HR of 0.88 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.02, mean follow‐up 10 years; HR 1.21, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.54, mean follow‐up 4.9 years). Pooled analysis of participant‐level data from the two trials comparing early open repair with surveillance (maximum follow‐up seven to eight years) showed no evidence of a difference in survival (propensity score‐adjusted HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.18; 2226 participants; high‐certainty evidence). This lack of treatment effect did not vary to three years by AAA diameter (P = 0.39), participant age (P = 0.61), or for women (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.11). Two studies compared EVAR with surveillance and there was no evidence of a survival benefit for early EVAR at 12 months (RR 1.92, 95% CI 0.73 to 5.06; 846 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Two trials reported costs. The mean UK health service costs per participant over the first 18 months after randomisation were higher in the open repair surgery than the surveillance group (GBP 4978 in the repair group versus GBP 3914 in the surveillance group; mean difference (MD) GBP 1064, 95% CI 796 to 1332; 1090 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There was a similar difference after 12 years. The mean USA hospital costs for participants at six months after randomisation were higher in the EVAR group than in the surveillance group (USD 33,471 with repair versus USD 5520 with surveillance; MD USD 27,951, 95% CI 25,156 to 30,746; 614 participants; low‐certainty evidence). After four years, there was no evidence of a difference in total medical costs between groups (USD 48,669 with repair versus USD 46,112 with surveillance; MD USD 2557, 95% CI –8043 to 13,156; 614 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
All studies reported quality of life but used different assessment measurements and results were conflicting. 
All four studies reported aneurysm rupture. There were very few ruptures reported in the trials of EVAR versus surveillance up to three years. In the trials of open surgery versus surveillance, there were ruptures to at least six years and there were more ruptures in the surveillance group, but most of these ruptures occurred in aneurysms that had exceeded the threshold for surgical repair. 
Authors' conclusions
There was no evidence of an advantage to early repair for small AAA (4.0 cm to 5.5 cm), regardless of whether open repair or EVAR is used and, at least for open repair, regardless of patient age and AAA diameter. Thus, neither early open nor early EVAR of small AAAs is supported by currently available evidence. Long‐term data from the two trials investigating EVAR are not available, so, we can only draw firm conclusions regarding outcomes after the first few years for open repair. Research regarding the risks related to and management of small AAAs in ethnic minorities and women is urgently needed, as data regarding these populations are lacking.","Surgery for small abdominal aortic aneurysms that do not cause symptoms
Background 
An aneurysm is a ballooning of an artery (blood vessel), which, in the case of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), occurs in the major artery in the abdomen (aorta). Ruptured AAAs cause death unless surgical repair is rapid, which is difficult to achieve. Surgery is recommended for people with aneurysms bigger than 5.5 cm in diameter or who have associated pain, to relieve symptoms and reduce the risk of rupture and death. However, there are risks with surgery. Surgical repair consists of re‐lining the aorta with strong synthetic material, either by open surgery or endovascular repair (a minimally invasive keyhole procedure). Small asymptomatic (no symptoms) AAAs are at low risk of rupture and are monitored through regular imaging so they can be surgically repaired if they grow. 
Key results 
We found four well‐conducted trials that randomised 3314 participants with small (diameter 4.0 cm to 5.5 cm) asymptomatic AAAs to early repair or regular, routine ultrasounds to check for aneurysm growth (surveillance) (search current to 10 July 2019). In the surveillance group, the aneurysm was repaired if it was enlarging, reached 5.5 cm in diameter, or became symptomatic. The trials showed an early survival benefit in the surveillance group because of the number of deaths within 30 days of surgery (operative mortality). The trials found no difference in long‐term survival between early repair (open or endovascular) and surveillance over three to eight years of follow‐up. After three years, about 31% of the participants randomised to surveillance eventually had the aneurysm repaired, rising to 75% after 12 years. 
Two trials reported costs. For the first 18 months, costs were lower with surveillance than either open repair or endovascular repair. After four years, one trial found similar total medical costs for early endovascular repair and surveillance groups. After 12 years, another trial found lower hospital costs with surveillance than with open repair. 
The four studies used different ways to measure quality of life and results were conflicting. The percentage of aneurysm ruptures in the surveillance group appeared higher in the trials using open repair but these have not restricted participants to those with aortic anatomy suitable for endovascular repair. Most ruptures were in people whose previous aneurysm diameter exceeded the threshold for surgical repair. 
Reliability of the evidence 
The methods within the studies using open repair were good and the reliability of the evidence was high to moderate for the two trials comparing open repair with surveillance. For the two trials comparing endovascular repair with surveillance, the risk of bias was unclear to high and the reliability of the evidence was low. The four trials suggest no overall advantage with early surgery for small AAAs (4.0 cm to 5.5 cm). The two trials comparing early open surgical repair to surveillance found this result holds true regardless of patient age or aneurysm size (within the range of 4.0 cm to 5.5 cm diameter). Furthermore, the two trials that focused on endovascular repair, also found no benefit over surveillance. Neither early open nor early endovascular repair of small AAAs is supported by the current evidence.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Treatment Options for Small Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms

## What is this study about?

An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a bulge in the main blood vessel that carries blood through the belly. Researchers wanted to find the best way to manage small AAAs (between 4.0 and 5.5 cm wide) that aren't causing symptoms.

## What did researchers compare?

They looked at two approaches:
- **Early surgery** to repair the aneurysm right away
- **Regular monitoring** with ultrasound scans (at least every 6 months), with surgery only if the aneurysm grows larger

The study examined two types of surgery:
- Open surgery (cutting through the abdomen)
- Endovascular repair (EVAR - using tubes inserted through blood vessels)

## Who was studied?

The review included 3,314 people from four different studies who had small AAAs between 4.0 and 5.5 cm that weren't causing symptoms.

## What did they find?

**Survival rates:**
- People who had early surgery faced higher risks in the first 30 days after surgery
- Over the long term (up to 10 years), there was no difference in survival between early surgery and monitoring
- This was true regardless of the person's age or the exact size of their aneurysm

**Costs:**
- Early surgery cost more than monitoring, at least in the first 1-2 years
- For open surgery: about $1,500 more per person in the first 18 months
- For EVAR: about $28,000 more per person in the first 6 months

**Aneurysm rupture:**
- Very few aneurysms ruptured during the studies
- Most ruptures in the monitoring group happened after the aneurysm had grown large enough that surgery was recommended

## What does this mean?

For people with small AAAs (4.0 to 5.5 cm) that aren't causing symptoms, regular monitoring with ultrasound is as safe as having surgery right away. Surgery can wait until the aneurysm grows larger or starts causing problems.

## What's still unknown?

More research is needed on how to best manage small AAAs in women and people from different ethnic backgrounds, as these groups weren't well represented in the studies.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What is this about?
- This review looked at the best way to manage small abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). An AAA is a bulge in the main artery in the belly. Many people have no symptoms.
- The question: Is it better to fix small AAAs right away with surgery, or to watch them closely with regular ultrasound and operate later if they grow?

Who was studied?
- Adults with AAAs between 4.0 cm and 5.5 cm across and no symptoms.
- 4 randomized trials with 3314 people were included.

What were the options?
- Early repair: surgery soon after diagnosis
  - Open repair (traditional surgery)
  - EVAR (endovascular repair, done through blood vessels)
- Surveillance: ultrasound checks at least every 6 months, with repair if the aneurysm grows or meets set rules for surgery

What outcomes were measured?
- Death (survival)
- Aneurysm rupture
- Quality of life
- Costs
- Safety (problems around the time of surgery)

Key findings
- Survival:
  - In the short term, people who waited (surveillance) did a little better because surgery has a small risk of death in the first 30 days.
  - Over the long term, there was no clear difference in survival between early surgery and surveillance for open repair (up to about 7–10 years).
  - For EVAR, there was no survival benefit at 12 months. Long‑term EVAR results are not yet available.
- Rupture:
  - Very few ruptures happened in the EVAR vs surveillance trials in the first 3 years.
  - In open repair vs surveillance trials, more ruptures happened in the surveillance group over 6+ years, mostly after the aneurysm had grown past the size where surgery is usually advised.
- Quality of life:
  - Results were mixed and used different tools, so no clear answer.
- Costs:
  - Early open surgery cost more than surveillance in the first 18 months and remained higher over 12 years in UK data.
  - For EVAR in US data, costs were higher at 6 months with early EVAR, but by 4 years total medical costs were similar between groups.
- Safety:
  - Surgery carries a small risk of death within 30 days. This explains the early survival advantage seen with surveillance.

How strong is the evidence?
- For open repair and survival: high certainty—no long‑term survival advantage to early surgery.
- For EVAR: lower certainty and not enough long‑term data.

Timing
- Searches included studies up to July 10, 2019.
- Follow‑up in the trials ranged from 1 to about 10 years, depending on the outcome and surgery type.

Bottom line
- For small AAAs (4.0–5.5 cm), fixing them right away did not improve long‑term survival compared with regular ultrasound checks and operating later if needed. This applies to open surgery; long‑term EVAR data are still limited.
- More research is needed in women and in ethnic minority groups."
100,"Background
Low‐back pain (LBP) is a common condition and imposes a substantial economic burden upon people living in industrialized societies. A large proportion of people with chronic LBP use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), visit CAM practitioners, or both. Several herbal medicines have been purported for use in treating people with LBP. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2006. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness of herbal medicine for non‐specific LBP.
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases up to September 2014: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Clinical Trials.gov, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Portal and PubMed; checked reference lists in review articles, guidelines and retrieved trials; and personally contacted individuals with expertise in this area. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining adults (over 18 years of age) suffering from acute, sub‐acute, or chronic non‐specific LBP. The interventions were herbal medicines which we defined as plants used for medicinal purposes in any form. Primary outcome measures were pain and function. 
Data collection and analysis
A library scientist with the Cochrane Back Review Group conducted the database searches. One review author contacted content experts and acquired relevant citations. We downloaded full references and abstracts of the identified studies and retrieved a hard copy of each study for final inclusion decisions. Two review authors assessed risk of bias, GRADE criteria (GRADE 2004), and CONSORT compliance and a random subset were compared to assessments by a third individual. Two review authors assessed clinical relevance and resolved any disagreements by consensus. 
Main results
We included 14 RCTs (2050 participants) in this review. One trial on Solidago chilensis M. (Brazilian arnica) (20 participants) found very low quality evidence of reduction in perception of pain and improved flexibility with application of Brazilian arnica‐containing gel twice daily as compared to placebo gel. Capsicum frutescens cream or plaster probably produces more favourable results than placebo in people with chronic LBP (three trials, 755 participants, moderate quality evidence). Based on current evidence, it is not clear whether topical capsicum cream is more beneficial for treating people with acute LBP compared to placebo (one trial, 40 participants, low quality evidence). Another trial found equivalence of C. frutescens cream to a homeopathic ointment (one trial, 161 participants, very low quality evidence). Daily doses of Harpagophytum procumbens (devil's claw), standardized to 50 mg or 100 mg harpagoside, may be better than placebo for short‐term improvements in pain and may reduce use of rescue medication (two trials, 315 participants, low quality evidence). Another H. procumbens trial demonstrated relative equivalence to 12.5 mg per day of rofecoxib (Vioxx®) but was of very low quality (one trial, 88 participants, very low quality). Daily doses of Salix alba (white willow bark), standardized to 120 mg or 240 mg salicin, are probably better than placebo for short‐term improvements in pain and rescue medication (two trials, 261 participants, moderate quality evidence). An additional trial demonstrated relative equivalence to 12.5 mg per day of rofecoxib (one trial, 228 participants) but was graded as very low quality evidence. S. alba minimally affected platelet thrombosis versus a cardioprotective dose of acetylsalicylate (one trial, 51 participants). One trial (120 participants) examining Symphytum officinale L. (comfrey root extract) found low quality evidence that a Kytta‐Salbe comfrey extract ointment is better than placebo ointment for short‐term improvements in pain as assessed by VAS. Aromatic lavender essential oil applied by acupressure may reduce subjective pain intensity and improve lateral spine flexion and walking time compared to untreated participants (one trial, 61 participants,very low quality evidence). No significant adverse events were noted within the included trials. 
Authors' conclusions
C. frutescens (Cayenne) reduces pain more than placebo. Although H. procumbens, S. alba, S. officinale L., S. chilensis, and lavender essential oil also seem to reduce pain more than placebo, evidence for these substances was of moderate quality at best. Additional well‐designed large trials are needed to test these herbal medicines against standard treatments. In general, the completeness of reporting in these trials was poor. Trialists should refer to the CONSORT statement extension for reporting trials of herbal medicine interventions.","Herbal medicine for low‐back pain
Review question 
We examined the evidence regarding the effect of herbal medicine on pain in people with non‐specific low‐back pain (LBP). 
Background Back pain is common and up to 35% of the population can be affected in a given month. Non‐specific LBP is defined as pain between the lowest rib and the bottom of the buttocks that is not caused by serious, underlying problems such as rheumatoid arthritis, infection, fracture, cancer, or sciatica due to a ruptured disc or other pressure on nerves. Herbal medicines taken orally or applied to the skin are being used to treat many conditions including back pain. 
Study characteristics Researchers from the Cochrane Collaboration examined the evidence available up to August 5, 2013. Fourteen studies tested six herbal medications and included 2050 adults with non‐specific acute or chronic LBP. Two oral herbal medications, Harpagophytum procumbens (devil's claw) and Salix alba (white willow bark), were compared to placebo (fake or sham pills) or to rofecoxib (Vioxx®). Three topical creams, plasters, or gels, Capsicum frutescens (cayenne), Symphytum officinale L. (comfrey), and Solidago chilensis (Brazilian arnica), were compared to placebo creams or plasters and a homeopathic gel. One essential oil, lavender, was compared to no treatment. The average age of people included in the trials was 52 years and studies usually lasted three weeks. 
Key results Devil's claw, in a standardized daily dose of 50 mg or 100 mg harpagoside, may reduce pain more than placebo; a standardized daily dose of 60 mg reduced pain about the same as a daily dose of 12.5 mg of Vioxx®. While willow bark, in a standardized daily dose of 120 mg and 240 mg of salicin reduced pain more than placebo; a standardized daily dose of 240 mg reduced pain about the same as a daily dose of 12.5 mg of Vioxx® (a non‐steroidal, anti‐inflammatory drug). Cayenne was tested in several forms: in plaster form, it reduced pain more than placebo and about the same as the homeopathic gel Spiroflor SLR. Two other ointment‐based medications, S. officinale and S. chilensis appeared to reduce perception of pain more than placebo creams. Lavender essential oil applied by acupressure appeared effective in reducing pain and improving flexibility compared to conventional treatment. Adverse effects were reported, but appeared to be primarily confined to mild, transient gastrointestinal complaints or skin irritations. 
Quality of the evidence Most included trials were at low risk of bias and the quality of the evidence was mainly very low to moderate. A moderate grade of evidence was only found for C. frutescens. Trials only tested the effects of short term use (up to six weeks). Authors of eight of the included trials had a potential conflict of interest and four other authors did not disclose conflicts of interest. Vioxx® has been withdrawn from the market because of adverse effects, so all three substances should be compared to readily‐available pain medications, such as nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen, for relative effectiveness and safety. 
Conclusion Low to moderate quality evidence shows that four herbal medicines may reduce pain in acute and chronic LBP in the short‐term and have few side effects. There is no evidence yet that any of these substances are safe or efficacious for long‐term use. Large, well‐designed trials are needed to further test the efficacy of these interventions.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Herbal Medicines for Low-Back Pain

## What was this review about?

Researchers looked at whether herbal medicines can help people with low-back pain. They reviewed 14 studies that included about 2,050 adults with back pain. The studies tested different plant-based treatments, mostly creams and ointments applied to the skin.

## What herbal medicines were studied?

The review examined several herbal treatments:
- **Cayenne pepper (Capsicum)** – applied as cream or plaster
- **Devil's claw (Harpagophytum procumbens)** – taken by mouth
- **White willow bark (Salix alba)** – taken by mouth
- **Comfrey root** – applied as ointment
- **Brazilian arnica** – applied as gel
- **Lavender essential oil** – applied with acupressure

## What did the researchers find?

**Cayenne pepper cream or plaster** likely works better than inactive cream for reducing chronic back pain.

**Devil's claw** (taken daily) may reduce pain better than inactive pills and may reduce the need for pain medication.

**White willow bark** (taken daily) likely reduces pain better than inactive pills and may reduce the need for other pain medications.

**Comfrey ointment** may reduce pain better than inactive ointment.

**Brazilian arnica gel** and **lavender oil** may help with pain, but the evidence was very limited.

No serious side effects were reported in any of the studies.

## What does this mean?

Some herbal medicines, especially cayenne pepper cream, may help reduce back pain. However, more high-quality studies are needed to know how well these treatments work compared to standard pain medications. The quality of evidence varied, with some findings being more reliable than others.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary: Herbal medicines for low back pain

Goal
To find out if herbal medicines help adults with non-specific low back pain.

Who was studied
- Adults age 18+ with acute, sub-acute, or chronic low back pain
- 14 randomized studies, 2050 people
- Studies found by September 2014

What was tested
- Capsicum (Cayenne) cream or plaster (topical)
- Devil’s claw (Harpagophytum procumbens) by mouth, standardized to 50–100 mg harpagoside per day
- White willow bark (Salix alba) by mouth, standardized to 120 or 240 mg salicin per day
- Comfrey root extract ointment (Kytta-Salbe)
- Brazilian arnica gel (Solidago chilensis) twice daily
- Lavender essential oil with acupressure
- Compared to placebo (a dummy treatment), a homeopathic ointment, or rofecoxib 12.5 mg/day (a pain medicine)

Main outcomes
- Pain and function (like flexibility and walking)
- Use of “rescue” pain medicine

Key findings
- Capsicum: Probably reduces pain more than placebo in chronic low back pain (moderate-quality evidence). Not clear if it helps acute pain (low-quality evidence).
- Devil’s claw: May reduce pain short term and may lower use of rescue medicine (low-quality evidence).
- White willow bark: Probably reduces pain short term and reduces rescue medicine (moderate-quality evidence).
- Comfrey ointment: May reduce pain short term (low-quality evidence).
- Brazilian arnica gel: May reduce pain and improve flexibility (very low-quality evidence).
- Lavender oil with acupressure: May reduce pain and improve side-bending and walking time (very low-quality evidence).
- Some small studies suggested similar effects to rofecoxib, but the evidence was very weak.

Safety
- No significant adverse events were reported in these studies.
- One small study found white willow bark had minimal effect on blood clotting compared with a low (cardioprotective) dose of aspirin.
- Reporting was often incomplete, so safety data are limited.

Timing
- Most benefits, when seen, were short term.

Overall
- Capsicum has the best support among these options for chronic low back pain.
- Evidence for devil’s claw, white willow bark, comfrey, Brazilian arnica, and lavender is low to moderate quality at best.
- Larger, well-designed trials are needed to confirm benefits and safety."
101,"Background
Randomized trials investigating the efficacy of aminosalicylates for the treatment of mildly to moderately active Crohn's disease have yielded conflicting results. A systematic review was conducted to critically examine current available data on the efficacy of sulfasalazine and mesalamine for inducing remission or clinical response in these patients. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy of aminosalicylates compared to placebo, corticosteroids, and other aminosalicylates (alone or in combination with corticosteroids) for the treatment of mildly to moderately active Crohn's disease. 
Search methods
We searched PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Library from inception to June 2015 to identify relevant studies. There were no language restrictions. We also searched reference lists from potentially relevant papers and review articles, as well as proceedings from annual meetings (1991‐2015) of the American Gastroenterological Association and American College of Gastroenterology. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials that evaluated the efficacy of sulfasalazine or mesalamine in the treatment of mildly to moderately active Crohn's disease compared to placebo, corticosteroids, and other aminosalicylates (alone or in combination with corticosteroids) were included. 
Data collection and analysis
Data extraction and assessment of methodological quality was independently performed by the investigators and any disagreement was resolved by discussion and consensus. We assessed methodological quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE criteria. The primary outcome measure was a well defined clinical endpoint of induction of remission or response to treatment. Secondary outcomes included mean Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) scores, adverse events, serious adverse events and withdrawal due to adverse events. For dichotomous outcomes we calculated the pooled risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) using a random‐effects model. For continuous outcomes we calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95% CI using a random‐effects model. Sensitivity analyses based on a fixed‐effect model and duration of therapy were conducted where appropriate. 
Main results
Twenty studies (2367 patients) were included. Two studies were judged to be at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding. Eight studies were judged to be at high risk of bias due to incomplete outcomes data (high drop‐out rates) and potential selective reporting. The other 10 studies were judged to be at low risk of bias. A non‐significant trend in favour of sulfasalazine over placebo for inducing remission was observed, with benefit confined mainly to patients with Crohn's colitis. Forty‐five per cent (63/141) of sulfasalazine patients entered remission at 17‐18 weeks compared to 29% (43/148) of placebo patients (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.89, 2 studies). A GRADE analysis rated the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome as moderate due to sparse data (106 events). There was no difference between sulfasalazine and placebo in adverse event outcomes. Sulfasalazine was significantly less effective than corticosteroids and inferior to combination therapy with corticosteroids (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.86, 1 study, 110 patients). Forty‐three per cent (55/128) of sulfasalazine patients entered remission at 17 to 18 weeks compared to 60% (79/132) of corticosteroid patients (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.91; 2 studies, 260 patients). A GRADE analysis rated the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome as moderate due to sparse data (134 events). Sulfasalazine patients experienced significantly fewer adverse events than corticosteroid patients (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.82; 1 study, 159 patients). There was no difference between sulfasalazine and corticosteroids in serious adverse events or withdrawal due to adverse events. Olsalazine was less effective than placebo in a single trial (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.71; 91 patients). Low dose mesalamine (1 to 2 g/day) was not superior to placebo for induction of remission. Twenty‐three per cent (43/185) of low dose mesalamine patients entered remission at week 6 compared to 15% (18/117) of placebo patients (RR = 1.46, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.40; n = 302). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was low due to risk of bias (incomplete outcome data) and sparse data (61 events). There was no difference between low dose mesalamine and placebo in the proportion of patients who had adverse events (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.96; 3 studies, 342 patients) or withdrew due to adverse events (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.95; 3 studies, 342 patients). High dose controlled‐release mesalamine (4 g/day) was not superior to placebo, inducing a clinically non significant reduction in CDAI (MD ‐19.8 points, 95% CI ‐46.2 to 6.7; 3 studies, 615 patients), and was also inferior to budesonide (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.78; 1 study, 182 patients, GRADE = low). While high dose delayed‐release mesalamine (3 to 4.5 g/day) was not superior to placebo for induction of remission (RR 2.02, 95% CI 0.75 to 5.45; 1 study, 38 patients, GRADE = very low), no significant difference in efficacy was found when compared to conventional corticosteroids (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.36; 3 studies, 178 patients, GRADE = moderate) or budesonide (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.05; 1 study, 307 patients, GRADE = moderate). However, these trials were limited by risk of bias (incomplete outcome data) and sparse data (small numbers of events). There was a lack of good quality clinical trials comparing sulfasalazine with other mesalamine formulations. Adverse events that were commonly reported included headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea. 
Authors' conclusions
Sulfasalazine is only modestly effective with a trend towards benefit over placebo and is inferior to corticosteroids for the treatment of mildly to moderately active Crohn's disease. Olsalazine and low dose mesalamine (1 to 2 g/day) are not superior to placebo. High dose mesalamine (3.2 to 4 g/day) is not more effective than placebo for inducing response or remission. However, trials assessing the efficacy of high dose mesalamine (4 to 4.5 g/day) compared to budesonide yielded conflicting results and firm conclusions cannot be made. Future large randomized controlled trials are needed to provide definitive evidence on the efficacy of aminosalicylates in active Crohn's disease.","Aminosalicylates for treatment of active Crohn's disease
What is Crohn's disease?
Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestines. Although Crohn's disease is often found in the ileum (the lower part of the small intestine), it can occur in any part of the digestive tract, from the mouth to the anus. The most common symptoms of Crohn's disease are diarrhea and abdominal pain which often occurs in the lower right region of the abdomen. 
What are aminosalicylates?
Aminosalicylates are a family of medications with various formulations that deliver the active ingredient, mesalamine, to target sites. Aminosalicylates are thought to treat Crohn's disease by reducing the inflammation of the intestines caused by the disease. 
What did the researchers investigate?
The researchers investigated whether aminosalicylates produce remission or alleviate disease severity in individuals with mildly to moderately active Crohn's disease, and whether they cause any harms (side effects). The researchers searched the medical literature extensively up to June 10, 2015. 
What did the researchers find?
The researchers identified twenty studies including a total of 2367 participants. Ten studies were judged to be of moderate to high quality, while the other ten studies were judged to be of low quality. The studies compared aminosalicylates (sulfasalazine, mesalazine and mesalamine) with placebo (inactive pills or tablets), corticosteroids or budesonide (a steroid that is rapidly metabolized by the body and has less side‐effects than traditional corticosteroids). 
The researchers found that, comparing to placebo, sulfasalazine provides only a modest benefit for the treatment of mild to moderately active Crohn's disease and is inferior to corticosteroids for treatment of active Crohn's disease. Sulphasalazine differs from other aminosalicylates in that it contains a sulpha portion that has been eliminated in the other preparations. 
Mesalazine and mesalamine formulations are not effective for inducing remission in active Crohn's disease. Budesonide was compared to high dose mesalamine (4 to 4.5 g/day) but results were conflicting. One study found mesalamine to be inferior to budesonide and the other study found no difference in effectiveness between mesalamine and budesonide. 
Side effects are generally mild in nature and typically include headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea. 
In conclusion, sulfasalazine is only modestly effective for the treatment of active Crohn's disease. However, the existing data show little benefit for mesalamine.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Studying Medications Called Aminosalicylates for Crohn's Disease

## What was this study about?

Researchers reviewed existing studies to see how well certain medications work for people with mild to moderate Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease causes inflammation in the digestive system. The medications studied were aminosalicylates, including sulfasalazine and mesalamine.

## Who was studied?

The review included 2,367 adults and children with mild to moderate Crohn's disease from 20 different studies.

## What did researchers compare?

They compared these medications to:
- Inactive pills (placebo)
- Steroid medications (corticosteroids)
- Different types and doses of aminosalicylates
- Combinations of treatments

## What did they find?

**Sulfasalazine:**
- Showed a small benefit compared to placebo, especially for people with Crohn's disease in the colon
- 45% of people improved with sulfasalazine versus 29% with placebo after 17-18 weeks
- Did not work as well as steroid medications
- Caused fewer side effects than steroids

**Low-dose mesalamine (1-2 grams daily):**
- Did not work better than placebo

**High-dose mesalamine (3.2-4.5 grams daily):**
- Did not work better than placebo
- Results were mixed when compared to a steroid called budesonide

**Common side effects** included headache, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, and diarrhea.

## What does this mean?

These medications show limited benefit for treating mild to moderate Crohn's disease. Sulfasalazine may help some people slightly, but steroid medications work better. More research is needed to understand if these medications are truly helpful.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the research review

What was studied
- Question: Do aminosalicylate medicines (sulfasalazine and mesalamine/5-ASA) help people with mild to moderate Crohn’s disease get better?
- Who: Adults with mild to moderate Crohn’s disease.
- What was compared: These drugs vs placebo (dummy pill), corticosteroids (steroid medicines), or each other.
- Main outcome: Getting into remission or showing clear clinical improvement.
- Other outcomes: Symptom scores, side effects, serious side effects, and stopping treatment because of side effects.
- Time searched: All available studies up to June 2015.
- Evidence base: 20 randomized trials, 2,367 participants. Study quality ranged from low to moderate; some had high dropout rates.

Key results
- Sulfasalazine vs placebo:
  - Small trend toward benefit. At 17–18 weeks, 45% on sulfasalazine vs 29% on placebo reached remission (2 studies).
  - Benefit seemed mainly in Crohn’s colitis (colon involvement).
  - Side effects: About the same as placebo.
- Sulfasalazine vs corticosteroids:
  - Sulfasalazine worked less well. At 17–18 weeks, 43% on sulfasalazine vs 60% on steroids reached remission (2 studies).
  - Side effects: Fewer with sulfasalazine than with steroids. Serious side effects and stopping treatment were similar.
- Olsalazine:
  - Worked worse than placebo in one study.
- Mesalamine (5-ASA), low dose (1–2 g/day):
  - Not better than placebo for remission by week 6 (several studies).
  - Side effects and stopping due to side effects: Similar to placebo.
- Mesalamine, high dose:
  - Controlled‑release 4 g/day: Not better than placebo; worse than budesonide in one study.
  - Delayed‑release 3–4.5 g/day: Not better than placebo in a small study. Similar to conventional steroids and to budesonide in some studies, but results were limited and uncertain.
- Common side effects reported: Headache, nausea, vomiting, belly pain, and diarrhea.

Quality of the evidence
- Mixed quality. Some results are moderate quality; many are low because of small numbers or study limitations. Results for high‑dose mesalamine vs budesonide were conflicting.

What this means
- Sulfasalazine may help a bit, but it works less well than corticosteroids for mild to moderate Crohn’s disease.
- Olsalazine and low‑dose mesalamine do not seem to help.
- High‑dose mesalamine has not shown clear benefit over placebo; comparisons with steroids or budesonide are uncertain.
- More large, high‑quality trials are needed.

Study timelines
- Key remission checks were done around 6 weeks (for some mesalamine studies) and 17–18 weeks (for sulfasalazine and some steroid comparisons)."
102,"Background
Excessive blood loss and increased blood transfusion requirements may have significant impact on the short‐term and long‐term outcomes after liver transplantation. 
Objectives
To compare the potential benefits and harms of different methods of decreasing blood loss and blood transfusion requirements during liver transplantation. 
Search methods
We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and metaRegister of Controlled Trials until September 2011. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised clinical trials that were performed to compare various methods of decreasing blood loss and blood transfusion requirements during liver transplantation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently identified the trials and extracted the data. We analysed the data with both the fixed‐effect and the random‐effects model using RevMan Analysis. For each outcome we calculated the risk ratio (RR), mean difference (MD), or standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on available data analysis. We also conducted network meta‐analysis. 
Main results
We included 33 trials involving 1913 patients. The sample size in the trials varied from 8 to 209 participants. The interventions included pharmacological interventions (aprotinin, tranexamic acid, epsilon amino caproic acid, antithrombin 3, recombinant factor (rFvIIa), oestrogen, prostaglandin, epinephrine), blood substitutes (blood components rather than whole blood, hydroxy‐ethyl starch, thromboelastography), and cardiovascular interventions (low central venous pressure). All the trials were of high risk of bias. Primary outcomes were reported in at least two trials for the following comparisons: aprotinin versus control, tranexamic acid versus control, recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) versus control, and tranexamic acid versus aprotinin. There were no significant differences in the 60‐day mortality (3 trials; 6/161 (3.7%) in the aprotinin group versus 8/119 (6.7%) in the control group; RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.18 to 1.45), primary graft non‐function (2 trials; 0/128 (0.0%) in the aprotinin group versus 4/89 (4.5%) in the control group; RR 0.15; 95% CI 0.02 to 1.25), retransplantation (3 trials; 2/256 (0.8%) in the aprotinin group versus 12/178 (6.7%) in the control group; RR 0.21; 95% CI 0.02 to 1.79), or thromboembolic episodes (3 trials; 4/161 (2.5%) in the aprotinin group versus 5/119 (4.2%) in the control group; RR 0.59; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.84) between the aprotinin and control groups. There were no significant differences in the 60‐day mortality (3 trials; 4/83 (4.8%) in the tranexamic acid group versus 5/56 (8.9%) in the control group; RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.17 to 1.76), retransplantation (2 trials; 3/41 (7.3%) in the tranexamic acid group versus 3/36 (8.3%) in the control group; RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.18 to 3.48), or thromboembolic episodes (5 trials; 5/103 (4.9%) in the tranexamic acid group versus 1/76 (1.3%) in the control group; RR 2.20; 95% CI 0.38 to 12.64) between the tranexamic acid and control groups. There were no significant differences in the 60‐day mortality (3 trials; 8/195 (4.1%) in the recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) group versus 2/91 (2.2%) in the control group; RR 1.51; 95% CI 0.33 to 6.95), thromboembolic episodes (2 trials; 24/185 (13.0%) in the rFVIIa group versus 8/81 (9.9%) in the control group; RR 1.38; 95% CI 0.65 to 2.91), or serious adverse events (2 trials; 90/185 (48.6%) in the rFVIIa group versus 30/81 (37.0%) in the control group; RR 1.30; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.78) between the rFVIIa and control groups. There were no significant differences in the 60‐day mortality (2 trials; 6/91 (6.6%) in the tranexamic acid group versus 1/87 (1.1%) in the aprotinin group; RR 4.12; 95% CI 0.71 to 23.76) or thromboembolic episodes (2 trials; 4/91 (4.4%) in the tranexamic acid group versus 2/87 (2.3%) in the aprotinin group; RR 1.97; 95% CI 0.37 to 10.37) between the tranexamic acid and aprotinin groups. The remaining outcomes in the above comparisons and the remaining comparisons included only only trial under the primary outcome or the outcome was not reported at all in the trials. There were no significant differences in the mortality, primary graft non‐function, graft failure, retransplantation, thromboembolic episodes, or serious adverse events in any of these comparisons. However, the confidence intervals were wide, and it is not possible to reach any conclusion on the safety of the interventions. None of the trials reported the quality of life in patients. 
Secondary outcomes were reported in at least two trials for the following comparisons ‐ aprotinin versus control, tranexamic acid versus control, rFVIIa versus control, thromboelastography versus control, and tranexamic acid versus aprotinin. There was significantly lower allogeneic blood transfusion requirements in the aprotinin group than the control group (8 trials; 185 patients in aprotinin group and 190 patients in control group; SMD ‐0.61; 95% CI ‐0.82 to ‐0.40). There were no significant differences in the allogeneic blood transfusion requirements between the tranexamic acid and control groups (4 trials; 93 patients in tranexamic acid group and 66 patients in control group; SMD ‐0.27; 95% CI ‐0.59 to 0.06); rFVIIa and control groups (2 trials; 141 patients in rFVIIa group and 80 patients in control group; SMD ‐0.05; 95% CI ‐0.32 to 0.23); thromboelastography and control groups (2 trials; 31 patients in thromboelastography group and 31 patients in control group; SMD ‐0.73; 95% CI ‐1.69 to 0.24); or between the tranexamic acid and aprotinin groups (3 trials; 101 patients in tranexamic acid group and 97 patients in aprotinin group; SMD ‐0.09; 95% CI ‐0.36 to 0.19). The remaining outcomes in the above comparisons and the remaining comparisons included only only trial under the primary outcome or the outcome was not reported at all in the trials. There were no significant differences in the blood loss, transfusion requirements, hospital stay, or intensive care unit stay in most of the comparisons. 
Authors' conclusions
Aprotinin, recombinant factor VIIa, and thromboelastography groups may potentially reduce blood loss and transfusion requirements. However, risks of systematic errors (bias) and risks of random errors (play of chance) hamper the confidence in this conclusion. We need further well‐designed randomised trials with low risk of systematic error and low risk of random errors before these interventions can be supported or refuted.","Methods to decrease blood loss and transfusion requirements for liver transplantation
The liver is the powerhouse of the body. It acts as a store of energy and a centre of metabolic activity. Liver transplantation is the main treatment for severe liver disease resulting in destruction of the liver (which can happen suddenly or over a period of time) due to various causes including alcoholism, viral infections, and autoimmune diseases. Liver transplantation is a major surgical procedure and is associated with significant loss of blood. Various methods have been used to decrease blood loss and transfusion requirements in patients undergoing liver transplantation, with a view to improve the results of liver transplantation. We performed a detailed review of the medical literature (available until September 2011) to determine the benefits and harms of different methods of decreasing blood loss and transfusion requirements in patients undergoing liver transplantation. We sought evidence from randomised clinical trials only, as when conducted properly such studies provide the best evidence. Two authors independently identified the trials and obtained the information from the trials. 
We included 33 trials involving 1913 patients. The number of patients included in the trials varied from 8 to 209. The comparisons included various drugs that affect the blood clotting (congealing) such as aprotinin, tranexamic acid; blood substitutes (blood components rather than whole blood); use of thromboelastography (a bedside measure of blood clot formation); and lowering the pressure in the veins with an aim to decrease the blood loss from veins. We found no significant difference in the risk of death or graft loss, or in the major complication rates between the compared groups in any of the comparisons. Quality of life was not reported in any of the trials. There does not appear to be any consistency in the results between blood loss and blood transfusion requirements. Aprotinin, tranexamic acid, recombinant factor VIIa, low central venous pressure, and thromboelastography may lower blood loss and transfusion requirements. However, these findings are based on few trials with a high risk of bias (systematic overestimation of benefits) and high risk of play of chance (random error due to small number of patients). There were no differences in the hospital stay or intensive care unit stay in any of the comparisons. Nor was there any significant difference in the intensive therapy unit stay, or hospital stay between the compared groups. Again, most of the trials were of high risk of systematic errors (a potential to arrive at wrong conclusions because of the way the trial was conducted) and random errors (a potential to arrive at wrong conclusions because of play of chance). 
Aprotinin is a drug which has been withdrawn from market since there was a suspicion that it increased death after major heart operations. The results from this review do not reveal any increased mortality with aprotinin in the liver transplantation setting although one has to interpret this information with caution because of the few patients included in the trial. We are unable to advocate or refute any method of decreasing blood loss and transfusion requirements in patients undergoing liver transplantation. Further well designed trials with low risk of systematic error and low risk of random errors are necessary.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Methods to Reduce Blood Loss During Liver Transplant Surgery

## What was this study about?

Researchers reviewed studies that tested different ways to reduce bleeding and the need for blood transfusions during liver transplant surgery. Too much blood loss during surgery can affect how well patients recover.

## What methods were studied?

The researchers looked at 33 studies involving 1,913 liver transplant patients. These studies tested:
- Medications that help blood clot (like aprotinin and tranexamic acid)
- Blood substitutes and special blood products
- Techniques to control blood pressure during surgery

## What did they find?

**Safety outcomes:** The studies looked at whether these methods affected:
- Deaths within 60 days after surgery
- Whether the new liver worked properly
- Blood clots
- Need for another transplant

For the most commonly tested methods, there were no clear differences in these safety outcomes between treatment and control groups. However, the studies were too small to know for certain if these methods are safe.

**Blood loss outcomes:** 
- Aprotinin (a clotting medication) appeared to reduce the amount of blood transfusions needed
- Other methods showed mixed or unclear results

## What does this mean?

The quality of all studies reviewed had significant problems in how they were designed and conducted. The number of patients in most studies was small, making it hard to draw firm conclusions.

Some methods might help reduce bleeding during liver transplant surgery, but more high-quality research is needed before doctors can confidently recommend them. Patients considering liver transplant should discuss blood loss management options with their surgical team.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the research

What was studied
- Researchers looked at ways to reduce blood loss and the need for blood transfusions during liver transplant surgery.
- They reviewed 33 randomized trials with 1,913 people having liver transplants. The studies were published up to September 2011.

Who was in the studies
- People undergoing liver transplant surgery. Trial sizes ranged from 8 to 209 participants.

What treatments were tested
- Medicines: aprotinin, tranexamic acid, epsilon-aminocaproic acid, antithrombin III, recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa), estrogen, prostaglandin, epinephrine.
- Other methods: using certain blood products instead of whole blood, hydroxyethyl starch, thromboelastography (a test to guide blood product use), and keeping central venous pressure low during surgery.

Main outcomes measured
- Death within 60 days, graft (new liver) not working, need for another transplant, blood clots, serious side effects.
- Amount of blood transfused, blood loss, time in intensive care and hospital.
- Quality of life (not reported in any trial).

Key results
- Survival and major complications: No clear differences were found for aprotinin, tranexamic acid, rFVIIa, or when comparing tranexamic acid to aprotinin. Results were similar for blood clots and serious side effects.
- Blood transfusions:
  - Aprotinin: people needed fewer donor blood transfusions than control (across 8 trials).
  - Tranexamic acid, rFVIIa, thromboelastography: no clear reduction compared with control in the trials that reported this.
- Hospital and ICU stay: No consistent differences.
- Quality of life: Not reported.

Safety
- No clear increase or decrease in deaths, graft failure, blood clots, or serious side effects was shown for any method. However, many trials were small and at high risk of bias. The results had wide ranges, so safety is uncertain.

Timing of follow-up
- Most key outcomes were measured up to 60 days after surgery.

Bottom line
- Aprotinin may reduce the need for blood transfusions during liver transplant, but its overall benefits and risks are unclear.
- For other methods (including tranexamic acid, rFVIIa, thromboelastography), there is no clear proof of benefit or harm.
- Better, larger, well-designed trials are needed to know which methods are effective and safe."
103,"Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma, also called malignant hepatoma, is a primary malignancy of the liver. Despite regular surveillance conducted in high‐risk populations, most people with hepatocellular carcinoma are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Consequently, only a minority of people with the disease are suitable for surgical resection when diagnosed. 
Objectives
To compare the beneficial and harmful effects of transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) followed by three‐dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3‐DCRT) versus TACE alone in adults with primary hepatocellular carcinoma, considered unsuitable for surgical resection. 
Search methods
We searched The Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Science Citation Index Expanded, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index – Science up to 31 May 2018. We checked reference lists for all included studies and related reviews for further relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised clinical trials comparing TACE followed by 3‐DCRT versus TACE alone in people with primary hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures as suggested by Cochrane. We presented the results of the fixed‐effect model in the absence of statistical heterogeneity. Otherwise, we reported the results from the random‐effects model meta‐analysis. We assessed risk of bias of the included trials using bias risk domains and presented the review results incorporating the methodological quality of the trials using GRADE. Our main conclusions were based on the analysis up to three years' follow‐up. 
Main results
We identified eight randomised clinical trials (632 participants) that fulfilled our inclusion criteria. All eight trials were at high risk of bias, and we rated the evidence as low to very low certainty. The mean age ranged from 16 years to 78 years. The proportion of men ranged from 60% to 75% and the proportion of people with stage III primary hepatocellular carcinoma ranged from 22% to 85%. The median follow‐up duration was 12 months (2 months to 38 months). 
TACE followed by 3‐DCRT compared with TACE alone may have reduced all‐cause mortality at three years' follow‐up (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 0.88; 552 participants; 7 trials; low‐certainty evidence). TACE followed by 3‐DCRT compared with TACE alone may reduce the proportion of participants without tumour response (complete response plus partial response) (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.61; 632 participants; 8 trials; low‐certainty evidence). Data, from one trial on health‐related quality of life, favoured the TACE followed by 3‐DCRT group, but the provided data were ill‐defined (very low‐certainty evidence). None of the trials reported serious adverse events. The results on non‐serious adverse events were as follows: TACE followed by 3‐DCRT compared with TACE alone showed no difference in the results for proportion of participants with leukopenia (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.34; 438 participants; 5 trials; very low‐certainty evidence) and serum transaminases elevation (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.66 to 4.27; 280 participants; 4 trials; very low‐certainty evidence). However, the proportion of participants with total bilirubin elevation was larger in the TACE followed by 3‐DCRT group than in the TACE alone group (RR 2.69, 95% CI 1.34 to 5.40; 172 participants; 2 trials; very low‐certainty evidence). The rate of participants with serum alpha‐fetoprotein (AFP) without decline or normalisation was significantly lower in the TACE followed by 3‐DCRT group than in the TACE group, but these data were from one trial only (Chi² = 7.24, P = 0.007; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
TACE followed by 3‐DCRT may be associated with lower all‐cause mortality and increased tumour response, despite the increased toxicity expressed by a higher rise of total bilirubin. Our review findings should be considered with caution because of the methodological weaknesses in the included trials, resulting in low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence. Data on serious adverse events and health‐related quality of life are lacking. We are also very much uncertain in the results of the reported non‐serious adverse events. High‐quality trials are needed to assess further the role of TACE followed by 3‐DCRT for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.","Transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation followed by three‐dimensional conformal radiotherapy for primary hepatocellular carcinoma 
Background 
Hepatocellular carcinoma, also called malignant hepatoma, is a primary liver cancer. Despite regular surveillance conducted in high‐risk populations, most people with hepatocellular carcinoma are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Consequently, a minority of the people with the disease are suitable for surgical resection (removal). Since transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE; a procedure to restrict the blood supply to a tumour) was introduced as a palliative (to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life) treatment in people with unresectable liver cancer, it has become one of the most common forms of intervention. More recently, the modern radiation technology of three‐dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3‐DCRT), which shapes the radiation beams to the shape of the tumour, has been used to improve the adverse effects of conventional radiotherapy. It is predicted that the combination of TACE followed by 3‐DCRT could enhance the treatment effect for hepatocellular carcinoma. To date, little is known about the benefits and harms of the combination of TACE followed by 3‐DCRT, and current studies are still controversial for the efficacy of the combination of TACE followed by 3‐DCRT compared with TACE alone. The aim of this Cochrane systematic review was to compare the benefits and harms of TACE followed by 3‐DCRT versus TACE alone in people with primary hepatocellular carcinoma, considered to be unsuitable for surgical removal. 
Study characteristics 
The review authors searched the medical literature in order to clarify the role of the combination of TACE followed by 3‐DCRT for the treatment of primary hepatocellular carcinoma, and to compare their benefits and harms with TACE alone. We collected and analysed data from randomised clinical trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) of people with primary hepatocellular carcinoma who were able to receive TACE or 3‐DCRT. Evidence is current to May 2018. 
Key results and quality of evidence 
The review included eight trials with 632 participants. All trials were at high risk of bias. TACE followed by 3‐DCRT appeared to be superior to TACE in improving death from any cause and tumour response, despite an increased toxicity expressed by a higher rise of total bilirubin (measured by a blood test to see how well the liver is working). No trials reported serious side effects. One trial reported health‐related quality of life (a measure of a person's satisfaction with their life and health), but this was ill‐defined. The review findings were uncertain because the included trials had methodological weaknesses. More high‐quality randomised clinical trials are needed to confirm or complete the review findings.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Two Treatments for Liver Cancer That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery

## What was this study about?

Researchers reviewed studies comparing two treatments for people with liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) that could not be removed with surgery:
- **Treatment 1**: A procedure called TACE (transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation) combined with a type of radiation therapy called 3-DCRT
- **Treatment 2**: TACE alone

TACE is a procedure that delivers chemotherapy drugs directly to the tumor through blood vessels and blocks blood flow to the cancer. 3-DCRT is a focused radiation treatment.

## Who was studied?

The review included 632 adults from 8 studies. Participants were ages 16 to 78 years old, and 60-75% were men. Most had advanced liver cancer. Researchers followed participants for an average of 12 months (ranging from 2 to 38 months).

## What did the study find?

After up to 3 years of follow-up:

**Potential benefits of combining TACE with radiation:**
- Fewer deaths compared to TACE alone
- Better tumor response (tumors shrank or disappeared more often)

**Side effects:**
- Higher levels of bilirubin (a substance that can indicate liver problems) in people receiving the combination treatment
- Similar rates of low white blood cells and liver enzyme changes between both groups

## Important limitations

- The quality of evidence was low to very low
- None of the studies reported serious side effects in a standard way
- Only one study looked at quality of life, and the information was unclear
- More high-quality studies are needed

## Bottom line

The combination of TACE plus radiation therapy may help people with inoperable liver cancer live longer and respond better to treatment, but it may also cause more liver-related side effects. These findings are uncertain due to study quality issues.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

Purpose
- To see if adding targeted radiation (called 3‑D conformal radiotherapy, or 3‑DCRT) after a liver artery treatment (called TACE) helps adults with liver tumors that cannot be removed by surgery, compared with TACE alone.

Who was studied
- Adults with primary liver cancer not suitable for surgery.
- 8 randomized studies, 632 people total.
- Most were men; ages ranged from teens to older adults.

Treatments compared
- TACE followed by 3‑DCRT (TACE + radiation)
- TACE alone

What researchers measured
- Death from any cause up to 3 years
- Tumor response (whether the tumor shrank or disappeared)
- Health-related quality of life
- Side effects (serious and non‑serious lab changes)

Timeframe
- Follow‑up ranged from 2 to 38 months; main results focused on up to 3 years.

Key results
- Survival: TACE + radiation may lower the chance of death by 3 years compared with TACE alone. (Low certainty)
- Tumor response: More people had tumor shrinkage with TACE + radiation. (Low certainty)
- Quality of life: One study suggested better scores with TACE + radiation, but the data were unclear. (Very low certainty)

Safety
- Serious side effects: None of the studies reported them.
- Non‑serious lab changes:
  - Low white blood cells: about the same in both groups. (Very low certainty)
  - Liver enzymes (transaminases): about the same. (Very low certainty)
  - Bilirubin: rose more often with TACE + radiation. (Very low certainty)
- A tumor marker (AFP) was more likely to improve with TACE + radiation in one study.

How strong is the evidence?
- Overall certainty is low to very low because of study weaknesses.
- Results should be interpreted with caution.
- Better, larger trials are needed to confirm benefits and fully assess safety."
104,"Background
In most pregnancies that miscarry, arrest of embryonic or fetal development occurs some time (often weeks) before the miscarriage occurs. Ultrasound examination can reveal abnormal findings during this phase by demonstrating anembryonic pregnancies or embryonic or fetal death. Treatment has traditionally been surgical but medical treatments may be effective, safe, and acceptable, as may be waiting for spontaneous miscarriage. This is an update of a review first published in 2006. 
Objectives
To assess, from clinical trials, the effectiveness and safety of different medical treatments for the termination of non‐viable pregnancies. 
Search methods
For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (24 October 2018) and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials comparing medical treatment with another treatment (e.g. surgical evacuation), or placebo, or no treatment for early pregnancy failure. Quasi‐randomised studies were excluded. Cluster‐randomised trials were eligible for inclusion, as were studies reported in abstract form, if sufficient information was available to assess eligibility. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
Forty‐three studies (4966 women) were included. The main interventions examined were vaginal, sublingual, oral and buccal misoprostol, mifepristone and vaginal gemeprost. These were compared with surgical management, expectant management, placebo, or different types of medical interventions were compared with each other. The review includes a wide variety of different interventions which have been analysed across 23 different comparisons. Many of the comparisons consist of single studies. We limited the grading of the quality of evidence to two main comparisons: vaginal misoprostol versus placebo and vaginal misoprostol versus surgical evacuation of the uterus. Risk of bias varied widely among the included trials. The quality of the evidence varied between the different comparisons, but was mainly found to be very‐low or low quality. 
Vaginal misoprostol versus placebo 
Vaginal misoprostol may hasten miscarriage when compared with placebo: e.g. complete miscarriage (5 trials, 305 women, risk ratio (RR) 4.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.01 to 5.94; low‐quality evidence). No trial reported on pelvic infection rate for this comparison. Vaginal misoprostol made little difference to rates of nausea (2 trials, 88 women, RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.43 to 4.40; low‐quality evidence), diarrhoea (2 trials, 88 women, RR 2.21, 95% CI 0.35 to 14.06; low‐quality evidence) or to whether women were satisfied with the acceptability of the method (1 trial, 32 women, RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.64; low‐quality evidence). It is uncertain whether vaginal misoprostol reduces blood loss (haemoglobin difference > 10 g/L) (1 trial, 50 women, RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.38 to 4.12; very‐low quality) or pain (opiate use) (1 trial, 84 women, RR 5.00, 95% CI 0.25 to 101.11; very‐low quality), because the quality of the evidence for these outcomes was found to be very low. 
Vaginal misoprostol versus surgical evacuation 
Vaginal misoprostol may be less effective in accomplishing a complete miscarriage compared to surgical management (6 trials, 943 women, average RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.50; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.03, I² = 46%; low‐quality evidence) and may be associated with more nausea (1 trial, 154 women, RR 21.85, 95% CI 1.31 to 364.37; low‐quality evidence) and diarrhoea (1 trial, 154 women, RR 40.85, 95% CI 2.52 to 662.57; low‐quality evidence). There may be little or no difference between vaginal misoprostol and surgical evacuation for pelvic infection (1 trial, 618 women, RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.37; low‐quality evidence), blood loss (post‐treatment haematocrit (%) (1 trial, 50 women, mean difference (MD) 1.40%, 95% CI ‐3.51 to 0.71; low‐quality evidence), pain relief (1 trial, 154 women, RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.46; low‐quality evidence) or women's satisfaction/acceptability of method (1 trial, 45 women, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.11; low‐quality evidence). 
Other comparisons 
Based on findings from a single trial, vaginal misoprostol was more effective at accomplishing complete miscarriage than expectant management (614 women, RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.45). There was little difference between vaginal misoprostol and sublingual misoprostol (5 trials, 513 women, average RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.16; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.10, I² = 871%; or between oral and vaginal misoprostol in terms of complete miscarriage at less than 13 weeks (4 trials, 418 women), average RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.03; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.13, I² = 90%). However, there was less abdominal pain with vaginal misoprostol in comparison to sublingual (3 trials, 392 women, RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.74). A single study (46 women) found mifepristone to be more effective than placebo: miscarriage complete by day five after treatment (46 women, RR 9.50, 95% CI 2.49 to 36.19). However the quality of this evidence is very low: there is a very serious risk of bias with signs of incomplete data and no proper intention‐to‐treat analysis in the included study; and serious imprecision with wide confidence intervals. Mifepristone did not appear to further hasten miscarriage when added to a misoprostol regimen (3 trials, 447 women, RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.47). 
Authors' conclusions
Available evidence from randomised trials suggests that medical treatment with vaginal misoprostol may be an acceptable alternative to surgical evacuation or expectant management. In general, side effects of medical treatment were minor, consisting mainly of nausea and diarrhoea. There were no major differences in effectiveness between different routes of administration. Treatment satisfaction was addressed in only a few studies, in which the majority of women were satisfied with the received intervention. Since the quality of evidence is low or very low for several comparisons, mainly because they included only one or two (small) trials; further research is necessary to assess the effectiveness, safety and side effects, optimal route of administration and dose of different medical treatments for early fetal death.","Medical treatment for early fetal death (less than 24 weeks)
What is the issue? 
A miscarriage is the spontaneous death and/or expulsion of an embryo or fetus from the uterus before it is able to survive on its own. This natural death of an embryo or fetus ('non‐viable pregnancy' or 'intrauterine fetal death', depending on the duration of pregnancy) can be identified by ultrasound before symptoms like blood loss and abdominal pain occur. Sometimes an embryo may not have even developed ('empty sac'). In the past, treatment for a deceived embryo/fetus, has usually been by dilatation and curettage (D&C) surgery, but drugs have now been developed to replace the need for surgery which may be helpful for the expulsion to happen. Misoprostol and gemeprost are synthetic prostaglandin E analogues that can stimulate expulsion of the embryo/fetus from the uterus. Mifepristone blocks the activity of progesterone, a hormone that supports pregnancy. These and similar drugs may be useful in bringing on expulsion in women with a non‐viable pregnancy and can be used before 24 weeks' gestation. 
Waiting for spontaneous expulsion is also possible. Women who retain the dead embryo/fetus can experience severe blood loss or develop an infection of the womb. These are rare complications. Gastro‐intestinal side effects such as nausea and diarrhoea, cramping or abdominal pain and fever have been reported with misoprostol. 
Why is this important? 
Surgical treatment has the disadvantage of requiring anaesthesia. It carries risks of damage to the uterus or cervix and possible development of fibrous tissue in the inner lining of the uterus. These can be avoided if the non‐viable pregnancy is treated with medication, or if the woman is able to wait for a spontaneous expulsion. 
We set out to determine if medical treatment is as good as, or better than, surgical treatment or expectant management (waiting for the expulsion to happen). Furthermore, we compared different doses and administration routes in order to detect which regimen most often induces a complete miscarriage with the fewest side effects. 
What evidence did we find? 
For this updated review, 43 randomised clinical trials involving 4966 women with non‐viable pregnancies at less than 24 weeks' gestation were included. The main interventions examined were vaginal, sublingual, oral and buccal misoprostol, mifepristone and vaginal gemeprost. These were compared with surgical management, expectant management, placebo, or different types of medical interventions were compared with each other. Fourteen comparisons had only one trial. The studies varied in risk of bias. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low or low for most comparisons. 
Vaginal misoprostol may hasten miscarriage when compared with placebo but made little difference to rates of nausea, diarrhoea or to whether women were satisfied with the acceptability of the method. It is uncertain whether vaginal misoprostol when compared to placebo reduces blood loss or pain because the quality of the evidence for these outcomes was found to be very low. 
Vaginal misoprostol was less effective in accomplishing a complete miscarriage compared to surgical management and may be associated with more nausea and diarrhoea. Vaginal misoprostol made little difference to pelvic infection, blood loss, pain or women's satisfaction/acceptability of method when compared to surgical management. 
There was little difference between different routes of giving misoprostol when trials compared the vaginal route with placing it under the tongue or between oral and vaginal misoprostol. Single studies found mifepristone to be more effective than placebo and vaginal misoprostol to be more effective than expectant management. However the quality of this evidence was found to be very low and so we are not convinced of these findings. Mifepristone did not appear to provide any additional benefit when added to misoprostol. 
What does this mean? 
Using misoprostol as an alternative to surgical treatment may decrease the need for surgery for women with an early fetal death. The use of misoprostol can have some side effects such as nausea and diarrhoea, but risks of severe blood loss or pelvic infection were not higher compared to surgical treatment or expectant management. Further research is needed on drug doses, routes of administration and potential adverse effects, including future fertility, and also on women's views of drug treatment, surgery and waiting for spontaneous miscarriage.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Medical Treatment Options for Early Pregnancy Loss

## What is this study about?

When a pregnancy stops developing in the early weeks, it's called early pregnancy loss or miscarriage. Sometimes the body doesn't naturally expel the pregnancy tissue right away. Doctors can confirm this through ultrasound. This review looked at different ways to help complete the miscarriage process.

## What treatments were studied?

Researchers reviewed 43 studies involving 4,966 women. They compared several approaches:

- **Medical treatment**: Using medications (mainly misoprostol, given through different routes like vaginally, under the tongue, by mouth, or in the cheek)
- **Surgical treatment**: A procedure to remove pregnancy tissue
- **Expectant management**: Waiting for the body to naturally complete the miscarriage
- **Placebo**: An inactive treatment for comparison

## What did they find?

**Medical treatment compared to placebo:**
- Vaginal misoprostol helped complete the miscarriage more effectively than placebo
- Side effects like nausea and diarrhea were similar between groups
- Most women found the treatment acceptable

**Medical treatment compared to surgery:**
- Surgery was more effective at completing the miscarriage than vaginal misoprostol
- Medical treatment caused more nausea and diarrhea
- Infection rates, blood loss, and pain relief were similar between both approaches
- Women's satisfaction was similar for both methods

**Medical treatment compared to waiting:**
- Vaginal misoprostol was more effective than waiting for natural miscarriage

**Different medication routes:**
- Various ways of taking misoprostol (vaginal, under the tongue, by mouth) worked similarly
- Vaginal misoprostol caused less abdominal pain than medication taken under the tongue

## What does this mean?

Medical treatment with misoprostol appears to be a reasonable alternative to surgery or waiting for natural miscarriage. Side effects are generally mild. However, more research is needed because many findings are based on small studies.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the review

Purpose
- To find out how well and how safely medicines end early pregnancies that are no longer developing, compared with surgery or waiting.

Who was studied
- 43 randomized trials with 4,966 women who had an early pregnancy that had stopped developing (found by ultrasound).

Treatments studied
- Medicines: misoprostol (vaginal, sublingual, oral, buccal), mifepristone, and vaginal gemeprost.
- Compared with: surgical evacuation, expectant (waiting) management, or placebo (no active medicine).

How the research was done
- Trials were searched up to October 24, 2018.
- Two reviewers checked studies and rated evidence quality. Many results were low or very low quality.

Main findings
- Vaginal misoprostol vs placebo:
  - More women had a complete miscarriage with misoprostol.
  - Nausea and diarrhea were similar to placebo.
  - Not enough good data on infection, bleeding, or pain.

- Vaginal misoprostol vs surgical evacuation:
  - Surgery led to complete miscarriage more often than misoprostol.
  - Nausea and diarrhea were more common with misoprostol.
  - Infection, bleeding, pain relief, and satisfaction were similar between groups (based on limited data).

- Vaginal misoprostol vs waiting:
  - Misoprostol led to complete miscarriage more often than waiting (single study).

- Different ways to take misoprostol:
  - Vaginal and sublingual/oral routes worked about the same for completeness.
  - Vaginal misoprostol caused less abdominal pain than sublingual in some studies.

- Mifepristone:
  - One small study showed mifepristone alone led to more complete miscarriage by day 5 than placebo, but the evidence was very weak.
  - Adding mifepristone to misoprostol did not clearly speed miscarriage.

Safety and side effects
- Common side effects with medicines: nausea and diarrhea; usually mild.
- Infection rates were similar between misoprostol and surgery in limited data.
- Bleeding and pain were generally similar across groups, but evidence was limited.

Timing
- In one small study, mifepristone led to completion by day 5 more often than placebo.
- Misoprostol generally helped the body pass tissue sooner than placebo; exact timing varied.

What this means
- Vaginal misoprostol is a reasonable alternative to surgery or waiting for many people.
- Surgery is more likely to complete the process in one step.
- Most side effects with medicines are mild.

Evidence quality
- Many comparisons came from small or single studies. Overall evidence was mostly low or very low quality.
- More high-quality research is needed to find the best medicine, dose, and route."
105,"Background
End‐stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a chronic, debilitative and progressive illness that may need interventions such as dialysis, transplantation, dietary and fluid restrictions. Most patients with ESKD will require renal replacement therapy, such as kidney transplantation or maintenance dialysis. Advance care planning traditionally encompass instructions via living wills, and concern patient preferences about interventions such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation and feeding tubes, or circumstances around assigning surrogate decision makers. Most people undergoing haemodialysis are not aware of advance care planning and few patients formalise their wishes as advance directives and of those who do, many do not discuss their decisions with a physician. Advance care planning involves planning for future healthcare decisions and preferences of the patient in advance while comprehension is intact. It is an essential part of good palliative care that likely improves the lives and deaths of haemodialysis patients. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to determine whether advance care planning in haemodialysis patients, compared with no or less structured forms of advance care planning, can result in fewer hospital admissions or less use of treatments with life‐prolonging or curative intent, and if patient's wishes were followed at end‐of‐life. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 27 June 2016 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. We also searched the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Social Work Abstracts (OvidSP). 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs (RCTs in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) looking at advance care planning versus no form of advance care planning in haemodialysis patients was considered for inclusion without language restriction. 
Data collection and analysis
Data extraction was carried out independently by two authors using standard data extraction forms. Studies reported in non‐English language journals were translated before assessment. Where more than one publication of one study exists, reports were grouped together and the publication with the most complete data was used in the analyses. Where relevant outcomes are only published in earlier versions these data were used. Any discrepancies between published versions were highlighted. Non‐randomised controlled studies were excluded. 
Main results
We included two studies (three reports) that involved 337 participants which investigated advance care planning for people with ESKD. Neither of the included studies reported outcomes relevant to this review. Study quality was assessed as suboptimal. 
Authors' conclusions
We found sparse data that were assessed at suboptimal quality and therefore we were unable to formulate conclusions about whether advance care planning can influence numbers of hospital admissions and treatment required by people with ESKD, or if patients' advance care directives were followed at end‐of‐life. Further well designed and adequately powered RCTs are needed to better inform patient and clinical decision‐making about advance care planning and advance directives among people with ESKD who are undergoing dialysis.","Advance care planning for haemodialysis patients
Background 
People with chronic kidney disease and end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD) have irreversible kidney damage and require renal replacement therapy. In developed countries, haemodialysis has become the most common treatment for people with ESKD. Despite its life‐saving potential, haemodialysis can be a significant physical and psychological burden to patients. Advance care planning is the process of planning for a person’s future health and personal care decisions in terms of level of healthcare and quality of life the person would want, should for any reason, the person becomes unable to participate in decision‐making. Advance care goals can change over time and advance care planning assists in addressing these changes and readdress care goals over time. This helps to ensure that individual choices are respected in future medical treatment in an event where the person cannot communicate or make decisions. 
We wanted to find out if advance care planning can improve health outcomes among people with ESKD in terms of use of resuscitation measures such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and withdrawal from dialysis. Additionally, we wanted to find out whether patient wishes were followed in the end of life period. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the literature up to June 2016 and found two studies (three reports) that involved 337 patients which investigated use of patient‐centred advanced care planning (PC‐ACP) and peer mentoring interventions. 
Key results 
Neither study addressed our questions concerning use of life‐prolonging treatments such as resuscitation, death in hospital or withdrawal from dialysis. It remains uncertain if advance care planning can improve health outcomes among ESKD patients. More research is required to better inform use of PC‐ACP for people receiving haemodialysis treatment.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Advance Care Planning for People on Dialysis

## What was this review about?

Researchers wanted to know if advance care planning helps people with severe kidney disease who are on dialysis (a treatment that filters the blood when kidneys don't work). Advance care planning means talking about and writing down what kind of medical care someone would want in the future, especially near the end of life.

## Why is this important?

People with severe kidney disease often need ongoing dialysis treatment. Many don't know about advance care planning or haven't written down their healthcare wishes. Planning ahead while someone can still clearly communicate their preferences may help ensure their wishes are followed later.

## What did the researchers look for?

The researchers searched medical databases through June 2016 for studies comparing:
- People who did advance care planning
- People who did not do advance care planning or did less formal planning

They wanted to see if advance care planning affected:
- Number of hospital visits
- Use of life-prolonging treatments
- Whether people's wishes were actually followed at the end of life

## What did they find?

The researchers found only 2 studies with 337 people total. However, neither study reported information about the outcomes the researchers were looking for. The quality of these studies was not strong.

## What does this mean?

There isn't enough good-quality research to know whether advance care planning helps people on dialysis have fewer hospital stays or ensures their wishes are followed. More well-designed studies are needed to answer these important questions.",0,Plano,"Plain-Language Summary

What was this study about?
- This review looked at whether advance care planning helps people on haemodialysis for end-stage kidney disease.

Who was studied?
- Adults receiving haemodialysis.
- Total people included across studies: 337.

What is the main idea being tested?
- Advance care planning (ACP): talking ahead of time about future healthcare wishes and writing them down.
- Compared to no ACP or a less structured approach.

What outcomes did researchers look for?
- Fewer hospital admissions.
- Less use of life-prolonging treatments when not wanted.
- Whether patients’ end-of-life wishes were followed.

How was the research done?
- Researchers searched medical databases up to June 27, 2016.
- They included randomized or quasi-randomized trials.

What did they find?
- Two studies met the criteria.
- Neither study reported the key outcomes listed above.
- Study quality was judged as suboptimal.
- Because of this, the reviewers could not say if ACP helps reduce hospital stays, change treatments used, or ensure wishes are followed.

Safety
- No safety issues or harms were reported for ACP in these studies.

What does this mean?
- There isn’t enough good-quality evidence to know if ACP changes hospital use, treatments, or whether wishes are followed for people on haemodialysis.

What’s next?
- Better, larger randomized trials are needed to show if ACP helps people on dialysis and to guide patients and clinicians."
106,"Background
A posterior crossbite occurs when the top back teeth bite inside the bottom back teeth. The prevalence of posterior crossbite is around 4% and 17% of children and adolescents in Europe and America, respectively. Several treatments have been recommended to correct this problem, which is related to such dental issues as tooth attrition, abnormal development of the jaws, joint problems, and imbalanced facial appearance. Treatments involve expanding the upper jaw with an orthodontic appliance, which can be fixed (e.g. quad‐helix) or removable (e.g. expansion plate). This is the third update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of different orthodontic treatments for posterior crossbites.
Search methods
Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched four bibliographic databases up to 8 April 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished and ongoing studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of orthodontic treatment for posterior crossbites in children and adults. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors, independently and in duplicate, screened the results of the electronic searches, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. A third review author participated to resolve disagreements. We used risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to summarise dichotomous data (event), unless there were zero values in trial arms, in which case we used odds ratios (ORs). We used mean differences (MD) with 95% CIs to summarise continuous data. We performed meta‐analyses using fixed‐effect models. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence for the main outcomes. 
Main results
We included 31 studies that randomised approximately 1410 participants. Eight studies were at low risk of bias, 15 were at high risk of bias, and eight were unclear. 
Intervention versus observation 
For children (age 7 to 11 years), quad‐helix was beneficial for posterior crossbite correction compared to observation (OR 50.59, 95% CI 26.77 to 95.60; 3 studies, 149 participants; high‐certainty evidence) and resulted in higher final inter‐molar distances (MD 4.71 mm, 95% CI 4.31 to 5.10; 3 studies, 146 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
For children, expansion plates were also beneficial for posterior crossbite correction compared to observation (OR 25.26, 95% CI 13.08 to 48.77; 3 studies, 148 participants; high‐certainty evidence) and resulted in higher final inter‐molar distances (MD 3.30 mm, 95% CI 2.88 to 3.73; 3 studies, 145 participants, 3 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). In addition, expansion plates resulted in higher inter‐canine distances (MD 2.59 mm, 95% CI 2.18 to 3.01; 3 studies, 145 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
The use of Hyrax is probably effective for correcting posterior crossbite compared to observation (OR 48.02, 95% CI 21.58 to 106.87; 93 participants, 3 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). Two of the studies focused on adolescents (age 12 to 16 years) and found that Hyrax increased the inter‐molar distance compared with observation (MD 5.80, 95% CI 5.15 to 6.45; 2 studies, 72 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
Intervention A versus intervention B 
When comparing quad‐helix with expansion plates in children, quad‐helix was more effective for posterior crossbite correction (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.46; 3 studies, 151 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), final inter‐molar distance (MD 1.48 mm, 95% CI 0.91 mm to 2.04 mm; 3 studies, 151 participants; high‐certainty evidence), inter‐canine distance (0.59 mm higher (95% CI 0.09 mm  to 1.08 mm; 3 studies, 151 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and length of treatment (MD −3.15 months, 95% CI −4.04 to −2.25; 3 studies, 148 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
There was no evidence of a difference between Hyrax and Haas for posterior crossbite correction (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.18; 3 studies, 83 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) or inter‐molar distance (MD −0.15 mm, 95% CI −0.86 mm to 0.56 mm; 2 studies of adolescents, 46 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
There was no evidence of a difference between Hyrax and tooth‐bone‐borne expansion for crossbite correction (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.12; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 120 participants; low‐certainty evidence) or inter‐molar distance (MD −0.66 mm, 95% CI −1.36 mm to 0.04 mm; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 65 participants; low‐certainty evidence).  
There was no evidence of a difference between Hyrax with bone‐borne expansion for posterior crossbite correction (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07; I² = 0%; 2 studies of adolescents, 81 participants; low‐certainty evidence) or inter‐molar distance (MD −0.14 mm, 95% CI −0.85 mm to 0.57 mm; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 81 participants; low‐certainty evidence).  
Authors' conclusions
For children in the early mixed dentition stage (age 7 to 11 years old), quad‐helix and expansion plates are more beneficial than no treatment for correcting posterior crossbites. Expansion plates also increase the inter‐canine distance. Quad‐helix is more effective than expansion plates for correcting posterior crossbite and increasing inter‐molar distance. Treatment duration is shorter with quad‐helix than expansion plates. 
For adolescents in permanent dentition (age 12 to 16 years old), Hyrax and Haas are similar for posterior crossbite correction and increasing the inter‐molar distance. 
The remaining evidence was insufficient to draw any robust conclusions for the efficacy of posterior crossbite correction.","Are braces effective for treating crossbite (top back teeth biting down inside the bottom back teeth)? 
Key messages 
Orthodontic treatment with quad‐helix (fixed) or expansion plates (removeable) is effective for correcting posterior crossbite correction in children. Quad‐helix is probably even more effective than expansion plates. For adolescents, there is probably no difference between Hyrax and Haas for posterior crossbite correction. 
What is the problem? 
Posterior crossbite occurs when the top teeth or jaw are narrower than the bottom teeth. It can happen on one side or both sides of the dental arches. This condition may increase the likelihood of dental problems (e.g. tooth wear), abnormal development of the jaws, joint problems, and unbalanced facial appearance. Posterior crossbites affect around 4% and 17% of children and adolescents in Europe and America.  
Different treatment approaches have been proposed, resulting in many different braces being produced. The basic treatment to correct crossbite correction treatment involves using an orthodontic device  on the palate (roof of the mouth) to expand the upper jaw by exerting pressure on both sides of the jaw. The devices can be fixed (e.g. quad‐helix, Haas, Hyrax expander) or removable (e.g. expansion plate). Fixed appliances are bonded to the teeth, while removeable devices can be taken out of the mouth by patients. 
What did we want to know? 
We wanted to know the effects of different braces for posterior crossbite correction. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that assessed the effectiveness of braces used to correct posterior crossbites. 
What did we find? 
We found 31 studies with 1410 children and adolescents who were randomly assigned to a treatment or no treatment group. Thirteen studies included children (7 to 11 years old), 12 included adolescents (12 to 16 years old), and six included both. Eight studies were conducted in Turkey, four in Brazil, four in Sweden, three in the USA, three in  Italy, two in Canada, and one each in Germany, UK, Switzerland, Iran, Spain, India, and Australia. Twenty‐seven studies were carried out in universities and clinical centres, one study in private practice, and three did not state the location. 
What were the main results? 
For children, expansion of the upper arch with fixed or removable braces can correct posterior crossbites.  
When testing fixed and removable braces against each other, the studies found that quad‐helix (fixed appliance) was more successful than expansion plate (removable appliance) and that treatment with quad‐helix took less time.  
For other comparisons between different types of treatments, there was no evidence to show that one worked better than another, but we had moderate to low certainty in the results, so future research may change them. 
How reliable are these results? 
Our confidence in the results is high to moderate for the main results. For the other comparisons, our confidence in the results is low. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
This review is an update. The evidence is current to April 2021.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Orthodontic Treatments for Posterior Crossbite

## What is a posterior crossbite?

A posterior crossbite happens when the upper back teeth bite inside the lower back teeth instead of outside them. This affects about 4 to 17 out of every 100 children and teens. If not corrected, it can lead to tooth wear, jaw development problems, and facial imbalance.

## What treatments are available?

Orthodontists use special devices called expanders to widen the upper jaw and fix this problem. These devices can be:
- **Fixed** (permanently attached to teeth), such as quad-helix, Hyrax, or Haas
- **Removable** (can be taken out), such as expansion plates

## What did researchers study?

Researchers reviewed 31 studies involving about 1,410 people to see which treatments work best. They compared different expanders to each other and to no treatment.

## What did they find?

**For children ages 7 to 11:**
- Both quad-helix and expansion plates work much better than no treatment at correcting the crossbite
- Quad-helix works better than expansion plates and takes about 3 months less time to complete treatment
- Both treatments successfully widen the upper jaw

**For teens ages 12 to 16:**
- Two types of fixed expanders (Hyrax and Haas) work equally well at correcting crossbites and widening the jaw

**Other comparisons:**
- Researchers found no clear differences between several other types of expanders

## What does this mean?

Children with posterior crossbites benefit from treatment with orthodontic expanders rather than waiting. For younger children, quad-helix devices may work faster than removable expansion plates. For teenagers, different types of fixed expanders appear to work similarly well.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What is this review about?
- Posterior crossbite is when the upper back teeth bite inside the lower back teeth.
- This review looked at which orthodontic treatments work best to correct it.

Who was studied?
- 31 randomized studies with about 1,410 people.
- Mostly children ages 7–11 and adolescents ages 12–16.
- Searches included studies up to April 8, 2021.

Treatments studied
- Quad-helix: a fixed appliance that widens the upper jaw.
- Expansion plate: a removable appliance that widens the upper jaw.
- Hyrax and Haas: fixed rapid expanders used mostly in teens.
- Tooth-bone-borne and bone-borne expanders: devices anchored to teeth and/or bone.

Main outcomes measured
- Whether the crossbite was corrected.
- Space between back teeth (inter-molar distance) and front canine teeth (inter-canine distance).
- How long treatment took.
- Safety (side effects) when reported.

Key findings

Children (ages 7–11)
- Quad-helix works better than no treatment to correct crossbite and increases space between back teeth.
- Expansion plates work better than no treatment and increase space between back teeth and front canine teeth.
- Quad-helix works better than expansion plates for correcting crossbite and widening the back teeth.
- Treatment is shorter with quad-helix than with expansion plates by about 3 months.

Adolescents (ages 12–16)
- Hyrax and Haas work about the same for correcting crossbite and widening the back teeth.
- Hyrax also likely works better than no treatment.

Other devices
- Studies comparing Hyrax with tooth-bone-borne or bone-borne devices showed no clear differences. Evidence here was limited.

Safety
- Side effects and harms were not well reported, so safety information is limited.

Certainty of the evidence
- Evidence was high to moderate for the main findings in children and for Hyrax vs no treatment in teens.
- Evidence was lower for some comparisons, especially those involving bone anchorage.

What this means
- For children, starting early with a quad-helix or an expansion plate helps. Quad-helix tends to work faster and a bit better than expansion plates.
- For teens, Hyrax and Haas appear similarly effective.
- More research is needed on other expander types and on safety."

Authors' conclusions
Methadone dosages ranging from 60 to 100 mg/day are more effective than lower dosages in retaining patients and in reducing use of heroin and cocaine during treatment. To find the optimal dose is a clinical ability, but clinician must consider these conclusions in treatment strategies.","Methadone maintenance at different dosages for opioid dependence
People who are addicted to opioids have high risks of receiving an overdose of opioid, HIV, hepatitis B and C infections and criminal activity. This has led to a harm reduction treatment approach to drug addiction. Treatment is aimed at a reduction in these risks and relapses to opioid and polysubstance use and promoting psychosocial adjustment. Methadone maintenance treatment is a long‐term opioid replacement therapy that is used to manage opioid dependence, reduce illicit opioid use and promote retention in treatment. Taken by mouth and active over 24 to 36 hours, it is an opioid drug that removes the euphoric effects of heroin and reduces withdrawal symptoms as well as being compatible with normal activities at work or school. The review authors identified 21 controlled trials involving a total of 5994 opioid users. In 11 of these trials, all from the USA, 2279 participants were randomised to methadone treatment at different doses or another treatment (buprenorphine or levomethadyl). Treatment was for between seven and 53 weeks. A further 10 controlled trials did not randomly assign the total of 3715 participants to a treatment. These were from various diverse countries and followed opioid users for one to 10 years. Higher doses of methadone (60 to 100 mg/day) were more effective than lower doses (1 to 39 mg/day) in retaining opioid users in therapy and in reducing illicit use of heroin and cocaine during treatment. Side effects of methadone appeared to be similar at the different doses, in one trial only.  The organisation and regulation of methadone maintenance treatment varies widely and some countries have explicit guidelines for programme operation. Methadone maintenance treatment involves the prescription of a drug which itself causes dependence. This means that treatment is not naturally aimed at the total recovery of the individual.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Different Doses of Methadone for Opioid Dependence Treatment

## What was this study about?

Researchers reviewed studies to find out which dose of methadone works best for people receiving treatment for opioid dependence. Methadone is a medication used as a long-term replacement therapy to help people stop using illegal opioids like heroin.

## What did the researchers look at?

The research team searched medical databases from 1947 to 2001 for studies that compared different doses of methadone. They looked at 21 studies that included nearly 6,000 participants total. The studies compared:
- High doses (60-100 mg per day)
- Medium doses
- Low doses

## What did they measure?

The researchers tracked several outcomes:
- How many people stayed in treatment
- How often people used heroin (based on self-reports and urine tests)
- Cocaine use
- Deaths from overdose

## What did they find?

**Higher doses (60-100 mg per day) worked better than lower doses:**
- More people stayed in treatment
- People were more likely to stop using heroin
- People were more likely to stop using cocaine

**Medium doses also showed benefits** compared to lower doses for reducing heroin use.

## What does this mean?

Methadone doses between 60 and 100 mg per day are more effective at helping people stay in treatment and reduce their use of heroin and cocaine. Doctors should consider using these higher doses when creating treatment plans, though the best dose may vary for each person.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the study

Purpose
- To compare different daily doses of methadone to see which work better for helping people stay in treatment and reduce use of heroin and cocaine.

Who was included
- Adults receiving methadone maintenance treatment for opioid dependence.

What was studied
- Different methadone dose levels. “High dose” was generally 60–100 mg per day. Lower and middle doses were less than this.

How the research was done
- This was a review of published studies up to 2001.
- 21 studies were included: 11 randomized trials (2,279 people) and 10 controlled prospective studies (3,715 people).
- Researchers compared results at shorter follow-ups (weeks to months) and longer follow-ups (including one at 6 years for deaths).

Outcomes measured
- Staying in treatment (retention)
- Use of opioids (self-report and urine tests)
- Use of cocaine (urine tests)
- Death from overdose (long-term)

Key results
- Staying in treatment: Higher doses kept more people in treatment than lower doses at both short and longer follow-ups.
- Opioid use:
  - Self-report: High doses were linked to fewer times per week using opioids than middle or low doses.
  - Urine tests after 3–4+ weeks: High doses led to more opioid-negative tests than low doses; results vs middle doses also favored higher doses but were less certain.
- Cocaine use:
  - Urine tests after 3–4+ weeks: High doses led to more cocaine-negative tests than low doses.
- Safety (overdose deaths):
  - Over about 6 years, differences between dose groups were very uncertain because the numbers were small. No clear difference was shown.

Timing
- Most outcomes were measured over weeks to months; overdose deaths were reported at about 6 years in some studies.

What this means
- Daily methadone doses of about 60–100 mg worked better than lower doses to help people stay in treatment and reduce heroin and cocaine use during treatment.
- Choosing the exact dose should be done by a clinician for each patient.

Notes
- Studies were selected and reviewed by multiple researchers to reduce bias.
- The evidence comes from studies published up to 2001."
108,"Background
Ventilator‐associated pneumonia (VAP) is associated with increased mortality, prolonged length of hospital stay and increased healthcare costs in critically ill patients. Guidelines recommend a semi‐recumbent position (30º to 45º) for preventing VAP among patients requiring mechanical ventilation. However, due to methodological limitations in existing systematic reviews, uncertainty remains regarding the benefits and harms of the semi‐recumbent position for preventing VAP. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of semi‐recumbent positioning versus supine positioning to prevent ventilator‐associated pneumonia (VAP) in adults requiring mechanical ventilation. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (2015, Issue 10), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1946 to October 2015), EMBASE (2010 to October 2015), CINAHL (1981 to October 2015) and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) (1978 to October 2015). 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing semi‐recumbent versus supine positioning (0º to 10º), or RCTs comparing alternative degrees of positioning in mechanically ventilated patients. Our outcomes included clinically suspected VAP, microbiologically confirmed VAP, intensive care unit (ICU) mortality, hospital mortality, length of ICU stay, length of hospital stay, duration of ventilation, antibiotic use and any adverse events. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently and in duplicate screened titles, abstracts and full texts, assessed risk of bias and extracted data using standardised forms. We calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for continuous data and the risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI for binary data. We performed meta‐analysis using the random‐effects model. We used the grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) approach to grade the quality of evidence. 
Main results
We included 10 trials involving 878 participants, among which 28 participants in two trials did not provide complete data due to loss to follow‐up. We judged all trials to be at high risk of bias. 
Semi‐recumbent position (30º to 60º) versus supine position (0° to 10°) 
A semi‐recumbent position (30º to 60º) significantly reduced the risk of clinically suspected VAP compared to a 0º to 10º supine position (eight trials, 759 participants, 14.3% versus 40.2%, RR 0.36; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.50; risk difference (RD) 25.7%; 95% CI 20.1% to 30.1%; GRADE: moderate quality evidence). 
There was no significant difference between the two positions in the following outcomes: microbiologically confirmed VAP (three trials, 419 participants, 12.6% versus 31.6%, RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.11 to 1.77; GRADE: very low quality evidence), ICU mortality (two trials, 307 participants, 29.8% versus 34.3%, RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.59 to 1.27; GRADE: low quality evidence), hospital mortality (three trials, 346 participants, 23.8% versus 27.6%, RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.59 to 1.20; GRADE: low quality evidence), length of ICU stay (three trials, 346 participants, MD ‐1.64 days; 95% CI ‐4.41 to 1.14 days; GRADE moderate quality evidence), length of hospital stay (two trials, 260 participants, MD ‐9.47 days; 95% CI ‐34.21 to 15.27 days; GRADE: very low quality evidence), duration of ventilation (four trials, 458 participants, MD ‐3.35 days; 95% CI ‐7.80 to 1.09 days), antibiotic use (three trials, 284 participants, 84.8% versus 84.2%, RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.03) and pressure ulcers (one trial, 221 participants, 28% versus 30%, RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.38; GRADE: low quality evidence). No other adverse events were reported. 
Semi‐recumbent position (45°) versus 25° to 30° 
We found no statistically significant differences in the following prespecified outcomes: clinically suspected VAP (two trials, 91 participants, RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.35 to 1.56; GRADE: very low quality evidence), microbiologically confirmed VAP (one trial, 30 participants, RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.20 to 1.84: GRADE: very low quality evidence), ICU mortality (one trial, 30 participants, RR 0.57; 95% CI 0.15 to 2.13; GRADE: very low quality evidence), hospital mortality (two trials, 91 participants, RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.38 to 2.65; GRADE: very low quality evidence), length of ICU stay (one trial, 30 participants, MD 1.6 days; 95% CI ‐0.88 to 4.08 days; GRADE: very low quality evidence) and antibiotic use (two trials, 91 participants, RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.47). No adverse events were reported. 
Authors' conclusions
A semi‐recumbent position (≧ 30º) may reduce clinically suspected VAP compared to a 0° to 10° supine position. However, the evidence is seriously limited with a high risk of bias. No adequate evidence is available to draw any definitive conclusion on other outcomes and the comparison of alternative semi‐recumbent positions. Adverse events, particularly venous thromboembolism, were under‐reported.","Head bed elevation versus flat bed for preventing ventilator‐associated pneumonia (VAP) in adults requiring mechanical ventilation 
Background 
Adults who are critically ill often need a machine to help maintain their breathing. One side effect of these machines is an increased risk of pneumonia. This is known as ventilator‐associated pneumonia (VAP). It is a leading cause of death in critically ill patients and can also increase the length of hospital stay and healthcare costs. The angle at which ventilated patients lie might play an important role in preventing the infection of their lungs. 
Review questions 
Head bed elevation by tilting the angle of the hospital bed might prevent the source of infection from getting into the lung. We assessed the benefit and harm of semi‐recumbent positioning for the prevention of VAP in critically ill adult patients requiring mechanical ventilation. We also investigated the best angle of head bed elevation in a semi‐recumbent position. 
Study characteristics 
We identified 10 studies involving 878 participants. Twenty‐eight participants were lost to follow‐up. The evidence is current up to 27 October 2015. All participants were recruited from intensive care units (ICUs) and received mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
Moderate quality evidence from eight studies involving 759 participants demonstrated that a semi‐recumbent (30º to 60º) position reduced clinically suspected VAP by 25.7% when compared to a 0° to 10° supine position. Based on this result, we would expect that out of 1000 critically ill adult patients who are nursed in the semi‐recumbent position (30º to 60º) for more than 48 hours, 145 patients would experience clinically suspected VAP compared to 402 patients nursed in the 0° to 10° supine position. There was no significant difference between the two positions in reducing microbiologically confirmed VAP (very low quality evidence), mortality (low quality evidence), length of ICU stay (moderate quality evidence), hospital stay (very low quality evidence), duration of ventilation or use of antibiotics. The main limitations of the evidence were the small numbers of participants contributing data to the analyses and that for some studies researchers would have known which treatment group participants were from (a risk of bias). 
Only two studies with 91 participants compared different degrees of bed head angle (45° versus 25° to 30° semi‐recumbent position). Very low quality evidence showed no statistically significant differences in the effects of VAP (clinically suspected and microbiologically confirmed), mortality (ICU and hospital), length of ICU stay or use of antibiotics. Only one study reported the adverse event of pressure ulcers and did not find a difference between the 45° semi‐recumbent and 10° supine positions. No other adverse events, such as thromboembolism, or side effects on heart rate or blood pressure were reported. 
The balance of the benefit and harm of semi‐recumbent positioning still remains uncertain due to the limited numbers of studies and the low quality of the existing evidence. More high quality evidence is required on the effects of the semi‐recumbent versus supine position and the optimal body positions.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Body Position to Prevent Lung Infections in Patients on Breathing Machines

## What was studied?

Researchers looked at whether raising the head of the bed helps prevent lung infections in patients who need breathing machines (ventilators) in intensive care units. These lung infections, called ventilator-associated pneumonia, are common and can be serious.

## What did they want to find out?

The research team wanted to know if keeping patients in a semi-sitting position (with the head of the bed raised 30 to 60 degrees) works better than lying flat (0 to 10 degrees) to prevent lung infections. They also looked at whether different amounts of bed elevation made a difference.

## What did they find?

The researchers reviewed 10 studies with 878 adult patients on breathing machines.

**Main findings:**
- Raising the head of the bed (30 to 60 degrees) reduced suspected lung infections compared to lying nearly flat. About 14 out of 100 patients in the raised position got lung infections versus 40 out of 100 patients lying flat.
- There was no clear difference between positions for:
  - Deaths in the ICU or hospital
  - Length of hospital stay
  - Time on the breathing machine
  - Need for antibiotics
  - Pressure sores

**Comparing different raised positions:**
- When researchers compared a 45-degree position to a 25-30 degree position, they found no clear differences in any outcomes.

## What does this mean?

Raising the head of the bed to at least 30 degrees may help prevent lung infections in patients on breathing machines. However, the quality of the studies had limitations, so more research is needed to be certain. The studies didn't report enough information about possible side effects.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What is this study about?
This review looked at whether raising the head of the bed (semi‑recumbent position) helps prevent lung infections linked to breathing machines in adults in intensive care.

Who was included?
- Adults on mechanical ventilation in the ICU

What positions were compared?
- Semi‑recumbent: head of bed raised 30° to 60° (often about 45°)
- Supine: nearly flat, 0° to 10°
- Some trials compared 45° versus 25° to 30°

How was the study done?
- Systematic review of 10 randomized trials
- 878 participants total
- Medical databases searched up to October 2015

What outcomes were measured?
- Suspected ventilator‑associated pneumonia (VAP)
- Lab‑confirmed VAP
- Death in ICU and in hospital
- Length of ICU stay and hospital stay
- Days on the ventilator
- Antibiotic use
- Side effects (such as pressure sores, blood clots)

Main findings
- Semi‑recumbent (≥30°) vs nearly flat (0°–10°):
  - Suspected VAP: lower with semi‑recumbent (about 14% vs 40%). That’s about 26 fewer cases per 100 patients.
  - No clear differences in: lab‑confirmed VAP, deaths, ICU/hospital stay length, ventilator days, antibiotic use, or pressure sores.
- 45° vs 25°–30°:
  - No clear differences in any measured outcomes.

Safety
- Reported side effects were similar between groups.
- Possible harms like blood clots were not well reported.

Quality of the evidence
- Overall quality was low to moderate.
- Many trials had a high risk of bias.
- Results for outcomes other than suspected VAP are uncertain.

What does this mean?
- Raising the head of the bed to at least 30° may lower suspected pneumonia in adults on ventilators.
- We need better, larger studies to know the best angle and to fully assess safety."
109,"Background
Long term levodopa therapy in Parkinson's disease is associated with the development of motor complications including abnormal involuntary movements and a shortening response to each dose (wearing off phenomenon). It is thought that dopamine agonists can reduce the duration of immobile off periods and the need for levodopa therapy whilst maintaining or improving motor impairments and only minimally increasing dopaminergic adverse events. 
Objectives
To compare the efficacy and safety of adjuvant cabergoline therapy versus placebo in patients with Parkinson's disease, already established on levodopa and suffering from motor complications. 
Search methods
Electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Handsearching of the neurology literature as part of the Cochrane Movement Disorders Group's strategy. Examination of the reference lists of identified studies and other reviews. Contact with Pharmacia Upjohn Limited. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of cabergoline versus placebo in patients with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease and long‐term complications of levodopa therapy. 
Data collection and analysis
Data was abstracted independently by the authors and differences settled by discussion. The outcome measures used included Parkinson's disease rating scales, levodopa dosage, off time measurements and the frequency of withdrawals and adverse events. 
Main results
Cabergoline has been compared with placebo in two phase II (6 ‐ 12 weeks) and one phase III randomised controlled trials (24 weeks). These were double‐blind, parallel group, multicentre studies including 268 patients with Parkinson's disease and motor complications. The reduction of 1.14 hours (WMD; 95% CI ‐0.06, 2.33; p = 0.06) in off time in favour of cabergoline was not statistically significant. Inadequate data on dyskinesia was collected either on rating scales or as adverse event reporting to allow a conclusion to be drawn. A small but statistically significant advantage of cabergoline over placebo was seen in one study for UPDRS ADL (part II) score and UPDRS motor score. No such advantage was seen in one other study due to small numbers of patients and the comparatively low doses of cabergoline used. No significant differences in Schwab and England scale were seen in two studies. Levodopa dose reduction was significantly greater with cabergoline (WMD 149.6 mg/d; 95% CI 94.1, 205.1; p < 0.00001). There was a trend towards more dopaminergic adverse events with cabergoline but this did not reach statistical significance at the p < 0.01 level. However, there was a trend towards fewer withdrawals from cabergoline. 
Authors' conclusions
In the management of the motor complications seen in Parkinson's disease, cabergoline can be used to reduce levodopa dose and modestly improve motor impairment and disability with an acceptable adverse event profile. These conclusions are based on, at best, medium term evidence.","Cabergoline for levodopa‐induced complications in Parkinson's disease
In the later stages of Parkinson's disease, side effects occur because of the use of levodopa treatment. These consist of involuntary writhing movements (choreoathetosis), painful cramps in the legs (dystonia) and a shortened response to each dose referred to as 'end‐of‐dose deterioration' or the 'wearing‐off effect'. Dopamine agonist drugs act by mimicking levodopa in the brain, but they do not cause these long‐term treatment complications when used as initial therapy. For this reason, dopamine agonists have for some years been added once these problems develop in the hope of improving them. Cabergoline is a new dopamine agonist recently licensed in the UK for the treatment of later Parkinson's disease. In this review, we will examine the trials performed with this drug to see how effective it is and what side effects it causes. 
Cabergoline has been compared with inactive placebo in two smaller and shorter (6 ‐ 12 weeks) studies and one larger, medium term trial (24 weeks). These trials included 268 patients with Parkinson's disease and motor complications. The average reduction in the time patients spent in the immobile off state was 1.1 hours greater with cabergoline compared with placebo, although this was not statistically significant. Inadequate data on dyskinesia was collected to allow a conclusion to be drawn. A small but significant advantage of cabergoline over placebo was seen in one study for activities of daily living and physical functioning. No such advantage was seen in one other study due to small numbers of patients and the comparatively low doses of cabergoline used. Levodopa dose reduction was greater with cabergoline by 145 mg per day. There was a trend towards more side effects with cabergoline but towards fewer withdrawals from cabergoline treatment. 
In the management of the motor complications seen in Parkinson's disease, cabergoline can be used to reduce levodopa dose and modestly improve motor function and activities of daily living with an acceptable side effect profile. This is based on, at best, medium term evidence. Further long term trials are required to compare the newer with the older dopamine agonists, particularly in terms of quality of life and cost.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Cabergoline as an Add-On Treatment for Parkinson's Disease

## What was this study about?

Researchers reviewed studies to see if a medication called cabergoline could help people with Parkinson's disease who were experiencing problems with their current treatment.

## Why was this research needed?

People with Parkinson's disease often take a medication called levodopa for many years. Over time, this medication can cause two main problems:
- Unwanted, uncontrollable movements
- Shorter-lasting effects from each dose (the medication ""wears off"" before the next dose)

Researchers wanted to know if adding cabergoline to levodopa treatment could help reduce these problems.

## Who was studied?

The review included 268 adults with Parkinson's disease who:
- Were already taking levodopa
- Were experiencing problems with their levodopa treatment wearing off or causing unwanted movements

## What did researchers do?

They reviewed three studies that compared cabergoline plus levodopa to placebo (inactive treatment) plus levodopa. The studies lasted between 6 and 24 weeks.

## What did they find?

**Benefits:**
- People taking cabergoline needed about 150 mg less levodopa per day
- Some studies showed small improvements in daily activities and movement
- The time when medication wasn't working (""off time"") may have improved slightly, but results weren't clear

**Side effects:**
- Cabergoline appeared generally safe
- There was a slight increase in side effects related to dopamine medications, but this wasn't significant
- Fewer people stopped taking cabergoline than expected

## What does this mean?

Cabergoline may be a helpful add-on medication for people with Parkinson's disease who are having problems with their levodopa treatment. It can help reduce the amount of levodopa needed and may provide modest improvements in movement and daily activities. However, these findings are based on studies lasting only up to 6 months.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What was the goal?
- To see if adding cabergoline to current levodopa treatment helps people with Parkinson’s who have movement problems from long-term levodopa use.

Who was in the studies?
- Adults with Parkinson’s who were already taking levodopa and were having motor complications (such as involuntary movements or “wearing off” when medicine effects fade).

What treatments were compared?
- Cabergoline (added to levodopa) versus a placebo (a look‑alike pill with no active drug), while people continued their levodopa.

What did researchers measure?
- Daily “off time” (hours when symptoms return as medicine wears off).
- Movement and daily activity scores (UPDRS).
- Levodopa dose changes.
- Side effects and how many people stopped treatment.

Study timeline
- Three randomized, double‑blind studies.
- Two short studies lasted 6–12 weeks; one longer study lasted 24 weeks.
- 268 people took part across multiple centers.

Main results
- Off time: Cabergoline reduced off time by about 1.1 hours per day on average, but this was not clearly proven across studies.
- Movement and daily activities: One study showed small improvements with cabergoline; another did not, likely due to small size and lower doses used.
- Overall function (Schwab and England scale): No clear difference in two studies.
- Levodopa dose: People on cabergoline were able to lower their levodopa by about 150 mg per day more than those on placebo.
- Involuntary movements (dyskinesia): Not enough good data to tell.
- Safety: There were signs of more dopamine‑related side effects (like nausea or dizziness) with cabergoline, but this was not clearly proven. Slightly fewer people stopped cabergoline compared with placebo.

What does this mean?
- Adding cabergoline may help lower levodopa dose and may modestly improve movement and daily activities for some people.
- Benefits and risks appeared acceptable over the short to medium term (up to 24 weeks).
- Longer and larger studies would help confirm these findings."
110,"Background
Communication is a common element in all medical consultations, affecting a range of outcomes for doctors and patients. The increasing demand for medical students to be trained to communicate effectively has seen the emergence of interpersonal communication skills as core graduate competencies in medical training around the world. Medical schools have adopted a range of approaches to develop and evaluate these competencies. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of interventions for medical students that aim to improve interpersonal communication in medical consultations. 
Search methods
We searched five electronic databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and ERIC (Educational Resource Information Centre) in September 2020, with no language, date, or publication status restrictions. We also screened reference lists of relevant articles and contacted authors of included studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs (C‐RCTs), and non‐randomised controlled trials (quasi‐RCTs) evaluating the effectiveness of interventions delivered to students in undergraduate or graduate‐entry medical programmes. We included studies of interventions aiming to improve medical students’ interpersonal communication during medical consultations. Included interventions targeted communication skills associated with empathy, relationship building, gathering information, and explanation and planning, as well as specific communication tasks such as listening, appropriate structure, and question style. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently reviewed all search results, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias of included studies, and rated the quality of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We found 91 publications relating to 76 separate studies (involving 10,124 students): 55 RCTs, 9 quasi‐RCTs, 7 C‐RCTs, and 5 quasi‐C‐RCTs. We performed meta‐analysis according to comparison and outcome. Among both effectiveness and comparative effectiveness analyses, we separated outcomes reporting on overall communication skills, empathy, rapport or relationship building, patient perceptions/satisfaction, information gathering, and explanation and planning. Overall communication skills and empathy were further divided as examiner‐ or simulated patient‐assessed. The overall quality of evidence ranged from moderate to very low, and there was high, unexplained heterogeneity.Overall, interventions had positive effects on most outcomes, but generally small effect sizes and evidence quality limit the conclusions that can be drawn. Communication skills interventions in comparison to usual curricula or control may improve both overall communication skills (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 1.31; 18 studies, 1356 participants; I² = 90%; low‐quality evidence) and empathy (SMD 0.64, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.05; 6 studies, 831 participants; I² = 86%; low‐quality evidence) when assessed by experts, but not by simulated patients. Students’ skills in information gathering probably also improve with educational intervention (SMD 1.07, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.54; 5 studies, 405 participants; I² = 78%; moderate‐quality evidence), but there may be little to no effect on students' rapport (SMD 0.18, 95% CI ‐0.15 to 0.51; 9 studies, 834 participants; I² = 81%; low‐quality evidence), and effects on information giving skills are uncertain (very low‐quality evidence). 
We are uncertain whether experiential interventions improve overall communication skills in comparison to didactic approaches (SMD 0.08, 95% CI ‐0.02 to 0.19; 4 studies, 1578 participants; I² = 4%; very low‐quality evidence). Electronic learning approaches may have little to no effect on students’ empathy scores (SMD ‐0.13, 95% CI ‐0.68 to 0.43; 3 studies, 421 participants; I² = 82%; low‐quality evidence) or on rapport (SMD 0.02, 95% CI ‐0.33 to 0.38; 3 studies, 176 participants; I² = 19%; moderate‐quality evidence) compared to face‐to‐face approaches. There may be small negative effects of electronic interventions on information giving skills (low‐quality evidence), and effects on information gathering skills are uncertain (very low‐quality evidence).  
Personalised/specific feedback probably improves overall communication skills to a small degree in comparison to generic or no feedback (SMD 0.58, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.87; 6 studies, 502 participants; I² = 56%; moderate‐quality evidence). There may be small positive effects of personalised feedback on empathy and information gathering skills (low quality), but effects on rapport are uncertain (very low quality), and we found no evidence on information giving skills. 
We are uncertain whether role‐play with simulated patients outperforms peer role‐play in improving students’ overall communication skills (SMD 0.17, 95% CI ‐0.33 to 0.67; 4 studies, 637 participants; I² = 87%; very low‐quality evidence). There may be little to no difference between effects of simulated patient and peer role‐play on students' empathy (low‐quality evidence) with no evidence on other outcomes for this comparison. 
Descriptive syntheses of results that could not be included in meta‐analyses across outcomes and comparisons were mixed, as were effects of different interventions and comparisons on specific communication skills assessed by the included trials. Quality of evidence was downgraded due to methodological limitations across several risk of bias domains, high unexplained heterogeneity, and imprecision of results.In general, results remain consistent in sensitivity analysis based on risk of bias and adjustment for clustering. No adverse effects were reported.  
Authors' conclusions
This review represents a substantial body of evidence from which to draw, but further research is needed to strengthen the quality of the evidence base, to consider the long‐term effects of interventions on students’ behaviour as they progress through training and into practice, and to assess effects of interventions on patient outcomes. Efforts to standardise assessment and evaluation of interpersonal skills will strengthen future research efforts.","Communication skills interventions for medical students
What are the best ways to teach medical students how to talk to patients? 
Teaching interpersonal skills 
We use interpersonal skills every day when we talk and interact with other people. Interpersonal skills include communication skills such as listening, speaking, and asking questions. Good communication between doctor and patient is vital for all medical consultations. Doctors need to build relationships, show empathy, gather information, explain concepts, and plan treatment with their patients. 
Medical students need to prove they are competent in interpersonal and communication skills before they graduate. Approaches to teaching medical students these skills include face‐to‐face teaching, online courses, programmes that give students personalised or tailored feedback, and use of role‐play with peers or with actors playing the role of the patient. 
Why we did this Cochrane Review 
Medical schools and universities around the world use different approaches to teach interpersonal and communication skills. We wanted to find out which types of educational programmes work best. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that assessed educational programmes to teach interpersonal and communication skills to medical students. 
Search date: we included evidence published up to September 2020. 
What we found 
We found 90 relevant studies involving 10,124 students, conducted in the USA and in countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia Pacific. These studies assessed educational programmes to teach interpersonal and communication skills, including individual role‐play and feedback, and large group demonstrations. Programmes were delivered by face‐to‐face teaching, by video, or online. In most studies, results were assessed immediately after the educational programme concluded, and up to 12 months later. 
We compared the results of studies conducted to find out how the different programmes affected: 
· overall communication skills;
· understanding of what another person is feeling (empathy);
· relationship building or understanding one another's feelings or ideas (rapport);
· gathering of information, including patients' satisfaction, understanding, or views; and 
· explaining and planning (giving of information).
What are the main results of our review? 
Comparing interpersonal programmes against the usual educational programmes or being on a waiting list for an interpersonal programme showed that these programmes: 
· may slightly improve students' overall communication skills (evidence from 18 studies, with 1356 students) and empathy (6 studies; 831 students); 
· probably improve skills in gathering information about the patient's views (5 studies, 405 students); but 
· may have little to no effect on rapport skills (9 studies, 834 students).
We are uncertain about how the interpersonal programmes affected skills in giving information (5 studies, 659 students). 
We are uncertain how online or self‐taught programmes affected students' overall communication skills (4 studies, 1578 students) or skills in gathering information (1 study, 164 students) compared with face‐to‐face teaching. 
Online or self‐directed programmes compared with face‐to‐face teaching:
· may have little to no effect on students' empathy skills (3 studies, 421 students);
· probably have little to no effect on rapport skills (3 studies, 176 students); but
· may slightly reduce skills in giving information (1 study, 122 students).
Programmes that give students personalised or tailored feedback compared with those that involve general or no feedback: 
· probably slightly improved overall communication skills (6 studies, 502 students); and 
· may slightly improve empathy skills (1 study, 66 students) and skills in gathering information (1 study, 48 students). 
We are uncertain how programmes with personalised or tailored feedback affected rapport skills (1 study, 190 students). No studies reported results for effects on skills in giving information. 
We are uncertain whether programmes involving role‐play with people acting as patients improved students' overall communication skills (4 studies, 637 students) compared with programmes involving role‐play with peers. Role‐play with people acting as patients may slightly improve empathy skills (2 studies, 213 students). No studies reported results for how role‐play with people acting as patients affected skills in rapport or gathering and giving of information. 
No studies reported any unwanted effects for any of the education programmes assessed.
How confident are we in our results? 
We are moderately confident that interpersonal education programmes and programmes involving personalised, specific feedback probably improve overall communication skills. 
We are not confident in our results for the other types of programmes. Some studies had limitations in the ways they were designed, such as how students taking part were assigned to different groups. Other studies had widely varying results, and some had short follow‐up times. Further research is likely to change our results. 
Key messages 
Interpersonal education programmes for medical students had positive effects on most of the interpersonal skills we looked at, although these effects were small and our confidence in some of our results is low. 
Programmes that include personalised feedback probably improve medical students' overall communication skills more than programmes that involve general or no feedback. 
Online or self‐directed programmes may make little to no difference in improving skills in empathy or rapport compared with face‐to‐face teaching.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Teaching Medical Students Better Communication Skills

## What was this study about?

Researchers wanted to find out the best ways to teach medical students how to communicate better with patients. Good communication between doctors and patients is important for quality healthcare. Medical schools around the world now recognize that teaching these skills should be a core part of training.

## What did the researchers do?

The research team reviewed 76 different studies involving over 10,000 medical students. They looked at various teaching methods designed to improve how students communicate during medical appointments. These methods focused on skills like:
- Showing empathy and understanding
- Building trust with patients
- Asking the right questions and listening well
- Explaining medical information clearly
- Organizing conversations effectively

## What did they find?

**Overall Results:**
- Communication training programs generally helped students improve their skills, though the improvements were usually small
- Different teaching methods worked better for some skills than others

**Specific Findings:**
- Training programs improved students' overall communication skills and empathy when evaluated by expert observers
- Students got better at gathering information from patients
- Training had little effect on building rapport (connection) with patients
- The quality of evidence varied, making it hard to draw strong conclusions

**Comparing Different Teaching Methods:**
- Personalized feedback (tailored to each student) worked better than general feedback
- It's unclear whether hands-on practice is better than classroom lectures
- Online learning and in-person learning seemed equally effective
- Practice with trained actors playing patients may not be better than practicing with fellow students

## What does this mean?

Communication skills training can help medical students become better communicators, but more high-quality research is needed to determine which teaching methods work best and whether these improvements last throughout their careers.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What was the goal?
- To see if training helps medical students communicate better with patients during medical visits.

Who was studied?
- Medical students in undergraduate or graduate-entry programs.
- 76 studies with 10,124 students were included.
- The research search was done in September 2020.

What kinds of training were tested?
- Skills such as empathy, building a relationship, listening, asking good questions, gathering information, and explaining plans.
- Different teaching styles: lectures vs. hands-on (experiential); e-learning vs. face-to-face.
- Role-play with simulated patients vs. role-play with peers.
- Personalized/specific feedback vs. generic or no feedback.

What outcomes were measured?
- Overall communication skills.
- Empathy.
- Rapport/relationship with patients.
- Information gathering.
- Information giving/explaining.
- Some studies also looked at patient satisfaction.
- Skills were rated by examiners or simulated patients.

Main findings
- Most trainings led to small improvements.
- Overall communication skills: likely improved when rated by experts.
- Empathy: likely improved when rated by experts; not improved when rated by simulated patients.
- Information gathering: probably improved.
- Rapport: little to no improvement.
- Information giving: effects are uncertain.

Comparisons of teaching methods
- Experiential (hands-on) vs. lectures: no clear difference.
- E-learning vs. face-to-face: similar for empathy and rapport; e-learning may slightly worsen information giving.
- Personalized feedback: probably gives small improvements in overall skills; may help empathy and information gathering.
- Simulated patient role-play vs. peer role-play: no clear difference.

Safety
- No harms were reported.

Strength of the evidence
- Evidence quality ranged from moderate to very low.
- Results varied a lot between studies.
- Most findings show small effects.

What’s next?
- Better-quality studies are needed.
- Future research should look at long-term effects and how training affects real patient outcomes.
- More standard ways to test communication skills would help."
111,"Background
Work participation of patients with inflammatory arthritis (IA) is important not only economically but also for physical and psychological health. There is no Cochrane Review to date on studies of non‐pharmacological interventions specifically aimed at preventing job loss in people with IA. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of non‐pharmacological interventions that aim to prevent job loss, work absenteeism or improve work functioning for employees with IA (rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), other spondylarthritis (SpA) or IA associated with connective tissue diseases, such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)). 
Search methods
We searched the following databases from inception up to 30 April 2014; The Cochrane Library (including Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, i.e. CENTRAL and DARE), MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE (Embase.com), CINAHL (EbSCOhost), ClinicalTrials.gov and PsycINFO (ProQuest). We did not impose language restrictions in the search. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated interventions aimed at preventing job loss in adults of working age (18 to 65 years) diagnosed with IA, including RA, AS, PsA, SpA or other types of IA. Primary outcomes were job loss and sickness absenteeism and the secondary outcome was work functioning. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias in the included RCTs. 
Main results
We included three RCTs with a total of 414 participants at risk of job loss. The majority of participants had IA, most with RA and to a lesser degree AS. The interventions aimed to prevent job loss and improve work functioning in several ways: firstly by evaluating work changes or adaptations and secondly by providing any person‐directed interventions including vocational counselling, advice or education. Interventions directly targeted at the work environment were minimal and included workplace visits (one trial) or any actions by an occupational physician (one trial). The duration or dose of the interventions varied from two 1.5‐hour sessions (one RCT) over five months, two consultation and multidisciplinary treatments during three months (one RCT), to six to eight individual or group sessions over six months (also one RCT). All participants were recruited through rheumatology clinics, both in or outside hospitals. Included trials investigated job loss (n = two RCTs; 382 participants), work absenteeism and work functioning (n = one RCT; 32 participants). Overall, we evaluated the two smaller trials as having a high risk of bias and the large trial as having a low risk of bias. Trials showed marked differences in how they performed on risk of bias items, particularly on performance bias. 
We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach and judged there to be very low quality evidence across the three reported outcomes. Of the two RCTs investigating job loss, the larger one (n = 242 participants) reported a large statistically significant reduction in job loss (relative risk (RR) = 0.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.68) and the other RCT (n = 140) reported similar effects in both groups, although the CI was very wide (RR = 1.05, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.06). The latter one probably suffered from performance bias and we judged it to have a high risk of bias. The one small trial investigating sickness absenteeism found uncertain results at six months' follow‐up (MD = ‐2.42 days, 95% CI ‐5.03 to 0.19). Finally, in the same small trial investigating work functioning using the Rheumatoid Arthritis‐Work Instability Scale (RA‐WIS), there was a moderate improvement of intermediate term work functioning (six months; scale range 0 to 23; mean improvement ‐4.67 points, 95% CI ‐8.43 to ‐0.91). We identified no adverse effects in the publications of the three trials. 
Authors' conclusions
This Cochrane review of three RCTs found very low quality evidence overall for job loss prevention interventions having an effect on job loss, work absenteeism and work functioning in workers with inflammatory arthritis. While this review highlights that further high quality RCTs are required, the results suggest that these strategies have potential to be effective.","Non‐drug interventions for helping workers with inflammatory arthritis stay at work
Background 
Inflammatory arthritis (IA), also called rheumatism, is a group of diseases that cause long‐lasting pain, stiffness and swelling in the joints. These symptoms make it difficult to move and make you feel tired, which in turn can make it difficult to work. The most common types of IA are: rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Worldwide about 3% of people have IA. The disease usually begins when people are between 30 to 40 years old, at a time when they still have many years of working life left. Therefore, it is important to know if there are effective ways in which we can help people with IA stay at work. This Cochrane Review focuses on non‐drug interventions. 
Trials we found 
We searched the available literature up to 30 April 2014. We included three randomised controlled trials with 414 participants who had IA and who were at risk of losing their jobs. These trials first evaluated how the work environment could be adapted and then provided counselling, advice or education for work problems. One trial gave two 1.5‐hour sessions over five months. Another trial gave two consultation and multidisciplinary treatments during three months. The third trial gave six to eight individual or group sessions over six months. The included trials compared the effects of interventions to usual care (two trials) or to written information only (one trial). Two of the included trials measured the effect of the intervention on job loss (382 participants) when the third measured effect on work absenteeism and work functioning (32 participants). 
What the research says 
When considered together, the evidence from the three trials was of very low quality. Two trials found different results on job loss measured at two years' follow‐up: one trial on job counselling found a large reduction in people who lost their job and the other trial found similar effects in both groups. Another trial did not find a considerable effect on absenteeism at six months' follow‐up but found a moderate improvement in work functioning. 
Conclusions 
Because of positive results from one RCT with long term follow‐up, we see potential for job loss prevention interventions in helping workers with inflammatory arthritis to stay at work. The certainty of these results is limited by the very low quality evidence of the three RCTs overall.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Programs to Help People with Inflammatory Arthritis Stay at Work

## What was this review about?

Researchers looked at programs designed to help people with inflammatory arthritis keep their jobs. Inflammatory arthritis includes conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis, which cause joint pain and swelling. These conditions can make it hard for people to do their jobs.

## What did the researchers do?

They searched medical databases through April 2014 for studies that tested programs aimed at helping working adults (ages 18-65) with inflammatory arthritis stay employed. They found 3 studies with a total of 414 people.

## What types of programs were tested?

The programs included:
- Counseling about work options
- Advice and education about managing arthritis at work
- Evaluating what changes could be made at work
- Some workplace visits
- Sessions with doctors who specialize in workplace health

The programs lasted anywhere from two 90-minute sessions over 5 months to six to eight sessions over 6 months.

## What did they find?

The evidence quality was very low, meaning we can't be certain about the results. However:
- One larger study showed the program may have helped people keep their jobs
- One smaller study showed uncertain results about reducing sick days
- One study showed the program might help people work better

No harmful effects were reported in any of the studies.

## What does this mean?

More high-quality research is needed to know if these programs truly help people with inflammatory arthritis stay at work. The early results suggest these programs might be helpful, but we need better studies to be sure.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What is this study about?
- Researchers looked at programs that do not use medicine to help people with inflammatory arthritis stay in their jobs, miss fewer work days, and work better.

Who was studied?
- Adults ages 18–65 with inflammatory arthritis (mostly rheumatoid arthritis; some ankylosing spondylitis and others).
- People were at risk of losing their jobs.

What did the programs include?
- Help planning changes at work or job tasks.
- Personal support like vocational counseling, advice, or education.
- In a few cases, workplace visits or actions by an occupational doctor.
- Program length ranged from a few sessions over 3–6 months.

How was the research done?
- This was a review of randomized controlled trials.
- Databases were searched up to April 30, 2014.
- Three trials with 414 people were included.

What outcomes were measured?
- Main: job loss and sickness absence (days missed from work).
- Other: work functioning (how well people could do their job).

What did they find?
- Job loss: Two trials (382 people). One larger, better-quality trial found fewer people lost their jobs with the program. The other trial did not show a clear difference.
- Sickness absence: One small trial (32 people) had uncertain results at 6 months.
- Work functioning: The same small trial showed a moderate improvement at 6 months.
- Safety: No harms were reported in these trials.

How strong is the evidence?
- Overall evidence quality was very low. Results may change with better studies.

Timeline
- Programs lasted about 3–6 months.
- Some results were reported at 6 months.

Bottom line
- Non-drug programs may help people with inflammatory arthritis stay employed and work better, but the current evidence is very limited. More high-quality studies are needed."
112,"Background
Fibromyalgia is a chronic widespread pain condition affecting millions of people worldwide. Current pharmacotherapies are often ineffective and poorly tolerated. Combining different agents could provide superior pain relief and possibly also fewer side effects. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of combination pharmacotherapy compared to monotherapy or placebo, or both, for the treatment of fibromyalgia pain in adults. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase to September 2017. We also searched reference lists of other reviews and trials registries. 
Selection criteria
Double‐blind, randomised controlled trials comparing combinations of two or more drugs to placebo or other comparators, or both, for the treatment of fibromyalgia pain. 
Data collection and analysis
From all studies, we extracted data on: participant‐reported pain relief of 30% or 50% or greater; patient global impression of clinical change (PGIC) much or very much improved or very much improved; any other pain‐related outcome of improvement; withdrawals (lack of efficacy, adverse events), participants experiencing any adverse event, serious adverse events, and specific adverse events (e.g. somnolence and dizziness). The primary comparison was between combination and one or all single‐agent comparators. We also assessed the evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of findings' table. 
Main results
We identified 16 studies with 1474 participants. Three studies combined a non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drug (NSAID) with a benzodiazepine (306 participants); two combined amitriptyline with fluoxetine (89 participants); two combined amitriptyline with a different agent (92 participants); two combined melatonin with an antidepressant (164 participants); one combined carisoprodol, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and caffeine (58 participants); one combined tramadol and paracetamol (acetaminophen) (315 participants); one combined malic acid and magnesium (24 participants); one combined a monoamine oxidase inhibitor with 5‐hydroxytryptophan (200 participants); and one combined pregabalin with duloxetine (41 participants). Six studies compared the combination of multiple agents with each component alone and with inactive placebo; three studies compared combination pharmacotherapy with each individual component but did not include an inactive placebo group; two studies compared the combination of two agents with only one of the agents alone; and three studies compared the combination of two or more agents only with inactive placebo. 
Heterogeneity among studies in terms of class of agents evaluated, specific combinations used, outcomes reported, and doses given prevented any meta‐analysis. None of the combinations of drugs found provided sufficient data for analysis compared with placebo or other comparators for our preferred outcomes. We therefore provide a narrative description of results. There was no or inadequate evidence in any comparison for primary and secondary outcomes. Two studies only reported any primary outcomes of interest (patient‐reported pain relief of 30%, or 50%, or greater). For each 'Risk of bias' item, only half or fewer of studies had unequivocal low risk of bias. Small size and selective reporting were common as high risk of bias. 
Our GRADE assessment was therefore very low for primary outcomes of pain relief of 30% or 50% or greater, PGIC much or very much improved or very much improved, any pain‐related outcome, participants experiencing any adverse event, any serious adverse event, or withdrawing because of an adverse event. 
Three studies found some evidence that combination pharmacotherapy reduced pain compared to monotherapy; these trials tested three different combinations: melatonin and amitriptyline, fluoxetine and amitriptyline, and pregabalin and duloxetine. Adverse events experienced by participants were not serious, and where they were reported (in 12 out of 16 studies), all participants experienced them, regardless of treatment. Common adverse events were nausea, dizziness, somnolence, and headache. 
Authors' conclusions
There are few, large, high‐quality trials comparing combination pharmacotherapy with monotherapy for fibromyalgia, consequently limiting evidence to support or refute the use of combination pharmacotherapy for fibromyalgia.","Combinations of drugs versus single drugs to treat fibromyalgia pain in adults
Bottom line 
There is no good evidence to prove or disprove that combining drugs is better than using single drugs for fibromyalgia. 
Background 
People with fibromyalgia experience constant, widespread pain, sleep problems, and fatigue. Common drugs such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) and ibuprofen are not usually effective. Medicines used to treat epilepsy or depression can sometimes be effective for fibromyalgia and other forms of long‐lasting pain where there may be nerve damage. Many individuals with fibromyalgia take many different drugs to deal with pain. We did this review to find the evidence about using combinations of drugs compared to single drugs. 
Study characteristics 
In September 2017 we searched for clinical trials where combinations of medicines were used for fibromyalgia pain in adults. We found 16 studies evaluating combinations of drugs versus one drug for fibromyalgia pain. 
Key results 
These studies looked at combinations of all sorts of different drugs, but did not provide enough data to draw any conclusions. Many of the studies did not directly compare a combination of drugs with each single drug. They sometimes compared a combination of medicines with only one of the medicines in the combination, or with only placebo. This limited our ability to make any conclusions. 
Most studies did not report any of the outcomes important to people with fibromyalgia. Some studies showed that a combination of drugs is better at reducing pain than one drug alone, but other studies showed that one drug alone is better than a combination of drugs. Other studies did not find any difference between combinations of drugs and single drugs. 
Side effects were not severe, and generally were not different between combination therapy and monotherapy. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high. Very low‐quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High‐quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. Overall, the quality of evidence for important outcomes was very low. None of the combinations of drugs provided enough information for our preferred outcomes. We think that new studies will be very likely to change any conclusions drawn from these studies.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Testing Combined Medications for Fibromyalgia Pain

## What is this study about?

Researchers reviewed studies that tested whether taking two or more medications together works better than taking one medication alone for treating fibromyalgia pain in adults. Fibromyalgia causes long-lasting, widespread body pain that affects millions of people. Current medications often don't work well or cause bothersome side effects.

## What did researchers do?

They searched medical databases through September 2017 and found 16 studies involving 1,474 adults with fibromyalgia. These studies tested different medication combinations, including:
- Pain relievers with anti-anxiety medications
- Different types of antidepressants together
- Sleep aids with antidepressants
- Pain medications combined with other drugs

## What did they find?

The researchers could not combine results from different studies because each study tested different medication combinations, used different doses, and measured results differently.

**Pain Relief:**
- Only 2 of the 16 studies reported on the main question: whether pain decreased by 30% or 50%
- Three studies found some evidence that combining medications reduced pain better than single medications
- Most studies did not provide enough information to draw clear conclusions

**Side Effects:**
- Side effects were generally not serious
- Common side effects included nausea, dizziness, sleepiness, and headache
- These occurred whether people took one medication or multiple medications

## What does this mean?

There isn't enough high-quality evidence to know whether taking multiple medications together works better than taking one medication for fibromyalgia pain. More large, well-designed studies are needed before doctors can confidently recommend combination treatments.",0,Plano,"Plain-Language Summary

What is this study about?
Researchers looked at whether taking two or more medicines together helps adults with fibromyalgia pain better than taking one medicine or a placebo.

Who was studied?
- Adults with fibromyalgia
- 16 studies with 1,474 people

What treatments were tested?
Studies tested different pairs or mixes of medicines, such as:
- Melatonin with an antidepressant (like amitriptyline)
- Amitriptyline with fluoxetine
- Pregabalin with duloxetine
- Tramadol with acetaminophen (paracetamol)
- NSAIDs with a benzodiazepine
- Other smaller combinations (for example, carisoprodol/acetaminophen/caffeine; malic acid with magnesium)

How was the research done?
- Only double-blind, randomized controlled trials were included.
- Researchers searched medical databases up to September 2017.
- They measured: pain relief (30% or 50% better), overall improvement, side effects, serious side effects, and people stopping treatment.

Main findings
- The studies were small and very different from each other. Results could not be combined.
- Only two studies reported the main pain outcomes (30% or 50% pain relief).
- Three small studies suggested some pain benefit for certain combinations (melatonin + amitriptyline; fluoxetine + amitriptyline; pregabalin + duloxetine).
- Overall, there was not enough good-quality evidence to show that combination treatment works better than one medicine or placebo.

Safety
- Side effects were common in all treatment groups where reported (12 of 16 studies).
- Reported side effects included nausea, dizziness, sleepiness, and headache.
- Serious side effects were rarely reported, and data were limited.
- Some people stopped treatment due to side effects, but reporting was inconsistent.

Quality of the evidence
- The quality of evidence was very low.
- Many studies were small and did not report results fully.
- Because of this, we cannot be confident about the benefits or risks.

Bottom line
There is not enough strong evidence to support or rule out using combinations of medicines for fibromyalgia pain in adults. More large, high-quality studies are needed."
113,"Background
Across the developed world, an estimated 150,000 to 300,000 people are treated annually with pelvic radiotherapy and 80% will develop gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms during treatment. Acute GI symptoms are associated with a greater risk of chronic, often debilitating, GI symptoms. Up to one‐third of patients are malnourished before pelvic radiotherapy and up to four‐fifths of patients lose weight during treatment. Malnutrition is linked to a higher risk of GI toxicity, which can lead to breaks in radiotherapy and early cessation of chemotherapy, thus compromising the efficacy of the primary cancer treatment. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of nutritional interventions for reducing GI toxicity in adults undergoing radical pelvic radiotherapy. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group's Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Issue 4, 2012, MEDLINE and EMBASE to May 2012. We handsearched the citation lists of included studies and previous systematic reviews identified to identify further relevant trials. 
Selection criteria
We included studies if they were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or non‐randomised studies with concurrent comparison groups including quasi‐randomised trials, cluster RCTs, non‐randomised trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, and case series of 30 or more patients. We only included studies if they assessed the effect of a nutritional intervention in adults aged 18 years or over undergoing radical pelvic radiotherapy as part of anticancer treatment for a primary pelvic malignancy. We excluded patients with stomas and a previous history of inflammatory bowel disease. Nutritional support interventions could be provided at any stage before or during pelvic radiotherapy and included dietary counselling; dietary modification of fibre, lactose or fat; supplementary foods or drinks or fortified foods; standard oral nutrition supplements including polymeric‐, peptide‐ or amino acid‐based supplements and those where novel substrates have been added; enteral tube feeds; or parenteral nutrition (partial or total). We excluded probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors to obtain missing data. We assessed bias for each of the included studies using the bias assessment tables in the Cochrane software Review Manager5. We performed meta‐analysis, when indicated, using the Mantel‐Haenszel fixed‐effect method or inverse variance fixed‐effect method displayed with heterogeneity. We undertook meta‐analyses on trials evaluating dietary modification against standard treatment for diarrhoea at the end of radiotherapy and for change in weight from baseline to end of radiotherapy. 
Main results
The searches identified 7558 titles, and we excluded 7513 during title and abstract searches. We reviewed 45 papers in full, and excluded 39. We identified four studies on handsearching of the references, which, along with the six eligible papers from the database search, led to 10 studies being included. Four studies, three of which were RCTs and one prospective study, investigated the effect of elemental diet on GI symptoms; one RCT investigated the effect of dietary modification and elemental diet; and five RCTs investigated dietary modification. Studies were varied in terms of risk of bias. Data were dichotomised for presence and absence of diarrhoea at the end of radiotherapy for four trials evaluating dietary modification comprising modified fat, lactose, fibre or combinations of these dietary changes. A reduction in diarrhoea was demonstrated with nutritional intervention (risk ratio (RR) 0.66; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 0.87, four studies, 413 participants, moderate quality of evidence) with low heterogeneity (Chi2 = 3.50, I2 = 14%). Two trials evaluating dietary modification on weight change (comparing baseline and end of radiotherapy) showed no difference between intervention or control (mean difference (MD) ‐0.57 kg; 95% CI ‐1.22 to 0.09) with low heterogeneity (Chi2 = 1.41, I2 = 29%). Generally adverse effects were poorly reported in included studies. Elemental diet in particular was poorly tolerated. GI symptoms or toxicity > 6 months after radiotherapy was not reported in included studies 
Authors' conclusions
There have been benefits demonstrated with dietary modification during pelvic radiotherapy to reduce diarrhoea. Those diets included single interventions or combinations of modified fat, lactose‐restriction, fat‐restriction and fibre supplementation. We were unable to meta‐analyse elemental diet, as data were not available. We considered some of the studies to be at high risk of bias. There have been recent advances in novel, more targeted radiotherapy techniques, such that the findings of older studies need to be interpreted with caution. In addition, there were problems with compliance and palatability with some of the interventions, particularly elemental diet, which limits its usefulness in clinical practice.","Do nutritional interventions reduce gastrointestinal toxicity in adults undergoing radical pelvic radiotherapy? 
Background 
Research has shown that nutrition and radiotherapy have effects on each other. People with malnutrition tend to get more bowel side effects during radiotherapy. It has also been shown that many people lose weight during radiotherapy due to the treatment side effects. These side effects can lead to some people needing gaps in their radiotherapy and sometimes they even need to stop it entirely. This can reduce the chance of cancer cure. This review looked at the literature for providing extra nourishment or changes in diet to patients before or during radiotherapy, to determine whether this is of benefit in terms of reducing bowel symptoms, improving nutritional status and quality of life. 
Study characteristics 
Searches of all relevant sources of medical information identified 7558 articles, and, after initial screening of all these articles, we selected 45 as being suitable for this review. On reading the summaries of these 45 trials, 10 were suitable to be included in this review. We included trials that looked at the effects of a nutritional intervention in adults aged 18 years or over having radical pelvic radiotherapy as part of anticancer treatment for a primary pelvic cancer. We excluded patients with stomas and a previous history of inflammatory bowel disease. 
Key results 
Results showed that studies evaluating dietary changes, including changes in dietary fat, fibre and lactose, during radiotherapy reduced diarrhoea at the end of treatment. However, these dietary changes did not seem to improve patients' weights. 
Quality of the evidence 
While some changes to diet during radiotherapy may benefit patients by reducing diarrhoea, it is important to recognise that some of the studies reviewed were dated and there have been changes in radiotherapy technique since then that may give patients less diarrhoea anyway. In addition, many studies were of poor quality and, therefore, only a small number were able to be included in this review. Some interventions described, for example, having to take a liquid diet, were not acceptable as many patients found them difficult to tolerate and were unable to take them completely.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Nutrition Support During Pelvic Radiation Therapy

## What was this study about?

Researchers reviewed studies to see if special diets or nutrition support could help reduce stomach and bowel problems in adults receiving radiation therapy to the pelvic area (lower abdomen) for cancer treatment.

## Why is this important?

About 80% of people getting pelvic radiation therapy experience stomach and bowel problems like diarrhea during treatment. Many patients are already underweight before starting treatment, and most lose more weight during it. Poor nutrition can make side effects worse and may force doctors to pause or stop cancer treatment.

## What did researchers look for?

They searched medical databases through May 2012 and found 10 studies that tested different nutrition approaches, including:
- Special diets with changes to fat, fiber, or dairy
- Liquid nutrition supplements
- Nutrition counseling

The studies included 413 people receiving pelvic radiation therapy for cancer.

## What did they find?

**Reducing diarrhea:** People who followed modified diets (with changes to fat, fiber, or dairy intake) had less diarrhea at the end of radiation treatment compared to those eating regular diets.

**Weight changes:** Two studies found no difference in weight loss between people on special diets and those on regular diets.

**Tolerability:** Some nutrition approaches, particularly liquid-only diets, were hard for patients to stick with because of taste and difficulty following the plan.

## What are the limitations?

- Some studies were older and may not reflect current radiation techniques
- Side effects beyond 6 months after treatment weren't reported
- More research is needed to confirm these findings",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What was the goal?
To see if nutrition changes can reduce gut side effects (like diarrhea) in adults getting pelvic radiotherapy.

Who was studied?
- Adults (18+) receiving pelvic radiotherapy for cancer
- People with stomas or inflammatory bowel disease were not included
- 10 studies were reviewed; most were randomized trials

What nutrition changes were tested?
- Dietary changes: low lactose, low fat, added fiber, or combinations
- Elemental diet (special liquid formulas)
- Support could start before or during radiotherapy
- Probiotics and prebiotics were not included

What did researchers measure?
- Diarrhea at the end of radiotherapy
- Change in body weight from start to end of treatment
- Side effects and how well people could follow the diet
- Longer-term gut problems (after 6 months)

Main findings
- Dietary changes helped: People who changed their diet were less likely to have diarrhea by the end of treatment (4 studies, 413 people).
- Weight: No clear difference in weight change between diet change and usual care (2 studies).
- Elemental diets: Often hard to tolerate and hard to stick with. Benefits were unclear because data were limited.

Safety
- Side effects were not well reported.
- Elemental diets had problems with taste and tolerability.

Timing
- Results are mainly about symptoms at the end of radiotherapy.
- No study reported gut symptoms more than 6 months after treatment.

Limits to keep in mind
- Some studies had a higher risk of bias.
- Radiotherapy techniques have improved since many of these studies were done, so results may not fully apply today.

Bottom line
Simple diet changes during pelvic radiotherapy—such as reducing lactose or fat and adding fiber—can lower the chance of diarrhea by the end of treatment. These changes did not clearly affect weight. Elemental diets were hard to use and may not be practical. More up-to-date, well-reported studies are needed, especially on long-term effects."
114,"Background
In primary care between 10% and 35% of all visits concern patients with medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS). MUPS are associated with high medical consumption, significant disabilities and psychiatric morbidity. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of consultation letters (CLs) to assist primary care physicians or occupational health physicians in the treatment of patients with MUPS and diagnostic subgroups. 
Search methods
We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Controlled Trials Registers, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 2, 2009), MEDLINE  (1966‐2009), MEDLINE In Process (2009‐08‐17), EMBASE (1974‐2009), PSYCINFO (1980‐2009) and CINAHL (1982‐2009). We screened the references lists of selected studies and consulted experts in the field to identify any additional, eligible RCTs. 
Selection criteria
RCTs of CLs for patients with MUPS being treated in primary care settings.
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently screened the abstracts of the studies identified through the searches and independently assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. We resolved any disagreement by discussion with a third review author. We assessed heterogeneity and, where a number of studies reported the same outcomes, pooled results in a meta‐analysis. 
Main results
We included six RCTs, with a total of 449 patients. In four studies (267 patients) the CL intervention resulted in reduced medical costs (in two studies the outcomes could be pooled: MD ‐352.55 US Dollars (95% CI ‐522.32 to ‐182.78)) and improved physical functioning (three studies, MD 5.71 (95% CI 4.11 to 7.31)). In two studies (182 patients) the intervention was a joint consultation with a psychiatrist in presence of the physician, and resulted in reduced severity of somatization symptoms, reduced medical consumption and improved social functioning. 
Authors' conclusions
There is limited evidence that a CL is effective in terms of medical costs and improvement of physical functioning for patients with MUPS in primary care. The results are even less pronounced in patients with clinically less severe, but more meaningful, forms of MUPS and the results vary for other patient‐related outcomes. All studies, except one, were performed in the United States and therefore the results can not be generalized directly to countries with other healthcare systems. Furthermore all studies were small and of only moderate quality. There is very limited evidence that a joint consultation with the patient by a psychiatrist in the presence of the physician, together with the provision of a CL, reduces severity of somatization symptoms and medical consumption.","Consultation letters for use by primary care physicians in their care of patients with physical symptoms for which no organic cause can be found 
In 10% to 35% of all consultations in primary care, no organic cause can be found for the physical symptoms of the patient. Patients may present with symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, dizziness, non‐specific low back pain and chest pain. Such symptoms can lead to frequent consultations with the physician and high medical costs as well as causing considerable worry and disability for the patient. Patients suffering from MUPS are more likely than the average patient to experience depressive and anxiety disorders. Studies have reported positive effects of screening by a psychiatrist in the treatment of MUPS in primary care. After screening, the psychiatrist sends the primary care physician a 'consultation letter' (CL) which states the diagnosis and that patients are best helped by: 1) having their symptoms taken seriously; 2) not being told their symptoms are 'all in your head'; 3) not being referred for further investigation unless there is a clear indication of a somatic disorder; 4) undergoing a physical examination at each visit; and 5) being seen at regular intervals. 
In our review we found six studies, with a total of 449 patients, in which one of two interventions were applied. One intervention (four studies, 267 patients) was a CL following a consultation between the patient and the psychiatrist; the other (two studies, 182 patients) was a CL following a joint consultation between patient, psychiatrist and primary care physician. In each case comparison was against care as usual, provided by the primary care physician. The first intervention resulted in reduced medical costs (three studies) and improved physical functioning (three studies). We found evidence for a slight reduction in the severity of the MUPS, reduced medical consumption and improved social functioning following the second intervention, although in only one of two studies assessed. There are serious limitations in generalizability of the results to modern healthcare: most trials reported doctor‐related outcomes with patient‐related outcomes varying in results; the intervention appears to be far more effective for the most serious but rare disorders, and less so in the more common forms of MUPS; five of the six studies were performed in the United States and four studies before 1995. Furthermore the studied populations were small and five of the six studies were of moderate quality. 
Our final conclusion is that CLs may be helpful for physicians who treat patients with MUPS (based on the provider‐related outcomes). However, until further studies are conducted to find out if the intervention results in improved patient‐related outcomes, the overall effectiveness of CLs cannot be demonstrated.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Consultation Letters for Patients with Unexplained Physical Symptoms

## What was this study about?

Researchers reviewed studies to see if special letters from specialists could help primary care doctors better treat patients who have physical symptoms that doctors cannot explain with medical tests. These unexplained symptoms are common—affecting 1 in 10 to 1 in 3 patients who visit their doctor.

## What did the researchers look for?

They searched medical databases from the 1960s through 2009 to find studies that tested whether consultation letters helped doctors treat patients with unexplained physical symptoms. They only included studies that randomly assigned patients to different treatment groups.

## What did they find?

The researchers found 6 studies with 449 patients total. The results showed:

- **Medical costs:** Four studies found that consultation letters reduced healthcare costs by about $350 per patient
- **Physical functioning:** Three studies found small improvements in patients' ability to do daily physical activities
- **Other approaches:** Two studies tested having a psychiatrist meet with both the doctor and patient together. This approach reduced symptom severity and healthcare use, and improved social functioning

## What does this mean?

Consultation letters may help reduce medical costs and slightly improve how well patients can function physically. However, the evidence is limited because:
- Most studies were small
- Nearly all were done in the United States, so results may not apply to other countries with different healthcare systems
- The quality of the studies was only moderate

More research is needed to know if this approach works well for most patients with unexplained physical symptoms.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What was the goal?
To see if consultation letters from specialists help primary care or work-health doctors care for people who have ongoing physical symptoms without a clear medical cause.

Who was included?
- 6 randomized studies with 449 adults seen in primary care
- Most studies were done in the United States
- Studies looked at people with medically unexplained physical symptoms

What did the researchers do?
- Searched medical databases for studies from 1966 to 2009
- Compared care with a specialist’s consultation letter versus usual care
- In 2 studies, patients also had a one-time joint visit with a psychiatrist and their doctor, plus a letter

What were the interventions?
- Consultation letter: a specialist gave the patient’s doctor written advice on care
- Joint visit + letter: a one-time visit with a psychiatrist and the doctor together, plus written advice

Main findings
- Consultation letters (4 studies, 267 people):
  - Lower medical costs (about $353 less in two pooled studies)
  - Better physical functioning (small to moderate improvement)
- Joint visit + letter (2 studies, 182 people):
  - Fewer and less severe physical symptoms
  - Less use of medical services
  - Better social functioning

Safety
- The studies did not clearly report safety or harms.

Timing
- Evidence came from studies published up to 2009. Follow-up times varied and were not clearly reported here.

Limits to the evidence
- Small studies, moderate quality
- Mostly done in the U.S., so results may not apply everywhere
- Effects were smaller in people with milder symptoms
- Results for other patient outcomes were mixed

Bottom line
Consultation letters may lower costs and slightly improve daily physical functioning. A one-time joint visit with a psychiatrist plus a letter may further reduce symptoms and medical use. More, larger, and newer studies are needed."
115,"Background
People with severe mental illness are twice as likely to develop type 2 diabetes as those without severe mental illness. Treatment guidelines for type 2 diabetes recommend that structured education should be integrated into routine care and should be offered to all. However, for people with severe mental illness, physical health may be a low priority, and motivation to change may be limited. These additional challenges mean that the findings reported in previous systematic reviews of diabetes self management interventions may not be generalised to those with severe mental illness, and that tailored approaches to effective diabetes education may be required for this population. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of diabetes self management interventions specifically tailored for people with type 2 diabetes and severe mental illness. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, ClinicalTrials.gov and grey literature. The date of the last search of all databases was 07 March 2016. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of diabetes self management interventions for people with type 2 diabetes and severe mental illness. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened abstracts and full‐text articles, extracted data and conducted the risk of bias assessment. We used a taxonomy of behaviour change techniques and the framework for behaviour change theory to describe the theoretical basis of the interventions and active ingredients. We used the GRADE method (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group) to assess trials for overall quality of evidence. 
Main results
We included one randomised controlled trial involving 64 participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The average age of participants was 54 years; participants had been living with type 2 diabetes for on average nine years, and with their psychiatric diagnosis since they were on average 28 years of age. Investigators evaluated the 24‐week Diabetes Awareness and Rehabilitation Training (DART) programme in comparison with usual care plus information (UCI). Follow‐up after trial completion was six months. Risk of bias was mostly unclear but was high for selective reporting. Trial authors did not report on diabetes‐related complications, all‐cause mortality, adverse events, health‐related quality of life nor socioeconomic effects. Twelve months of data on self care behaviours as measured by total energy expenditure showed a mean of 2148 kcal for DART and 1496 kcal for UCI (52 participants; very low‐quality evidence), indicating no substantial improvement. The intervention did not have a substantial effect on glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at 6 or 12 months of follow‐up (12‐month HbA1c data 7.9% for DART vs 6.9% for UCI; 52 participants; very low‐quality evidence). Researchers noted small improvements in body mass index immediately after the intervention was provided and at six months, along with improved weight post intervention. Diabetes knowledge and self efficacy improved immediately following receipt of the intervention, and knowledge also at six months. The intervention did not improve blood pressure. 
Authors' conclusions
Evidence is insufficient to show whether type 2 diabetes self management interventions for people with severe mental illness are effective in improving outcomes. Researchers must conduct additional trials to establish efficacy, and to identify the active ingredients in these interventions and the people most likely to benefit from them.","Self management interventions for type 2 diabetes in adults with severe mental illness
Review question 
What are the effects of diabetes self management interventions specifically tailored for adults with type 2 diabetes and severe mental illness? 
Background 
Diabetes is one of the most common long‐term conditions, affecting around 415 million people worldwide. People with severe mental illness are twice as likely to develop diabetes as those without mental health problems because of many factors, including antipsychotic medication side effects and inadequate 'lifestyle' such as poor diet and low levels of physical activity. Once diagnosed, type 2 diabetes is managed through a combination of medication and behavioural changes. When diabetes is poorly managed, people can develop severe and life‐threatening complications. Healthcare providers have developed patient education programmes to help people to self manage their diabetes, and to reduce the likelihood of these complications. Although many programmes for type 2 diabetes have been found to be effective, little is known about programmes that have been specifically tailored to meet the needs of people with severe mental illness. 
Study characteristics 
We identified one study, which recruited 64 adults with type 2 diabetes and schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Researchers compared usual care plus information leaflets with a 24‐week education programme delivered once a week for 90 minutes (Diabetes Awareness and Rehabilitation Training). This programme provided basic diabetes education and information about nutrition and exercise. The average age of participants was 54 years; participants had been living with type 2 diabetes for on average nine years and with their psychiatric diagnosis since they were on average 28 years old. People in the included study were monitored for six months after the programme ended. 
This evidence is up to date as of 07 March 2016.
Key results 
In summary, few studies have evaluated the effects of diabetes self management programmes for adults with severe mental illness. Study authors of the single included study did not report diabetes‐related complications, all‐cause mortality, adverse events, health‐related quality of life nor socioeconomic effects. They described small improvements in body mass index and body weight, as well as in diabetes knowledge and self efficacy. Current evidence is insufficient to show that these types of programmes can help people with type 2 diabetes and severe mental illness to better manage their diabetes and its consequences. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the overall quality of the evidence as very low, mainly because of the small numbers of included studies and participants, and because reported study results showed inconsistency.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Diabetes Self-Management Programs for People with Serious Mental Illness

## What was this study about?

Researchers wanted to know if special diabetes education programs help people who have both type 2 diabetes and serious mental illness (like schizophrenia) manage their diabetes better.

## Why is this important?

People with serious mental illness are twice as likely to develop type 2 diabetes compared to people without mental illness. Regular diabetes education programs work for many people, but those with serious mental illness may face extra challenges, like having less motivation or not making physical health a priority. Researchers wanted to see if specially designed programs might work better for this group.

## What did the researchers do?

They searched medical databases through March 2016 for studies that tested diabetes self-management programs designed specifically for people with both type 2 diabetes and serious mental illness.

## What did they find?

The researchers found only one study that met their criteria. This study included 64 adults with schizophrenia or a related condition. Participants were about 54 years old on average, had lived with diabetes for about 9 years, and had been diagnosed with their mental illness since age 28.

The study tested a 24-week program called DART (Diabetes Awareness and Rehabilitation Training) and compared it to usual care plus written information. Participants were followed for 6 months after the program ended.

## What were the results?

The program did not show clear improvements in:
- Blood sugar control
- Physical activity levels
- Blood pressure

The program showed some small improvements in:
- Diabetes knowledge
- Confidence in managing diabetes
- Body weight and body mass index (right after the program)

The study did not report on diabetes complications, deaths, side effects, quality of life, or costs.

116,"Background
High altitude illness (HAI) is a term used to describe a group of cerebral and pulmonary syndromes that can occur during travel to elevations above 2500 metres ( ˜ 8200 feet ). Acute hypoxia, acute mountain sickness (AMS), high altitude cerebral oedema (HACE) and high altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) are reported as potential medical problems associated with high altitude. In this review, the first in a series of three about preventive strategies for HAI, we assess the effectiveness of six of the most recommended classes of pharmacological interventions. 
Objectives
To assess the clinical effectiveness and adverse events of commonly‐used pharmacological interventions for preventing acute HAI. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OVID), Embase (OVID), LILACS and trial registries in January 2017. We adapted the MEDLINE strategy for searching the other databases. We used a combination of thesaurus‐based and free‐text terms to search. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized‐controlled and cross‐over trials conducted in any setting where commonly‐used classes of drugs were used to prevent acute HAI. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We included 64 studies (78 references) and 4547 participants in this review, and classified 12 additional studies as ongoing. A further 12 studies await classification, as we were unable to obtain the full texts. Most of the studies were conducted in high altitude mountain areas, while the rest used low pressure (hypobaric) chambers to simulate altitude exposure. Twenty‐four trials provided the intervention between three and five days prior to the ascent, and 23 trials, between one and two days beforehand. Most of the included studies reached a final altitude of between 4001 and 5000 metres above sea level. Risks of bias were unclear for several domains, and a considerable number of studies did not report adverse events of the evaluated interventions. We found 26 comparisons, 15 of them comparing commonly‐used drugs versus placebo. We report results for the three most important comparisons: 
Acetazolamide versus placebo (28 parallel studies; 2345 participants) 
The risk of AMS was reduced with acetazolamide (risk ratio (RR) 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.56; I2 = 0%; 16 studies; 2301 participants; moderate quality of evidence). No events of HAPE were reported and only one event of HACE (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.48; 6 parallel studies; 1126 participants; moderate quality of evidence). Few studies reported side effects for this comparison, and they showed an increase in the risk of paraesthesia with the intake of acetazolamide (RR 5.53, 95% CI 2.81 to 10.88, I2 = 60%; 5 studies, 789 participants; low quality of evidence). 
Budenoside versus placebo (2 parallel studies; 132 participants) 
Data on budenoside showed a reduction in the incidence of AMS compared with placebo (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.61; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 132 participants; low quality of evidence). Studies included did not report events of HAPE or HACE, and they did not find side effects (low quality of evidence). 
Dexamethasone versus placebo (7 parallel studies; 205 participants) 
For dexamethasone, the data did not show benefits at any dosage (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.00; I2 = 39%; 4 trials, 176 participants; low quality of evidence). Included studies did not report events of HAPE or HACE, and we rated the evidence about adverse events as of very low quality. 
Authors' conclusions
Our assessment of the most commonly‐used pharmacological interventions suggests that acetazolamide is an effective pharmacological agent to prevent acute HAI in dosages of 250 to 750 mg/day. This information is based on evidence of moderate quality. Acetazolamide is associated with an increased risk of paraesthesia, although there are few reports about other adverse events from the available evidence. The clinical benefits and harms of other pharmacological interventions such as ibuprofen, budenoside and dexamethasone are unclear. Large multicentre studies are needed for most of the pharmacological agents evaluated in this review, to evaluate their effectiveness and safety.","Drugs commonly‐used for preventing high altitude illness
Background 
High altitude illness (HAI) is a term used to describe a group of brain and breathing conditions that can occur while travelling to altitudes above 2500 metres ( ˜ 8200 feet ). HAI is generally characterized by headache, nausea, vomiting and tiredness (often called acute mountain sickness), but may affect the brain or the lungs in different individuals. In this review, we assessed the most commonly‐used drugs to prevent the onset of this illness. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to January 2017. We included 64 studies related to six different types of drugs recommended for HAI prevention. Most of the studies were conducted in high altitude mountain areas, while the rest used low pressure (hypobaric) chambers to simulate altitude exposure. The participants' ages ranged between 16 and 65 years. Eleven studies included people at a high risk of this condition due to their history of HAI or other illnesses such as asthma. Twenty‐four trials provided the intervention between three and five days prior to the ascent, and 23 trials, between one and two days beforehand. Most of the included studies reached a final altitude of between 4001 and 5000 metres above sea level. In 23 of the included studies, the source of funding was unclear. Only 18 studies declared their possible conflicts of interests. We classed 24 more studies as still ongoing or waiting for assessment. 
Key results 
Our findings suggest that acetazolamide is an effective treatment for the prevention of acute HAI in dosages of 250 to 750 mg/day, when this drug is compared to a placebo (i.e. a pill with no active agent). Most of the available information relates to the prevention of uncomplicated HAI (headache, nausea, vomiting and tiredness) rather than to more serious brain or lung problems. We also found that acetazolamide is associated with an increased risk of paraesthesia in the fingers (i.e. a sensation of tingling, tickling, pricking, or burning of the skin), although this outcome is not well reported in the available evidence. The benefits and harms of other drugs such as ibuprofen, budenoside and dexamethasone are unclear, due to the small number of studies. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of the evidence as moderate to very low. Several studies had quality shortcomings, including their use of small numbers of participants and a lack of reporting of important outcomes such as side effects. For most of the drugs covered by the studies, additional research is required to clarify their effectiveness and safety.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Medications to Prevent High Altitude Illness

## What is this review about?

When people travel to high mountains (above 8,200 feet), they can get sick from the lower oxygen levels. This is called high altitude illness. Researchers wanted to find out if certain medications can help prevent this illness.

## What did the researchers study?

The research team looked at 64 studies involving 4,547 people. They examined how well different medications work to prevent high altitude sickness. Most studies took place in mountain areas, while some used special chambers that simulate high altitude conditions. Participants typically climbed to heights between 13,000 and 16,000 feet above sea level.

## What were the main findings?

**Acetazolamide (a common medication):**
- Taking 250 to 750 mg per day reduced the chances of getting altitude sickness by about half
- This medication appears to work well based on moderate-quality evidence
- Side effect: People often experienced tingling sensations (paraesthesia) in their hands and feet
- Most studies gave this medication 1-5 days before climbing

**Budenoside (a steroid medication):**
- Showed promise in reducing altitude sickness
- Only 2 small studies tested this medication, so more research is needed

**Dexamethasone (another steroid):**
- Results were unclear about whether it helps prevent altitude sickness

## What does this mean?

Acetazolamide appears to be helpful for preventing high altitude illness when taken before and during mountain travel. However, more research is needed to understand other medications better and to learn more about potential side effects.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary: Medicines to prevent sickness at high altitude

- This review looked at medicines that may prevent people from getting sick when they go to high places (above about 2,500 meters or 8,200 feet). This sickness can cause headaches, nausea, tiredness, and, in rare cases, serious brain or lung problems.

Goal
- To see which common medicines work best and are safe for preventing high-altitude illness.

Who and where
- The review combined 64 studies with 4,547 people.
- Most studies took place in real mountain settings. Some used chambers that copy high-altitude conditions.
- Most people went up to 4,001–5,000 meters (about 13,100–16,400 feet).
- In many studies, people started the medicine 1–5 days before going higher.

Medicines studied
- Acetazolamide (250–750 mg per day)
- Budesonide (an inhaled steroid)
- Dexamethasone (a steroid)
- Other drugs were also studied, but results were less clear.

Main findings
- Acetazolamide: Clearly lowered the chance of getting altitude sickness compared with a dummy pill (placebo). Evidence quality: moderate.
- Budesonide: May lower the chance, but the evidence was limited and low quality.
- Dexamethasone: No clear benefit based on the available studies.

Safety
- Acetazolamide: Increased risk of tingling in fingers or toes. Few reports on other side effects.
- Budesonide and dexamethasone: Few side effects reported, but the evidence was limited, so safety is unclear.
- Serious brain or lung problems were rare and not well reported in these studies.

Timing
- Evidence was gathered from databases up to January 2017.
- Some studies were still ongoing or not fully available at that time.

Bottom line
- Acetazolamide, taken at 250–750 mg per day starting before ascent, helps prevent altitude sickness.
- We don’t have strong enough evidence to recommend budesonide, dexamethasone, or other medicines.
- More and larger studies are needed to confirm benefits and risks for most medicines."
117,"Background
Cataract and age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) are common causes of decreased vision that often occur simultaneously in people over age 50. Although cataract surgery is an effective treatment for cataract‐induced visual loss, some clinicians suspect that such an intervention may increase the risk of worsening of underlying AMD and thus have deleterious effects on vision. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of cataract surgery compared with no surgery in eyes with AMD. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2016, Issue 11), Ovid MEDLINE, Epub Ahead of Print, In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily (January 1946 to December 2016), Embase (January 1980 to December 2016), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to December 2016), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 2 December 2016. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomized trials that enrolled participants whose eyes were affected by both cataract and AMD in which cataract surgery was compared with no surgery. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently evaluated the search results against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two review authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias for included studies, and graded the certainty of evidence. We followed methods as recommended by Cochrane. 
Main results
We included two RCTs with a total of 114 participants (114 study eyes) with visually significant cataract and AMD. We identified no ongoing trials. Participants in each RCT were randomized to immediate cataract surgery (within two weeks of enrollment) or delayed cataract surgery (six months after enrollment). The risk of bias was unclear for most domains in each study; one study was registered prospectively. 
In one study conducted in Australia outcomes were reported only at six months (before participants in the delayed‐surgery group had cataract surgery). At six months, the immediate‐surgery group showed mean improvement in best‐corrected visual acuity (BCVA) compared with the delayed‐surgery group (mean difference (MD) ‐0.15 LogMAR, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.28 to ‐0.02; 56 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). In the other study, conducted in Austria, outcomes were reported only at 12 months (12 months after participants in the immediate‐surgery group and six months after participants in the delayed‐surgery group had cataract surgery). There was uncertainty as to which treatment group had better improvement in distance visual acuity at 12 months (unit of measure not reported; very low‐certainty evidence). 
At 12 months, the mean change from baseline between groups in cumulated drusen or geographic atrophy area size was small and there was uncertainty which, if either, of the groups was favored (MD 0.76, 95% CI ‐8.49 to 10.00; 49 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No participant in one study had exudative AMD develop in the study eye during 12 months of follow‐up; in the other study, choroidal neovascularization developed in the study eye of 1 of 27 participants in the immediate‐surgery group versus 0 of 29 participants in the delayed‐surgery group at six months (risk ratio 3.21, 95% CI 0.14 to 75.68; 56 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Quality of life was measured using two different questionnaires. Scores on the Impact of Vision Impairment (IVI) questionnaire suggested that the immediate‐surgery group fared better regarding vision‐related quality of life than the delayed‐surgery group at six months (MD in IVI logit scores 1.60, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.59; low‐certainty evidence). However, we could not analyze scores from the Visual Function‐14 (VF‐14) questionnaire from the other study due to insufficient data. No postoperative complication was reported from either study. 
Authors' conclusions
At this time, it is not possible to draw reliable conclusions from the available data as to whether cataract surgery is beneficial or harmful in people with AMD after 12 months. Although cataract surgery provides short‐term (six months) improvement in BCVA in eyes with AMD compared with no surgery, it is unclear whether the timing of surgery has an effect on long‐term outcomes. Physicians must make recommendations to their AMD patients regarding cataract surgery based on experience and clinical judgment until large controlled trials are conducted and their findings published. 
There is a need for prospective RCTs in which cataract surgery is compared with no surgery in people with AMD to better evaluate whether cataract surgery is beneficial or harmful in all or a subset of AMD patients. However, ethical considerations preclude withholding surgery, or delaying it for several years, if it may be a potentially beneficial treatment. Designers of future trials are encouraged to utilize existing standardized systems for grading cataract and AMD and for measuring key outcomes: visual acuity, change in visual acuity, worsening of AMD, quality of life measures, and adverse events.","Cataract surgery in people with age‐related macular degeneration
What is the aim of this review?  The aim of this Cochrane Review was to determine whether cataract surgery is safe and improves vision in eyes with age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) compared with no surgery. Cochrane researchers collected and analyzed all relevant studies to answer this question and included two studies. 
Key messages  Although data from two small studies suggest that surgery to remove cataracts in eyes with AMD may improve vision without worsening of AMD, it is not possible to draw reliable conclusions from the available data at this time. Physicians must decide whether to recommend cataract surgery to their AMD patients based on clinical judgment until larger studies have been conducted and their findings published. 
What was studied in this review?  Both cataract and AMD are common causes of poor vision; they often occur together in people over age 50. Cataract occurs when the clear lens in the front of the eye becomes cloudy. Removing the cloudy lens (cataract surgery) restores good vision for many eyes that do not have other eye conditions. AMD is disease in which the macula (the area in the back of the eye that is responsible for central vision) deteriorates. Some physicians believe that cataract surgery may put eyes that have AMD at higher risk of more vision loss than leaving the cloudy lens in the eye. 
What are the main results of this review?  This review included two studies comparing immediate cataract surgery (within two weeks) with delayed cataract surgery (at six months) for people who had both cataract and AMD. In one study, the group that received immediate surgery had better vision at six months than the group scheduled for delayed surgery. In the other study, it was unclear which group had better vision improvements at 12 months. No participant in one study had the AMD get worse; AMD got worse in only one person in the immediate‐surgery group in the other study. Two studies measured quality of life: one study suggested that the immediate‐surgery group had a better quality of life than the delayed‐surgery group, and the second study did not report enough information to allow us to analyze the data. Neither study reported adverse events. 
How up‐to‐date is the review?  Cochrane researchers searched for studies that had been published up to 2 December 2016.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Cataract Surgery in People with Age-Related Macular Degeneration

## What was this review about?

Researchers wanted to find out if cataract surgery is safe and helpful for people who have both cataracts and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). AMD is an eye condition that affects the center of vision, while cataracts cloud the lens of the eye. Both conditions are common in people over age 50 and can make it hard to see clearly.

Some doctors worry that cataract surgery might make AMD worse, even though it helps remove the cloudy lens.

## What did the researchers look for?

The review team searched medical databases through December 2016 for studies that compared:
- People who had cataract surgery right away
- People who waited to have cataract surgery (or didn't have it at all)

## What did they find?

The researchers found 2 studies with 114 people total. In both studies, some participants had surgery within 2 weeks, while others waited 6 months.

**After 6 months:**
- People who had surgery right away could see better than those who waited
- Vision-related quality of life was better for those who had surgery
- One person who had surgery developed a complication related to AMD, but this was rare

**After 12 months:**
- It was unclear whether having surgery earlier or later made a difference in vision
- The size of AMD-related changes in the eye was similar between groups
- No serious complications from surgery were reported

## What does this mean?

Cataract surgery appears to help people see better in the short term (6 months), but the researchers couldn't tell if it helps or harms vision in the long term (12 months or more). The studies were small and didn't follow people long enough to give clear answers.

Doctors must use their best judgment when recommending cataract surgery to patients with AMD until larger, longer studies are completed.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the study

What was the goal?
- To see if cataract surgery helps or harms vision in people who also have age-related macular degeneration (AMD), compared with waiting and not having surgery right away.

Who was studied?
- Adults with both cataracts and AMD.
- Evidence came from two small randomized trials with 114 people total.

What treatments were compared?
- Immediate cataract surgery: done within 2 weeks.
- Delayed surgery: no surgery for 6 months, then surgery later.

What did the studies measure?
- Vision sharpness (best-corrected visual acuity).
- Changes in AMD signs (drusen and geographic atrophy area).
- Quality of life related to vision.
- Safety and complications.

Main findings
- Short term (6 months): People who had surgery right away saw better vision than those who waited. They also reported better vision-related quality of life in one study.
- One year: It was unclear whether having surgery earlier or later led to better vision. Results were uncertain.
- AMD worsening: Over 12 months, changes in AMD signs were small and uncertain between groups. Very few people showed new “wet” AMD changes, and numbers were too small to draw firm conclusions.
- Safety: No post-surgery complications were reported in these trials.

Timing and follow-up
- Immediate group: surgery within 2 weeks; measured at 6 or 12 months.
- Delayed group: no surgery for 6 months, then surgery; measured up to 12 months.

How strong is the evidence?
- The trials were small, and many results were uncertain (low to very low certainty).
- The short-term vision gain at 6 months had moderate certainty in one study.

Bottom line
- Cataract surgery likely improves vision in the short term for people with AMD.
- It is unclear if having surgery right away or waiting changes long-term vision or AMD outcomes.
- More, larger studies are needed, but it may not be ethical to delay helpful surgery for long periods.

Safety notes
- No surgery-related complications were reported in these trials.
- Talk with your eye doctor about your vision needs and risks to decide on timing."
118,"Background
Neuropathic pain is thought to arise from damage to the somatosensory nervous system. Its prevalence is increasing in line with many chronic disorders such as diabetes. All treatments have limited effectiveness. Given the evidence regarding psychological treatment for distress and disability in people with various chronic pain conditions, we were interested to investigate whether psychological treatments have any effects for those with chronic neuropathic pain. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of psychological treatments on pain experience, disability, mood, and health‐care use in adults with chronic neuropathic pain. 
Search methods
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in any language in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO, from database inception to March 2015. 
Selection criteria
Full publications of RCTs on psychological interventions for neuropathic pain. Trials had to have lasted at least three months, had at least 20 participants in each arm at the end of treatment, and compared a psychological intervention with any active or inactive intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
Two small studies (enrolling a total of 105 participants) met the inclusion criteria. One was a standard cognitive behavioural treatment (CBT) programme for 61 people with pain from spinal cord injury, followed up for three months, and compared with a waiting list. The other was weekly group psychotherapy for 44 people with burning mouth syndrome, compared with a daily placebo tablet. The overall risk of bias was high in both trials. 
The CBT study assessed participants for pain, disability, mood, and quality of life, with improvement in treatment and control groups. However, there was no more improvement in the treatment group than in the control for any outcome, either post‐treatment or at follow‐up. The group psychotherapy study only assessed pain, classifying participants by pain severity. There is a lack of evidence on the efficacy and safety of psychological interventions for people with neuropathic pain. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence of the efficacy and safety of psychological interventions for chronic neuropathic pain. The two available studies show no benefit of treatment over either waiting list or placebo control groups.","Psychological treatments for chronic pain involving damage or disease to nerves responsible for pain 
Many people experience pain from an injury or disease that goes away within three months, but for some people the pain continues. When the pain involves changes to nerves we call the pain 'neuropathic'. Although the condition is increasingly common, the treatments we have help only a few people. Following unsuccessful surgical or pharmacological treatment, people with chronic pain may be offered psychologically‐based rehabilitation to improve their quality of life. While we know that this can help people with other types of chronic pain, this treatment for neuropathic pain alone has received less research attention. 
In this review, we were interested in finding out whether psychological treatments improve pain, distress, and disability in people with chronic neuropathic pain. We searched the academic literature to March 2015 and identified two randomised controlled trials (the gold standard design for clinical trials) on psychological interventions for chronic neuropathic pain. The two studies included 105 participants: one trial of 61 people with pain from spinal cord injury and the other of 44 people with burning mouth syndrome. 
Our confidence in the results of the individual trials was limited by several potential biases in how they were conducted. We were not able to analyse the results of the two trials together because the experiences of people with spinal cord injury or burning mouth are too different from each other. On their own, the trials were too small for us to undertake any statistical analysis. However, neither trial found any clear benefit of treatment. We conclude that there is currently no evidence that will help practitioners and patients to decide whether to use these treatments. We discuss what studies are needed.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Psychological Treatments for Chronic Nerve Pain

## What was this review about?

Researchers wanted to find out if psychological treatments (like talk therapy) can help adults who have long-lasting nerve pain. Nerve pain happens when nerves in the body are damaged. It's becoming more common as conditions like diabetes increase. Current treatments don't work well for many people.

## What did the researchers do?

They searched medical databases up to March 2015 looking for studies that tested psychological treatments for nerve pain. They only included studies that:
- Lasted at least 3 months
- Had at least 20 people in each group at the end
- Compared psychological treatment to another treatment or no treatment

## What did they find?

The researchers found only 2 small studies with 105 people total:

**Study 1:** 61 people with pain from spinal cord injuries received cognitive behavioral therapy (a type of talk therapy that helps change thoughts and behaviors). They were compared to people on a waiting list. The study measured pain levels, daily functioning, mood, and quality of life for 3 months.

**Study 2:** 44 people with burning mouth syndrome attended weekly group therapy sessions. They were compared to people taking a placebo (inactive) pill daily. The study only measured pain levels.

## What were the results?

Neither study showed that psychological treatment worked better than the comparison groups. Both studies had problems with how they were designed and conducted.

## What does this mean?

There isn't enough evidence to know if psychological treatments help people with chronic nerve pain. More and better research is needed.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What is this study about?
- Researchers looked at whether psychological treatments can help adults with long‑lasting nerve pain.

Who was studied?
- Adults with chronic neuropathic (nerve) pain.
- Two small randomized studies with a total of 105 people:
  - 61 people with pain after spinal cord injury.
  - 44 people with burning mouth syndrome.

What treatments were tested?
- Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program vs being on a waiting list.
- Weekly group psychotherapy vs a daily placebo pill.

What outcomes were measured?
- Pain levels.
- Disability (how much pain limits daily activities).
- Mood.
- Quality of life.
- Health care use was an interest, but not clearly reported in results.

How long did it last?
- Trials had to run at least 3 months.
- The CBT study followed people for 3 months after treatment. The group therapy was weekly; exact length not stated here.

What did they find?
- In the CBT study, both the treatment and control groups improved, but CBT did not help more than the waiting list for pain, disability, mood, or quality of life, either right after treatment or at follow‑up.
- In the group psychotherapy study, only pain was measured; there was no clear benefit over the placebo pill.
- Both studies were small and had a high risk of bias, which lowers confidence in the results.

Safety
- The review did not find enough information to judge safety. No clear safety benefits or harms were shown.

Bottom line
- There is not enough good evidence to show that psychological treatments help adults with chronic neuropathic pain. More, larger, and better‑designed studies are needed."
119,"Background
A large proportion of people with advanced cancer will experience moderate to severe pain. Tapentadol is a novel, centrally acting analgesic medicine acting at the μ‐opioid receptor and inhibiting noradrenaline reuptake. The efficacy of tapentadol is stated to be comparable to morphine and oxycodone. 
Objectives
To assess the analgesic efficacy of tapentadol for the relief of cancer pain in adults, and the adverse events associated with its use in clinical trials. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE from January 2005 to July 2015, together with reference lists of retrieved papers and review articles, and two clinical trial registries. Searches started from 2005 because this covered the period during which clinical trials were conducted. We contacted the manufacturer of tapentadol in the UK to find additional trials not identified by electronic searches. We did not restrict searches by language. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of tapentadol compared with placebo or active controls in adults with moderate to severe cancer pain. Pain had to be measured using a validated assessment tool, and studies had to include at least 10 participants per treatment arm. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data using a standard form and assessed risk of bias. We extracted available data on study design, participant details, interventions, and outcomes, including analgesic outcome measures, withdrawals, and adverse events. 
Main results
We included four studies with 1029 participants. All the studies used a parallel‐group design, and included an initial titration phase to determine the maximum effective and tolerated dose, followed by a maintenance phase. Tapentadol medication was taken twice daily and doses ranged from 50 to 500 mg per day. Rescue medication (morphine or oxycodone immediate‐release) was available to participants in all studies. 
Overall, 440 participants were randomised in classically designed RCTs, and 589 participants were enrolled in enriched‐enrolment, randomised‐withdrawal (EERW) trials. A total of 476 participants were randomised to titration with tapentadol and 338 participants took tapentadol throughout the maintenance phase of their trial. 
All studies used numerical rating scores, Patient Global Impression of Change scores, and use of rescue medication as measures of efficacy, and all reported on adverse events and withdrawals. 
All studies enrolled fewer than 200 participants per treatment arm and were therefore at risk of overestimating efficacy. One study was terminated early due to problems with supply of rescue medication, with fewer than 20 participants enrolled per treatment arm in the maintenance phase of the trial. We judged another study at high risk of bias due to an open‐label design. 
There were insufficient data for pooling and statistical analysis. Response rates for pain intensity were comparable across treatment groups in each study. In one EERW study, response rates were high across both treatment and placebo arms during the maintenance phase (62% tapentadol, 69% morphine, 50% placebo). For pain relief, tapentadol is no more and no less effective than oxycodone or morphine (low quality evidence). 
Treatment emergent adverse event rates were high, approximately 50% to 90%. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, constipation) (low quality evidence). There was no advantage of tapentadol over morphine or oxycodone in terms of serious adverse events. The number of people experiencing effects on consciousness, appetite, or thirst was low. 
Authors' conclusions
Information from RCTs on the effectiveness and tolerability of tapentadol was limited. The available studies were of moderate or small size and used different designs, which prevented pooling of data. Pain relief and adverse events were comparable between the tapentadol and morphine and oxycodone groups.","Oral tapentadol for cancer pain
Tapentadol taken by mouth produced good pain relief for people with moderate to severe cancer pain, similar to morphine or oxycodone. 
One person in two or three who gets cancer will experience moderate to severe pain. As the cancer advances, the pain may get worse. Morphine has been used since the 1950s for controlling cancer pain. Since then, a number of medications with morphine‐like actions have been developed for controlling pain, one of which is tapentadol. Tapentadol has been studied in clinical trials since 2005, but has only been used in the UK since 2011. It is available in tablets of different strengths, and is normally taken twice a day. In this review, we set out to estimate how well tapentadol worked and how many people had side effects, including serious effects or those that stopped people from taking the medication. 
We searched medical databases for clinical trials in adults with moderate to severe cancer pain that compared tapentadol with placebo (dummy medicine) or other pain‐relieving medicines, and measured pain using recognised assessment methods. 
We found four studies with 1029 participants. All four studies compared participants taking tapentadol to participants taking similar medicine, such as morphine or oxycodone. All studies gave participants a period of time to find the best dose to take, before continuing on the medication and comparing their pain levels. 
All the studies were small or medium sized, so the results are at risk of being influenced by random fluctuations rather than real differences, and they may also overestimate any effects. One trial allowed participants to know what medication they were taking, and one trial was stopped early due administrative problems, so they did not have enough people in the study. We have to be cautious interpreting results from these studies. 
Because the studies all used different designs, we could not compare the results from one with another. However, each study showed that there was not much difference between the pain levels of people taking tapentadol and people taking morphine and oxycodone. Pain levels were generally well controlled. The studies also showed there was no measurable difference in how many adverse effects people had while taking tapentadol, morphine, or oxycodone. 
Therefore, we can conclude only that the studies to date show tapentadol was no more or less effective and no more or less well tolerated than morphine and oxycodone.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Study of Tapentadol for Cancer Pain Relief

## What was this study about?

Researchers reviewed clinical trials to see how well a pain medication called tapentadol works for adults with moderate to severe cancer pain. They also looked at what side effects people experienced when taking this medication.

## What is tapentadol?

Tapentadol is a prescription pain medication that works in the brain and nervous system to reduce pain signals. It's designed to work similarly to other strong pain medications like morphine and oxycodone.

## What did the researchers do?

The research team searched medical databases for studies published between 2005 and 2015. They looked for studies that:
- Tested tapentadol in adults with moderate to severe cancer pain
- Compared it to either a placebo (inactive pill) or other pain medications
- Included at least 10 people in each treatment group
- Used standard methods to measure pain levels

## What did they find?

The researchers found 4 studies involving 1,029 people total. In these studies:
- Participants took tapentadol twice daily, with doses ranging from 50 to 500 mg per day
- People could take additional ""rescue"" medication (morphine or oxycodone) when needed
- Pain relief from tapentadol was similar to pain relief from morphine and oxycodone

**Side effects:**
- 50% to 90% of people experienced side effects
- The most common side effects were stomach-related: nausea, vomiting, and constipation
- Serious side effects occurred at similar rates whether people took tapentadol, morphine, or oxycodone

## What does this mean?

Based on the limited information available, tapentadol appears to relieve cancer pain about as well as morphine and oxycodone, with similar types and rates of side effects. However, the researchers noted that more and larger studies are needed to fully understand how well tapentadol works for cancer pain.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

Purpose
- To find out if the pain medicine tapentadol helps adults with cancer pain, and to learn about its side effects.

Who was studied
- Adults with moderate to severe cancer pain.

What was studied
- Tapentadol taken by mouth twice a day (total daily dose 50–500 mg).
- Compared with placebo (no active medicine) or other strong pain medicines: morphine or oxycodone.
- All studies allowed short-acting “rescue” pain medicine (morphine or oxycodone) if needed.

How the studies worked
- 4 randomized studies with 1,029 people.
- Most had two parts:
  1) Titration: dose adjusted to find the best balance of pain relief and side effects.
  2) Maintenance: kept on the chosen dose.
- Pain was measured with number scales and patient global ratings. Use of rescue medicine and side effects were also tracked.

Main findings
- Pain relief: Tapentadol worked about the same as morphine and oxycodone. In one study, during maintenance, response rates were similar across groups (about 62% with tapentadol, 69% with morphine, 50% with placebo).
- Side effects: Common and occurred in about 50% to 90% of people across groups. The most common were stomach and bowel problems like nausea, vomiting, and constipation.
- Serious side effects: No clear advantage of tapentadol over morphine or oxycodone.
- Effects on alertness, appetite, or thirst were reported less often.

Timing
- Studies were published between 2005 and 2015.
- Each study included a dose-finding phase followed by a maintenance phase; exact lengths varied.

Safety
- High rates of side effects, mainly gastrointestinal.
- Serious side effects were similar between tapentadol and the other strong pain medicines.

Limits of the evidence
- Only four studies; many were small or had design limits. Results could not be combined for stronger estimates.
- Overall, the quality of evidence was low.

Bottom line
- Tapentadol appears to relieve cancer pain about as well as morphine and oxycodone, with similar side effects. More and larger high-quality studies are needed."
120,"Background
Post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a distressing condition, which is often treated with psychological therapies. Earlier versions of this review, and other meta‐analyses, have found these to be effective, with trauma‐focused treatments being more effective than non‐trauma‐focused treatments. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2005 and updated in 2007. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of psychological therapies for the treatment of adults with chronic post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 
Search methods
For this update, we searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR‐Studies and CCDANCTR‐References) all years to 12th April 2013. This register contains relevant randomised controlled trials from: The Cochrane Library (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). In addition, we handsearched the Journal of Traumatic Stress, contacted experts in the field, searched bibliographies of included studies, and performed citation searches of identified articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of individual trauma‐focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TFCBT), eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR), non‐trauma‐focused CBT (non‐TFCBT), other therapies (supportive therapy, non‐directive counselling, psychodynamic therapy and present‐centred therapy), group TFCBT, or group non‐TFCBT, compared to one another or to a waitlist or usual care group for the treatment of chronic PTSD. The primary outcome measure was the severity of clinician‐rated traumatic‐stress symptoms. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data and entered them into Review Manager 5 software. We contacted authors to obtain missing data. Two review authors independently performed 'Risk of bias' assessments. We pooled the data where appropriate, and analysed for summary effects. 
Main results
We include 70 studies involving a total of 4761 participants in the review. The first primary outcome for this review was reduction in the severity of PTSD symptoms, using a standardised measure rated by a clinician. For this outcome, individual TFCBT and EMDR were more effective than waitlist/usual care (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐1.62; 95% CI ‐2.03 to ‐1.21; 28 studies; n = 1256 and SMD ‐1.17; 95% CI ‐2.04 to ‐0.30; 6 studies; n = 183 respectively). There was no statistically significant difference between individual TFCBT, EMDR and Stress Management (SM) immediately post‐treatment although there was some evidence that individual TFCBT and EMDR were superior to non‐TFCBT at follow‐up, and that individual TFCBT, EMDR and non‐TFCBT were more effective than other therapies. Non‐TFCBT was more effective than waitlist/usual care and other therapies. Other therapies were superior to waitlist/usual care control as was group TFCBT. There was some evidence of greater drop‐out (the second primary outcome for this review) in active treatment groups. Many of the studies were rated as being at 'high' or 'unclear' risk of bias in multiple domains, and there was considerable unexplained heterogeneity; in addition, we assessed the quality of the evidence for each comparison as very low. As such, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence for each of the comparisons made in this review was assessed as very low quality. This evidence showed that individual TFCBT and EMDR did better than waitlist/usual care in reducing clinician‐assessed PTSD symptoms. There was evidence that individual TFCBT, EMDR and non‐TFCBT are equally effective immediately post‐treatment in the treatment of PTSD. There was some evidence that TFCBT and EMDR are superior to non‐TFCBT between one to four months following treatment, and also that individual TFCBT, EMDR and non‐TFCBT are more effective than other therapies. There was evidence of greater drop‐out in active treatment groups. Although a substantial number of studies were included in the review, the conclusions are compromised by methodological issues evident in some. Sample sizes were small, and it is apparent that many of the studies were underpowered. There were limited follow‐up data, which compromises conclusions regarding the long‐term effects of psychological treatment.","Psychological therapies for chronic post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults
Background: Post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can occur following a traumatic event. It is characterised by symptoms of re‐experiencing the trauma (in the form of nightmares, flashbacks and distressing thoughts), avoiding reminders of the traumatic event, negative alterations in thoughts and mood, and symptoms of hyper‐arousal (feeling on edge, being easily startled, feeling angry, having difficulties sleeping, and problems concentrating). 
Previous reviews have supported the use of individual trauma‐focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TFCBT) and eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) in the treatment of PTSD. TFCBT is a variant of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which includes a number of techniques to help a person overcome a traumatic event. It is a combination of cognitive therapy aimed at changing the way a person thinks, and behavioural therapy, which aims to change the way a person acts. TFCBT helps an individual come to terms with a trauma through exposure to memories of the event. EMDR is a psychological therapy, which aims to help a person reprocess their memories of a traumatic event. The therapy involves bringing distressing trauma‐related images, beliefs, and bodily sensations to mind, whilst the therapist guides eye movements from side to side. More positive views of the trauma memories are identified, with the aim of replacing the ones that are causing problems. 
TFCBT and EMDR are currently recommended as the treatments of choice by guidelines such as those published by the United Kingdom's National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). 
Study characteristics: This review draws together up‐to‐date evidence from 70 studies including a total of 4761 people. 
Key findings: There is continued support for the efficacy of individual TFCBT, EMDR, non‐TFCBT and group TFCBT in the treatment of chronic PTSD in adults. Other non‐trauma‐focused psychological therapies did not reduce PTSD symptoms as significantly. There was evidence that individual TFCBT, EMDR and non‐TFCBT are equally effective immediately post‐treatment in the treatment of PTSD. There was some evidence that TFCBT and EMDR are superior to non‐TFCBT between one to four months following treatment, and also that individual TFCBT, EMDR and non‐TFCBT are more effective than other therapies. No specific conflicts of interest were identified. 
Quality of the evidence: Although we included a substantial number of studies in this review, each only included small numbers of people and some were poorly designed. We assessed the overall quality of the studies as very low and so the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. There is insufficient evidence to show whether or not psychological therapy is harmful.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Talking Therapies for Adults with Long-Term PTSD

## What was this review about?

Researchers looked at whether different types of talk therapy (psychological therapy) help adults who have been living with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for a long time. PTSD can develop after someone experiences or witnesses a traumatic event, causing distressing symptoms that affect daily life.

## What did the researchers do?

They reviewed 70 studies that included 4,761 adults with chronic PTSD. The studies tested different types of therapy, including:
- Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TFCBT) – therapy that directly addresses the traumatic experience
- Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) – a therapy using eye movements while recalling trauma
- Non-trauma-focused CBT – therapy that doesn't directly focus on the traumatic event
- Other therapies like supportive therapy and counseling
- Group therapy versions of these treatments

These therapies were compared to each other or to people on waiting lists who hadn't started treatment yet.

## What did they find?

- Individual TFCBT and EMDR reduced PTSD symptoms more than being on a waiting list
- TFCBT, EMDR, and non-trauma-focused CBT worked about equally well right after treatment ended
- TFCBT and EMDR may work better than non-trauma-focused CBT 1-4 months after treatment
- Group trauma-focused therapy also helped reduce symptoms
- More people dropped out of active treatment groups than waiting list groups

## Important limitations

The researchers noted serious concerns about the quality of the evidence. Many studies were small, had design problems, and didn't follow participants long enough to know if benefits lasted. The findings should be interpreted carefully.

## What does this mean?

Talk therapies, especially those that focus on the traumatic experience, may help reduce PTSD symptoms in adults, though more high-quality research is needed.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the review

What was studied
- Goal: To see how well different talk therapies help adults with long‑lasting post‑traumatic stress symptoms.
- Who: Adults with chronic PTSD in clinical trials.
- What was compared: 
  - Individual trauma‑focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TFCBT)
  - Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR)
  - Non‑trauma‑focused CBT (non‑TFCBT)
  - Other therapies (supportive therapy, non‑directive counseling, psychodynamic therapy, present‑centered therapy)
  - Group TFCBT and group non‑TFCBT
  - Versus waitlist/usual care or versus each other

How the review was done
- Type of studies: Randomized controlled trials.
- Number of studies/people: 70 studies, 4,761 adults.
- Main outcome: Change in PTSD symptom severity rated by a clinician.
- Timing: Benefits measured right after treatment and again about 1–4 months later.
- The authors also looked at how many people stopped treatment early (drop‑out).

Main findings
- Individual TFCBT and EMDR worked better than waitlist/usual care to reduce symptoms right after treatment.
- Right after treatment, TFCBT, EMDR, and non‑TFCBT seemed about equally helpful.
- At 1–4 months after treatment, there was some evidence that TFCBT and EMDR worked better than non‑TFCBT.
- TFCBT, EMDR, and non‑TFCBT worked better than the “other therapies” group.
- Group TFCBT worked better than waitlist/usual care.
- More people dropped out of the active therapy groups than from waitlist/usual care.

Safety
- No detailed harms were reported across studies. The main safety‑related finding was higher drop‑out in active treatments.

Limits of the evidence
- Overall evidence quality was rated very low.
- Many studies had small sample sizes and possible bias.
- Results varied a lot between studies.
- Long‑term effects are unclear due to limited follow‑up data.

What this means
- Several talk therapies, especially TFCBT and EMDR, can reduce symptoms compared with no treatment.
- Differences between therapies right after treatment are small; TFCBT and EMDR may hold an edge at short follow‑up.
- Because the evidence is very limited in quality, these results should be viewed with caution."
121,"Background
Raised intraocular pressure is a risk factor for glaucoma. One treatment option is glaucoma drainage surgery (trabeculectomy). Antimetabolites are used during surgery to reduce postoperative scarring during wound healing. Two agents in common use are mitomycin C (MMC) and 5‐Fluorouracil (5‐FU). 
Objectives
To assess the effects of MMC compared to 5‐FU as an antimetabolite adjunct in trabeculectomy surgery. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2015 Issue 9), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to October 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to October 2015), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (January 1982 to October 2015), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 2 October 2015. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials where wound healing had been modified with MMC compared to 5‐FU. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials and collected data. The primary outcome was failure of a functioning trabeculectomy one year after surgery. Secondary outcomes included mean intraocular pressure at one year. We considered three subgroups: high risk of trabeculectomy failure (people with previous glaucoma surgery, extracapsular cataract surgery, African origin and people with secondary glaucoma or congenital glaucoma); medium risk of trabeculectomy failure (people undergoing trabeculectomy with extracapsular cataract surgery) and low risk of trabeculectomy failure (people who have received no previous surgical eye intervention). 
Main results
We identified 11 trials that enrolled 687 eyes of 679 participants. The studies were conducted in the United States, Europe, Asia and Africa. Five studies enrolled participants at low risk of trabeculectomy failure, five studies enrolled participants at high risk of failure, and one study enrolled people with both high and low risk of failure. None of the included trials enrolled participants with combined trabeculectomy/cataract surgery. 
We considered one study to be at low risk of bias in all domains, six studies to be at high risk of bias in one or more domains, and the remaining four studies to be at an unclear risk of bias in all domains. 
The risk of failure of trabeculectomy at one year after surgery was less in those participants who received MMC compared to those who received 5‐FU, however the confidence intervals were wide and are compatible with no effect (risk ratio (RR) 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 to 1.00; studies = 11; I2 = 40%). There was no evidence for any difference between groups at high and low risk of failure (test for subgroup differences P = 0.69). 
On average, people treated with MMC had lower intraocular pressure at one year (mean difference (MD) ‐3.05 mmHg, 95% CI ‐4.60 to ‐1.50), but the studies were inconsistent (I2 = 52%). The size of the effect was greater in the high‐risk group (MD ‐4.18 mmHg, 95% CI ‐6.73 to ‐1.64) compared to the low‐risk group (MD ‐1.72 mmHg, 95% CI ‐3.28 to ‐0.16), but again the test for interaction was not statistically significant (P = 0.11). 
Similar proportions of eyes treated with MMC lost 2 or more lines of visual acuity one year after surgery compared to 5‐FU, but the confidence intervals were wide (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.06). 
Adverse events occurred relatively rarely, and estimates of effect were generally imprecise. There was some evidence for less epitheliopathy in the MMC group (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.47) and less hyphaema in the MMC group (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.91). 
None of the studies reported quality of life.
Overall, we graded the quality of the evidence as low largely because of risk of bias in the included studies and imprecision in the estimate of effect. 
Authors' conclusions
We found low‐quality evidence that MMC may be more effective in achieving long‐term lower intraocular pressure than 5‐FU. Further comparative research on MMC and 5‐FU is needed to enhance reliability and validity of the results shown in this review. Furthermore, the development of new agents that control postoperative scar tissue formation without side effects would be valuable and is justified by the results of this review.","Mitomycin C versus 5‐Fluorouracil for wound healing in glaucoma surgery
Review question  Does mitomycin C (MMC) offer any advantage in comparison to 5‐Fluorouracil (5‐FU) as the antimetabolite used to augment glaucoma surgery (trabeculectomy)? Does MMC help to achieve lower rates of trabeculectomy failure than 5‐FU at one year postoperatively? 
Background  Raised intraocular pressure is a risk factor for glaucoma. One treatment option is glaucoma drainage surgery (trabeculectomy) to help lower intraocular pressure. Antimetabolites are medicines used during surgery to help reduce scarring after surgery during wound healing. If scarring occurs it can lead to treatment failure because the drainage channel no longer works. Two agents in common use are MMC and 5‐FU. 
Search date  The evidence is up to date to October 2015. 
Study characteristics  We included 11 randomised controlled trials conducted in the United States, Europe, Asia and Africa in this review. In total, 687 eyes of 679 participants underwent routine trabeculectomy for glaucoma control. Some participants were at a higher risk of failure than others, for example if they had had previous glaucoma surgery, were of African origin, or if they had secondary glaucoma. Five studies enrolled participants at low risk of trabeculectomy failure, five studies enrolled participants at high risk of failure, and one study enrolled people with both high and low risk of failure. None of the included trials enrolled participants with combined trabeculectomy/cataract surgery. 
Key results  Our review showed that the risk of failure of trabeculectomy at one year after surgery was slightly less in those participants treated with MMC compared to 5‐FU. All of the included randomised controlled trials contributed to this result, with a mixed study population of high‐ and low‐risk participants and varied methodology of antimetabolite application. We did not detect any significant differences between the subgroups of participants at low and high risk of failure, but the power of this analysis was low. 
We identified no difference between the visual outcomes of the group that received MMC and the group that received 5‐FU at one year postoperatively nor in the number of drops used postoperatively. However, we found evidence to suggest that MMC was more effective at lowering intraocular pressure than 5‐FU in both high‐ and low‐risk participants, achieving a lower mean intraocular pressure postoperatively than in those who were treated with 5‐FU at one year. This effect seemed to be greater in the high‐risk populations. 
Evaluating the overall complications across all studies revealed a slight favour toward using MMC, particularly with the incidence of epitheliopathy and hyphaema. There was a trend towards bleb leaks, wound leaks, late hypotony and cataract formation in the MMC‐treated group. 
None of the studies reported quality of life.
Quality of the evidence  We graded the quality of the evidence as low, mostly due to the risk of bias in the included studies. One bias we commonly encountered came from the different techniques of antimetabolite administration, making it difficult to conceal which medicine was being used. Furthermore, most studies only had a few complications to report, which meant that there were low numbers overall to include in the analysis of complications.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Two Medications Used During Glaucoma Surgery

## What was this study about?

Researchers reviewed studies comparing two medications—mitomycin C (MMC) and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)—used during a type of glaucoma surgery called trabeculectomy. Both medications help prevent scarring after surgery, which can affect how well the surgery works.

## Who was studied?

The review included 11 studies with 679 people (687 eyes total) from the United States, Europe, Asia, and Africa. Participants fell into two main groups:
- **Lower risk**: People having their first eye surgery
- **Higher risk**: People who had previous eye surgeries or certain types of glaucoma

## What did researchers look at?

The main question was: Which medication works better to keep eye pressure low one year after surgery? Researchers also looked at:
- Average eye pressure at one year
- Vision changes
- Side effects from the medications

## What did they find?

**Eye pressure control:**
- People treated with MMC had slightly lower eye pressure one year after surgery (about 3 points lower on average)
- The benefit appeared greater in higher-risk patients

**Surgery success:**
- MMC may reduce the chance of surgery failure, but results were uncertain

**Vision and side effects:**
- Both medications had similar effects on vision
- MMC caused fewer problems with the eye surface and less bleeding in the eye

## What does this mean?

MMC may work slightly better than 5-FU for keeping eye pressure low after glaucoma surgery, but the evidence quality was limited. More research is needed to confirm these findings and develop better medications with fewer side effects.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What was studied
- Doctors use glaucoma drainage surgery (trabeculectomy) to lower high eye pressure.
- During surgery, medicines called antimetabolites are used to lower scarring. This review compared two common medicines: mitomycin C (MMC) and 5‑fluorouracil (5‑FU).

Who was included
- 11 randomized trials with 687 eyes from 679 people.
- Studies took place in the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Africa.
- People had different chances of scarring after surgery: some low risk, some high risk. No trials included combined cataract plus trabeculectomy surgery.

What treatments were compared
- MMC used during surgery versus 5‑FU used during surgery as the scarring-control medicine.

Main outcomes and timing
- Main check: whether the surgery failed by 1 year.
- Other checks at 1 year: average eye pressure and vision changes.
- Safety: side effects and complications.
- No study reported quality of life.

Key results at about 1 year
- Surgery failure: MMC may reduce the chance of failure compared with 5‑FU, but the result was uncertain.
- Eye pressure: On average, MMC lowered eye pressure about 3 mmHg more than 5‑FU. The drop looked larger in higher‑risk patients, but this was not clearly proven.
- Vision: Similar numbers of eyes in both groups lost 2 or more lines on the eye chart.
- Safety: Serious problems were uncommon. MMC had less eye surface irritation (epitheliopathy) and less bleeding in the front of the eye (hyphaema) than 5‑FU in these trials.

Quality of the evidence
- Overall evidence quality was low. Many studies had risks of bias, and results were imprecise.

Bottom line
- MMC may control eye pressure better than 5‑FU after trabeculectomy, but the confidence in this finding is low. More high‑quality research comparing MMC and 5‑FU is needed, and new, safer anti‑scarring medicines would be valuable."
122,"Background
The use of anaesthetics in the elderly surgical population (more than 60 years of age) is increasing. Postoperative delirium, an acute condition characterized by reduced awareness of the environment and a disturbance in attention, typically occurs between 24 and 72 hours after surgery and can affect up to 60% of elderly surgical patients. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a new‐onset of cognitive impairment which may persist for weeks or months after surgery. 
Traditionally, surgical anaesthesia has been maintained with inhalational agents. End‐tidal concentrations require adjustment to balance the risks of accidental awareness and excessive dosing in elderly people. As an alternative, propofol‐based total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) offers a more rapid recovery and reduces postoperative nausea and vomiting. Using TIVA with a target controlled infusion (TCI) allows plasma and effect‐site concentrations to be calculated using an algorithm based on age, gender, weight and height of the patient. 
TIVA is a viable alternative to inhalational maintenance agents for surgical anaesthesia in elderly people. However, in terms of postoperative cognitive outcomes, the optimal technique is unknown. 
Objectives
To compare maintenance of general anaesthesia for elderly people undergoing non‐cardiac surgery using propofol‐based TIVA or inhalational anaesthesia on postoperative cognitive function, mortality, risk of hypotension, length of stay in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU), and hospital stay. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1946 to November 2017), Embase (1974 to November 2017), PsycINFO (1887 to November 2017). We searched clinical trials registers for ongoing studies, and conducted backward and forward citation searching of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with participants over 60 years of age scheduled for non‐cardiac surgery under general anaesthesia. We planned to also include quasi‐randomized trials. We compared maintenance of anaesthesia with propofol‐based TIVA versus inhalational maintenance of anaesthesia. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and synthesized findings. 
Main results
We included 28 RCTs with 4507 randomized participants undergoing different types of surgery (predominantly cardiovascular, laparoscopic, abdominal, orthopaedic and ophthalmic procedures). We found no quasi‐randomized trials. Four studies are awaiting classification because we had insufficient information to assess eligibility. 
All studies compared maintenance with propofol‐based TIVA versus inhalational maintenance of anaesthesia. Six studies were multi‐arm and included additional TIVA groups, additional inhalational maintenance or both. Inhalational maintenance agents included sevoflurane (19 studies), isoflurane (eight studies), and desflurane (three studies), and was not specified in one study (reported as an abstract). Some studies also reported use of epidural analgesia/anaesthesia, fentanyl and remifentanil. 
We found insufficient reporting of randomization methods in many studies and all studies were at high risk of performance bias because it was not feasible to blind anaesthetists to study groups. Thirteen studies described blinding of outcome assessors. Three studies had a high of risk of attrition bias, and we noted differences in the use of analgesics between groups in six studies, and differences in baseline characteristics in five studies. Few studies reported clinical trials registration, which prevented assessment of risk of selective reporting bias. 
We found no evidence of a difference in incidences of postoperative delirium according to type of anaesthetic maintenance agents (odds ratio (OR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 2.26; 321 participants; five studies; very low‐certainty evidence); we noted during sensitivity analysis that using different time points in one study may influence direction of this result. Thirteen studies (3215 participants) reported POCD, and of these, six studies reported data that could not be pooled; we noted no difference in scores of POCD in four of these and in one study, data were at a time point incomparable to other studies. We excluded one large study from meta‐analysis because study investigators had used non‐standard anaesthetic management and this study was not methodologically comparable to other studies. We combined data for seven studies and found low‐certainty evidence that TIVA may reduce POCD (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.87; 869 participants). 
We found no evidence of a difference in mortality at 30 days (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.33 to 4.45; 271 participants; three studies; very low‐certainty evidence). Twelve studies reported intraoperative hypotension. We did not perform meta‐analysis for 11 studies for this outcome. We noted visual inconsistencies in these data, which may be explained by possible variation in clinical management and medication used to manage hypotension in each study (downgraded to low‐certainty evidence); one study reported data in a format that could not be combined and we noted little or no difference between groups in intraoperative hypotension for this study. Eight studies reported length of stay in the PACU, and we did not perform meta‐analysis for seven studies. We noted visual inconsistencies in these data, which may be explained by possible differences in definition of time points for this outcome (downgraded to very low‐certainty evidence); data were unclearly reported in one study. We found no evidence of a difference in length of hospital stay according to type of anaesthetic maintenance agent (mean difference (MD) 0 days, 95% CI ‐1.32 to 1.32; 175 participants; four studies; very low‐certainty evidence). 
We used the GRADE approach to downgrade the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Reasons for downgrading included: study limitations, because some included studies insufficiently reported randomization methods, had high attrition bias, or high risk of selective reporting bias; imprecision, because we found few studies; inconsistency, because we noted heterogeneity across studies. 
Authors' conclusions
We are uncertain whether maintenance with propofol‐based TIVA or with inhalational agents affect incidences of postoperative delirium, mortality, or length of hospital stay because certainty of the evidence was very low. We found low‐certainty evidence that maintenance with propofol‐based TIVA may reduce POCD. We were unable to perform meta‐analysis for intraoperative hypotension or length of stay in the PACU because of heterogeneity between studies. We identified 11 ongoing studies from clinical trials register searches; inclusion of these studies in future review updates may provide more certainty for the review outcomes.","Injected versus inhaled medicines to maintain general anaesthesia during non‐cardiac surgery for cognitive outcomes in elderly people 
Background 
Anaesthesia during surgery in elderly people (more than 60 years of age) is increasing.
Traditionally, general anaesthesia is maintained with an inhaled drug (a vapour which the patient breathes in) which needs to be adjusted to ensure that the patient remains unconscious during surgery without receiving too much anaesthetic. An alternative method is to use propofol which is injected into a vein throughout the anaesthetic procedure; this is called total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA). 
Elderly people are more likely to experience confusion or problems with thinking following surgery, which can occur up to several days postoperatively. These cognitive problems can last for weeks or months, and can affect the patients' ability to plan, focus, remember, or undertake activities of daily living. We looked at two types of postoperative confusion: delirium (a problem with awareness and attention which is often temporary) and cognitive dysfunction (a persistent problem with brain function). 
TIVA with propofol may be a good alternative to inhaled drugs, and it is known that patients who have TIVA experience less nausea and vomiting, and wake up more quickly after anaesthesia. However, it is unknown which is the better anaesthetic technique in terms of postoperative cognitive outcomes. 
Review question 
To compare maintenance of general anaesthesia for elderly people undergoing non‐cardiac surgery using TIVA or inhalational anaesthesia on postoperative cognitive function, number of deaths, risk of low blood pressure during the operation, length of stay in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU), and hospital stay. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to November 2017. We included 28 randomized studies with 4507 participants in the review. We are awaiting sufficient information for the classification of four studies. 
All studies included elderly people undergoing non‐cardiac surgery and compared use of propofol‐based TIVA versus inhalational agents during maintenance of general anaesthesia. 
Key results 
We found little or no difference in postoperative delirium according to the type of anaesthetic maintenance agents from five studies (321 participants). We found that fewer people experienced postoperative cognitive dysfunction when TIVA with propofol was used in seven studies (869 participants). We excluded one study from analysis of this outcome because study authors had used methods to anaesthetize people which were not standard. 
We found little or no difference in the number of deaths from three studies (271 participants). We did not combine data for low blood pressure during the operation or length of stay in the PACU because we noted differences in studies, which may be explained by differences in patient management (for low blood pressure), and differences in how length of stay in the PACU is defined in each study . We found little or no difference in length of hospital stay from four studies (175 participants). 
Quality of the evidence 
Many studies did not report randomization methods adequately and all studies were at high risk of bias from anaesthetists, who needed to be aware of which anaesthetic agent they used. Outcome assessors in some studies were aware of which study group participants were in. We noted a large loss of participants in three studies, and some studies had differences between groups in the types of drugs used for pain, the types of monitors used to assess how deeply‐unconscious the patients were, and participant characteristics at the start of the studies; these factors may have influenced the results. Few studies had reported clinical trials registration. We found few studies for two outcomes (mortality and length of hospital stay), which made the results less precise. We judged evidence for postoperative delirium, number of deaths, length of stay in the PACU, and length of hospital stay to be very low certainty, and evidence for postoperative cognitive dysfunction, and low blood pressure during the operation to be low certainty. 
TIVA with propofol may reduce postoperative cognitive dysfunction. We are uncertain whether the choice of anaesthetic agents (TIVA with propofol, or inhalational agents) affects postoperative delirium, mortality and length of hospital stay. We found 11 ongoing studies in database and clinical trials register searches. Inclusion of these studies in future review updates will provide more certainty for the review outcomes.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Two Types of Anesthesia for Older Adults During Surgery

## What was this study about?

Researchers wanted to find the best way to keep older adults (over 60 years old) asleep during surgery. They compared two methods:
- **Inhaled gases** (breathed in through a mask) – the traditional method
- **Intravenous propofol** (given through an IV) – a newer method

They wanted to see which method was better for protecting thinking and memory after surgery.

## Why does this matter?

After surgery, some older adults experience:
- **Confusion** (called delirium) – usually happens 1-3 days after surgery and can affect up to 60% of older surgical patients
- **Thinking and memory problems** – can last weeks or months

## What did the researchers do?

They reviewed 28 studies involving 4,507 older adults having different types of surgery (like heart, abdominal, bone, and eye surgeries). All participants received one of the two anesthesia methods to keep them asleep during their operations.

## What did they find?

- **Confusion after surgery**: No clear difference between the two methods (very uncertain results)
- **Thinking and memory problems**: Propofol through an IV may cause fewer problems than inhaled gases, but more research is needed
- **Deaths within 30 days**: No clear difference (very uncertain results)
- **Blood pressure drops during surgery**: Results varied too much between studies to draw conclusions
- **Time in recovery room**: Results varied too much between studies to draw conclusions
- **Hospital stay length**: No clear difference (very uncertain results)

## What does this mean?

The researchers cannot say for certain which anesthesia method is better for older adults because the evidence quality was limited. Propofol through an IV might help protect thinking and memory better, but more high-quality studies are needed to be sure.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What was studied
- Doctors compared two common ways to keep people asleep during surgery:
  - Propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), given through a vein
  - Inhaled anesthesia, breathed in (such as sevoflurane, isoflurane, or desflurane)
- Focus: people age 60 and older having non-cardiac surgery.

Why it matters
- Some older adults have short-term confusion after surgery (delirium, usually 1–3 days after surgery) or thinking/memory problems that can last weeks to months (postoperative cognitive dysfunction, POCD).
- The best anesthetic method to lower these risks is unclear.

Who was included
- 28 randomized studies with 4,507 participants.
- Surgeries included abdominal, orthopedic, eye, laparoscopic, and vascular (not heart surgery).

What the researchers looked at
- Delirium after surgery (within 24–72 hours)
- POCD (weeks to months after surgery)
- Death within 30 days
- Low blood pressure during surgery
- Time in the recovery room (PACU)
- Length of hospital stay
- Safety and side effects

Key findings
- Delirium: No clear difference between TIVA and inhaled anesthesia. Certainty of evidence: very low.
- POCD: TIVA may lower the chance of POCD compared with inhaled anesthesia. Certainty: low.
- Death within 30 days: No clear difference. Certainty: very low.
- Low blood pressure during surgery: Results varied across studies; no clear conclusion.
- Time in PACU: Results varied; no clear conclusion.
- Hospital stay: No difference.
- Side effects: Not enough consistent information to show clear differences.

Study quality and limits
- Many studies could not blind the anesthesia team.
- Some had missing data or differences in pain medicines.
- Results were not always measured the same way, making them hard to combine.
- Overall certainty was low to very low for most outcomes.

Bottom line
- For adults 60+ having non-cardiac surgery, TIVA may reduce longer-lasting thinking/memory problems (POCD), but the evidence is limited.
- No clear differences were found for delirium, 30-day death, or hospital stay.
- More high-quality studies are needed. Eleven ongoing studies may provide clearer answers in the future."

We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (14 February 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 1, 2011 in The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (January 1966 to January 2011) and EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2011) and reference lists of articles searched using the terms motor neuron disease, motor neurone disease, motoneuron disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We contacted authors of trials for further information. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised and quasi‐randomised trials of oral medications in people with ALS which assessed cramps as a primary or secondary outcome measure or as an adverse event. We also included trials using subcutaneous or intravenous medications or physical therapy. 
Data collection and analysis
All authors applied the selection criteria and assessed study quality independently, and all authors performed independent data extraction. 
Main results
Twenty studies including 4789 participants were identified. Only one trial, of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), assessed cramps as the primary endpoint. Thirteen studies assessed cramps as a secondary endpoint. The medications comprised vitamin E, baclofen, riluzole, L‐threonine, xaliproden, indinavir, and memantine. Six studies assessed cramps as an adverse event. The medications comprised creatine, gabapentin, dextromethorphan, quinidine, and lithium. In all 20 studies no favourable effect for the treatment of cramps in ALS/MND could be demonstrated, but many studies were underpowered to draw a definite conclusion. A meta‐analysis of two small studies showed a statistically nonsignificant result for the amino acid L‐threonine for the treatment of cramps in ALS/MND. No study was identified using physical therapy as a therapeutic intervention for cramps. 
Authors' conclusions
There is no evidence to support the use of any intervention for muscle cramps in ALS/MND. More and larger randomised controlled trials evaluating treatments for muscle cramps in ALS/MND are needed.","Treatment for cramps in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease
A cramp is a sudden, involuntary painful contraction of a muscle. Many people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease (MND), experience cramps during the course of the disease. These range from mild cramps that do not affect daily activities and sleep, through to very severe, painful cramps. Some medications that are used to treat cramps in people with no medical condition or with conditions other than ALS have been tested in ALS clinical trials. These medicines include vitamin E, creatine, quinidine, and gabapentin. Other medications such as quinine sulfate, magnesium, lioresal, dantrolene, clonazepam, diphenylhydantoin, and gabapentin have been used to treat cramps in people with ALS but their effectiveness is unknown. In 2006 and 2010 the US Food and Drugs Administration issued warnings concerning the use of quinine sulfate, which was the previously most widely prescribed medication for cramps in the US. This review sought to find out how effective medications and physical treatments for cramps are for people with ALS. The reviewers identified 20 randomised controlled trials in people with ALS comprising a total of 4789 participants. Only one trial, of the drug tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), directly investigated the effectiveness of an intervention for cramps. Thirteen randomised controlled ALS trials investigated cramps secondarily among other variables. The medications comprised vitamin E, baclofen, riluzole, L‐threonine, xaliproden, indinavir, and memantine. Six randomised controlled ALS trials investigated cramps as adverse events. The medications comprised creatine, gabapentin, dextromethorphan, quinidine and lithium. None of the 20 studies could demonstrate any benefit, but the studies were small. Current evidence on the treatment of cramps in ALS is lacking and more research is needed.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Studies on Treatments for Muscle Cramps in People with ALS

## What was this review about?

Researchers looked at studies testing different treatments for muscle cramps in people with ALS (also called motor neuron disease or MND). Muscle cramps are painful, sudden muscle tightening that happens without a person's control. These cramps are common in people with ALS at any stage of their condition.

## What did the researchers do?

The research team searched medical databases through early 2011 to find studies that tested treatments for muscle cramps in people with ALS. They looked for studies that:
- Tested medications taken by mouth, injection, or IV
- Tested physical therapy
- Measured whether cramps got better or worse

## What did they find?

The researchers found 20 studies that included 4,789 people total. These studies tested many different medications, including:
- Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)
- Vitamin E
- Baclofen
- Riluzole
- L-threonine
- Several other drugs

Only one study specifically focused on treating cramps as its main goal. The other studies looked at cramps as a side effect or secondary measure.

## What were the results?

None of the 20 studies showed that any treatment helped reduce muscle cramps in people with ALS. However, many studies had too few participants to give clear answers. The researchers found no studies testing physical therapy for cramps.

## What does this mean?

Currently, there is no proven treatment for muscle cramps in people with ALS. Larger studies are needed to find effective treatments for this painful symptom.",0,Plano,"Plain-Language Summary

- A small combined analysis of two studies of L‑threonine did not show a meaningful effect.
- Many studies were too small to give firm answers.

Safety
- Several studies tracked cramps as side effects of medicines, but no treatment showed a proven benefit for cramps.
- No physical therapy safety data were available because no trials tested it for cramps.

What this means
- There is no good evidence that any tested treatment helps muscle cramps in ALS/MND.
- Larger, well-designed trials are needed to find effective and safe treatments.

Timeline note
- Evidence includes studies available up to February 2011."
124,"Background
Thalassaemia is a hereditary anaemia due to ineffective erythropoiesis. In particular, people with thalassaemia major develop secondary iron overload resulting from regular red blood cell transfusions. Iron chelation therapy is needed to prevent long‐term complications. 
Both deferoxamine and deferiprone are effective; however, a review of the effectiveness and safety of the newer oral chelator deferasirox in people with thalassaemia is needed. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of oral deferasirox in people with thalassaemia and iron overload. 
Search methods
We searched the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 12 August 2016. 
We also searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Biosis Previews, Web of Science Core Collection and three trial registries: ClinicalTrials.gov; the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; and the Internet Portal of the German Clinical Trials Register: 06 and 07 August 2015. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled studies comparing deferasirox with no therapy or placebo or with another iron‐chelating treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. 
Main results
Sixteen studies involving 1807 randomised participants (range 23 to 586 participants) were included. Twelve two‐arm studies compared deferasirox to placebo (two studies) or deferoxamine (seven studies) or deferiprone (one study) or the combination of deferasirox and deferoxamine to deferoxamine alone (one study). One study compared the combination of deferasirox and deferiprone to deferiprone in combination with deferoxamine. Three three‐arm studies compared deferasirox to deferoxamine and deferiprone (two studies) or the combination of deferasirox and deferiprone to deferiprone and deferasirox monotherapy respectively (one study). One four‐arm study compared two different doses of deferasirox to matching placebo groups. 
The two studies (a pharmacokinetic and a dose‐escalation study) comparing deferasirox to placebo (n = 47) in people with transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia showed that deferasirox leads to net iron excretion. In these studies, safety was acceptable and further investigation in phase II and phase III studies was warranted. 
Nine studies (1251 participants) provided data for deferasirox versus standard treatment with deferoxamine. Data suggest that a similar efficacy can be achieved depending on the ratio of doses of deferoxamine and deferasirox being compared. In the phase III study, similar or superior efficacy for the intermediate markers ferritin and liver iron concentration (LIC) could only be achieved in the highly iron‐overloaded subgroup at a mean ratio of 1 mg of deferasirox to 1.8 mg of deferoxamine corresponding to a mean dose of 28.2 mg per day and 51.6 mg per day respectively. The pooled effects across the different dosing ratios are: serum ferritin, mean difference (MD) 454.42 ng/mL (95% confidence interval (CI) 337.13 to 571.71) (moderate quality evidence); LIC evaluated by biopsy or SQUID, MD 2.37 mg Fe/g dry weight (95% CI 1.68 to 3.07) (moderate quality evidence) and responder analysis, LIC 1 to < 7 mg Fe/g dry weight, risk ratio (RR) 0.80 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.92) (moderate quality evidence). The substantial heterogeneity observed could be explained by the different dosing ratios. Data on mortality (low quality evidence) and on safety at the presumably required doses for effective chelation therapy are limited. Patient satisfaction was better with deferasirox among those who had previously received deferoxamine treatment, RR 2.20 (95% CI 1.89 to 2.57) (moderate quality evidence). The rate of discontinuations was similar for both drugs (low quality evidence). 
For the remaining comparisons in people with transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia, the quality of the evidence for outcomes assessed was low to very low, mainly due to the very small number of participants included. Four studies (205 participants) compared deferasirox to deferiprone; one of which (41 participants) revealed a higher number of participants experiencing arthralgia in the deferiprone group, but due to the large number of different types of adverse events reported and compared this result is uncertain. One study (96 participants) compared deferasirox combined with deferiprone to deferiprone with deferoxamine. Participants treated with the combination of the oral iron chelators had a higher adherence compared to those treated with deferiprone and deferoxamine, but no participants discontinued the study. In the comparisons of deferasirox versus combined deferasirox and deferiprone and that of deferiprone versus combined deferasirox and deferiprone (one study, 40 participants), and deferasirox and deferoxamine versus deferoxamine alone (one study, 94 participants), only a few patient‐relevant outcomes were reported and no significant differences were observed. 
One study (166 participants) included people with non‐transfusion dependent thalassaemia and compared two different doses of deferasirox to placebo. Deferasirox treatment reduced serum ferritin, MD ‐306.74 ng/mL (95% CI ‐398.23 to ‐215.24) (moderate quality evidence) and LIC, MD ‐3.27 mg Fe/g dry weight (95% CI ‐4.44 to ‐2.09) (moderate quality evidence), while the number of participants experiencing adverse events and rate of discontinuations (low quality evidence) was similar in both groups. No participant died, but data on mortality were limited due to a follow‐up period of only one year (moderate quality evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Deferasirox offers an important treatment option for people with thalassaemia and secondary iron overload. Based on the available data, deferasirox does not seem to be superior to deferoxamine at the usually recommended ratio of 1 mg of deferasirox to 2 mg of deferoxamine. However, similar efficacy seems to be achievable depending on the dose and ratio of deferasirox compared to deferoxamine. Whether this will result in similar efficacy and will translate to similar benefits in the long term, as has been shown for deferoxamine, needs to be confirmed. Data from randomised controlled trials on rare toxicities and long‐term safety are still limited. However, after a detailed discussion of the potential benefits and risks, deferasirox could be offered as the first‐line option to individuals who show a strong preference for deferasirox, and may be a reasonable treatment option for people showing an intolerance or poor adherence to deferoxamine.","Deferasirox for managing iron overload in people with thalassaemia
Background 
Thalassaemia is a hereditary anaemia due to a defect in the production of haemoglobin. Regular red blood cell transfusions are needed, particularly for the severe form of the disease, thalassaemia major. This results in iron overload. Since the human body has no means of actively getting rid of excessive iron, drug treatment (iron‐chelating drugs) is needed. Several years ago, a newer oral iron chelator, deferasirox, was introduced. 
Review question 
Does deferasirox offer advantages compared to placebo or to the other iron chelators deferoxamine or deferiprone in people with thalassaemia with regard to effectiveness and safety? 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to 12 August 2016. This updated review includes 16 randomised controlled studies (1807 participants) containing 20 comparisons of deferasirox versus another treatment. 
In people with transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia, two studies compared deferasirox with placebo and nine studies (1251 participants) compared deferasirox with standard treatment of deferoxamine. Four studies (205 participants) compared deferasirox to deferiprone. One study each compared deferasirox and deferiprone respectively to deferasirox and deferiprone combination therapy (40 participants), deferasirox and deferoxamine combination therapy to deferoxamine alone (94 participants) and deferasirox and deferiprone combination therapy to deferiprone and deferoxamine combination therapy (96 participants). 
In people with non‐transfusion dependent thalassemia (individuals not requiring regular blood transfusions), one study (166 participants) compared deferasirox to placebo. The duration of the included studies ranged from 12 days to two years. 
Key results 
Two studies comparing deferasirox with placebo in people with transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia showed that deferasirox was effective at removing iron. Nine other studies compared deferasirox with standard treatment of deferoxamine. Similar effectiveness seems possible, depending of the doses of the two drugs compared. It needs to be confirmed whether this leads to similar improvements in patient‐important outcomes in the long run. The safety of deferasirox was acceptable; however, rarer adverse events or long‐term side effects could not be adequately investigated due to the limited number of participants and the relatively short duration of the studies. Patient satisfaction was significantly better with deferasirox among those who had previously been treated with deferoxamine. The rate of discontinuations was similar for both drugs. Deferasirox may be an alternative for those individuals who do not tolerate, or have poor adherence with, deferoxamine. In people with a strong preference to deferasirox, potential benefits and risks should be discussed. 
One study (41 participants) reported that more individuals with transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia experienced joint pain when treated with deferiprone than with deferasirox, but due to the large number of different types of adverse events reported and compared, this result may be due to chance. One study revealed that adherence to treatment was higher when both oral iron chelators, deferasirox and deferiprone are used than the combination of deferiprone and deferoxamine, but no participant discontinued the study. We found no evidence for any differences comparing deferasirox or deferiprone alone to combined deferasirox and deferiprone treatment or deferasirox and deferoxamine combination to deferoxamine alone, but the numbers of people in the studies were small and available data were very limited. 
One study in people with non‐transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia found deferasirox was better at reducing serum ferritin and liver iron concentration compared to placebo. However, there is no evidence on the impact on patient‐important outcomes or long‐term safety data in this population. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of included studies comparing deferasirox to deferoxamine in people with transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia was moderate to low, mainly due fact that the investigators and participants knew which interventions had been assigned to which participants, the small number of participants included in the studies and the use of a surrogate markers (measures used in place of a hard clinical end point) instead of patient‐important outcomes. For the comparison of deferasirox to placebo in people with non‐transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia, the quality of the evidence was moderate to very low based on only one small study. For the other comparisons, the quality of the evidence was low to very low, mainly due to the inclusion of even fewer participants. Ideally, further randomised studies looking at patient‐important, long‐term outcomes and rarer adverse events, should be conducted.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Study on Deferasirox for Iron Overload in People with Thalassemia

## What is this study about?

People with thalassemia major need regular blood transfusions throughout their lives. These transfusions cause extra iron to build up in the body, which can damage organs over time. To prevent this damage, people need to take medicine that removes the extra iron (called iron chelation therapy).

This study reviewed how well a newer oral medicine called deferasirox works compared to other iron-removal medicines.

## What medicines were compared?

Researchers looked at 16 studies involving 1,807 people with thalassemia. They compared:
- Deferasirox (taken by mouth) versus deferoxamine (given by injection under the skin)
- Deferasirox versus deferiprone (another oral medicine)
- Deferasirox versus inactive treatment (placebo)
- Various combinations of these medicines

## What did they find?

**Deferasirox compared to deferoxamine:**
- Both medicines can reduce iron levels in the body
- Deferasirox works similarly to deferoxamine, but the dose matters—higher doses of deferasirox may be needed to match deferoxamine's effects
- People preferred taking deferasirox because it's a pill taken once daily, while deferoxamine requires injections 5-7 times per week
- Both medicines had similar rates of people stopping treatment

**Deferasirox in people who don't need regular transfusions:**
- Deferasirox reduced iron levels in the blood and liver
- Side effects were similar to inactive treatment

**Safety:**
- Information about long-term safety and rare side effects is still limited
- More research is needed to understand effects over many years

## What does this mean?

Deferasirox provides an important treatment choice for people with thalassemia who have too much iron. It may be a good option for people who have difficulty with or prefer not to use injection-based treatments.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the clinical trial review

Purpose
- To see how well the oral iron remover (chelator) deferasirox works and how safe it is for people with thalassaemia who have too much iron.

Who was studied
- 16 randomized studies with 1,807 people.
- Most had transfusion‑dependent thalassaemia; one study included people who did not need regular transfusions.

Treatments compared
- Deferasirox (oral) versus:
  - Placebo (no active drug)
  - Deferoxamine (standard treatment, usually by infusion)
  - Deferiprone (oral)
- Some studies tested combinations (deferasirox + deferiprone, or deferasirox + deferoxamine) versus single drugs.

What researchers measured
- Iron levels in the body, using:
  - Blood ferritin
  - Liver iron concentration (LIC)
  - Net iron excretion
- Side effects, treatment stopping, satisfaction, and deaths.
- Follow-up in many studies was up to about 1 year.

Key results

Transfusion‑dependent thalassaemia
- Versus placebo: Deferasirox increased iron removal and had acceptable short‑term safety in small early studies.
- Versus deferoxamine: Similar iron control was possible, depending on dose. At commonly used dose ratios (about 1 mg deferasirox to 2 mg deferoxamine), deferasirox did not appear better than deferoxamine. Higher deferasirox dosing (relative to deferoxamine) led to similar results in highly iron‑overloaded groups.
- Patient satisfaction: Higher with deferasirox in people who had used deferoxamine before.
- Stopping treatment: Similar rates for deferasirox and deferoxamine.
- Versus deferiprone: Few small studies; results were uncertain. One small study found more joint pain with deferiprone.
- Combination treatments: All‑oral combo (deferasirox + deferiprone) had better adherence than deferiprone + deferoxamine. Few differences in other outcomes were shown, and data were limited.

Non‑transfusion‑dependent thalassaemia
- Deferasirox lowered ferritin and LIC more than placebo.
- Side effects and stopping treatment were similar to placebo over about 1 year.
- No deaths were reported in that study’s follow‑up period.

Safety
- Short‑term safety was generally acceptable in the trials reviewed.
- Evidence about rare side effects and long‑term safety is limited.
- In small studies, many different side effects were reported, but most comparisons were too small to be certain.

What this means
- Deferasirox is an important oral option to lower iron in thalassaemia.
- It can work about as well as deferoxamine when the dose is matched properly, but it is not clearly better at usual dose ratios.
- Because it is oral, many people prefer it. It may be a good first choice for those who strongly prefer pills or have trouble using deferoxamine.
- More research is needed on long‑term benefits and rare risks."
125,"Background
Crowns for primary molars are preformed and come in a variety of sizes and materials to be placed over decayed or developmentally defective teeth. They can be made completely of stainless steel (know as 'preformed metal crowns' or PMCs), or to give better aesthetics, may be made of stainless steel with a white veneer cover or made wholly of a white ceramic material. In most cases, teeth are trimmed for the crowns to be fitted conventionally using a local anaesthetic. However, in the case of the Hall Technique, PMCs are pushed over the tooth with no local anaesthetic, carious tissue removal or tooth preparation. Crowns are recommended for restoring primary molar teeth that have had a pulp treatment, are very decayed or are badly broken down. However, few dental practitioners use them in clinical practice. This review updates the original review published in 2007. 
Objectives
Primary objective 
To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of all types of preformed crowns for restoring primary teeth compared with conventional filling materials (such as amalgam, composite, glass ionomer, resin modified glass ionomer and compomers), other types of crowns or methods of crown placement, non‐restorative caries treatment or no treatment. 
Secondary objective 
To explore whether the extent of decay has an effect on the clinical outcome of primary teeth restored with all types of preformed crowns compared with those restored with conventional filling materials. 
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 21 January 2015), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library, 2014, Issue 12), MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to 21 January 2015) and EMBASE via Ovid (1980 to 21 January 2015). We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials and Open Grey for grey literature (to 21 January 2015). No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the databases. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the effectiveness of crowns compared with fillings, other types of crowns, non‐restorative approaches or no treatment in children with untreated tooth decay in one or more primary molar teeth. We would also have included trials comparing different methods of fitting crowns. 
For trials to be considered for this review, the success or failure of the interventions and other clinical outcomes had to be reported at least six months after intervention (with the exception of 'pain/discomfort during treatment and immediately postoperatively'). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the title and abstracts for each article from the search results. and independently assessed the full text for each potentially relevant study. At least two authors assessed risk of bias and extracted data using a piloted data extraction form. 
Main results
We included five studies that evaluated three comparisons. Four studies compared crowns with fillings; two of them compared conventional PMCs with open sandwich restorations, and two compared PMCs fitted using the Hall Technique with fillings. One of these studies included a third arm, which allowed the comparison of PMCs (fitted using the Hall Technique) versus non‐restorative caries treatment. In the two studies using crowns fitted using the conventional method, all teeth had undergone pulpotomy prior to the crown being placed. The final study compared two different types of crowns: PMCs versus aesthetic stainless steel crowns with white veneers. No RCT evidence was found that compared different methods of fitting preformed metal crowns (i.e. Hall Technique versus conventional technique). 
We considered outcomes reported at the dental appointment or within 24 hours of it, and in the short term (less than 12 months) or long term (12 months or more). Some of our outcomes of interest were not measured in the studies: time to restoration failure or retreatment, patient satisfaction and costs. 
Crowns versus fillings 
All studies in this comparison used PMCs. One study reported outcomes in the short term and found no reports of major failure or pain in either group. There was moderate quality evidence that the risk of major failure was lower in the crowns group in the long term (risk ratio (RR) 0.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 0.56; 346 teeth in three studies, one conventional and two using Hall Technique). Similarly, there was moderate quality evidence that the risk of pain was lower in the long term for the crown group (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.67; 312 teeth in two studies). 
Discomfort associated with the procedure was lower for crowns fitted using the Hall Technique than for fillings (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87; 381 teeth) (moderate quality evidence). 
It is uncertain whether there is a clinically important difference in the risk of gingival bleeding when using crowns rather than fillings, either in the short term (RR 1.69, 95% CI 0.61 to 4.66; 226 teeth) or long term (RR 1.74, 95% CI 0.99 to 3.06; 195 teeth, two studies using PMCs with conventional technique at 12 months) (low quality evidence). 
Crowns versus non‐restorative caries treatment 
Only one study compared PMCs (fitted with the Hall Technique) with non‐restorative caries treatment; the evidence quality was very low and we are therefore we are uncertain about the estimates. 
Metal crowns versus aesthetic crowns 
One split‐mouth study (11 participants) compared PMCs versus aesthetic crowns (stainless steel with white veneers). It provided very low quality evidence so no conclusions could be drawn. 
Authors' conclusions
Crowns placed on primary molar teeth with carious lesions, or following pulp treatment, are likely to reduce the risk of major failure or pain in the long term compared to fillings. Crowns fitted using the Hall Technique may reduce discomfort at the time of treatment compared to fillings. The amount and quality of evidence for crowns compared to non‐restorative caries, and for metal compared with aesthetic crowns, is very low. There are no RCTs comparing crowns fitted conventionally versus using the Hall Technique.","Preformed crowns for managing decayed primary molar teeth in children
Background 
To stop further damage and restore function of primary molar teeth that are decayed or malformed, a dentist will usually use a filling (a soft material that is placed in the cavity and hardened) to restore the tooth to its original shape. Alternatively the dentist may place a crown over the tooth to cover it. This usually requires an injection in the gum to numb the tooth before trimming it down (conventional technique). These crowns are pre‐made (i.e. preformed) in a variety of sizes and can be metal or white, with the correct size being chosen to fit the trimmed down tooth. The Hall Technique is an alternative method for fitting metal crowns, where there is no need for an injection or tooth trimming as the crown is simply pushed over the tooth. Preformed crowns are recommended by specialists in children's dentistry for the management of baby back teeth (molars) when they are affected by moderate to advanced tooth decay, or where the enamel has malformed during development or the tooth has had to have root canal treatment. 
Review question 
This Cochrane review asked whether crowns are better than other ways of managing decay in children's baby teeth for reducing 'major failure' (an outcome that includes aspects such as toothache and dental abscess), pain during treatment and harm, and for improving satisfaction with treatment. It also asked whether metal or white crowns were better and whether a new fitting method called the Hall Technique was better than the conventional fitting technique. The review updates one originally published in 2007. 
Study characteristics 
We searched medical and dental sources for studies up to 21 January 2015. We identified five relevant studies. They were at high risk of bias because the participants knew which treatment they received and so did the people who treated them. 
Four studies compared crowns with fillings. Two of them compared metal crowns fitted using the conventional method with fillings and two compared metal crowns fitted using the Hall Technique with fillings. One of the studies also compared the Hall Technique with 'non‐restorative caries treatment' (not using either a filling or crown but opening the cavity to make it possible to clean with a toothbrush, sealing with fluoride varnish and encouraging toothbrushing). The final study compared crowns made of two different materials (stainless steel versus stainless steel with a white covering). We looked at what happened for each treatment at the time of the dental appointment or within 24 hours of treatment, in the short term (less than 12 months) and long term (12 months to 48 months). 
Key results 
Teeth restored with preformed crowns are less likely to develop problems (e.g. abscess) or cause pain in the long term, compared to fillings. Crowns fitted using the Hall Technique (no injections or tooth trimming) gave less discomfort at the time of the appointment, when compared with fillings. Crowns may increase the risk of gingival bleeding but this result was unclear. Only one small study compared crowns with non‐restorative caries treatment and one small study compared metal and white crowns, and we could draw no reliable conclusions from these. Some of our outcomes of interest were not measured in any of the studies: these included time to restoration failure or retreatment, patient satisfaction and costs. 
Quality of the evidence 
There is moderate quality evidence that crowns are more effective than fillings for managing decay in primary molar teeth. There is moderate quality evidence that crowns fitted using the Hall Technique are less likely to cause abscesses and pain than fillings. The evidence comparing preformed crowns with non‐restorative caries management, and comparing preformed metal crowns with preformed white crowns, is very low quality so we do not know which is better. 
Author's conclusion 
Crowns placed on primary molar teeth with decay, or that have had pulp treatment, are likely to reduce the risk of major failure or pain in the long term compared to fillings. Crowns fitted using the Hall Technique may reduce discomfort at the time of treatment compared to fillings.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Crowns vs. Fillings for Baby Teeth

## What was studied?
Researchers reviewed studies comparing different ways to fix cavities in baby molars (back teeth). They looked at crowns (metal or white caps that cover the whole tooth) versus regular fillings, and different types of crowns.

## Who was studied?
Children with cavities in one or more baby molar teeth.

## What treatments were compared?
- **Crowns**: Pre-made metal caps, sometimes with a white coating for appearance
- **Regular fillings**: Materials like amalgam, composite, or glass ionomer
- **Two ways to place crowns**:
  - Standard method: Tooth is trimmed and numbed first
  - Hall Technique: Crown is pushed over the tooth without numbing, drilling, or removing decay

## What did they find?

**Crowns vs. Fillings (346 teeth from 3 studies):**
- Crowns were less likely to fail after 12 months or more
- Children with crowns had less pain long-term
- The Hall Technique (no numbing or drilling) caused less discomfort during the appointment than fillings
- Gum bleeding was similar for both treatments

**Other comparisons:**
- Not enough evidence to draw conclusions about crowns versus no treatment, or metal versus white-coated crowns

## Bottom line
Crowns on baby molars with cavities likely work better than fillings over time and cause less pain. The Hall Technique may be more comfortable for children during treatment since it doesn't require numbing or drilling.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary: Crowns for baby molars

- Researchers reviewed clinical trials to see how well preformed crowns work for baby back teeth (primary molars) with tooth decay or after pulp treatment.
- They compared crowns with fillings, with non-restorative care, and with different types of crowns.

Who was included
- Children with untreated decay in one or more primary molars.
- Only randomized controlled trials were included.
- Studies had to report results at least 6 months after treatment (except for pain/discomfort right after the visit).

Treatments compared
- Preformed metal crowns (PMCs), placed:
  - The conventional way (tooth trimmed, local anesthetic; often after pulpotomy), or
  - Using the Hall Technique (crown pushed over the tooth with no drilling, no local anesthetic).
- Fillings (amalgam, composite, glass ionomer, resin-modified glass ionomer, compomer).
- Non-restorative caries treatment (managing decay without restoring the tooth).
- Metal crowns vs “aesthetic” stainless steel crowns with white veneers.

How the evidence was found
- Databases searched up to January 21, 2015, with no language limits.

Key results
- Crowns vs fillings (moderate-quality evidence):
  - Long-term (12 months or more): crowns had fewer major failures (RR 0.18) and less pain (RR 0.15) than fillings.
  - During the visit: Hall Technique crowns caused less discomfort than fillings (RR 0.56).
  - Bleeding gums: difference was unclear in short term and long term (low-quality evidence).
  - One short-term study found no major failures or pain in either group.

- Crowns vs non-restorative care:
  - Evidence from one study was very limited and uncertain.

- Metal vs aesthetic crowns:
  - Evidence from one small study was very limited and uncertain.

Outcomes and timelines measured
- At the visit/within 24 hours: pain/discomfort.
- Short term: under 12 months.
- Long term: 12 months or more.
- Not well reported: time to failure or retreatment, patient satisfaction, and costs.

Safety
- Less discomfort during placement with the Hall Technique than with fillings.
- Long-term pain was lower with crowns than with fillings.
- Gum bleeding findings were uncertain.

Limits of the evidence
- Only five trials met the criteria.
- No trials directly compared the Hall Technique with conventional crown placement.

Bottom line
- For baby molars with decay or after pulp treatment, crowns likely last longer and cause less long-term pain than fillings.
- The Hall Technique may be more comfortable during the visit than fillings.
- We need more good-quality studies to compare crown types and placement methods, and to measure satisfaction, costs, and time to failure."
126,"Background
Collaborative care for severe mental illness (SMI) is a community‐based intervention, which typically consists of a number of components. The intervention aims to improve the physical and/or mental health care of individuals with SMI. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of collaborative care approaches in comparison with standard care for people with SMI who are living in the community. The primary outcome of interest was psychiatric admissions. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Specialised register in April 2011. The register is compiled from systematic searches of major databases, handsearches of relevant journals and conference proceedings. We also contacted 51 experts in the field of SMI and collaborative care. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) described as collaborative care by the trialists comparing any form of collaborative care with 'standard care' for adults (18+ years) living in the community with a diagnosis of SMI, defined as schizophrenia or other types of schizophrenia‐like psychosis (e.g. schizophreniform and schizoaffective disorders), bipolar affective disorder or other types of psychosis. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors worked independently to extract and quality assess data. For dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and we calculated mean differences (MD) with 95% CIs for continuous data. Risk of bias was assessed. 
Main results
We included one RCT (306 participants; US veterans with bipolar disorder I or II) in this review. We did not find any trials meeting our inclusion criteria that included people with schizophrenia. The trial provided data for one comparison: collaborative care versus standard care. All results are 'low or very low quality evidence'. 
Data indicated that collaborative care reduced psychiatric admissions at year two in comparison to standard care (n = 306, 1 RCT, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.99). 
The sensitivity analysis showed that the proportion of participants psychiatrically hospitalised was lower in the intervention group than the standard care group in year three: 28% compared to 38% (n = 330, 1 RCT, RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.99). 
In comparison to the standard care group, collaborative care significantly improved the Mental Health Component (MHC) of quality of life at the three‐year follow‐up, (n = 306, 1 RCT, MD 3.50, 95% CI 1.80 to 5.20). The Physical Health Component (PHC) of the quality of life measure at the three‐year follow‐up did not differ significantly between groups (n = 306, 1 RCT, MD 0.50, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.91). 
Direct intervention (all‐treatment) costs of collaborative care at the three‐year follow‐up did not differ significantly from standard care (n = 306, 1 RCT, MD ‐$2981.00, 95% CI $16934.93 to $10972.93). The proportion of participants leaving the study early did not differ significantly between groups (n = 306, 1 RCT, RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.79). There is no trial‐based information regarding the effect of collaborative care for people with schizophrenia. 
No statistically significant differences were found between groups for number of deaths by suicide at three years (n = 330, 1 RCT, RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.32), or the number of participants that died from all other causes at three years (n = 330, 1 RCT, RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.65 to 3.66). 
Authors' conclusions
The review did not identify any studies relevant to care of people with schizophrenia and hence there is no evidence available to determine if collaborative care is effective for people suffering from schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorders. There was however one trial at high risk of bias that suggests that collaborative care for US veterans with bipolar disorder may reduce psychiatric admissions at two years and improves quality of life (mental health component) at three years, however, on its own it is not sufficient for us to make any recommendations regarding its effectiveness. More large, well designed, conducted and reported trials are required before any clinical or policy making decisions can be made.","Collaborative care approaches for people with severe mental illness
Collaborative care aims to improve the physical and mental health of people with severe mental illness (SMI). Common to all definitions is that collaborative care aims to develop closer working relationships between primary care (family doctors or GPs and practice nurses) and specialist health care (such as Community Mental Health Teams). There are different ways in which this can be achieved, making collaborative care very complex. Integrating or joining‐up primary care and mental health services, so that they work better together, is intended to increase communication and joint working between health professionals (e.g. GPs, psychiatrists, nurses, pharmacists, psychologists). This is meant to provide a person with severe mental illness with better care, based in the community, which is often a less stigmatised setting than hospital, and that promotion of good practice helps consumers maintain contact with services. A major issue is that many GPs still feel that physical health problems (such as diabetes, heart disease, smoking cessation) are more their concern and see treatment of severe mental illness as the job of psychiatrists and other mental health professionals. Collaborative care aims to improve overall quality of care by ensuring that healthcare professionals work together, trying to meet the physical and mental health needs of people. The aim of the review was to assess the effectiveness of collaborative care in comparison to standard or usual care. An electronic search for trials was carried out in April 2011. The primary focus of interest was admissions to hospital. According to the one included study in this review, collaborative care may be effective in reducing going into hospital (less psychiatric admissions and other admissions). It also helps improve people’s quality of life and mental health. However, all evidence was either low or very low quality and further research is needed to determine whether collaborative care is good for people with SMI in terms of clinical outcomes or helping people feel better as well as its cost effectiveness.

## What was this review about?

Researchers wanted to know if ""collaborative care"" works better than regular care for adults with serious mental illness living in the community. Collaborative care means a team of healthcare providers works together to help manage someone's health.

They were particularly interested in whether this approach could reduce the number of times people needed to be admitted to the hospital for mental health reasons.

## Who was studied?

The review looked for studies of adults (18 years and older) with serious mental illnesses like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or similar conditions. These people were living in the community, not in hospitals.

## What did they find?

The researchers found only **one study** that met their requirements. This study included 306 U.S. military veterans with bipolar disorder. They did not find any studies about people with schizophrenia.

## What were the results?

Compared to regular care, collaborative care showed:

- **Fewer hospital admissions** for mental health reasons after 2 years
- **Better mental health quality of life** after 3 years
- **No difference** in physical health quality of life
- **Similar costs** between both types of care
- **Similar rates** of people leaving the study early or dying

The quality of this evidence was rated as low or very low.

## What does this mean?

There isn't enough evidence to know if collaborative care helps people with schizophrenia. For people with bipolar disorder, one small study suggests it might help, but more research is needed before doctors can recommend it confidently.",0,Plano,"Plain Language Summary

127,"Background
A frozen embryo transfer (FET) cycle is when one or more embryos (frozen during a previous treatment cycle) are thawed and transferred to the uterus. Some women undergo fresh embryo transfer (ET) cycles with embryos derived from donated oocytes. In both situations, the endometrium is primed with oestrogen and progestogen in different doses and routes of administration. 
Objectives
To evaluate the most effective endometrial preparation for women undergoing transfer with frozen embryos or embryos from donor oocytes with regard to the subsequent live birth rate (LBR). 
Search methods
The Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, LILACS, trials registers and abstracts of reproductive societies' meetings were searched in June 2020 together with reference checking and contact with study authors and experts in the field to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating endometrial preparation in women undergoing fresh donor cycles and frozen embryo transfers. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. We analysed all available interventions versus placebo, no treatment, or between each other. The primary review outcome was live birth rate. Secondary outcomes were clinical and multiple pregnancy, miscarriage, cycle cancellation, endometrial thickness and adverse effects. 
Main results
Thirty‐one RCTs (5426 women) were included. Evidence was moderate to very low‐quality: the main limitations were serious risk of bias due to poor reporting of methods, and serious imprecision. 
Stimulated versus programmed cycle 
We are uncertain whether a letrozole‐stimulated cycle compared to a programmed cycle, for endometrial preparation, improves LBR (odds ratio (OR) 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 3.26; 100 participants; one study; very low‐quality evidence). 
Stimulating with follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), letrozole or clomiphene citrate may improve clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.38; 656 participants; five studies; I2 = 11%; low‐quality evidence). We are uncertain if they reduce miscarriage rate (MR) (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.71; 355 participants; three studies; I2 = 0%; very low‐quality evidence). Endometrial thickness (ET) may be reduced with clomiphene citrate (mean difference(MD) ‐1.04, 95% CI ‐1.59 to ‐0.49; 92 participants; one study; low‐quality evidence). Other outcomes were not reported. 
Natural versus programmed cycle 
We are uncertain of the effect from a natural versus programmed cycle for LBR (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.28; 1285 participants; four studies; I2 = 0%; very low‐quality evidence) and CPR (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.01; 1249 participants; five studies; I2 = 60%; very low‐quality evidence), while a natural cycle probably reduces the cycle cancellation rate (CCR) (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.82; 734 participants; one study; moderate‐quality evidence). We are uncertain of the effect on MR and ET. No study reported other outcomes. 
Transdermal versus oral oestrogens 
From low‐quality evidence we are uncertain of the effect transdermal compared to oral oestrogens has on CPR (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.25; 504 participants; three studies; I2 = 58%) or MR (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.09; 414 participants; two studies; I2 = 0%). Other outcomes were not reported. 
Day of starting administration of progestogen 
When doing a fresh ET using donated oocytes in a synchronised cycle starting progestogen on the day of oocyte pick‐up (OPU) or the day after OPU, in comparison with recipients that start progestogen the day prior to OPU, probably increases the CPR (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.13 to 3.08; 282 participants; one study, moderate‐quality evidence). We are uncertain of the effect on multiple pregnancy rate (MPR) or MR. It probably reduces the CCR (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.74; 282 participants; one study; moderate‐quality evidence). No study reported other outcomes. 
Gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist versus control 
A cycle with GnRH agonist compared to without may improve LBR (OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.19 to 5.78; 234 participants; one study; low‐quality evidence). From low‐quality evidence we are uncertain of the effect on CPR (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.43; 1289 participants; eight studies; I2 = 20%), MR (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.00; 828 participants; four studies; I2 = 0%), CCR (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.17; 530 participants; two studies; I2 = 0%) and ET (MD ‐0.08, 95% CI ‐0.33 to 0.16; 697 participants; four studies; I2 = 4%). No study reported other outcomes. 
Among different GnRH agonists 
From very low‐quality evidence we are uncertain if cycles among different GnRH agonists improves CPR or MR. No study reported other outcomes. 
GnRH agonists versus GnRH antagonists 
GnRH antagonists compared to agonists probably improves CPR (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.90; 473 participants; one study; moderate‐quality evidence). We are uncertain of the effect on MR and MPR. No study reported other outcomes. 
Aspirin versus control 
From very low‐quality evidence we are uncertain whether a cycle with aspirin versus without improves LBR, CPR, or ET. 
Steroids versus control 
From very low‐quality evidence we are uncertain whether a cycle with steroids compared to without improves LBR, CPR or MR. No study reported other outcomes. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence on the use of any particular intervention for endometrial preparation in women undergoing fresh donor cycles and frozen embryo transfers. In frozen embryo transfers, low‐quality evidence showed that clinical pregnancy rates may be improved in a stimulated cycle compared to a programmed one, and we are uncertain of the effect when comparing a programmed cycle to a natural cycle. Cycle cancellation rates are probably reduced in a natural cycle. Although administering a GnRH agonist, compared to without, may improve live birth rates, clinical pregnancy rates will probably be improved in a GnRH antagonist cycle over an agonist cycle. 
In fresh synchronised oocyte donor cycles, the clinical pregnancy rate is probably improved and cycle cancellation rates are probably reduced when starting progestogen the day of or day after donor oocyte retrieval. 
Adequately powered studies are needed to evaluate each treatment more accurately.","Endometrial preparation for egg donor recipients or for frozen embryo transfers
Review question 
What is the most effective method for endometrial preparation in women undergoing embryo transfers with frozen embryos or embryos derived from donor oocytes? 
Background 
Couples undergo infertility treatments due to male factor, female factors or unexplained infertility. After an unsuccessful fresh embryo transfer cycle, a frozen‐thawed embryo transfer can be performed when frozen embryos are available. Adequate hormonal preparation of the endometrium is of utmost importance for both egg donor and frozen embryo replacement cycles to provide the optimal chances of pregnancy. Many drugs and various modes of administration have been tried by several investigators in order to optimise implantation rates and consequently improve the success rates of the embryo transfer procedures: stimulated cycles (to generate endogenous oestradiol), programmed cycles (administering exogenous oestradiol) or natural cycles (allowing the ovaries to produce oestradiol without stimulation) are some of the options; avoiding spontaneous ovulation with gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists and antagonists could have some impact; or using some other drugs such as aspirin or steroids that could potentially enhance the endometrial receptivity were also evaluated. 
Study characteristics 
We found 31 randomised controlled trials comparing different interventions such as the dose and route of administration of oestrogens and progestogen, the use of drugs that stop the patient from ovulating prematurely (GnRH agonists), and the use of other medications to improve the endometrium in a total of 5426 women. The evidence is current to June 2020. 
Key results 
We are uncertain whether a stimulated cycle (with letrozole) compared to a programmed cycle, for endometrial preparation, improves live birth. The evidence suggests that if the chance of live birth following a programmed cycle is assumed to be 24%, the chance following a stimulated cycle would be between 13% and 51%. We are also uncertain of the impact on miscarriage rate and endometrial thickness. A stimulated cycle may improve clinical pregnancy rate. Data were lacking on multiple pregnancy, cycle cancellation and other adverse effects. 
We are uncertain whether a natural cycle improves the live birth rate, pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate and endometrial thickness in comparison with a programmed cycle. Data were lacking for all other outcomes. 
We are uncertain if transdermal (delivered via the skin) oestrogens compared with oral (by mouth) oestrogens improve clinical pregnancy rate and miscarriage rate. Data were lacking for all other outcomes in this comparison. 
Starting progestogen on the day of the donor oocyte retrieval or the day after probably increases the clinical pregnancy rate and probably reduces the cycle cancellation rate. We are uncertain if it reduces the miscarriage rate. Data were lacking for all other outcomes. 
A cycle with GnRH agonist compared to without may improve live birth rate. We are uncertain of the effect of a GnRH cycle compared to no GnRH for the outcomes of clinical pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate, and endometrial thickness. No study reported on the other outcomes for this comparison. 
We are uncertain if any GnRH agonist is better than other: a cycle with daily leuprolide or with deposit tryptorelin improves clinical pregnancy rate, or if daily acetate leuprolide or daily nafarelin reduces the miscarriage rate. Other outcomes were not reported. 
GnRH antagonists compared to agonists probably improve clinical pregnancy rate. We are uncertain of the effect on miscarriage rate and multiple pregnancy rate. No study reported the other outcomes. 
We are uncertain whether a cycle with aspirin compared to a cycle without improves live birth, clinical pregnancy rate or endometrial thickness. Data were lacking for all other outcomes. 
We are also uncertain whether a cycle with steroids compared to a cycle without steroids improves live birth rate, clinical pregnancy rate or miscarriage rate. No study reported on the other outcomes. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was of moderate to very low‐quality. The main limitations in the evidence were poor reporting of study methods, and lack of precision in the findings for live birth.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Preparing the Uterus for Frozen or Donor Embryo Transfer

## What was this study about?

Researchers reviewed different methods for preparing a woman's uterus before transferring frozen embryos or embryos created from donated eggs. The goal was to find which preparation method works best for achieving a successful pregnancy and birth.

## What happens during embryo transfer?

Some women have embryos frozen from a previous fertility treatment, which are later thawed and placed in the uterus. Other women receive embryos created from eggs donated by another person. Before transfer, the uterus lining needs to be prepared using hormones like estrogen and progesterone. Doctors use different doses and methods to give these hormones.

## What did the researchers do?

They reviewed 31 studies involving 5,426 women. The studies compared different preparation methods, including:
- Using medications to stimulate the body's natural cycle versus using hormones on a set schedule
- Following a woman's natural cycle versus using hormones on a schedule
- Different ways of giving estrogen (skin patch versus pill)
- Different timing for starting progesterone
- Adding other medications like GnRH agonists or antagonists

## What did they find?

The evidence quality was mostly low, making it hard to draw firm conclusions. Some findings include:

- Using medications to stimulate ovulation may improve pregnancy rates compared to scheduled hormone treatment
- Natural cycles may reduce the number of cancelled treatment cycles
- For women receiving donated eggs, starting progesterone on the day of egg retrieval (or the day after) may improve pregnancy rates compared to starting it earlier

## What does this mean?

More high-quality studies are needed to determine the best way to prepare the uterus for embryo transfer. Current evidence is limited and uncertain for most preparation methods.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary: Preparing the uterus for frozen or donor embryo transfer

What was studied
- Goal: To find which way of preparing the uterine lining (endometrium) works best for women having a frozen embryo transfer (FET) or a transfer using embryos from donor eggs.
- How: Review of 31 randomized controlled trials with 5,426 women.
- When: Medical databases were searched up to June 2020.

Who was included
- Women having FET cycles.
- Women having fresh transfers using embryos from donor eggs.

What treatments were compared
- Natural cycle (using the woman’s own hormones) vs programmed cycle (hormones given by medicine).
- Stimulated cycles using medicines like FSH, letrozole, or clomiphene vs programmed cycles.
- Estrogen given on the skin (patch/gel) vs by mouth.
- When to start progesterone in donor cycles (day before, day of, or day after egg retrieval).
- Adding GnRH agonists vs not adding them; and agonists vs antagonists.
- Adding aspirin vs not; adding steroids vs not.

Main outcomes
- Live birth rate (main outcome).
- Clinical pregnancy rate.
- Miscarriage.
- Multiple pregnancy.
- Cycle cancellation.
- Endometrial thickness.
- Side effects and adverse events.

Key findings
Frozen embryo transfers (FET)
- Stimulated vs programmed: Clinical pregnancy may be higher with stimulation medicines, but effect on live birth is unclear.
- Natural vs programmed: Live birth and clinical pregnancy look similar. Natural cycles probably have fewer canceled cycles.
- Estrogen patch/gel vs pills: No clear difference in pregnancy or miscarriage.
- Adding a GnRH agonist: May improve live birth in one small study, but overall results for pregnancy are unclear.
- GnRH antagonist vs agonist: Antagonist probably leads to higher clinical pregnancy than agonist.
- Aspirin or steroids: No clear benefit.

Fresh donor egg cycles (synchronized)
- Starting progesterone on the day of, or the day after, the donor’s egg retrieval probably improves clinical pregnancy and probably reduces canceled cycles compared with starting the day before.

Safety
- Few studies reported side effects. Evidence about risks like miscarriage or multiple pregnancy was often unclear. No strong safety concerns were established, but data were limited.

Quality of the evidence
- Most evidence was low to very low quality due to small studies and limited reporting. Results may change with better studies.

What this means
- There is no single best method proven for preparing the uterine lining before FET or donor embryo transfer.
- Natural cycles may reduce cancellations. In donor cycles, timing progesterone to the day of or after egg retrieval probably helps.
- Talk with your clinic about options, monitoring, convenience, and your medical history.
- More, larger trials are needed to identify the safest and most effective approach."
128,"Background
Vitamin D deficiency is common worldwide, contributing to nutritional rickets and osteomalacia which have a major impact on health, growth, and development of infants, children and adolescents. Vitamin D levels are low in breast milk and exclusively breastfed infants are at risk of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency. 
Objectives
To determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation given to infants, or lactating mothers, on vitamin D deficiency, bone density and growth in healthy term breastfed infants. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to 29 May 2020 supplemented by searches of clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and citations. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs in breastfeeding mother‐infant pairs comparing vitamin D supplementation given to infants or lactating mothers compared to placebo or no intervention, or sunlight, or that compare vitamin D supplementation of infants to supplementation of mothers. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias and independently extracted data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
We included 19 studies with 2837 mother‐infant pairs assessing vitamin D given to infants (nine studies), to lactating mothers (eight studies), and to infants versus lactating mothers (six studies). No studies compared vitamin D given to infants versus periods of infant sun exposure. 
Vitamin D supplementation given to infants: vitamin D at 400 IU/day may increase 25‐OH vitamin D levels (MD 22.63 nmol/L, 95% CI 17.05 to 28.21; participants = 334; studies = 6; low‐certainty) and may reduce the incidence of vitamin D insufficiency (25‐OH vitamin D < 50 nmol/L) (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.80; participants = 274; studies = 4; low‐certainty). However, there was insufficient evidence to determine if vitamin D given to the infant reduces the risk of vitamin D deficiency (25‐OH vitamin D < 30 nmol/L) up till six months of age (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.05; participants = 122; studies = 2), affects bone mineral content (BMC), or the incidence of biochemical or radiological rickets (all very‐low certainty). We are uncertain about adverse effects including hypercalcaemia. There were no studies of higher doses of infant vitamin D (> 400 IU/day) compared to placebo. 
Vitamin D supplementation given to lactating mothers: vitamin D supplementation given to lactating mothers may increase infant 25‐OH vitamin D levels (MD 24.60 nmol/L, 95% CI 21.59 to 27.60; participants = 597; studies = 7; low‐certainty), may reduce the incidences of vitamin D insufficiency (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.57; participants = 512; studies = 5; low‐certainty), vitamin D deficiency (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.24; participants = 512; studies = 5; low‐certainty) and biochemical rickets (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.44; participants = 229; studies = 2; low‐certainty). The two studies that reported biochemical rickets used maternal dosages of oral D3 60,000 IU/day for 10 days and oral D3 60,000 IU postpartum and at 6, 10, and 14 weeks. However, infant BMC was not reported and there was insufficient evidence to determine if maternal supplementation has an effect on radiological rickets (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.31; participants = 536; studies = 3; very low‐certainty). All studies of maternal supplementation enrolled populations at high risk of vitamin D deficiency. We are uncertain of the effects of maternal supplementation on infant growth and adverse effects including hypercalcaemia. 
Vitamin D supplementation given to infants compared with supplementation given to lactating mothers: infant vitamin D supplementation compared to lactating mother supplementation may increase infant 25‐OH vitamin D levels (MD 14.35 nmol/L, 95% CI 9.64 to 19.06; participants = 269; studies = 4; low‐certainty). Infant vitamin D supplementation may reduce the incidence of vitamin D insufficiency (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.94; participants = 334; studies = 4) and may reduce vitamin D deficiency (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.72; participants = 334; studies = 4) but the evidence is very uncertain. Infant BMC and radiological rickets were not reported and there was insufficient evidence to determine if maternal supplementation has an effect on infant biochemical rickets. All studies enrolled patient populations at high risk of vitamin D deficiency. Studies compared an infant dose of vitamin D 400 IU/day with varying maternal vitamin D doses from 400 IU/day to > 4000 IU/day. We are uncertain about adverse effects including hypercalcaemia. 
Authors' conclusions
For breastfed infants, vitamin D supplementation 400 IU/day for up to six months increases 25‐OH vitamin D levels and reduces vitamin D insufficiency, but there was insufficient evidence to assess its effect on vitamin D deficiency and bone health. For higher‐risk infants who are breastfeeding, maternal vitamin D supplementation reduces vitamin D insufficiency and vitamin D deficiency, but there was insufficient evidence to determine an effect on bone health. In populations at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D supplementation of infants led to greater increases in infant 25‐OH vitamin D levels, reductions in vitamin D insufficiency and vitamin D deficiency compared to supplementation of lactating mothers. However, the evidence is very uncertain for markers of bone health. Maternal higher dose supplementation (≥ 4000 IU/day) produced similar infant 25‐OH vitamin D levels as infant supplementation of 400 IU/day. The certainty of evidence was graded as low to very low for all outcomes.","Vitamin D supplementation for term breastfed infants to prevent vitamin D deficiency and improve bone health 
Review question: do vitamin D supplements for breastfed infants or their mothers prevent vitamin D deficiency and improve bone health? 
Background: vitamin D deficiency is common worldwide with infants at higher risk due to pigmentation, covering, avoidance of sun exposure or the latitude of where they live. Vitamin D is important for bone health, helping prevent nutritional rickets and fractures. Vitamin D levels are low in breast milk and exclusively breastfed infants are at risk of low vitamin D levels. 
Study characteristics: evidence is up‐to‐date as of May 2020. We identified 19 studies with 2837 mother‐infant pairs assessing vitamin D given to infants (nine studies), to breastfeeding mothers (eight studies), and to infants versus breastfeeding mothers (six studies). No studies compared vitamin D given to infants versus periods of infant sun exposure. 
Key results: for breastfed infants, vitamin D supplements may increase vitamin D levels and reduce the incidence of mildly low vitamin D levels, but there was insufficient information to determine if there was a reduction in vitamin D deficiency or in signs of poor bone health (low bone mineral content, nutritional rickets or fractures). For breastfed infants at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D supplementation for the mother may increase infant vitamin D levels and may prevent vitamin D deficiency. There was not enough information to determine if there are benefits for bone health. In populations at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D supplementation of infants may be better than vitamin D supplementation of the mother whilst breastfeeding for preventing vitamin D deficiency. However, the evidence is very uncertain for markers of bone health. High‐dose maternal supplementation (≥ 4000 IU per day) achieved similar infant vitamin D levels as infant supplementation with 400 IU per day. 
Certainty of evidence: the evidence is currently very uncertain for supplementation of vitamin D for breastfeeding mothers or supplementation of their infants in populations at low risk of vitamin D deficiency. In populations at high risk of vitamin D deficiency, there is low‐certainty evidence that vitamin D 400 IU per day given to the infant or higher doses given to the breastfeeding mother may prevent vitamin D deficiency, although effects on bone health are unclear.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Vitamin D for Breastfed Babies

## What is this study about?

Researchers wanted to find out the best way to make sure breastfed babies get enough vitamin D. Vitamin D is important for healthy bones and growth. Breast milk doesn't contain much vitamin D, so babies who only drink breast milk might not get enough.

## What did researchers look at?

They reviewed 19 studies that included about 2,800 mothers and babies. The studies tested different approaches:
- Giving vitamin D directly to babies
- Giving vitamin D to breastfeeding mothers
- Comparing both approaches

## What did they find?

**When babies received vitamin D (400 IU per day):**
- Vitamin D levels in the baby's blood increased
- Fewer babies had low vitamin D levels
- Researchers couldn't tell if it helped prevent very low vitamin D levels or improved bone health

**When breastfeeding mothers received vitamin D:**
- Vitamin D levels in the baby's blood increased
- Fewer babies had low or very low vitamin D levels
- This approach seemed to help in families at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency
- Researchers couldn't tell if it improved bone health

**Comparing both approaches:**
- Giving vitamin D directly to babies raised their vitamin D levels more than giving it to mothers
- Both methods appeared to reduce low vitamin D levels
- When mothers took high doses (4,000 IU or more per day), babies' vitamin D levels were similar to giving babies 400 IU directly

## What does this mean?

Both approaches can help increase vitamin D levels in breastfed babies, but more research is needed to understand how they affect bone health and overall development.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What is this about?
- Many breastfed infants do not get enough vitamin D from breast milk alone.
- This review looked at whether giving vitamin D to infants or to breastfeeding mothers helps infants’ vitamin D levels, bone health, and growth.

Who was in the studies?
- 19 studies with 2,837 healthy, full‑term, breastfed mother–infant pairs.
- Most studies were in places where vitamin D deficiency is common.

What did they test?
- Infant drops: usually 400 IU of vitamin D per day, for up to 6 months.
- Mother supplements: doses varied (some high doses). Some used ≥4,000 IU/day.
- No studies tested sunlight exposure as a comparison.

Main findings
- Giving infants 400 IU/day:
  - Likely raises infants’ vitamin D levels.
  - Likely lowers the number of infants with low vitamin D.
  - Not enough evidence to show effects on true deficiency, bone strength, or growth.
- Giving vitamin D to mothers:
  - Likely raises infants’ vitamin D levels.
  - Likely lowers low vitamin D and deficiency in infants, especially in high‑risk areas.
  - May lower blood test signs of rickets; effect on X‑ray signs and bone strength is unclear.
- Infant drops vs mother supplements:
  - Infant drops may raise infant vitamin D levels more and may reduce low levels more than mother supplements, but evidence is uncertain.
  - When mothers took higher doses (at least 4,000 IU/day), infants’ vitamin D levels were similar to infants who got 400 IU/day.

Safety
- Harms were not well reported. It is unclear if there is a risk of high calcium in the blood or other side effects for infants or mothers.

Timing
- Most results are for the first 6 months after birth.

How strong is the evidence?
- Overall certainty was low to very low. This means results could change with better studies.

Bottom line
- Infant vitamin D drops (400 IU/day) likely improve infants’ vitamin D levels and reduce low levels.
- Mother supplementation can also help infants’ levels, especially in high‑risk settings; very high maternal doses may match infant drops.
- Effects on bone health and growth are still unclear, and safety data are limited."
129,"Background
Beta‐blockers are an essential part of standard therapy in adult congestive heart failure and therefore, are expected to be beneficial in children. However, congestive heart failure in children differs from that in adults in terms of characteristics, aetiology, and drug clearance. Therefore, paediatric needs must be specifically investigated. This is an update of a Cochrane review previously published in 2009. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of beta‐adrenoceptor‐blockers (beta‐blockers) in children with congestive heart failure. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS up to November 2015. Bibliographies of identified studies were checked. No language restrictions were applied. 
Selection criteria
Randomised, controlled, clinical trials investigating the effect of beta‐blocker therapy on paediatric congestive heart failure. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted and assessed data from the included trials.
Main results
We identified four new studies for the review update; the review now includes seven studies with 420 participants. Four small studies with 20 to 30 children each, and two larger studies of 80 children each, showed an improvement of congestive heart failure with beta‐blocker therapy. A larger study with 161 participants showed no evidence of benefit over placebo in a composite measure of heart failure outcomes. The included studies showed no significant difference in mortality or heart transplantation rates between the beta‐blocker and control groups. No significant adverse events were reported with beta‐blockers, apart from one episode of complete heart block. A meta‐analysis of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and fractional shortening (LVFS) data showed a very small improvement with beta‐blockers. 
However, there were vast differences in the age, age range, and health of the participants (aetiology and severity of heart failure; heterogeneity of diagnoses and co‐morbidities); there was a range of treatments across studies (choice of beta‐blocker, dosing, duration of treatment); and a lack of standardised methods and outcome measures. Therefore, the primary outcomes could not be pooled in meta‐analyses. 
Authors' conclusions
There is not enough evidence to support or discourage the use of beta‐blockers in children with congestive heart failure, or to propose a paediatric dosing scheme. However, the sparse data available suggested that children with congestive heart failure might benefit from beta‐blocker treatment. Further investigations in clearly defined populations with standardised methodology are required to establish guidelines for therapy. Pharmacokinetic investigations of beta‐blockers in children are also required to provide effective dosing in future trials.","Beta‐blockers for children with congestive heart failure
Background 
The term congestive heart failure describes a disorder in which the heart is unable to sufficiently and efficiently pump blood through the body. Depending on the severity of the condition, this causes breathlessness and fatigue due to insufficient oxygen supply, and an accumulation of fluids in tissues and organs. 
In children, congestive heart failure is mainly due to congenital heart defects. Drug treatment, depending on the specific condition, may be used for long‐term control of heart failure, or to bridge the time until corrective surgery. For dilated or restrictive cardiomyopathy, a disorder with high mortality, heart transplantation remains the only option when drug treatment fails. 
Beta‐blockers have proven beneficial and even life‐saving in adults with congestive heart failure and therefore, are part of the standard treatment. For children, similar benefits could be expected, but beta‐blockers are used, if at all, off‐label (i.e. they are not recommended for children). Since the causes for heart failure are different in children than they are in adults, the main effect and adverse events may differ. Dosing might also have to be specifically adapted for different age groups. 
Study characteristics 
This review summarises and discusses the available information on the use of beta‐blockers in children with congestive heart failure. Seven studies, with a total of 420 children were included in the review. 
Key results 
Beta‐blocker therapy improved heart failure in four small studies with less than 30 participants each, and two larger studies with 80 participants each. However, the largest trial, with 161 participants, did not show a significant effect of the investigated beta‐blocker over placebo. 
None of the studies reported any severe beta‐blocker‐related adverse events, apart from one child who had a heart rhythm disturbance.  
Conclusions 
There were not enough data to recommend or discourage the use of beta‐blockers in children with congestive heart failure. However, the current available data suggest that children with heart failure might benefit from beta‐blocker treatment. Further investigations are required to establish guidelines for therapy.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Beta-Blocker Medications for Children with Heart Failure

## What was studied?
Researchers reviewed studies about using beta-blocker medications (drugs that help the heart work more efficiently) in children with heart failure. Heart failure means the heart doesn't pump blood as well as it should. While these medications help adults with heart failure, researchers wanted to know if they also help children.

## Why is this important?
Children's hearts and bodies work differently than adults'. Their bodies also process medications differently. What works for adults may not work the same way for children, so researchers needed to study children specifically.

## What did researchers find?
The review team looked at 7 studies involving 420 children total. Here's what they found:

- **Heart function measurements**: Some children showed small improvements in how well their heart pumped blood
- **Safety**: The medications appeared safe, with only one serious side effect reported (a heart rhythm problem)
- **Survival**: There was no clear difference in death rates or need for heart transplants between children taking beta-blockers and those who didn't

## What were the challenges?
The studies were very different from each other:
- Children's ages varied widely
- They had different types and severity of heart problems
- Different beta-blocker medications were used
- Treatment lengths varied
- Studies measured results in different ways

These differences made it hard to combine the results.

## What does this mean?
There isn't enough evidence yet to say whether beta-blockers definitely help or don't help children with heart failure. More research is needed with:
- Similar groups of children
- Standardized ways of measuring results
- Better understanding of proper doses for children",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What was studied
- Researchers looked at whether beta‑blockers (a type of heart medicine) help children with heart failure.

Who was included
- Children with heart failure from 7 randomized controlled trials.
- Total participants: 420 children.
- Children varied in age, causes of heart failure, and how sick they were.

What the researchers did
- Searched medical databases through November 2015.
- Compared beta‑blockers to placebo or usual care.
- Two reviewers independently checked and extracted the data.

What outcomes were measured
- Heart failure status (combined measures used by each study)
- Heart pumping strength (left ventricular ejection fraction and fractional shortening)
- Death or need for heart transplant
- Side effects

Main findings
- Four small studies (20–30 children each) and two medium studies (~80 children each) reported improvement with beta‑blockers.
- One larger study (161 children) found no benefit over placebo for its combined heart failure outcome.
- Across all studies, there was no clear difference in death or heart transplant rates between groups.
- Heart pumping strength showed a very small improvement with beta‑blockers.
- Results could not be combined for the main outcomes because the studies were very different (ages, diagnoses, drug type, doses, treatment length, and outcome measures).

Safety
- No major safety problems were commonly reported.
- One child had a serious side effect (complete heart block).

Timeline
- Evidence includes studies available up to November 2015.
- This summary updates a 2009 Cochrane review.

Bottom line
- There is not enough evidence to clearly support or discourage beta‑blocker use in children with heart failure.
- Some studies suggest possible benefit, but better, standardized trials are needed.
- More research is also needed to understand how children process these medicines and to guide dosing."
130,"Background
Bell's palsy or idiopathic facial palsy is an acute facial paralysis due to inflammation of the facial nerve. A number of studies published in China have suggested acupuncture is beneficial for facial palsy. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to examine the efficacy of acupuncture in hastening recovery and reducing long‐term morbidity from Bell's palsy. 
Search methods
We updated the searches of the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Specialized Register (24 May 2010), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 2, 2010), MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2010), EMBASE (January 1980 to May 2010), AMED (January 1985 to May 2010), LILACS (from January 1982 to May 2010) and the Chinese Biomedical Retrieval System (January 1978 to May 2010) for randomised controlled trials using 'Bell's palsy' and its synonyms, 'idiopathic facial paralysis' or 'facial palsy' as well as search terms including 'acupuncture'. Chinese journals in which we thought we might find randomised controlled trials relevant to our study were handsearched. We reviewed the bibliographies of the randomised trials and contacted the authors and known experts in the field to identify additional published or unpublished data. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials involving acupuncture by needle insertion in the treatment of Bell's palsy irrespective of any language restrictions. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors identified potential articles from the literature search, extracted data and assessed quality of each trial independently. All disagreements were resolved by discussion between the review authors. 
Main results
The literature search and handsearching identified 49 potentially relevant articles. Of these, six RCTs were included involving 537 participants with Bell's palsy. Two more possible trials were identified in the update than the previous version of this systematic review, but both were excluded because they were not real RCTs. Of the six included trials, five used acupuncture while the other one used acupuncture combined with drugs. No trial reported on the outcomes specified for this review. Harmful side effects were not reported in any of the trials. Poor quality caused by flaws in study design or reporting (including uncertain method of randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding) and clinical differences between trials prevented reliable conclusions about the efficacy of acupuncture. 
Authors' conclusions
The quality of the included trials was inadequate to allow any conclusion about the efficacy of acupuncture. More research with high quality trials is needed.","Acupuncture for Bell's palsy
Bell's palsy or idiopathic facial palsy is the most common disorder affecting the facial nerves and results in weakness or paralysis on one side of the face. The paralysis causes distortion of the face and interferes with normal functions, such as closing the eye and eating. It is thought to be caused by inflammation of the facial nerve. 
According to Traditional Chinese Medicine, facial paralysis is known as 'deviated mouth'. It was attributed to 'wind' by past dynasties. 'Qi' refers to the vital substances comprising the human body and the physiological functions of viscera and bowels, channels and collaterals. It maintains life activities and reflects the resistance of the human body. Deficiency of 'qi' allows the invasion of exogenous pathogenic wind. Acupuncture is part of Traditional Chinese Medicine and dates back thousands of years. It involves inserting fine needles into specific points on the skin or applying various other techniques to the acupuncture points to bring about healing. In Bell's palsy, acupuncture treatment might have numerous beneficial effects. This review aimed to review systematically all randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials, which examined the effectiveness of acupuncture by needle insertion for Bell's palsy. Six studies including a total of 537 participants met the inclusion criteria. Five studies used acupuncture while the other used acupuncture combined with drugs. No trials reported on the outcomes specified for this review. Harmful side effects were not reported in any of the trials.

## What is this review about?

Bell's palsy is a condition where one side of the face suddenly becomes weak or paralyzed due to swelling of a nerve in the face. Some studies from China have suggested that acupuncture (inserting thin needles into specific points on the body) might help people recover from Bell's palsy.

## What did researchers want to find out?

Researchers wanted to know if acupuncture helps people with Bell's palsy:
- Recover faster
- Have fewer long-term problems

## What did they do?

Researchers searched medical databases from 1966 to May 2010 for studies that tested acupuncture in people with Bell's palsy. They looked for studies in multiple languages and hand-searched Chinese medical journals. They only included studies where people were randomly assigned to receive acupuncture or another treatment.

## What did they find?

- They found 6 studies with 537 people who had Bell's palsy
- 5 studies tested acupuncture alone
- 1 study tested acupuncture combined with medication
- None of the studies reported harmful side effects

## What does this mean?

The researchers could not draw any conclusions about whether acupuncture helps people with Bell's palsy. The studies had too many problems with how they were designed and conducted. Better quality studies are needed to find out if acupuncture is helpful for Bell's palsy.",0,Plano,"Plain language summary: Acupuncture for Bell’s palsy

131,"Background
Foot wounds in people with diabetes mellitus (DM) are a common and serious global health issue. People with DM are prone to developing foot ulcers and, if these do not heal, they may also undergo foot amputation surgery resulting in postoperative wounds. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is a technology that is currently used widely in wound care. NPWT involves the application of a wound dressing attached to a vacuum suction machine. A carefully controlled negative pressure (or vacuum) sucks wound and tissue fluid away from the treated area into a canister. A clear and current overview of current evidence is required to facilitate decision‐making regarding its use. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of negative pressure wound therapy compared with standard care or other therapies in the treatment of foot wounds in people with DM in any care setting. 
Search methods
In January 2018, for this first update of this review, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies, reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. We identified six additional studies for inclusion in the review. 
Selection criteria
Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effects of any brand of NPWT in the treatment of foot wounds in people with DM, irrespective of date or language of publication. Particular effort was made to identify unpublished studies. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Initial disagreements were resolved by discussion, or by including a third review author when necessary. We presented and analysed data separately for foot ulcers and postoperative wounds. 
Main results
Eleven RCTs (972 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Study sample sizes ranged from 15 to 341 participants. One study had three arms, which were all included in the review. The remaining 10 studies had two arms. Two studies focused on postamputation wounds and all other studies included foot ulcers in people with DM. Ten studies compared NPWT with dressings; and one study compared NPWT delivered at 75 mmHg with NPWT delivered at 125 mmHg. Our primary outcome measures were the number of wounds healed and time to wound healing. 
NPWT compared with dressings for postoperative wounds 
Two studies (292 participants) compared NPWT with moist wound dressings in postoperative wounds (postamputation wounds). Only one study specified a follow‐up time, which was 16 weeks. This study (162 participants) reported an increased number of healed wounds in the NPWT group compared with the dressings group (risk ratio (RR) 1.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 2.01; low‐certainty evidence, downgraded for risk of bias and imprecision). This study also reported that median time to healing was 21 days shorter with NPWT compared with moist dressings (hazard ratio (HR) calculated by review authors 1.91, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.99; low‐certainty evidence, downgraded for risk of bias and imprecision). Data from the two studies suggest that it is uncertain whether there is a difference between groups in amputation risk (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.02; 292 participants; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision). 
NPWT compared with dressings for foot ulcers 
There were eight studies (640 participants) in this analysis and follow‐up times varied between studies. Six studies (513 participants) reported the proportion of wounds healed and data could be pooled for five studies. Pooled data (486 participants) suggest that NPWT may increase the number of healed wounds compared with dressings (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.72; I² = 0%; low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). Three studies assessed time to healing, but only one study reported usable data. This study reported that NPWT reduced the time to healing compared with dressings (hazard ratio (HR) calculated by review authors 1.82, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.60; 341 participants; low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). 
Data from three studies (441 participants) suggest that people allocated to NPWT may be at reduced risk of amputation compared with people allocated to dressings (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.70; I² = 0%; low‐certainty evidence; downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). 
Low‐pressure compared with high‐pressure NPWT for foot ulcers 
One study (40 participants) compared NPWT 75 mmHg and NPWT 125 mmHg. Follow‐up time was four weeks. There were no data on primary outcomes. There was no clear difference in the number of wounds closed or covered with surgery between groups (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.47; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for serious imprecision) and adverse events (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.28 to 8.04; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for serious imprecision). 
Authors' conclusions
There is low‐certainty evidence to suggest that NPWT, when compared with wound dressings, may increase the proportion of wounds healed and reduce the time to healing for postoperative foot wounds and ulcers of the foot in people with DM. For the comparisons of different pressures of NPWT for treating foot ulcers in people with DM, it is uncertain whether there is a difference in the number of wounds closed or covered with surgery, and adverse events. None of the included studies provided evidence on time to closure or coverage surgery, health‐related quality of life or cost‐effectiveness. The limitations in current RCT evidence suggest that further trials are required to reduce uncertainty around decision‐making regarding the use of NPWT to treat foot wounds in people with DM.","Negative pressure wound therapy for treating foot wounds in people with diabetes mellitus
What was the aim of this review? 
We reviewed the evidence about whether or not negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is effective in treating foot wounds in people with diabetes. Researchers from Cochrane collected and analysed all relevant studies (randomised controlled trials; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) to answer this question and found 11 relevant studies. 
Key messages 
We cannot be certain whether NPWT is effective for treating foot wounds in people with diabetes. There is some low‐certainty evidence that NPWT increases the number of wounds healed compared with dressings, and may reduce the time it takes wounds to heal. We are uncertain about the effectiveness of different pressures of NPWT on wound healing. Overall, the reliability of the evidence provided by the trials is too low for us to be certain of the benefits and harms of NPWT for treating foot wounds in people with diabetes. 
What did the review study? 
Diabetes mellitus is a common condition that leads to high blood glucose (blood sugar) concentrations, with around 2.8 million people affected in the UK (approximately 4.3% of the population). Some people with diabetes can develop ulcers on their feet. These wounds can take a long time to heal, they can be painful and become infected. Ulceration of the foot in people with diabetes can also lead to a higher risk of amputation of parts of the foot or leg. Generally, people with diabetes are at a higher risk of lower‐limb amputation than people without diabetes. 
NPWT is a treatment currently being used for wounds including leg ulcers. NPWT involves the application of a wound dressing attached to a vacuum suction machine which sucks any wound and tissue fluid away from the treated area into a canister. Worldwide, the use of NPWT is increasing. However, it is expensive compared with wound treatments such as dressings. 
We wanted to find out if NPWT could help foot wounds in people with diabetes to heal more quickly and effectively. We wanted to know if people treated with NPWT experienced any side effects. We were also interested in the impact of NPWT on people's quality of life. 
What were the main results of the review? 
In January 2018, we searched for randomised controlled trials that compared NPWT with other treatments for foot ulcers or other open wounds of the foot in people with diabetes. We found 11 trials involving 972 adults. Participant numbers in each trial ranged from 15 to 341 and trial follow‐up (observation) times ranged from four weeks to 16 weeks where specified. Not all the studies stated how they were funded. Two were funded by an NPWT manufacturer. 
There is low‐certainty evidence to suggest that NPWT may be effective in healing postoperative foot wounds and ulcers of the foot in people with diabetes compared with wound dressings, in terms of the proportion of wounds healed and time to healing. For the comparison of different pressures of NPWT for foot ulcers in people with diabetes, we are uncertain whether there is a difference in the number of wounds closed or covered with surgery, and side effects. There was no evidence available on time to closure or coverage surgery, health‐related quality of life and cost‐effectiveness. 
How up to date was this review? 
We searched for studies that had been published up to January 2018.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Testing a Vacuum Treatment for Foot Wounds in People with Diabetes

## What was studied?
Researchers reviewed studies about a treatment called negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) for foot wounds in people with diabetes. NPWT uses a special bandage connected to a vacuum machine that gently sucks fluid away from the wound into a container.

## Why is this important?
People with diabetes often develop foot wounds that can be difficult to heal. Some people also have wounds after foot surgery. Finding effective treatments is important to help these wounds heal and prevent serious problems.

## What did researchers find?
The review included 11 studies with 972 people total. The studies looked at two main types of wounds:

**For wounds after foot surgery (2 studies, 292 people):**
- NPWT may help more wounds heal compared to regular bandages
- Wounds may heal about 3 weeks faster with NPWT
- It's unclear if NPWT affects the need for amputation

**For foot ulcers (8 studies, 640 people):**
- NPWT may help more wounds heal compared to regular bandages
- NPWT may reduce healing time
- NPWT may lower the risk of needing an amputation

One small study compared different vacuum strengths but didn't provide clear results.

## What does this mean?
NPWT might help foot wounds in people with diabetes heal better and faster than regular bandages, but the evidence is limited. More research is needed to be certain about these benefits and to understand costs and effects on quality of life.

## How reliable are these findings?
The confidence in these results is low to very low, meaning the true effects might be different from what these studies showed.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary: Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) for diabetic foot wounds

What is this study about?
- This is a review of past clinical trials. It looked at whether NPWT helps foot wounds in people with diabetes heal better than standard moist dressings.

Who was studied?
- 11 randomized controlled trials with 972 adults who had foot wounds related to diabetes.
- Wound types: foot ulcers and post-surgery (after amputation) wounds.
- Studies were found and reviewed up to January 2018.

What treatments were compared?
- NPWT: a special dressing connected to a small vacuum that gently removes fluid from the wound.
- Standard care: moist wound dressings.
- One small study compared two NPWT pressure settings (75 mmHg vs 125 mmHg).

Main outcomes measured
- How many wounds healed.
- How long it took for wounds to heal.
- Amputation risk.
- Side effects (adverse events).
- Note: No trials reported quality of life, time to surgical closure, or cost.

Key results
- Post-surgery (after amputation) wounds:
  - In one study (16-week follow-up), more wounds healed with NPWT than with dressings.
  - Healing was faster with NPWT (about 3 weeks sooner on average).
  - It is unclear if NPWT changed amputation risk.

- Foot ulcers:
  - Across several studies, more ulcers healed with NPWT than with dressings.
  - One large study showed NPWT helped ulcers heal faster.
  - Some studies suggest NPWT may lower the chance of amputation.
  
- Different NPWT pressures (75 vs 125 mmHg):
  - One small study found no clear differences in wound closure or side effects after 4 weeks.

Safety
- Reported side effects were limited and varied.
- It is uncertain if NPWT has more or fewer side effects than dressings based on the available data.

Timing
- Follow-up times varied by study.
- One post-surgery study followed people for 16 weeks; the pressure-comparison study followed for 4 weeks.

How certain are these findings?
- Evidence quality was low. This means results could change as more high-quality studies are done.

Bottom line
- NPWT may help more diabetic foot wounds heal and may shorten healing time compared with moist dressings.
- Possible reduction in amputations for ulcers, but this is not certain.
- More good-quality research is needed to confirm benefits, risks, and best settings for NPWT."
132,"Background
The standard duration of treatment for children with acute group A beta hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) pharyngitis with oral penicillin is 10 days. Shorter duration antibiotics may have comparable efficacy. 
Objectives
To summarize the evidence regarding the efficacy of two to six days of newer oral antibiotics (short duration) compared to 10 days of oral penicillin (standard duration) in treating children with acute GABHS pharyngitis. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2012, Issue 3) which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group’s Specialized Register, MEDLINE (January 1966 to March week 3, 2012) and EMBASE (January 1990 to April 2012).

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing short duration oral antibiotics to standard duration oral penicillin in children aged 1 to 18 years with acute GABHS pharyngitis. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors scanned the titles and abstracts of retrieved citations and applied the inclusion criteria. We retrieved included studies in full, and extracted data. Two review authors independently assessed trial quality. 
Main results
We included 20 studies with 13,102 cases of acute GABHS pharyngitis. The updated search did not identify any new eligible studies; the majority of studies were at high risk of bias. However, the majority of the results were consistent. Compared to standard duration treatment, the short duration treatment studies had shorter periods of fever (mean difference (MD) ‐0.30 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.45 to ‐0.14) and throat soreness (MD ‐0.50 days, 95% CI ‐0.78 to ‐0.22); lower risk of early clinical treatment failure (odds ratio (OR) 0.80, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.94); no significant difference in early bacteriological treatment failure (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.20) or late clinical recurrence (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.08). However, the overall risk of late bacteriological recurrence was worse in the short duration treatment studies (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.48), although no significant differences were found when studies of low dose azithromycin (10 mg/kg) were eliminated (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.22). Three studies reported long duration complications. Out of 8135 cases of acute GABHS pharyngitis, only six cases in the short duration treatment versus eight in the standard duration treatment developed long‐term complications in the form of glomerulonephritis and acute rheumatic fever, with no statistically significant difference (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.64). 
Authors' conclusions
Three to six days of oral antibiotics had comparable efficacy compared to the standard duration 10‐day course of oral penicillin in treating children with acute GABHS pharyngitis. . In areas where the prevalence of rheumatic heart disease is still high, our results must be interpreted with caution.","The effect of short duration versus standard duration antibiotic therapy for streptococcal throat infection in children 
Streptococcal (strep) throat infection is very common. A 10‐day course of penicillin is prescribed mainly to protect against the complication of acute rheumatic fever, which can occur approximately 20 days after streptococcal throat and cause damage to the heart valves. Cases of acute rheumatic fever have dropped dramatically in high‐income countries. Newer antibiotics taken for a shorter duration, may have a comparable effect to penicillin taken for 10 days. 
We summarized medical literature regarding the effect of two to six days of oral antibiotics (short duration) in treating children with streptococcal throat infection, compared with 10 days of oral penicillin (standard duration). We included 20 studies with 13,102 cases of acute group A beta hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) pharyngitis. The short duration treatment resulted in better compliance but more side effects. All side effects were self‐limiting: mostly mild to moderate diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Three studies reported the rate of long duration complications with no statistically significant difference. 
Our study has several limitations. Firstly, only 3 out of the 20 included studies followed the participants for a sufficient duration to be able to study the prevalence of complications of GABHS pharyngitis. Although these three studies had a total of 8135 participants, results were too under‐powered to draw any conclusions on differences in complication rates. This means our conclusion is not applicable in low‐income countries where the prevalence of rheumatic heart disease is high. Another limitation is that the primary studies evaluated different antibiotics for variable durations (three to six days). Also, studies were of limited quality. Finally, although the shorter antibiotic duration appeared to be effective and more convenient, it is more expensive than the standard duration 10 days of penicillin. However, one must take into account the reality of patient behavior and the price of unsuccessful or incomplete therapy. 
Three to six days of oral antibiotics for children with streptococcal throat infection is a safe treatment with a comparable effect to the standard duration of 10 days of penicillin. However, our results must be interpreted with caution in low‐income countries where acute rheumatic fever is still a problem.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Shorter Antibiotic Treatment for Children with Strep Throat

## What was this study about?

Researchers wanted to find out if children with strep throat could take antibiotics for fewer days instead of the usual 10 days. Strep throat is a common infection caused by bacteria called Group A streptococcus.

## Who was studied?

Children between 1 and 18 years old who had strep throat confirmed by testing.

## What did researchers compare?

- **Shorter treatment**: Taking newer antibiotics for 2 to 6 days
- **Standard treatment**: Taking penicillin for 10 days

## What did they find?

The researchers looked at 20 studies with over 13,000 children. They found that shorter antibiotic treatment:

- Helped fever go away about 7 hours faster
- Reduced throat pain for about half a day less time
- Worked just as well at clearing the infection in most cases
- Had similar rates of the infection coming back

However, in some cases where lower doses of certain antibiotics were used, the bacteria came back more often.

Out of over 8,000 children studied, very few (only 14 total) developed serious complications like kidney problems or rheumatic fever. There was no difference between the shorter and longer treatment groups.

## What does this mean?

Taking antibiotics for 3 to 6 days may work as well as taking them for 10 days for treating strep throat in children. However, in places where rheumatic heart disease is common, doctors should be careful when deciding on shorter treatment.",1,Técnico,"Plain-language summary of the research

What was the goal?
- To see if a short course (2 to 6 days) of newer oral antibiotics works as well as the standard 10-day course of penicillin for children with strep throat caused by group A strep.

Who was studied?
- Children ages 1 to 18 years with confirmed group A strep throat.
- The review combined 20 randomized studies with 13,102 children.

What treatments were compared?
- Short duration: 2–6 days of newer oral antibiotics.
- Standard duration: 10 days of oral penicillin.

How was it studied?
- Researchers reviewed randomized controlled trials.
- Two reviewers selected studies, checked quality, and collected data.

Main findings
- Symptoms: Short courses led to slightly shorter fever (about 0.3 days less) and sore throat (about 0.5 days less).
- Early results: Short courses had a slightly lower chance of early clinical failure. Clearing the bacteria early was similar between groups.
- Coming back later: Return of symptoms later was similar. Return of the bacteria later was a bit more common with short courses, mainly when very low-dose azithromycin (10 mg/kg) was used. Without those low-dose studies, there was no clear difference.
- Serious complications: Very rare in both groups (6 cases with short courses vs 8 with 10-day penicillin out of 8,135 children studied). No clear difference between groups.

Safety
- Long-term complications (such as kidney or heart-related problems after infection) were very rare and similar between groups in the studies reviewed.

Timing
- Short courses lasted 2–6 days; standard treatment lasted 10 days.
- The studies included were published up to 2012.

Bottom line
- For children with group A strep throat, 3–6 days of certain newer antibiotics worked about as well as a 10-day course of penicillin for symptom relief and early results.
- There may be a slightly higher chance of the bacteria returning later with some short-course regimens, especially very low-dose azithromycin.
- In places where rheumatic heart disease is common, results should be used with caution."
133,"Background
The optimal haemoglobin threshold for use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in anaemic patients remains an active field of research. Blood is a scarce resource, and in some countries, transfusions are less safe than in others because of inadequate testing for viral pathogens. If a liberal transfusion policy does not improve clinical outcomes, or if it is equivalent, then adopting a more restrictive approach could be recognised as the standard of care.  
Objectives
The aim of this review update was to compare 30‐day mortality and other clinical outcomes for participants randomised to restrictive versus liberal red blood cell (RBC) transfusion thresholds (triggers) for all clinical conditions. The restrictive transfusion threshold uses a lower haemoglobin concentration as a threshold for transfusion (most commonly, 7.0 g/dL to 8.0 g/dL), and the liberal transfusion threshold uses a higher haemoglobin concentration as a threshold for transfusion (most commonly, 9.0 g/dL to 10.0 g/dL). 
Search methods
We identified trials through updated searches: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1946 to November 2020), Embase (1974 to November 2020), Transfusion Evidence Library (1950 to November 2020), Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index (1990 to November 2020), and trial registries (November 2020). We  checked the reference lists of other published reviews and relevant papers to identify additional trials. We were aware of one trial identified in earlier searching that was in the process of being published (in February 2021), and we were able to include it before this review was finalised. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised trials of surgical or medical participants that recruited adults or children, or both. We excluded studies that focused on neonates. 
Eligible trials assigned intervention groups on the basis of different transfusion schedules or thresholds or 'triggers'. These thresholds would be defined by a haemoglobin (Hb) or haematocrit (Hct) concentration below which an RBC transfusion would be administered; the haemoglobin concentration remains the most commonly applied marker of the need for RBC transfusion in clinical practice. We included trials in which investigators had allocated participants to higher thresholds or more liberal transfusion strategies compared to more restrictive ones, which might include no transfusion. As in previous versions of this review, we did not exclude unregistered trials published after 2010 (as per the policy of the Cochrane Injuries Group, 2015), however, we did conduct analyses to consider the differential impact of results of trials for which prospective registration could not be confirmed.   
Data collection and analysis
We identified trials for inclusion and extracted data using Cochrane methods. We pooled risk ratios of clinical outcomes across trials using a random‐effects model. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We conducted predefined analyses by clinical subgroups. We defined participants randomly allocated to the lower transfusion threshold as being in the 'restrictive transfusion' group and those randomly allocated to the higher transfusion threshold as being in the 'liberal transfusion' group. 
Main results
A total of 48 trials, involving data from 21,433 participants (at baseline), across a range of clinical contexts (e.g. orthopaedic, cardiac, or vascular surgery; critical care; acute blood loss (including gastrointestinal bleeding); acute coronary syndrome; cancer; leukaemia; haematological malignancies), met the eligibility criteria. The haemoglobin concentration used to define the restrictive transfusion group in most trials (36) was between 7.0 g/dL and 8.0 g/dL.  Most trials included only adults; three trials focused on children. 
The included studies were generally at low risk of bias for key domains including allocation concealment and incomplete outcome data. 
Restrictive transfusion strategies reduced the risk of receiving at least one RBC transfusion by 41% across a broad range of clinical contexts (risk ratio (RR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.66; 42 studies, 20,057 participants; high‐quality evidence), with a large amount of heterogeneity between trials (I² = 96%). 
Overall, restrictive transfusion strategies did not increase or decrease the risk of 30‐day mortality compared with liberal transfusion strategies (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.15; 31 studies, 16,729 participants; I² = 30%; moderate‐quality evidence) or any of the other outcomes assessed (i.e. cardiac events (low‐quality evidence), myocardial infarction, stroke, thromboembolism (all high‐quality evidence)). High‐quality evidence shows that the liberal transfusion threshold did not affect the risk of infection (pneumonia, wound infection, or bacteraemia). Transfusion‐specific reactions are uncommon and were inconsistently reported within trials. 
We noted less certainty in the strength of evidence to support the safety of restrictive transfusion thresholds for the following predefined clinical subgroups: myocardial infarction, vascular surgery, haematological malignancies, and chronic bone‐marrow disorders. 
Authors' conclusions
Transfusion at a restrictive haemoglobin concentration decreased the proportion of people exposed to RBC transfusion by 41% across a broad range of clinical contexts. Across all trials, no evidence suggests that a restrictive transfusion strategy impacted 30‐day mortality, mortality at other time points, or morbidity (i.e. cardiac events, myocardial infarction, stroke, pneumonia, thromboembolism, infection) compared with a liberal transfusion strategy. 
Despite including 17 more randomised trials (and 8846 participants), data remain insufficient to inform the safety of transfusion policies in important and selected clinical contexts, such as myocardial infarction, chronic cardiovascular disease, neurological injury or traumatic brain injury, stroke, thrombocytopenia, and cancer or haematological malignancies, including chronic bone marrow failure.  
Further work is needed to improve our understanding of outcomes other than mortality. Most trials compared only two separate thresholds for haemoglobin concentration, which may not identify the actual optimal threshold for transfusion in a particular patient. Haemoglobin concentration may not be the most informative marker of the need for transfusion in individual patients with different degrees of physiological adaptation to anaemia. Notwithstanding these issues, overall findings provide good evidence that transfusions with allogeneic RBCs can be avoided in most patients with haemoglobin thresholds between the range of 7.0 g/dL and 8.0 g/dL. Some patient subgroups might benefit from RBCs to maintain higher haemoglobin concentrations; research efforts should focus on these clinical contexts.","Is it safe to use lower blood counts (haemoglobin levels) as a trigger for blood transfusion in order to give fewer blood transfusions? 
Key messages 
•There is no evidence that giving blood transfusions to patients with lower blood counts (haemoglobin levels of 7.0 g/dL to 8.0 g/dL) compared to higher blood counts (9.0 g/dL to 10.0 g/dL) affects risks of death, heart attack, myocardial infarction, stroke, pneumonia, blood clots or infection. 
• Giving blood only to patients with lower blood counts (7.0 g/dL to 8.0 g/dL) would reduce the amount of blood transfused substantially. It would also reduce the risk of unnecessary transfusions (transfusions can have harmful effects). 
• More research is needed to:
‐ establish the blood count at which a blood transfusion is needed in people who have suffered a heart attack, brain injury, or have cancer; and to 
‐ improve our understanding of outcomes other than death, including quality of life.
What happens in people who need blood transfusions? 
Doctors and healthcare professionals often give blood transfusions to people who lose blood through surgery, bleeding, or illness. For example, blood transfusions may help patients with anaemia to recover after surgery, but they should only be given when they help people to get better from their medical condition. Blood is a limited resource and transfusion is not risk‐free, especially for people in low‐income countries where the blood used in transfusions may not be tested for harmful viruses such as HIV or hepatitis. 
What did we want to find out? 
The blood count measures the amount of haemoglobin in the blood. Haemoglobin is a protein that gives blood its red colour and carries oxygen around the body. A normal blood count is around 12 grams a decilitre (12 g/dL). We wanted to find out if it is safe to withhold blood transfusion until the blood count drops to between 7.0 g/dL to 8.0 g/dL, rather than transfusing sooner at higher blood counts of between 9.0 g/dL to 10.0 g/dL. 
What did we do? 
We examined the results of studies that allocated patients to one of two groups by chance (for example, by flipping a coin). In one group, the patients only received blood transfusions if their blood count fell below a higher threshold (typically, 9.0 g/dL to 10.0 g/dL). In the other group, the patients only received blood transfusions if their blood counts fell below a lower threshold (typically, 7.0 g/dL to 8.0 g/dL). 
What did we find? 
We found 48 studies that involved 21,433 patients. The patients had been hospitalised for a range of reasons including: bone (orthopaedic), heart (cardiac) or vascular surgery; critical care; acute blood loss (for example, through bleeding in the stomach or intestines); heart diseases; cancer and blood cancers. The studies compared higher or lower blood count thresholds for blood transfusion. (The ‘threshold’ is the blood count level that would need to be met before a transfusion would be given.) 
Transfusion 
We found that patients who received transfusions only at lower blood count thresholds were 41% less likely to receive a blood transfusion than those who received them only at higher blood count thresholds. If the lower threshold were applied routinely by medical staff, it would lead to a substantial reduction in the quantity of blood needed. 
Death and harmful events 
There was no clear difference in the risk of dying within 30 days of receiving, or not receiving, a transfusion for patients in the two different threshold groups. 
There was also no clear difference between the low and high threshold groups for the number of serious harmful events that occurred after patients received, or did not receive, blood transfusions. The harmful events recorded included infection (pneumonia, wound infection, and blood poisoning), heart attacks, strokes, and problems with blood clots. 
What are the limitations of the evidence? 
We found that most of the studies provided a high quality of evidence; they were adequately conducted and used methods that minimised biases that could make the validity of the results uncertain. 
We are confident in the evidence regarding likelihood of receiving a transfusion, death within 30 days of transfusion, heart attack, stroke and infection. We are moderately confident in the evidence for problems caused by blood clots, but too few occurred in either group for us to be more confident. 
Too few studies evaluated quality of life for us to be able to see whether it varied between groups. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
This Cochrane Review updates our previous work on this subject (last published in 2016). Seventeen new studies are included. The evidence is up to date to November 2020.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Blood Transfusion Thresholds Study

## What was this study about?

Researchers reviewed studies to find out when doctors should give blood transfusions to patients with low red blood cell counts (anemia). They compared two approaches:

- **Restrictive approach**: Give blood transfusions when blood levels drop to 7.0-8.0 g/dL
- **Liberal approach**: Give blood transfusions at higher blood levels of 9.0-10.0 g/dL

## Why is this important?

Blood is a limited resource. In some countries, blood transfusions carry risks of infection. If waiting until blood levels are lower doesn't harm patients, doctors could save blood for when it's truly needed.

## Who was studied?

The review included 48 studies with 21,433 adults and children who needed medical care or surgery. These patients had various conditions including:
- Heart surgery or heart problems
- Other surgeries (bone, blood vessel)
- Critical illness
- Blood loss or bleeding
- Cancer or blood disorders

## What did researchers find?

**Main findings:**
- Using the restrictive approach (waiting until blood levels were lower) reduced the number of people receiving transfusions by 41%
- Patients in the restrictive group were just as safe as those in the liberal group
- Both approaches had similar rates of death within 30 days
- Both approaches had similar rates of complications like heart problems, stroke, blood clots, and infections

**What this means:**
For most patients, doctors can safely wait until blood levels drop to 7.0-8.0 g/dL before giving transfusions.

## What's still unknown?

More research is needed for patients with:
- Recent heart attacks
- Ongoing heart disease
- Brain injuries
- Stroke
- Certain blood disorders and cancers

These patient groups may need transfusions at higher blood levels, but current evidence is limited.",0,Plano,"Plain-Language Summary of the Research

What was studied
- Researchers asked: Is it safe to give blood transfusions only when blood levels are lower (restrictive) compared to giving them at higher levels (liberal)?
- They focused on the first 30 days after treatment and other health outcomes.

Who was included
- 48 randomized trials with 21,433 people.
- Mostly adults in many settings: surgery, intensive care, sudden blood loss (like stomach or gut bleeding), heart problems, and cancer.
- Three trials included children. Newborns were not included.

What the treatments were
- Restrictive transfusion: give red blood cells when hemoglobin is lower, most often at 7.0–8.0 g/dL.
- Liberal transfusion: give red blood cells at a higher level, most often at 9.0–10.0 g/dL.

What outcomes were measured
- Death within 30 days.
- Heart problems (like heart attack), stroke, blood clots.
- Infections (pneumonia, wound infection, bloodstream infection).
- How many people received at least one transfusion.
- Reactions to transfusion.

Main findings
- Fewer people received blood with restrictive care: a 41% reduction in getting at least one transfusion.
- No clear difference in death within 30 days between restrictive and liberal strategies.
- No clear difference in heart attack, stroke, blood clots, or infections.
- Transfusion reactions were rare but not always well reported.

Safety notes
- Overall, restrictive transfusion (often 7–8 g/dL) appears as safe as liberal transfusion for most patients studied.
- There is less certainty for some groups: people with a heart attack, those having vascular surgery, and people with blood cancers or long-term bone marrow problems.

Timing of evidence
- Trials were found in databases up to November 2020. One additional trial from early 2021 was included.

What this means
- Using a lower hemoglobin level to decide on transfusion can safely reduce how many people get blood, in many common medical situations.
- Some patient groups may need higher levels; more research is needed to know the best approach for them."
134,"Background
Fetal growth restriction is defined as failure to reach growth potential and considered one of the major complications of pregnancy. These infants are often, although not universally, small for gestational age (SGA). SGA is defined as a weight less than a specified percentile (usually the 10th percentile). Identification of SGA infants is important because these infants are at increased risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Screening for SGA is a challenge for all maternity care providers and current methods of clinical assessment fail to detect many infants who are SGA. Large observational studies suggest that customised growth charts may be better able to differentiate between constitutional and pathologic smallness. Customised charts adjust for physiological variables such as maternal weight and height, ethnicity and parity. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of using population‐based growth charts compared with customised growth charts as a screening tool for detection of fetal growth in pregnant women. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (12 March 2014), reviewed published guidelines and searched the reference lists of review articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised, quasi‐randomised or cluster‐randomised clinical trials comparing customised versus population‐based growth charts used as a screening tool for detection of fetal growth in pregnant women. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion.
Main results
No randomised trials met the inclusion criteria.
Authors' conclusions
There is no randomised trial evidence currently available. Further randomised trials are required to accurately assess whether the improvement in detection shown is secondary to customised charts alone or an effect of the policy change. Future research in large trials is needed to investigate the benefits and harms (including perinatal mortality) of using customised growth charts in different settings and for both fundal height and ultrasound measurements","Customised versus population‐based growth charts as a screening tool for detecting small for gestational age infants in low‐risk pregnant women 
Small for gestational age (SGA) infants are defined as having a birthweight that is less than that for 10% of the population when plotted on a growth chart based on their gestational age and sex. This definition includes both infants who are normally grown but small, and infants who do not reach their full growth potential (are growth restricted). SGA infants are at an increased risk of complications, fetal distress and even death during labour. Detecting SGA infants is a major challenge for all maternity care providers, particularly with women who have an otherwise healthy pregnancy. 
Several clinical methods are commonly used for assessing an infant’s growth during pregnancy including estimating the size of the uterus by examining the pregnant woman (symphysiofundal height (SFH) and single or a series of ultrasound scans). 
Both of the above measurements can be plotted and followed on growth charts. Most maternity services use standard population‐based growth charts in assessing fetal weight during pregnancy, and monitoring changes from the birthweight after the baby is born. Previous research suggests that customised growth charts which adjust for factors such as the mother's weight and height, ethnicity and number of babies she has had may make assessment of fetal growth more precise, reducing unnecessary consultations for investigations and parental anxiety. 
Currently there are no studies available. Research is needed to assess the effect of using the charts in different settings and for both fundal height and ultrasound measurements on the health of women and their babies and should include important outcomes such as mortality.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Different Growth Charts for Monitoring Baby Size During Pregnancy

## What is this study about?

Researchers wanted to find out which type of growth chart works best for tracking how babies grow during pregnancy. Some babies don't grow as much as they should, which can lead to health problems. Doctors need good tools to identify these babies early.

## What are growth charts?

Growth charts help doctors track whether a baby in the womb is growing normally. There are two main types:

- **Standard growth charts**: Use the same measurements for all pregnant women
- **Customized growth charts**: Adjust measurements based on the mother's height, weight, ethnic background, and whether she has had babies before

## Why does this matter?

Babies who are smaller than expected may face higher risks of health problems or death around the time of birth. However, current methods often miss babies who aren't growing well. Some research suggests customized charts might be better at telling the difference between babies who are naturally small and healthy versus those who have growth problems.

## What did the researchers find?

The researchers searched for studies that compared these two types of charts, but **they found no studies that met their requirements**. No proper trials have been done to test which approach works better.

## What's next?

More research studies are needed to determine:
- Whether customized growth charts actually help identify at-risk babies better than standard charts
- Whether using customized charts improves health outcomes for babies
- Any potential downsides of using either type of chart",0,Plano,"Plain-Language Summary

What is the study about?
- Doctors use growth charts during pregnancy to check how a baby is growing.
- This review looked at two types of charts:
  - Population-based charts: the same chart for everyone.
  - Customised charts: adjusted for the mother’s height, weight, ethnicity, and number of previous births.

Who is this for?
- Pregnant women and their care providers.

Main question (Objective)
- Do customised growth charts work better or cause any harms compared to population-based charts for finding babies who may be smaller than expected?

How was the research done?
- The team searched medical databases and guidelines up to March 12, 2014.
- They looked for randomised studies that compared the two chart types.

What did they find?
- No randomised clinical trials met the criteria.
- This means there is no strong trial evidence to show which chart is better or safer.

Why does this matter?
- Finding small-for-gestational-age (SGA) babies is important, but current checks miss some.
- Customised charts may help, but this has not been tested in high-quality trials.

Planned outcomes to assess
- How well each chart finds babies who are small for their gestational age.
- Health outcomes around birth, including perinatal death.
- Any harms from using one chart type over the other.
- Use with both fundal height and ultrasound measurements.

Safety
- Benefits and harms are unknown due to lack of trials.

Timeline
- Evidence search was completed on March 12, 2014.

Bottom line
- There is no randomised trial evidence yet.
- Large, well-designed trials are needed to learn if customised charts improve detection and outcomes without causing harm."
135,"Background
Direct laryngoscopy is the method currently used for tracheal intubation in children. It occasionally offers unexpectedly poor laryngeal views. Indirect laryngoscopy involves visualizing the vocal cords by means other than obtaining a direct sight, with the potential to improve outcomes. We reviewed the current available literature and performed a meta‐analysis to compare direct versus indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, with regards to efficacy and adverse effects. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy of indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, versus direct laryngoscopy for intubation of children with regards to intubation time, number of attempts at intubation, and adverse haemodynamic responses to endotracheal intubation. We also assessed other adverse responses to intubation, such as trauma to oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal structures, and we assessed vocal cord view scores. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and trial registers (www.clinicaltrials.gov and www.controlledtrials) in November 2015. We reran the search in January 2017. We added new studies of potential interest to a list of ‘Studies awaiting classification' and will incorporate them into formal review findings during the review update. We performed reference checking and citation searching and contacted the authors of unpublished data to ask for more information. We applied no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included only randomized controlled trials. Participants were children aged 28 days to 18 years. Investigators performed intubations using any type of indirect laryngoscopes, or videolaryngoscopes, versus direct laryngoscopes. 
Data collection and analysis
We used Cochrane standard methodological procedures. Two review authors independently reviewed titles, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. 
Main results
We included 12 studies (803 children) in this review and meta‐analysis. We identified three studies that are awaiting classification and two ongoing studies. 
Trial results show that a longer intubation time was required when indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, was used instead of direct laryngoscopy (12 trials; n = 798; mean difference (MD) 5.49 seconds, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37 to 9.60; I2 = 90%; very low‐quality evidence). Researchers found no significant differences between direct and indirect laryngoscopy on assessment of success of the first attempt at intubation (11 trials; n = 749; risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.02; I2 = 67%; low‐quality evidence) and observed that unsuccessful intubation (five trials; n = 263) was significantly increased in the indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, group (RR 4.93, 95% CI 1.33 to 18.31; I2 = 0%; low‐quality evidence). Five studies reported the effect of intubation on oxygen saturation (n = 272; very low‐quality evidence). Five children had desaturation during intubation: one from the direct laryngoscopy group and four from the indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, group. 
Two studies (n = 100) reported other haemodynamic responses to intubation (very low‐quality evidence). One study reported a significant increase in heart rate five minutes after intubation in the indirect laryngoscopy group (P = 0.007); the other study found that the heart rate change in the direct laryngoscopy group was significantly less than the heart rate change in the indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, group (P < 0.001). A total of five studies (n = 244; very low‐quality evidence) looked at evidence of trauma resulting from intubation. Investigators reported that only two children from the direct laryngoscopy group had trauma compared with no children in the indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, group. 
Use of indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, improved the percentage of glottic opening (five trials; n = 256). Studies noted no significant difference in Cormack and Lehane score (C&L) grade 1 (three trials; n = 190; RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21; I2 = 59%). 
Authors' conclusions
Evidence suggests that indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, leads to prolonged intubation time with an increased rate of intubation failure when compared with direct laryngoscopy (very low‐quality evidence due to imprecision, inconsistency, and study limitations). Review authors had difficulty reaching conclusions on adverse haemodynamic responses and other adverse effects of intubation, as only a few children were reported to have these outcomes. Use of indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, might lead to improved vocal cord view, but marked heterogeneity between studies made it difficult for review authors to reach conclusions on this outcome.","Comparison of video‐assisted and non‐video‐assisted devices for intubation of children
Background 
Children who need a general anaesthetic sometimes need a breathing tube placed in their throat, known as intubation. Intubations are also performed in emergency situations such as trauma, severe breathing difficulty, and heart dysfunction. Intubation is traditionally performed with a laryngoscope, a device that lifts the tongue to allow a direct view of the vocal cords. This is known as direct laryngoscopy. New devices have been developed that show the vocal cords through a fine video camera placed on the tip of the device; this is known as indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy. 
Indirect laryngoscopes, or videolaryngoscopes, are thought to provide a better view of the vocal cords when compared with direct laryngoscopes, but whether this equipment allows easier placement of the breathing tube remains unclear. 
Study characteristics 
We reviewed the evidence on how effective indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, is when compared with direct laryngoscopy for intubation in children from 28 days to 18 years old. We found 12 randomized controlled trials (803 children) that met our inclusion criteria. The evidence is current to November 2015. We reran the search in January 2017 and will include the three studies awaiting classification when we update the review. 
Key results 
For intubation, use of indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, took longer and was more likely to be unsuccessful (very low‐quality evidence). No significant difference was found between direct and indirect laryngoscopy when success of the first attempt at intubation was assessed (low‐quality evidence). Only a few studies reported the effect of intubation on adverse haemodynamic response, including changes in oxygen saturation, heart rate, and trauma to the mouth and windpipe. Therefore, it was difficult to conclude on the overall adverse effect (very low‐quality evidence). Indirect laryngoscopy might provide better views of the vocal cords. 
Quality of the evidence 
We found considerable variation in results from included studies in terms of assessment of intubation time, number of attempts at intubation, number of unsuccessful intubations, adverse effects, and assessments of how well the vocal cords were seen. None of the included studies was funded by a laryngoscope manufacturer, hence minimizing the risk of other bias. The quality of the studies varied, and only a few were of highest quality. For these reasons, we graded the overall quality of evidence as very low.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Two Methods for Inserting Breathing Tubes in Children

## What was this study about?

Researchers compared two ways doctors insert breathing tubes into children's windpipes during medical procedures:

1. **Direct laryngoscopy** – The standard method where doctors look directly down the throat to see the vocal cords
2. **Indirect laryngoscopy (also called videolaryngoscopy)** – A newer method using a camera to see the vocal cords on a screen

## Who was studied?

The review combined results from 12 studies involving 803 children between 28 days and 18 years old who needed breathing tubes inserted.

## What did researchers find?

**Time needed:**
- The camera method took about 5 seconds longer on average to insert the breathing tube

**Success rates:**
- Both methods had similar success rates on the first try
- However, the camera method had more complete failures (when the tube couldn't be inserted at all)

**Safety concerns:**
- Very few children had problems with either method
- Five children had temporary drops in oxygen levels (1 with direct method, 4 with camera method)
- Two children had minor mouth or throat injuries, both with the direct method
- A few children had changes in heart rate with the camera method

**Viewing the vocal cords:**
- The camera method may provide better views of the vocal cords

## What does this mean?

The traditional direct method appears to work faster and may have fewer failures than the camera method for inserting breathing tubes in children. However, the researchers noted the evidence quality was limited, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What was studied
- Doctors compared two ways to place a breathing tube in children: direct laryngoscopy (looking straight at the vocal cords) versus indirect or video laryngoscopy (using a camera to see the vocal cords).

Who was included
- Children aged 28 days to 18 years.
- Evidence came from 12 randomized trials with 803 children. Searches were done in 2015 and updated in 2017.

What the study wanted to find out
- How fast the tube could be placed (intubation time).
- How often the tube was placed on the first try and overall success.
- Body responses during the procedure (like heart rate and oxygen levels).
- Injuries to the mouth, throat, or voice box.
- How well the vocal cords could be seen.

What was done
- Researchers compared indirect/video laryngoscopes to direct laryngoscopes.
- They combined results (meta-analysis) and rated how strong the evidence was.

Main findings
- Time to place the tube: Indirect/video took longer by about 5.5 seconds on average. Evidence quality: very low.
- First try success: No clear difference between the two methods. Evidence quality: low.
- Overall failure to place the tube: Higher with indirect/video. Evidence quality: low.
- Oxygen drops during intubation: 5 children total—1 with direct, 4 with indirect/video. Evidence quality: very low.
- Heart rate changes: Two small studies found bigger increases with indirect/video. Evidence quality: very low.
- Injuries (mouth/throat/voice box): Very few events; 2 cases with direct, 0 with indirect/video across five studies. Evidence quality: very low.
- View of the vocal cords: Indirect/video often showed a wider opening, but studies varied a lot.

Safety
- Few adverse events were reported overall. Because events were rare and studies were small, it is hard to draw firm safety conclusions.

Strength of the evidence
- Many findings were based on low or very low-quality evidence due to small study sizes, differences between studies, and study limitations.

Other notes
- Three more studies were found but not yet fully assessed, and two studies were ongoing at the time of the update."
136,"Background
People who suffer from severe mental disorder experience high rates of unemployment. Supported employment is an approach to vocational rehabilitation that involves trying to place clients in competitive jobs without any extended preparation. The Individual placement and support (IPS) model is a carefully specified form of supported employment. 
Objectives
1. To review the effectiveness of supported employment compared with other approaches to vocational rehabilitation or treatment as usual. 2. Secondary objectives were to establish how far: (a) fidelity to the IPS model affects the effectiveness of supported employment, (b) the effectiveness of supported employment can be augmented by the addition of other interventions. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (February 2010), which is compiled by systematic searches of major databases, handsearches and conference proceedings. 
Selection criteria
All relevant randomised clinical trials focusing on people with severe mental illness, of working age (normally 16 to 70 years), where supported employment was compared with other vocational approaches or treatment as usual. Outcomes such as days in employment, job stability, global state, social functioning, mental state, quality of life, satisfaction and costs were sought. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors (YK and KK) independently extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% (CI). We employed a fixed‐effect model for analyses. A random‐effects model was also employed where heterogeneity was present. 
Main results
A total of 14 randomised controlled trials were included in this review (total 2265 people). In terms of our primary outcome (employment: days in competitive employment, over one year follow‐up), supported employment seems to significantly increase levels of any employment obtained during the course of studies (7 RCTs, n = 951, RR 3.24 CI 2.17 to 4.82, very low quality of evidence). Supported employment also seems to increase length of competitive employment when compared with other vocational approaches (1 RCT, n = 204, MD 70.63 CI 43.22 to 94.04, very low quality evidence). Supported employment also showed some advantages in other secondary outcomes. It appears to increase length (in days) of any form of paid employment (2 RCTs, n = 510, MD 84.94 CI 51.99 to 117.89, very low quality evidence) and job tenure (weeks) for competitive employment (1 RCT, n = 204, MD 9.86 CI 5.36 to 14.36, very low quality evidence) and any paid employment (3 RCTs, n = 735, MD 3.86 CI ‐2.94 to 22.17, very low quality evidence). Furthermore, one study indicated a decreased time to first competitive employment in the long term for people in supported employment (1 RCT, n = 204, MD ‐161.60 CI ‐225.73 to ‐97.47, very low quality evidence). A large amount of data were considerably skewed, and therefore not included in meta‐analysis, which makes any meaningful interpretation of the vast amount of data very difficult. 
Authors' conclusions
The limited available evidence suggests that supported employment is effective in improving a number of vocational outcomes relevant to people with severe mental illness, though there appears to exist some overall risk of bias in terms of the quality of individual studies. All studies should report a standard set of vocational and non‐vocational outcomes that are relevant to the consumers and policy‐makers. Studies with longer follow‐up should be conducted to answer or address the critical question about durability of effects.","Supported employment for adults with severe mental illness
People with mental health problems experience high rates of unemployment. There are various schemes delivering support to people with mental health problems who are trying to find employment. Supported employment tries to place people into competitive jobs. People are placed quickly in normal work settings where they receive intensive support and training from ‘job coaches’.  Individual placement and support (IPS) is a more specified scheme that includes: finding local jobs; a rapid job search; customer choice in what they want from the employment service; close working between employment and mental health teams; attention to people’s preferred job, their strengths and work experience; ongoing and, if necessary, long‐term individual support; and the benefits of counselling. Employment specialists act to identify people’s job interests, assist with job finding, give job support and engage other support services. IPS uses assertive outreach to deliver training, advice and vocational support in the community. Augmented supported employment is where employment support is given with other supplementary techniques, such as social skills training, motivational classes and various types of rehabilitation. Other approaches are many and varied, including: job workshops; job counselling; peer support; partnerships with business; and the Clubhouse model, which involves training, work experience, peer support and transitional employment and IPS because they do not search for immediate and competitive employment. However, all approaches involve periods of preparation, education and on‐the‐job training.  This review compares supported employment and IPS with other approaches for finding employment. Drawing from a total of 2259 people with mental health problems in 14 studies, the review has two main findings: 1) Supported employment increases the length and time of people’s employment; 2) People on supported employment find jobs quicker. Supported employment and IPS are better than other approaches in these two respects, but there is limited information or measurable differences on other important issues for service users.  For example, there is little information on issues such as improving quality of life, impact on people’s mental health, days in hospital and costs. Furthermore, the review built its main findings on limited statistical evidence drawn mainly from studies carried out in North America and Europe. Future studies should address a fuller range of information and outcomes. Longer studies are needed to see how long the effects of supported employment last. 
This plain language summary has been written by a consumer Ben Gray from RETHINK.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Supported Employment for People with Severe Mental Illness

## What was this study about?

Researchers reviewed studies on a job-finding approach called ""supported employment"" for people with severe mental illness. This approach, also known as Individual Placement and Support (IPS), helps people look for regular jobs right away, without lengthy training programs first.

## Who was studied?

Adults of working age (typically 16 to 70 years old) with severe mental illness who wanted to work.

## What was compared?

Researchers compared supported employment to:
- Other job training programs
- Standard care

## What did researchers measure?

The main focus was on how many days people worked in regular jobs over one year. They also looked at:
- How long people kept their jobs
- Total days in any paid work
- Time it took to find a first job
- Quality of life and satisfaction

## What did they find?

The review included 14 studies with 2,265 people total. Key findings showed:

- **More people got jobs**: Those in supported employment were about 3 times more likely to find work compared to other approaches
- **Longer employment**: People worked an average of 71 more days in regular jobs
- **Faster job placement**: People found their first job about 162 days sooner

However, the quality of evidence was rated as ""very low,"" meaning these results should be interpreted with caution.

## What does this mean?

Supported employment may help people with severe mental illness find and keep jobs better than other approaches. However, more high-quality, long-term studies are needed to confirm these benefits last over time.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the trial review

What was the goal?
- To see if supported employment helps adults with severe mental health conditions get and keep regular, paid jobs.
- To check if following the IPS model closely makes a difference, and if adding other services helps.

Who was in the studies?
- Adults ages 16 to 70 with severe mental health conditions.
- 14 randomized controlled trials with 2,265 people.

What is the intervention?
- Supported employment (often the IPS model): helps people find competitive jobs quickly and provides on-the-job support.
- Compared to other vocational programs or usual care.

What outcomes were measured?
- Getting any competitive job
- Days or weeks worked in paid jobs
- How long a job was kept (job tenure)
- Time to first competitive job
- Other areas: overall functioning, mental health, quality of life, satisfaction, and costs

Main findings (about 1 year follow-up)
- More people got competitive jobs with supported employment than with other approaches.
- People in supported employment worked more days and kept jobs longer.
- They got their first competitive job faster.
- Results across studies were mixed in quality, and many data were hard to combine. Overall evidence quality was very low.

Safety
- Harms or safety issues were not clearly reported.

Timing
- Studies generally followed people for about one year.
- The review searched for studies up to February 2010.

Bottom line
- Supported employment, especially IPS, likely helps people get and keep regular jobs more than other services.
- Because study quality was low and follow-up was short, better and longer studies are needed to confirm how strong and lasting these benefits are."
137,"Background
Congenital heart disease (ConHD) affects approximately 1% of all live births. People with ConHD are living longer due to improved medical intervention and are at risk of developing non‐communicable diseases. Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is reduced in people with ConHD, who deteriorate faster compared to healthy people. CRF is known to be prognostic of future mortality and morbidity: it is therefore important to assess the evidence base on physical activity interventions in this population to inform decision making. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of all types of physical activity interventions versus standard care in individuals with congenital heart disease. 
Search methods
We undertook a systematic search on 23 September 2019 of the following databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, BIOSIS Citation Index, Web of Science Core Collection, LILACS and DARE. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and we reviewed the reference lists of relevant systematic reviews. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) that compared any type of physical activity intervention against a 'no physical activity' (usual care) control. We included all individuals with a diagnosis of congenital heart disease, regardless of age or previous medical interventions.  
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors (CAW and CW) independently screened all the identified references for inclusion. We retrieved and read all full papers; and we contacted study authors if we needed any further information. The same two independent reviewers who extracted the data then processed the included papers, assessed their risk of bias using RoB 2 and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. The primary outcomes were: maximal cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) assessed by peak oxygen consumption; health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) determined by a validated questionnaire; and device‐worn ‘objective’ measures of physical activity. 
Main results
We included 15 RCTs with 924 participants in the review. The median intervention length/follow‐up length was 12 weeks (12 to 26 interquartile range (IQR)). There were five RCTs of children and adolescents (n = 500) and 10 adult RCTs (n = 424). We identified three types of intervention: physical activity promotion; exercise training; and inspiratory muscle training. We assessed the risk of bias of results for CRF as either being of some concern (n = 12) or at a high risk of bias (n = 2), due to a failure to blind intervention staff. One study did not report this outcome. Using the GRADE method, we assessed the certainty of evidence as moderate to very low across measured outcomes. 
When we pooled all types of interventions (physical activity promotion, exercise training and inspiratory muscle training), compared to a 'no exercise' control CRF may slightly increase, with a mean difference (MD) of 1.89 mL.kg−1.min−1 (95% CI −0.22 to 3.99; n = 732; moderate‐certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of physical activity and exercise interventions on HRQoL. There was a standardised mean difference (SMD) of 0.76 (95% CI −0.13 to 1.65; n = 163; very low certainty evidence) in HRQoL. However, we could pool only three studies in a meta‐analysis, due to different ways of reporting. Only one study out of eight showed a positive effect on HRQoL. There may be a small improvement in mean daily physical activity (PA) (SMD 0.38, 95% CI −0.15 to 0.92; n = 328; low‐certainty evidence), which equates to approximately an additional 10 minutes of physical activity daily (95% CI −2.50 to 22.20). 
Physical activity and exercise interventions likely result in an increase in submaximal cardiorespiratory fitness (assessed with VO2 mL.kg‐1.min‐1 at the gas exchange threshold; MD 2.05, 95% CI 0.05 to 4.05; n = 179; moderate‐certainty evidence). Physical activity and exercise interventions likely increase muscular strength (measured by maximal voluntary contraction of knee extensions; MD 17.13, 95% CI 3.45 to 30.81; n = 18; moderate‐certainty evidence). Eleven studies (n = 501) reported on the outcome of adverse events (73% of total studies). Of the 11 studies, six studies reported zero adverse events. Five studies reported a total of 11 adverse events; 36% of adverse events were cardiac related (n = 4); there were, however, no serious adverse events related to the interventions or reported fatalities (moderate‐certainty evidence). No studies reported hospital admissions. 
Authors' conclusions
This review summarises the latest evidence on CRF, HRQoL and PA. Although there were only small improvements in CRF and PA, and small to no improvements in HRQoL, there were no reported serious adverse events related to the interventions. Although these data are promising, there is currently insufficient evidence to definitively determine the impact of physical activity interventions in ConHD. Further high‐quality randomised controlled trials are therefore needed, utilising a longer duration of follow‐up.","Physical activity interventions for people with congenital heart disease
Review question
This review aimed to gather evidence for the use of any physical activity intervention for people with congenital heart disease. We aimed to compare interventions including exercise training, physical activity promotion or lung training with no intervention (usual care). 
Background
Congenital heart disease is the term used for a range of birth defects that affect how the heart works. People with congenital heart disease have reduced life expectancy, physical fitness and quality of life. However, due to better prenatal diagnoses, surgical procedures (often performed in the early years of life) and earlier interventions, the survival rate for those born with this disease has improved dramatically, such that most people will now live into adulthood. Exercise training and physical activity interventions are known to improve fitness, physical activity, survival and quality of life in healthy people, but it is not clear how effective these programmes are for people with long‐term medical conditions. 
Study characteristics
We searched for studies in September 2019 and identified 15 studies involving 924 participants. The studies used three main types of interventions, including programmes designed to increase physical activity, aerobic fitness and health‐related quality of life and compared physical activity intervention and control interventions in people with congenital heart disease.  
Key results
We included 15 trials with 924 participants. Half of the participants were female. Of the 15 trials, 5 used a total of 500 young people (less than 18 years of age) and 10 trials used a total of 424 adult participants. We found that physical fitness and physical activity may slightly increase but we are very uncertain about quality of life. There is currently no data to say if this small increase in fitness will result in fewer visits to the hospital. But there were no recorded deaths or serious events that were related to participation in physical activity. 
Quality of evidence
Using a validated scientific approach (GRADE), the certainty in the evidence base was moderate for fitness, low for physical activity and very low for quality of life. Most outcomes were limited due to small study participant numbers and poor reporting of study details.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Physical Activity Programs for People with Congenital Heart Disease

## What was this study about?

Researchers reviewed studies to see if physical activity programs help people born with heart problems (congenital heart disease). About 1 in 100 babies are born with these heart conditions. Thanks to better medical care, people with congenital heart disease are living longer, but they often have lower fitness levels than others and may lose fitness faster as they age.

## What did the researchers look for?

The research team searched medical databases in September 2019 for studies that tested physical activity programs. They looked for studies that compared people who did physical activity programs to those who received usual care. They included people of all ages with congenital heart disease.

## What did they find?

The review included 15 studies with 924 people total. Five studies involved children and teens (500 people), and 10 studies involved adults (424 people). Most programs lasted about 12 weeks. The programs included:
- Encouragement to be more physically active
- Structured exercise training
- Breathing muscle training

## What were the results?

**Fitness:** People in physical activity programs showed small improvements in fitness levels compared to those receiving usual care.

**Daily Activity:** Participants may have increased their daily physical activity by about 10 minutes per day, though results varied.

**Quality of Life:** The effect on quality of life was unclear. Only 3 of 8 studies could be compared, and results were mixed.

**Strength:** Programs likely improved muscle strength.

**Safety:** Eleven studies reported on safety. Six studies had no problems. Five studies reported 11 minor issues total, with 4 related to the heart. There were no serious problems or deaths related to the programs.

## What does this mean?

Physical activity programs appear safe for people with congenital heart disease and may provide small improvements in fitness and daily activity. However, more research with longer follow-up periods is needed to better understand the benefits.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the research

What was studied
- Researchers reviewed clinical trials to see if physical activity programs help people with congenital heart disease (ConHD) improve fitness, daily activity, and quality of life, and to check safety.

Who was included
- 15 randomized controlled trials with 924 people who had ConHD.
- Both children/teens (5 trials; 500 people) and adults (10 trials; 424 people).

What activities were tested
- Physical activity promotion (coaching, education, activity goals)
- Exercise training (supervised or structured workouts)
- Breathing muscle (inspiratory) training

How long did programs last
- Most programs and follow-up lasted about 12 weeks (range roughly 12–26 weeks).

Main outcomes measured
- Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), often by peak oxygen use (VO2)
- Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using questionnaires
- Daily physical activity using wearable devices
- Submaximal fitness and muscle strength
- Safety (adverse events, hospital stays)

What the review found
- CRF: Small improvement compared with usual care (about 1.9 mL/kg/min higher peak VO2 on average). Certainty: moderate.
- Daily physical activity: Small increase, about 10 more minutes per day on average. Certainty: low.
- Quality of life: Effect is unclear; results varied and were based on few studies. Certainty: very low.
- Submaximal fitness: Likely improved. Certainty: moderate.
- Muscle strength: Likely improved (knee extension strength). Certainty: moderate.

Safety
- 11 studies (501 people) reported safety.
- 6 studies reported no adverse events.
- 5 studies reported 11 total adverse events; about one-third were heart-related.
- No serious adverse events linked to the programs and no deaths. No hospitalizations were reported.
- Overall safety certainty: moderate.

What this means
- Physical activity programs for people with ConHD may bring small gains in fitness and daily activity, with no serious safety concerns reported.
- Effects on quality of life are uncertain.
- More high-quality, longer studies are needed to know the true benefits and to guide care."
138,"Background
Anthracycline‐containing regimens (ACR) are the most prevalent regimens in the management of patients with advanced follicular lymphoma (FL). However, there is no proof that they are superior to non‐anthracycline‐containing regimens (non‐ACR). 
Objectives
To compare the efficacy of ACRs to other chemotherapy regimens, in the treatment of FL. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 3), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2013), smaller databases, relevant conference proceedings (2004 to 2012) and the National Medical Library (April 2013). 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ACR with non‐ACR for adult patients with FL. We excluded trials in which immunotherapy, radiotherapy alone or stem‐cell transplantation were used in one arm alone. Our primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Secondary outcomes included disease control, as measured by progression‐free survival (PFS) or remission duration (RD). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors assessed the quality of trials and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We analyzed trials separately according to resemblance of the chemotherapeutic regimens in study arms, other than the addition of anthracyclines ('same' versus 'different' chemotherapy). Hazard ratios (HR) and risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated and pooled using the fixed‐effect model. 
Main results
Eight RCTs, conducted between 1974 and 2011, and involving 2636 patients were included in this meta‐analysis. All trials included therapy‐naive patients. Rituximab was used in one trial only. Follow‐up was between three and five years in most trials (range three to 18 years). All trials were published in peer‐reviewed journals. 
Five trials compared similar chemotherapeutic regimens, except for the anthracycline. In three studies reporting overall survival specifically in FL patients, there was no statistically significant difference between ACR and non‐ACR arms (HR 0.99; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.29; I2 = 0%). ACR significantly improved disease control (HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.81; four trials). Progression or relapse at three years were reduced (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.85). Anthracyclines did not significantly increase rates of complete response (RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.18) or overall response (RR 1.06; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.12), but heterogeneity was substantial. 
Overall, ACR were more often associated with cytopenias, but not with serious infections or death related to chemotherapy. Cardiotoxicity, albeit rare, was associated with anthracycline use (RR 4.55; 95% CI 0.92 to 22.49; four trials). 
Three trials added anthracycline to one arm of two different regimens. None showed benefit to ACR regarding OS, yet there was a trend in favor of anthracyclines for disease control. Results were heterogeneous. 
We judged the overall quality of these trials as moderate as all are unblinded, some are outdated and are not uniform in outcome definitions. 
Authors' conclusions
The use of anthracyclines in patients with FL has no demonstrable benefit on overall survival, although it may have been mitigated by the more intense regimens given in the control arms of three of five trials. ACR improved disease control, as measured by PFS and RD with an increased risk for side effects, notably cardiotoxicity. The current evidence on the added value of ACR in the management of FL is limited. Further studies involving immunotherapy during induction and maintenance may change conclusion.","Anthracyclines in the treatment of follicular lymphoma (FL) in adults
FL is the most common indolent non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). It is a slowly progressive disease, with a risk of transformation to a more aggressive lymphoma. Advanced disease (stage III and IV) has been considered incurable. However, in recent years, the use of combination therapy and treatment with the monoclonal anti‐CD20 antibody rituximab, have prolonged survival and decreased transformation rate, and is now considered standard of care in FL patients. One of the most common chemotherapies used in the treatment of FL is the combination of rituximab with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, adriamycin, prednisone (R‐CHOP), which contains an anthracycline (adriamycin). Other anthracycline‐containing regimens (ACR) have also been used to treat FL patients. However, there is no proof that ACRs are better than non‐anthracycline‐containing regimens (non‐ACRs), and there are no standard guidelines for the initial treatment of advanced FL. Importantly, anthracyclines have serious side effects, notably a decrease in blood counts and potential damage to the heart, depending on the dose. 
The aim of this systematic review and meta‐analysis was to examine if there is a benefit in the use of anthracyclines for patients with FL. We looked at overall survival (OS); measures of disease control; response rates; and side effects. 
We found eight randomized controlled trials, of which five compared similar chemotherapy regimens in both trial arms, except for the anthracycline. Even among these five trials, three included more intense chemotherapy in the control arm. Most trials were conducted in the 1980s and 1990s. Only one of them included rituximab as part of the chemotherapy regimen. Almost all patients were treatment‐naive with advanced disease. Follow‐up ranged between three and five years in most trials. The main results from this set of trials are. 
1. There is no evidence that OS is prolonged with the use of anthracyclines, although it may have been hampered by the more intense regimens given in the control arms of three of five trials. 
2. Anthracyclines improved disease control. Concordantly, less patients progressed or relapsed within three years of treatment with ACR. 
3. There is no statistically significant difference in complete or overall response rates. 
4. Qualitatively, more side effects were reported with ACR, myelotoxicity and cardiotoxicity included. 
This evidence is limited, mainly due to disparities in regimens between control and study arms, but also since most included trials were conducted over one to two decades ago, and only one employed rituximab. Importantly, results from this study were in agreement with pooled‐outcomes from trials of the pre‐rituximab era. 
It is essential to find the optimal chemotherapeutic regimen in conjunction with rituximab and other novel agents, and understand the role of anthracyclines in this combination, especially with current methods that are able to reduce their toxicity. With longer follow‐up periods we may better understand whether improved disease control will eventually translate to an increase in survival.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Chemotherapy Treatments for Follicular Lymphoma

Researchers reviewed existing studies to see whether chemotherapy drugs called anthracyclines help people with follicular lymphoma (a type of blood cancer) live longer or control their disease better compared to chemotherapy without anthracyclines.

## Who was studied?

The review included 2,636 adults with follicular lymphoma who had not received treatment before. The information came from 8 studies conducted between 1974 and 2011.

## What treatments were compared?

- **Group 1**: Chemotherapy that included anthracycline drugs
- **Group 2**: Chemotherapy without anthracycline drugs

Most studies followed patients for 3 to 5 years (some up to 18 years).

## What did researchers find?

**Survival:** Adding anthracyclines to chemotherapy did not help patients live longer overall.

**Disease Control:** Anthracyclines did help slow down the cancer. After 3 years, fewer patients in the anthracycline group had their cancer grow or come back compared to those without anthracyclines.

**Side Effects:** Anthracyclines caused more problems with blood cell counts and rare heart problems. However, serious infections and treatment-related deaths were similar in both groups.

## What does this mean?

While anthracyclines may help keep cancer under control for a period of time, they don't appear to help people live longer and come with additional side effects, particularly affecting the heart. The evidence is limited, and newer treatments may change these findings.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

Purpose
- To see if chemotherapy plans that include an anthracycline work better than plans without an anthracycline for adults with follicular lymphoma.

Who was studied
- Adults with newly treated (no prior therapy) follicular lymphoma.
- Across 8 randomized studies done from 1974 to 2011, with 2,636 patients.
- Most studies followed people for about 3 to 5 years (range 3 to 18 years).
- Only one study used rituximab.

Treatments compared
- Anthracycline-containing regimens (ACR) vs non-anthracycline regimens (non-ACR).
- Some trials compared very similar chemo plans except for the anthracycline; others compared different plans.

Key outcomes measured
- Primary: Overall survival (how long people lived).
- Secondary: Disease control (progression-free survival or remission duration), response rates, and side effects.

Main results
- Overall survival: No clear difference between ACR and non-ACR.
- Disease control: ACR improved time without the cancer getting worse or coming back.
- Response rates: No meaningful difference in complete or overall response rates.

Safety
- Blood count problems (cytopenias) were more common with ACR.
- Serious infections and deaths related to treatment were not increased with ACR.
- Heart problems (cardiotoxicity) were rare but happened more often with ACR.

Timeframe and quality
- Studies were older and not blinded, and some measured outcomes differently.
- Overall evidence quality was judged moderate.

What this means
- Adding an anthracycline did not help people live longer.
- It did help keep the disease under control longer but caused more side effects, especially low blood counts and rare heart problems.
- More up-to-date studies, including modern treatments, are needed."
139,"Background
Constipation is a common symptom experienced during pregnancy. It has a range of consequences from reduced quality of life and perception of physical health to haemorrhoids. An understanding of the effectiveness and safety of treatments for constipation in pregnancy is important for the clinician managing pregnant women. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions (pharmacological and non‐pharmacological) for treating constipation in pregnancy. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 April 2015), ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (30 April 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
We considered all published, unpublished and ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs and quasi‐RCTs, evaluating interventions (pharmacological and non‐pharmacological) for constipation in pregnancy. Cross‐over studies were not eligible for inclusion in this review. Trials published in abstract form only (without full text publication) were not eligible for inclusion. 
We compared one intervention (pharmacological or non‐pharmacological) against another intervention, placebo or no treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. 
Main results
Four studies were included, but only two studies with a total of 180 women contributed data to this review. It was not clear whether they were RCTs or quasi‐RCTs because the sequence generation was unclear. We classified the overall risk of bias of three studies as moderate and one study as high risk of bias. No meta‐analyses were carried out due to insufficient data. 
There were no cluster‐RCTs identified for inclusion. Comparisons were available for stimulant laxatives versus bulk‐forming laxatives, and fibre supplementation versus no intervention. There were no data available for any other comparisons. 
During the review process we found that studies reported changes in symptoms in different ways. To capture all data available, we added a new primary outcome (improvement in constipation) ‐ this new outcome was not prespecified in our published protocol. 
Stimulant laxatives versus bulk‐forming laxatives 
No data were identified for any of this review's prespecified primary outcomes: pain on defecation, frequency of stools and consistency of stools. 
Compared to bulk‐forming laxatives, pregnant women who received stimulant laxatives (Senokot or Normax) had an improvement in constipation (risk ratio (RR) 1.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21 to 2.09; 140 women, one study, moderate quality of evidence), but also had more abdominal discomfort (RR 2.33, 95% CI 1.15 to 4.73; 140 women, one study, low quality of evidence), and a borderline difference in diarrhoea (RR 4.50, 95% CI 1.01 to 20.09; 140 women, one study, moderate quality of evidence). In addition, there was no clear difference in women's satisfaction (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.46; 140 women, one study, moderate quality of evidence). 
One of the stimulant laxatives, Normax (dioctyl sodium sulphosuccinate and dihydroxy anthraquinone) is no longer used for the treatment of constipation in pregnant women (and the package information advises that it should not be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding). We therefore carried out a non‐prespecified sensitivity analysis with the data for Senokot and Normax presented separately. Results for Senokot and Normax were very similar, thus results for the individual drugs largely reflected findings for the combined analysis, although when individual drugs were compared with bulk‐forming laxatives there was no longer a clear difference between groups in terms of abdominal discomfort and diarrhoea. 
No usable data were identified for any of this review's secondary outcomes: quality of life; dehydration; electrolyte imbalance; acute allergic reaction; or asthma. 
Fibre supplementation versus no intervention 
Pregnant women who received fibre supplementation had a higher frequency of stools compared to no intervention (mean difference (MD) 2.24 times per week, 95% CI 0.96 to 3.52; 40 women, one study, moderate quality of evidence). Fibre supplementation was associated with improved stool consistency as defined by trialists (hard stool decreased by 11% to 14%, normal stool increased by 5% to 10%, and loose stool increased by 0% to 6%). 
No usable data were reported for either the primary outcomes of pain on defecation and improvement in constipation or any of this review's secondary outcomes as listed above. 
Quality 
Five outcomes were assessed with the GRADE software: improvement in constipation, frequency of stools, abdominal discomfort, diarrhoea and women's satisfaction. These were assessed to be of moderate quality except for abdominal discomfort which was assessed to be of low quality. The results should therefore be interpreted with caution. There were no data available for evaluation of pain on defecation or consistency of stools. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to comprehensively assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions (pharmacological and non‐pharmacological) for treating constipation in pregnancy, due to limited data (few studies with small sample size and no meta‐analyses). Compared with bulk‐forming laxatives, stimulant laxatives appear to be more effective in improvement of constipation (moderate quality evidence), but are accompanied by an increase in diarrhoea (moderate quality evidence) and abdominal discomfort (low quality evidence) and no difference in women's satisfaction (moderate quality evidence). Additionally, fibre supplementation may increase frequency of stools compared with no intervention (moderate quality evidence), although these results were of moderate risk of bias. 
There were no data for a comparison of other types of interventions, such as osmotic laxatives, stool softeners, lubricant laxatives and enemas and suppositories. 
More RCTs evaluating interventions for treating constipation in pregnancy are needed. These should cover different settings and evaluate the effectiveness of various interventions (including fibre, osmotic, and stimulant laxatives) on improvement in constipation, pain on defecation, frequency of stools and consistency of stools.","Interventions for treating constipation in pregnancy
What is the issue? 
The term 'constipation' is defined as difficulty in passing stool and reduced frequency of bowel movements. It is characterised by discomfort, excessive straining, hard or lumpy stools, a sensation of incomplete evacuation, and infrequent bowel movements. Constipation is a common symptom experienced during pregnancy. This can result from a combination of factors, including changes in hormones during pregnancy affecting the digestive system, reduced physical activity and changes in dietary habits during pregnancy. In addition, as the baby grows it can press on the mother's intestines and cause digestive delays/obstructions. 
Why is this important? 
Constipation during pregnancy is associated with impaired quality of life and distress for pregnant women as well as physical problems including, occasionally, haemorrhoids. There are a range of suggested treatments with drugs, supplements or dietary modifications. 
Generally, non‐pharmacological interventions (changes in diet, water intake and exercise) are recommended initially, followed by pharmacological interventions if the non‐pharmacological interventions fail or are insufficient. Pharmacological interventions include medications from a wide range of drug classes including lubricants, bulk‐forming agents, osmotic laxatives, stimulant laxatives, stool softeners, and enemas and suppositories. 
This review looked at the benefits of drug and non‐drug interventions for constipation in pregnancy and whether they are safe for women and babies. 
What evidence did we find? 
We identified four studies, but only two studies (with a total of 180 women) provided data for analysis.The studies looked at stimulant laxatives compared with bulk‐forming laxatives and dietary fibre supplementation versus no intervention. The included studies were judged to be of moderate quality. 
We looked at two main comparisons. In the first, we found that stimulant laxatives may be more effective in improving constipation than bulk‐forming laxatives (moderate quality evidence) but may also cause more abdominal discomfort (low quality evidence) and diarrhoea (moderate quality evidence) and we found no difference in women's satisfaction (moderate quality evidence). However, when we removed data relating to an intervention called Normax (dioctyl sodium sulphosuccinate and dihydroxy anthraquinone), which is no longer routinely used in pregnancy, there was no longer a clear difference between stimulant and bulk‐forming laxatives in terms of abdominal discomfort and diarrhoea. 
The second comparison, between fibre supplementation and no intervention, found that fibre supplementation may be effective in increasing the frequency of stools (moderate quality evidence). Fibre supplementation was associated with improved stool consistency as defined by trialists (hard stool decreased by 11% to 14%, normal stool increased by 5% to 10%, and loose stool increased by 0% to 6%). 
There were no studies that looked at others types of interventions like osmotic laxatives, stool softeners, lubricant laxatives and enemas and suppositories. 
What does this mean? 
What little evidence there is, suggests that dietary fibre supplementation may increase the frequency of stools. If choosing between stimulant and bulk‐forming laxatives, then stimulant may relieve constipation better but may cause more abdominal discomfort and diarrhoea. 
More research in this area is needed.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Treatments for Constipation During Pregnancy

## What is this review about?

Constipation is a common problem during pregnancy that can affect a woman's quality of life and overall health. Researchers wanted to find out which treatments work best and are safe for pregnant women who experience constipation.

## What did the researchers look for?

The researchers searched for studies that tested different treatments for constipation in pregnancy. These treatments included:
- Medications (laxatives)
- Non-medication approaches (like fiber supplements)

They looked for studies published up to April 2015.

## What did they find?

The researchers found only 4 studies that met their criteria, and only 2 of these studies (with 180 pregnant women total) provided usable information. This is a very small amount of evidence.

### Two types of treatments were compared:

**1. Stimulant laxatives compared to bulk-forming laxatives** (140 women in one study)

Stimulant laxatives (like Senokot) worked better at relieving constipation than bulk-forming laxatives. However, women taking stimulant laxatives experienced more side effects:
- More abdominal discomfort
- More diarrhea
- Similar satisfaction levels between both types

**2. Fiber supplements compared to no treatment** (40 women in one study)

Women who took fiber supplements had more bowel movements per week (about 2 more times per week) compared to women who didn't take anything. Their stool consistency also improved.

## What does this mean?

There isn't enough evidence to make strong recommendations about the best treatments for constipation during pregnancy. The studies were small and limited in number. Based on the available information:
- Stimulant laxatives may work better than bulk-forming laxatives but can cause uncomfortable side effects
- Fiber supplements may help increase bowel movements

More research with larger groups of pregnant women is needed to better understand which treatments work best and are safest during pregnancy.",0,Plano,"Plain Language Summary: Treatments for Constipation in Pregnancy

What was studied
- Goal: To see how well different treatments help with constipation during pregnancy and how safe they are.
- Who: Pregnant people with constipation.
- What was checked: Medicines (like stimulant and bulk-forming laxatives) and non-medicine options (like added fiber).
- When: Studies found up to April 30, 2015.

How the research was done
- Type of studies: Randomized or similar trials.
- Studies included: 4 total; only 2 (180 women) had usable data.
- Overall evidence quality: Mostly moderate, some low. Results should be viewed with caution because studies were small and limited.

Treatments tested and key results
1) Stimulant laxatives (such as Senokot) vs bulk-forming laxatives
- Helped more with constipation than bulk-forming laxatives (moderate-quality evidence).
- More side effects: more stomach discomfort (low-quality evidence) and more diarrhea (moderate-quality evidence).
- No clear difference in how satisfied women felt (moderate-quality evidence).
- Note: One stimulant product studied (Normax) is no longer advised in pregnancy or breastfeeding.

2) Fiber supplements vs no treatment
- Led to more bowel movements each week (moderate-quality evidence).
- Stool consistency improved (fewer hard stools; more normal stools).
- Not enough data on pain with bowel movements or overall improvement.

Outcomes the review looked for
- Main: Pain during bowel movements, how often bowel movements happen, stool consistency, overall improvement in constipation.
- Safety: Stomach discomfort, diarrhea, dehydration, electrolyte problems, allergic reactions, asthma.
- Many outcomes had little or no usable data.

Safety
- Stimulant laxatives may work better but can cause more stomach discomfort and diarrhea.
- Fiber supplements seemed helpful for frequency and consistency.
- No strong data on serious side effects from the included studies, but evidence is limited.

What’s missing
- No data on other treatments like osmotic laxatives, stool softeners, lubricants, enemas, or suppositories.
- More and better trials are needed to compare different options and to measure pain, frequency, stool consistency, overall improvement, and safety.

Bottom line
- For pregnant people with constipation, stimulant laxatives may relieve symptoms more than bulk-forming laxatives but may cause more side effects.
- Adding fiber may help increase bowel movements and improve stool consistency.
- Talk with a healthcare provider about options and safety in pregnancy, since the current evidence is limited."
140,"Background
Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common bacterial infection that can lead to significant morbidity including stricture, abscess formation, fistula, bacteraemia, sepsis, pyelonephritis and kidney dysfunction. Mortality rates are reported to be as high as 1% in men and 3% in women due to development of pyelonephritis. Because probiotic therapy is readily available without a prescription, a review of their efficacy in the prevention of UTI may aid consumers in making informed decisions about potential prophylactic therapy. Institutions and caregivers also need evidence‐based synopses of current evidence to make informed patient care decisions. 
Objectives
Compared to placebo or no therapy, did probiotics (any formulation) provide a therapeutic advantage in terms of morbidity and mortality, when used to prevent UTI in susceptible patient populations? 
Compared to other prophylactic interventions, including drug and non‐drug measures (e.g. continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, topical oestrogen, cranberry juice), did probiotics (any formulation) provide a therapeutic advantage in terms of morbidity and mortality when used to prevent UTIs in susceptible patient populations? 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 21 September 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co‐ordinator using search terms relevant to this review. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of susceptible patients (e.g. past history of UTI) or healthy people in which any strain, formulation, dose or frequency of probiotic was compared to placebo or active comparators were included. 
Data collection and analysis
All RCTs and quasi‐RCTs (RCTs in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) looking at comparing probiotics to no therapy, placebo, or other prophylactic interventions were included. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random‐effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. 
Main results
We included nine studies that involved 735 people in this review. Four studies compared probiotic with placebo, two compared probiotic with no treatment, two compared probiotics with antibiotics in patients with UTI, and one study compared probiotic with placebo in healthy women. All studies aimed to measure differences in rates of recurrent UTI. 
Our risk of bias assessment found that most studies had small sample sizes and reported insufficient methodological detail to enable robust assessment. Overall, there was a high risk of bias in the included studies which lead to inability to draw firm conclusions and suggesting that any reported treatment effects may be misleading or represent overestimates. 
We found no significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI between patients treated with probiotics and placebo (6 studies, 352 participants: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.12; I2 = 23%) with wide confidence intervals, and statistical heterogeneity was low. No significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI was found between probiotic and antibiotic treated patients (1 study, 223 participants: RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.33). 
The most commonly reported adverse effects were diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, constipation and vaginal symptoms. None of the included studies reported numbers of participants with at least one asymptomatic bacterial UTI, all‐cause mortality or those with at least one confirmed case of bacteraemia or fungaemia. Two studies reported study withdrawal due to adverse events and the number of participants who experienced at least one adverse event. One study reported withdrawal occurred in six probiotic participants (5.2%), 15 antibiotic participants (12.2%), while the second study noted one placebo group participant discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. 
Authors' conclusions
No significant benefit was demonstrated for probiotics compared with placebo or no treatment, but a benefit cannot be ruled out as the data were few, and derived from small studies with poor methodological reporting. 
There was limited information on harm and mortality with probiotics and no evidence on the impact of probiotics on serious adverse events. Current evidence cannot rule out a reduction or increase in recurrent UTI in women with recurrent UTI who use prophylactic probiotics. There was insufficient evidence from one RCT to comment on the effect of probiotics versus antibiotics.","Probiotics for preventing urinary tract infections in adults and children
Background 
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) occur in kidneys, ureters, urethra or bladder. UTIs are one of the most common bacterial infections and can lead to other health problems. 
Probiotics (live micro‐organisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host) are thought to work by preventing other infectious bacteria from climbing up the urinary tract and causing infection. We were interested in studying any form of probiotics (bacteria used to change balance of bacteria) compared with no treatment, antibiotics, hormone therapy, cranberry juice or other interventions in people at risk of UTI. To assess if probiotics were effective, we planned to measure how many people had recurrent UTIs. 
Study characteristics 
We conducted a literature search up to September 2015 and nine studies were eligible for inclusion according to our selection criteria. The nine studies reported data on 735 participants and investigated probiotics for preventing UTI: seven studies involved women or girls with recurrent UTIs, one looked at children with abnormal urinary tracts, and one investigated UTI in healthy women. 
Key results 
Generally, studies were poor quality with high risk of bias. Aside from the different populations, there were also many different species of probiotics used, different dosage forms such as vaginal and oral, and probiotics were given for varying lengths of time. All of these factors may have affected our results. 
Most studies did not collect information on adverse effects so we were unable to estimate any harms associated with probiotic therapies. We found no significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI between patients treated with probiotics and placebo and no significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI was found between probiotic and patients treated with antibiotics. 
Quality of the evidence 
The currently available evidence shows no reduction in UTI using probiotics.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Probiotics for Preventing Urinary Tract Infections

## What was this review about?

Researchers wanted to know if probiotics (beneficial bacteria found in supplements and some foods) can help prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in people who are prone to getting them. UTIs are common bacterial infections that can cause serious health problems if they spread to the kidneys or bloodstream.

## Why is this important?

Since probiotics are easy to buy without a prescription, people need clear information about whether they actually work to prevent UTIs. This helps consumers and healthcare providers make better decisions about prevention options.

## What did the researchers do?

They reviewed 9 studies that included 735 people total. The studies compared probiotics to:
- Placebo (inactive treatment)
- No treatment
- Antibiotics
- One study looked at healthy women

All studies tracked whether people got repeat UTIs.

## What did they find?

- **Probiotics vs. placebo:** No clear difference in preventing repeat UTIs (6 studies, 352 people)
- **Probiotics vs. antibiotics:** No clear difference in preventing repeat UTIs (1 study, 223 people)
- **Side effects:** Some people reported diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and vaginal symptoms
- **Study quality:** Most studies were small and didn't provide enough details about how they were conducted, making the results less reliable

## What does this mean?

The evidence doesn't show that probiotics clearly prevent UTIs, but it also doesn't prove they don't work. The studies were too small and not well-designed enough to give a definite answer. More research with larger, better-designed studies is needed.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the clinical trial review

What was studied
- Do probiotics help prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in people who often get them?
- Do probiotics work better than placebo, no treatment, or other prevention methods like antibiotics?

Who was included
- 9 randomized studies with 735 people.
- Most were adults with a history of repeated UTIs; one study included healthy women.

What treatments were tested
- Probiotics (any type, dose, or schedule).
- Compared with placebo, no treatment, or antibiotics.

What outcomes were measured
- Main: getting another symptomatic bacterial UTI.
- Also planned: bloodstream infection, death, and other harms. (Most studies did not report these.)

Key results
- Probiotics vs placebo or no treatment: No clear reduction in repeat UTIs. Results were uncertain.
- Probiotics vs antibiotics (one study): No clear difference in repeat UTIs.
- Because studies were small and methods were weak, we cannot be sure of any benefit or lack of benefit.

Safety
- Reported side effects: diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and vaginal symptoms.
- Few studies reported safety in detail. No clear data on serious harms, bloodstream infections, or deaths.
- Study withdrawals due to side effects: 6 of 116 on probiotics (about 5%), 15 of 123 on antibiotics (about 12%) in one study; 1 person stopped placebo in another study.

Study quality and limits
- Many studies were small and did not report methods clearly.
- This creates a high risk of biased results and makes firm conclusions difficult.

Timing
- Evidence was gathered up to September 21, 2015.

Bottom line
- Current evidence does not show that probiotics clearly prevent repeat UTIs, and it does not show clear harm.
- We need larger, well-designed studies that report benefits and risks, including serious side effects."
141,"Background
Opioid dependence (OD) is an increasing clinical and public health problem worldwide. International guidelines recommend opioid substitution treatment (OST), such as methadone and buprenorphine, as first‐line medication treatment for OD. A negative aspect of OST is that the medication used can be diverted both through sale on the black market, and the unsanctioned use of medications. Daily supervised administration of medications used in OST has the advantage of reducing the risk of diversion, and may promote therapeutic engagement, potentially enhancing the psychosocial aspect of OST, but costs more and is more restrictive on the client than dispensing for off‐site consumption. 
Objectives
The objective of this systematic review is to compare the effectiveness of OST with supervised dosing relative to dispensing of medication for off‐site consumption. 
Search methods
We searched in Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialised Register and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science from inception up to April 2016. Ongoing and unpublished studies were searched via ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/). 
All searches included non‐English language literature. We handsearched references on topic‐related systematic reviews. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), and prospective controlled cohort studies, involving people who are receiving OST (methadone, buprenorphine) and comparing supervised dosing with dispensing of medication to be consumed away from the dispensing point, usually without supervision. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
Six studies (four RCTs and two prospective observational cohort studies), involving 7999 participants comparing supervised OST treatment with unsupervised treatment, met the inclusion criteria. The risk of bias was generally moderate across trials, but the results reported on outcomes that we planned to consider were limited. Overall, we judged the quality of the evidence from very low to low for all the outcomes. 
We found no difference in retention at any duration with supervised compared to unsupervised dosing (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.12, 716 participants, four trials, low‐quality evidence) or in retention in the shortest follow‐up period, three months (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.05; 472 participants, three trials, low‐quality evidence). Additional data at 12 months from one observational study found no difference in retention between groups (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.14; n = 300).There was no difference in abstinence at the end of treatment (self‐reported drug use) (67% versus 60%, P = 0.33, 293 participants, one trial, very low‐quality evidence); and in diversion of medication (5% versus 2%, 293 participants, one trial, very low‐quality evidence). 
Regarding our secondary outcomes, we did not found a difference in the incidence of adverse effects in the supervised compared to unsupervised control group (RR 0.63; 96% CI 0.10 to 3.86; 363 participants, two trials, very low‐quality evidence). Data on severity of dependence were very limited (244 participants, one trial) and showed no difference between the two approaches. Data on deaths were reported in two studies. One trial reported two deaths in the supervised group (low‐quality evidence), while in the cohort study all‐cause mortality was found lower in regular supervision group (crude mortality rate 0.60 versus 0.81 per 100 person‐years), although after adjustment insufficient evidence existed to suggest that regular supervision was protective (mortality rate ratio = 1.23, 95% CI = 0.67 to 2.27). 
No studies reported pain symptoms, drug craving, aberrant opioid‐related behaviours, days of unsanctioned opioid use and overdose. 
Authors' conclusions
Take‐home medication strategies are attractive to treatment services due to lower costs, and place less restrictions on clients, but it is unknown whether they may be associated with increased risk of diversion and unsanctioned use of medication. There is uncertainty about the effects of supervised dosing compared with unsupervised medication due to the low and very low quality of the evidence for the primary outcomes of interest for this review. Data on defined secondary outcomes were similarly limited. More research comparing supervised and take‐home medication strategies is needed to support decisions on the relative effectiveness of these strategies. The trials should be designed and conducted with high quality and over a longer follow‐up period to support comparison of strategies at different stages of treatment. In particular, there is a need for studies assessing in more detail the risk of diversion and safety outcomes of using supervised OST to manage opioid dependence.","Supervised‐dosing strategies versus take‐home opioid substitution treatment for people dependent on opioid drugs 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of supervised dosing strategies in opioid substitution treatment for people dependent on opioid drugs. 
Background 
Opioid dependence (OD) is a global clinical and public health problem that is associated with significant burden of disease and drug‐related deaths. OD represents a complex health condition that usually requires long‐term treatment. International guidelines recommend opioid substitution treatment (OST), such as methadone and buprenorphine, as a first‐line treatment for OD. OST is a form of health care for people who are dependent on heroin, or who have become dependent after taking prescribed opioids for pain, and involves substitution of the drug that is being used inappropriately with a long‐acting opioid. OST gives people who are opioid dependent the opportunity to stabilise their lives, and to address the social and psychological dimensions that tend to accompany opioid dependence. A negative aspect of OST is that the medications used can be diverted, by being sold on the black market or used inappropriately. One strategy for minimising diversion is for OST medications to be administered under supervision (supervised dosing). With supervised dosing, access to unsupervised or take‐away doses of medication is then a privilege which can be used as a motivational and reward incentive. Supervised dosing is also associated with more frequent contact between the client and service provider offering more opportunities for therapeutic engagement. However, providing supervised dosing is more expensive for service providers, and more restrictive for clients who have to attend for dosing every day. The purpose of this review was to assess the effectiveness of supervised dosing, compared to dispensing of take‐home medication, in terms of reduction in heroin and other unsanctioned opioid use, retention in treatment, diversion of medication and adverse effects. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to April 2016.
Study characteristics 
We identified six studies involving 7999 people receiving treatment with methadone (7786 people) or buprenorphine–naloxone (213 people ) for opioid dependence. Four of the studies were randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), while the other two studies followed groups of people over time. Four of the studies were funded by the National Institutes for Health Research and by the Health Research Board, with one study not reporting the funding source. One study was also funded by the drug company of buprenorphine–naloxone. 
Key results 
At three or more months follow‐up, this review found no evidence on benefit of the supervised dosing with respect to keep people in treatment, or reduce opioid use, mortality reduction and adverse drug events. One study found that supervised dosing led to a reduction of diversion. None of the studies assessed the effect of supervised dosing on pain symptoms, drug craving, days of unsanctioned opioid use, overdose and hospitalisation. 
We are unable to make any conclusion about the effectiveness of supervised dosing compared to dispensing of medication as take‐home doses, in the context of OST. Further research is required to determine the effectiveness of supervised or take‐home dosing in OST. 
Quality of the evidence 
Overall, the studies were moderately well‐conducted, but there was a small number of studies reporting outcomes of interest, therefore insufficient to evaluate the efficacy of intervention such as diversion, opoid use reduction, retention in treatment and frequency of unsanctioned opioid use, Furthermore, low rates of occurrence of some events between studies resulted in the overall quality of the evidence being assessed as low and very low. This indicates that further evidence would be likely to change the estimates of relative effect made in this review.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Supervised vs. Take-Home Medication for Opioid Treatment

## What was this study about?

Researchers reviewed studies comparing two ways of giving medication to people receiving treatment for opioid dependence:
- **Supervised dosing**: Taking medication at a clinic or pharmacy while being watched by staff
- **Take-home medication**: Receiving medication to take at home without supervision

## Why does this matter?

Medications like methadone and buprenorphine help people with opioid dependence. However, these medications can sometimes be sold illegally or used in unintended ways. Supervised dosing may reduce these risks and help people stay engaged in treatment, but it costs more and requires daily clinic visits. Take-home medication is more convenient and less expensive but may carry different risks.

## What did the researchers find?

The review included 6 studies with nearly 8,000 participants. The evidence quality was low to very low, meaning the results are uncertain.

**Key findings:**
- **Staying in treatment**: No clear difference between supervised and take-home dosing
- **Drug use**: No clear difference in whether people continued using drugs
- **Medication misuse**: Very limited information, with no clear difference between groups
- **Side effects**: No clear difference in harmful effects
- **Deaths**: Very limited information from 2 studies, with unclear results

## What does this mean?

The researchers could not determine whether supervised or take-home medication works better because the available studies were limited and of low quality. More high-quality research is needed to help treatment programs decide which approach is best for different situations and stages of treatment.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What is this review about?
- This review looked at two ways to give medicines used in opioid substitution treatment (OST): 
  - Supervised dosing: taking methadone or buprenorphine under supervision at a clinic or pharmacy.
  - Take‑home dosing: getting doses to take away, usually without supervision.

Why was it done?
- Supervised dosing may reduce misuse and help people stay engaged, but it costs more and is more restrictive. The review compared how well supervised dosing works versus take‑home dosing.

Who and what was studied?
- People receiving OST with methadone or buprenorphine.
- 6 studies (4 randomized trials and 2 cohort studies) with 7,999 participants.
- Studies were found in several databases up to April 2016.

Main outcomes
- Staying in treatment (retention): No clear difference between supervised and take‑home dosing at about 3 months or up to 12 months.
- Not using other drugs (self‑report at end of treatment): No clear difference (based on one study).
- Diversion of medication (sharing or selling): No clear difference (based on one study).
- Side effects: No clear difference (based on two studies).
- Deaths: Results were limited and mixed; no clear conclusion.
- Not reported: pain, drug craving, unsafe opioid use days, overdose, or certain behaviors.

Timing
- Follow‑up ranged from about 3 months to 12 months, depending on the study.

Safety
- Based on limited data, side effects were similar in both groups. Death data were too limited to show a clear difference.

Quality of the evidence
- Overall evidence quality was low to very low. Results should be viewed with caution.

Bottom line
- We do not know if supervised dosing works better than take‑home dosing for OST. Take‑home dosing costs less and is less restrictive, but its impact on misuse is unclear. More high‑quality, longer studies are needed, especially on safety and diversion."
142,"Background
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is a disease that causes progressive or relapsing and remitting weakness and numbness. It is probably caused by an autoimmune process. Immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory drugs would be expected to be beneficial. This review was first published in 2003 and has been updated most recently in 2016. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive agents other than corticosteroids, immunoglobulin, and plasma exchange in CIDP. 
Search methods
On 24 May 2016, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 4) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and LILACS for completed trials, and clinical trial registers for ongoing trials. We contacted the authors of the trials identified and other disease experts seeking other published and unpublished trials. 
Selection criteria
We sought randomised and quasi‐randomised trials of all immunosuppressive agents, such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil, and rituximab, and all immunomodulatory agents, such as interferon (IFN) alfa and IFN beta, in participants fulfilling standard diagnostic criteria for CIDP. We included all comparisons of these agents with placebo, another treatment, or no treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We wanted to measure the change in disability after one year as our primary outcome. Our secondary outcomes were change in disability after four or more weeks (from randomisation); change in impairment after at least one year; change in maximum motor nerve conduction velocity and compound muscle action potential amplitude after one year; and for participants who were receiving corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), the amount of this medication given during at least one year after randomisation. Participants with one or more serious adverse events during the first year was also a secondary outcome. 
Main results
Four trials fulfilled the selection criteria: one of azathioprine (27 participants), two of IFN beta‐1a (77 participants in total) and one of methotrexate (60 participants). The risk of bias was considered low in the trials of IFN beta‐1a and methotrexate but high in the trial of azathioprine. None of the trials showed significant benefit in any of the outcomes selected by their authors. The results of the outcomes which approximated most closely to the primary outcome for this review were as follows. 
In the azathioprine trial there was a median improvement in the Neuropathy Impairment Scale (scale range 0 to 280) after nine months of 29 points (range 49 points worse to 84 points better) in the azathioprine and prednisone treated participants compared with 30 points worse (range 20 points worse to 104 points better) in the prednisone alone group. There were no reports of adverse events. 
In a cross‐over trial of IFN beta‐1a with 20 participants, the treatment periods were 12 weeks. The median improvement in the Guy's Neurological Disability Scale (range 1 to 10) was 0.5 grades (interquartile range (IQR) 1.8 grades better to zero grade change) in the IFN beta‐1a treatment period and 0.5 grades (IQR 1.8 grades better to 1.0 grade worse) in the placebo treatment period. There were no serious adverse events in either treatment period. 
In a parallel group trial of IFN beta‐1a with 67 participants, none of the outcomes for this review was available. The trial design involved withdrawal from ongoing IVIg treatment. The primary outcome used by the trial authors was total IVIg dose administered from week 16 to week 32 in the placebo group compared with the IFN beta‐1a groups. This was slightly but not significantly lower in the combined IFN beta‐1a groups (1.20 g/kg) compared with the placebo group (1.34 g/kg, P = 0.75). There were four participants in the IFN beta‐1a group and none in the placebo group with one or more serious adverse events, risk ratio (RR) 4.50 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 80.05). 
The methotrexate trial had a similar design involving withdrawal from ongoing corticosteroid or IVIg treatment. At the end of the trial (approximately 40 weeks) there was no significant difference in the change in the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale, a disability scale (scale range 0 to 12), the median change being 0 (IQR −1 to 0) in the methotrexate group and 0 (IQR −0.75 to 0) in the placebo group. These changes in disability might have been confounded by the reduction in corticosteroid or IVIg dose required by the protocol. There were three participants in the methotrexate group and one in the placebo with one or more serious adverse events, RR 3.56 (95% CI 0.39 to 32.23). 
Authors' conclusions
Low‐quality evidence from randomised trials does not show significant benefit from azathioprine or interferon beta‐1a and moderate‐quality evidence from one randomised trial does not show significant benefit from a relatively low dose of methotrexate for the treatment of CIDP. None of the trials was large enough to rule out small or moderate benefit. The evidence from observational studies is insufficient to avoid the need for randomised controlled trials to discover whether these drugs are beneficial. Future trials should have improved designs, more sensitive outcome measures relevant to people with CIDP, and longer treatment durations.","Immune system treatments other than corticosteroids, immunoglobulin and plasma exchange for CIDP 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence for giving people with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) treatment that regulates the immune system other than corticosteroids, immunoglobulin and plasma exchange. 
Background 
CIDP is an uncommon disease that causes weakness and numbness of the arms and legs. The condition may progress steadily or have periods of worsening and improvement. The cause is inflammation that damages the insulating layer (myelin) around individual nerve fibres. In severe cases, the disease affects the actual nerve fibres themselves. According to Cochrane systematic reviews, three immune system treatments are known to help. These are corticosteroids ('steroids'), plasma exchange (which removes and replaces blood plasma), and intravenous immunoglobulin (infusions into a vein of human antibodies). However, benefit from these is often inadequate or does not last long. We wanted to discover whether other drugs that suppress or change the activity of the immune system are of benefit. 
Study characteristics 
We found four trials. A trial with 27 participants compared the effects of azathioprine together with steroids to steroids alone for nine months. Azathioprine is a drug that is often used to treat autoimmune diseases because it suppresses the harmful immune cells. This trial had a parallel‐group design, which means that the participants were divided into groups that each received only one of the treatments. 
A cross‐over design trial with 10 participants compared the immune‐regulating drug interferon (IFN) beta‐1a with placebo (dummy treatment) for 12 weeks. The cross‐over design means that all participants received both treatments in random order. A parallel‐group trial with 67 participants also compared interferon beta‐1a with placebo, but for 32 weeks. Another parallel‐group trial with 60 participants compared the cytotoxic drug methotrexate with placebo for 40 weeks. The IFN beta‐1a trials, but not the azathioprine or methotrexate trials, received pharmaceutical company support or sponsorship. 
Key results 
None of these trials showed significant benefit or harm from the drugs. We selected disability scores as our primary measure of the effect of treatment. All the trials were too small to detect or rule out anything but major benefit or harm. We rated the quality of the evidence as moderate or low for IFN beta‐1a and methotrexate because of problems with trial design, and because the small number of participants made the result imprecise. We rated the quality of the evidence for azathioprine as low because of lack of blinding and imprecision. Observational studies of these and other drugs, including the cytotoxic drugs cyclophosphamide, ciclosporin, mycophenolate, rituximab, alemtuzumab and natalizumab, peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, and the immune regulating drug interferon (IFN) alfa, exist but are of insufficient quality to determine whether any of these treatments are beneficial. 
The evidence is up to date to May 2016.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Testing Immune-Modifying Drugs for a Nerve Condition Called CIDP

## What is CIDP?
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is a condition that affects the nerves. People with CIDP experience weakness and numbness that gets worse over time or comes and goes. The body's immune system may be attacking its own nerves by mistake.

## What did researchers want to find out?
Researchers wanted to know if certain drugs that affect the immune system could help people with CIDP. They looked at drugs like azathioprine, interferon beta-1a, and methotrexate. They did not study steroids, immunoglobulin, or plasma exchange, which are already known treatments.

## What did they do?
The researchers searched medical databases in May 2016 for studies that tested these drugs. They only included studies that randomly assigned people to receive either the drug being tested or a placebo (dummy treatment).

## What did they find?
They found 4 studies with a total of 164 people:
- 1 study tested azathioprine (27 people)
- 2 studies tested interferon beta-1a (77 people total)
- 1 study tested methotrexate (60 people)

**Results:**
- None of the drugs showed clear benefits for people with CIDP
- The studies measured things like disability levels, nerve function, and whether people could reduce other medications they were taking
- Side effects were generally mild, though a few people had serious side effects

## What does this mean?
The evidence does not show that these drugs help people with CIDP. However, the studies were small, so they couldn't rule out the possibility of small benefits. Larger, longer studies with better designs are needed to know for sure whether these drugs work.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the review

Purpose
- To find out if certain immune-based medicines (not steroids, IVIg, or plasma exchange) help people with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP).

Who was studied
- Adults with CIDP who met standard diagnostic criteria.

Medicines studied
- Azathioprine
- Interferon beta-1a (IFN beta-1a)
- Methotrexate
- The review also searched for trials of other drugs (like cyclophosphamide, ciclosporin, mycophenolate, rituximab), but no eligible randomized trials of these were found.

How the research was done
- This was a review of randomized and quasi-randomized clinical trials found in major medical databases up to May 24, 2016.
- 4 trials met the criteria:
  - Azathioprine: 27 people; compared azathioprine + prednisone vs prednisone alone; about 9 months.
  - IFN beta-1a (cross-over): 20 people; each person received IFN beta-1a and placebo in two 12‑week periods.
  - IFN beta-1a (parallel groups): 67 people; focused on how much IVIg was needed from week 16 to week 32 after stopping regular IVIg.
  - Methotrexate: 60 people; about 40 weeks; looked at function after reducing or withdrawing steroids or IVIg per protocol.

Main outcomes measured
- Primary goal of the review: change in disability after 1 year.
- Other outcomes: disability after at least 4 weeks, nerve test results after 1 year, amount of IVIg or steroids needed over a year, and serious side effects during the first year.

Key results
- None of the four trials showed a clear benefit of the tested drugs on disability or other main outcomes.
- Azathioprine trial: no clear difference in nerve impairment scores at 9 months; no reported serious side effects.
- IFN beta-1a cross-over trial: no meaningful difference in disability over 12-week treatment periods; no serious side effects.
- IFN beta-1a parallel-group trial: IVIg use was slightly lower with IFN beta-1a than placebo, but not significant (1.20 vs 1.34 g/kg; P=0.75). Serious side effects: 4 with IFN beta-1a vs 0 with placebo.
- Methotrexate trial: no significant difference in disability at ~40 weeks. Serious side effects: 3 with methotrexate vs 1 with placebo.

Safety
- Serious side effects were uncommon overall:
  - Azathioprine trial: none reported.
  - IFN beta-1a cross-over: none.
  - IFN beta-1a parallel: 4 with IFN beta-1a, 0 with placebo.
  - Methotrexate: 3 with methotrexate, 1 with placebo.

Quality and limits
- Evidence for azathioprine and IFN beta-1a: low quality.
- Evidence for methotrexate at a relatively low dose: moderate quality.
- Trials were small and sometimes short. Some designs (reducing steroids or IVIg during the study) may have affected results.

Bottom line
- Based on the trials reviewed, azathioprine, IFN beta-1a, and low-dose methotrexate did not show clear benefit for CIDP.
- More and better-designed, longer trials are needed to know if these or other immune medicines help."
143,"Background
People with multiple sclerosis (MS) are confronted with a number of important uncertainties concerning many aspects of the disease. These include diagnosis, prognosis, disease course, disease‐modifying therapies, symptomatic therapies, and non‐pharmacological interventions, among others. While people with MS demand adequate information to be able to actively participate in medical decision making and to self manage their disease, it has been shown that patients’ disease‐related knowledge is poor, therefore guidelines recommend clear and concise high‐quality information at all stages of the disease. Several studies have outlined communication and information deficits in the care of people with MS. However, only a few information and decision support programmes have been published. 
Objectives
The primary objectives of this updated review was to evaluate the effectiveness of information provision interventions for people with MS that aim to promote informed choice and improve patient‐relevant outcomes, Further objectives were to evaluate the components and the developmental processes of the complex interventions used, to highlight the quantity and the certainty of the research evidence available, and to set an agenda for future research. 
Search methods
For this update, we searched the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the Central Nervous System Group Specialised Register, which contains trials from CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library 2017, Issue 11), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, PEDro, and clinical trials registries (29 November 2017) as well as other sources. We also searched reference lists of identified articles and contacted trialists. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐randomised controlled trials, and quasi‐randomised trials comparing information provision for people with MS or suspected MS (intervention groups) with usual care or other types of information provision (control groups) were eligible. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the retrieved articles for relevance and methodological quality and extracted data. Critical appraisal of studies addressed the risk of selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, and detection bias. We contacted authors of relevant studies for additional information. 
Main results
We identified one new RCT (73 participants), which when added to the 10 previously included RCTs resulted in a total of 11 RCTs that met the inclusion criteria and were analysed (1387 participants overall; mean age, range: 31 to 51; percentage women, range: 63% to 100%; percentage relapsing‐remitting MS course, range: 45% to 100%). The interventions addressed a variety of topics using different approaches for information provision in different settings. Topics included disease‐modifying therapy, relapse management, self care strategies, fatigue management, family planning, and general health promotion. The active intervention components included decision aids, decision coaching, educational programmes, self care programmes, and personal interviews with physicians. All studies used one or more components, but the number and extent differed markedly between studies. The studies had a variable risk of bias. We did not perform meta‐analyses due to marked clinical heterogeneity. All five studies assessing MS‐related knowledge (505 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) detected significant differences between groups as a result of the interventions, indicating that information provision may successfully increase participants’ knowledge. There were mixed results on decision making (five studies, 793 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and quality of life (six studies, 671 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No adverse events were detected in the seven studies reporting this outcome. 
Authors' conclusions
Information provision for people with MS seems to increase disease‐related knowledge, with less clear results on decision making and quality of life. The included studies in this review reported no negative side effects of providing disease‐related information to people with MS. Interpretation of study results remains challenging due to the marked heterogeneity of interventions and outcome measures.","Information provision to help people with multiple sclerosis make informed decisions
Background 
People with multiple sclerosis (MS) are confronted with many uncertainties in all phases of the disease. For example, the significance of a diagnosis for the future disease course remains unclear, as up to one‐third of people will experience a benign disease course with little or even no disability progression. Uncertainty is also present for the effects and adverse effects of drug and non‐drug therapies. 
People with MS have the right and wish to receive accurate, recent, and relevant information in order to make informed choices on all relevant disease‐related decisions and also on personal life‐planning decisions. For this to occur, balanced information is a prerequisite. It has been shown that disease knowledge is poor in people with MS, therefore people with MS should receive interventions that provide information on all aspects relevant for them. 
Results 
We searched for relevant studies in the medical literature in November 2017 and identified 11 studies involving a total of 1387 participants. The studies evaluated a variety of approaches including the provision of written information or decision aids, coaching, educational programmes, and personal information. The quality of the study methods varied. Topics included disease‐modifying therapy, relapse management, self care strategies, fatigue management, family planning, and general health promotion. Five studies assessing level of knowledge showed that information may successfully increase patients’ knowledge (moderate‐certainty evidence). Five studies reporting on the effects on decision making (low‐certainty evidence) and six studies assessing quality of life (low‐certainty evidence) showed mixed results. As the studies and the interventions used differed markedly, and the certainty of the evidence for our outcomes was not high, our results prevented a clear conclusion about the effectiveness of information provision interventions for people with MS.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Information Programs for People with Multiple Sclerosis

## What was this review about?

People with multiple sclerosis (MS) often need clear information about their condition to help them make decisions about their care and manage their daily lives. However, studies show that many people with MS don't have enough knowledge about their disease. Researchers wanted to find out if special information programs could help people with MS better understand their condition and improve their lives.

## What did the researchers look for?

The researchers searched medical databases through November 2017 for studies that tested different ways of providing information to people with MS. They looked for studies that compared information programs to usual care or other types of information.

## What did they find?

The researchers found 11 studies involving 1,387 people with MS. Most participants were women (63% to 100%), and their average ages ranged from 31 to 51 years.

The information programs covered different topics, including:
- Treatment options
- Managing flare-ups
- Self-care strategies
- Managing fatigue
- Family planning
- General health

The programs used various methods such as decision-making tools, coaching sessions, educational classes, self-care programs, and meetings with doctors.

## What were the results?

**Knowledge:** All five studies that measured MS-related knowledge found that information programs helped people learn more about their condition.

**Decision-making and Quality of Life:** The results were mixed—some studies showed improvements while others didn't.

**Safety:** Seven studies reported on safety, and none found any harmful effects from the information programs.

## What does this mean?

Information programs appear to help people with MS learn more about their condition without causing harm. However, it's unclear whether these programs consistently help with decision-making or improve quality of life. Because the studies used very different approaches and measured different things, it's difficult to draw firm conclusions about which types of information programs work best.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

Purpose
- To see if giving clear, structured information to people with multiple sclerosis (MS) helps them make informed choices and improves outcomes that matter to them.

Who was studied
- 11 randomized studies with 1,387 adults with MS or possible MS.
- Average ages ranged from 31 to 51 years.
- 63% to 100% were women.
- In some studies, 45% to 100% had relapsing‑remitting MS.

What the information programs were
- Topics: disease‑modifying medicines, relapse care, self‑care, fatigue, family planning, and general health.
- Formats: decision aids, decision coaching, education classes, self‑care programs, and one‑on‑one talks with doctors.
- Compared with usual care or other types of information.

What outcomes were measured
- MS knowledge
- Decision making about care
- Quality of life
- Safety (adverse events)

Key findings
- Knowledge: 5 studies (505 people) showed clear improvement in MS knowledge after information programs.
- Decision making: 5 studies (793 people) showed mixed results; some improved, some did not.
- Quality of life: 6 studies (671 people) showed mixed results.
- Safety: 7 studies reported no harmful effects from receiving disease‑related information.

Timeframe and methods
- Search date: up to November 29, 2017.
- Only randomized or similar controlled trials were included.
- The studies were quite different from each other, so results were not combined into one pooled estimate.

What this means
- Providing structured, high‑quality information can increase MS‑related knowledge.
- It is less clear whether it improves decision making or quality of life.
- No safety concerns were reported in the studies that checked for them."
144,"Background
Gallstones are present in about 10% to 15% of the adult western population. Between 1% and 4% of these adults become symptomatic in a year (the majority due to biliary colic but a significant proportion due to acute cholecystitis). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis is mainly performed after the acute cholecystitis episode settles because of the fear of higher morbidity and of need for conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy. However, delaying surgery exposes the people to gallstone‐related complications. 
Objectives
The aim of this systematic review was to compare early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (less than seven days of clinical presentation with acute cholecystitis) versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (more than six weeks after index admission with acute cholecystitis) with regards to benefits and harms. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform until July 2012. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised clinical trials comparing early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy in participants with acute cholecystitis. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.
Main results
We identified seven trials that met the inclusion criteria. Out of these, six trials provided data for the meta‐analyses. A total of 488 participants with acute cholecystitis and fit to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomised to early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELC) (244 people) and delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (DLC) (244 people) in the six trials. Blinding was not performed in any of the trials and so all the trials were at high risk of bias. Other than blinding, three of the six trials were at low risk of bias in the other domains such as sequence generation, allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data, and selective outcome reporting. The proportion of females ranged between 43.3% and 80% in the trials that provided this information. The average age of participants ranged between 40 years and 60 years. There was no mortality in any of the participants in five trials that reported mortality. There was no significant difference in the proportion of people who developed bile duct injury in the two groups (ELC 1/219 (adjusted proportion 0.4%) versus DLC 2/219 (0.9%); Peto OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.05 to 4.72 (5 trials)). There was no significant difference between the two groups (ELC 14/219 (adjusted proportion 6.5%) versus DLC 11/219 (5.0%); RR 1.29; 95% CI 0.61 to 2.72 (5 trials)) in terms of other serious complications. None of the trials reported quality of life from the time of randomisation. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the proportion of people who required conversion to open cholecystectomy (ELC 49/244 (adjusted proportion 19.7%) versus DLC 54/244 (22.1%); RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.25 (6 trials)). The total hospital stay was shorter in the early group than the delayed group by four days (MD ‐4.12 days; 95% CI ‐5.22 to ‐3.03 (4 trials; 373 people)). There was no significant difference in the operating time between the two groups (MD ‐1.22 minutes; 95% CI ‐3.07 to 0.64 (6 trials; 488 people)). Only one trial reported return to work. The people belonging to the ELC group returned to work earlier than the DLC group (MD ‐11.00 days; 95% CI ‐19.61 to ‐2.39 (1 trial; 36 people)). Four trials did not report any gallstone‐related morbidity during the waiting period. One trial reported five gallstone‐related morbidities (cholangitis: two; biliary colic not requiring urgent operation: one; acute cholecystitis not requiring urgent operation: two). There were no reports of pancreatitis during the waiting time. Gallstone‐related morbidity was not reported in the remaining trials. Forty (18.3%) of the people belonging to the delayed group had either non‐resolution of symptoms or recurrence of symptoms before their planned operation and had to undergo emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy in five trials. The proportion with conversion to open cholecystectomy was 45% (18/40) in this group of people. 
Authors' conclusions
We found no significant difference between early and late laparoscopic cholecystectomy on our primary outcomes. However, trials with high risk of bias indicate that early laparoscopic cholecystectomy during acute cholecystitis seems safe and may shorten the total hospital stay. The majority of the important outcomes occurred rarely, and hence the confidence intervals are wide. It is unlikely that future randomised clinical trials will be powered to measure differences in bile duct injury and other serious complications since this might involve performing a trial of more than 50,000 people, but several smaller randomised trials may answer the questions through meta‐analyses.","Early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for people with acute cholecystitis
The liver produces bile which has many functions including elimination of waste processed by the liver and digestion of fat. The bile is temporarily stored in the gallbladder (an organ situated underneath the liver) before it reaches the small bowel. Concretions in the gallbladder are called gallstones. Gallstones are present in about 10% to 15% of the adult western population. Between 1% and 4% become symptomatic in a year. The symptoms include pain related to the gallbladder (biliary colic), inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis), obstruction to the flow of bile from the liver and gallbladder into the small bowel resulting in jaundice (yellowish discolourisation of the body usually most prominently noticed in the white of the eye, which turns yellow), bile infection (cholangitis), and inflammation of the pancreas, an organ which secretes digestive juices and harbours the insulin secreting cells which maintain blood sugar level (pancreatitis). Removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is currently considered the best treatment option for people with symptomatic gallstones. This is generally performed by key‐hole surgery (laparoscopic cholecystectomy). Cholecystitis (inflammation) of the gallbladder is one of the indications for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Cholecystitis can occur suddenly, with symptoms such as fever along with intense pain in the right upper tummy. This is called acute cholecystitis. In comparison, chronic cholecystitis is a smouldering inflammation of the gallbladder which presents with less intense pain in the right upper tummy. For many years, surgeons have preferred to perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy once the inflammation settles down completely (which usually takes about six weeks) because of the fear of higher complication rates including injury to the bile duct (a tube through which the bile flows from the gallbladder to the small bowel). Injury to the bile duct is a life‐threatening condition which requires urgent corrective operation in most instances. In spite of the corrective surgery, people have poor quality of life several years after the operation due to repeated instances of bile infection caused by obstruction to the flow of bile into the small bowel. Another reason for the surgeons' preference for delaying the operation is to avoid an open operation, as there has been a perception that early operation increases the risk of an open operation. However, delaying the surgery exposes the people to the risk of complications related to gallstones. The review authors set out to determine whether it is preferable to perform early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (within seven days of people presenting to doctors with symptoms) or delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (more than six weeks after the initial admission). A systematic search of medical literature was performed in order to identify studies which provided information on the above question. The authors obtained information from randomised trials only since such types of trials provide the best information if conducted well. Two authors independently identified the trials and collected the information. 
Six trials providing information on the review question were identified. A total of 488 people with acute cholecystitis were included. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed early (within seven days of people presenting to the doctor with symptoms) in 244 people while it was performed after at least six weeks in the remaining 244 people. The proportion of females ranged between 43.3% and 80% in the trials that provided this information. The average age of participants ranged between 40 years and 60 years. All the trials were at high risk of bias (and might have overestimated the benefits or underestimated the harms of either early laparoscopic cholecystectomy or delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy). All the people included in the trials were discharged home alive after operation in the five trials from which this information was available. There was no significant difference in the proportion of people who developed bile duct injury, surgical complications, or who required conversion from key‐hole to open operation between the two groups. None of the trials reported quality of life from the time of randomisation. The total hospital stay was shorter in the early group than the delayed group by four days. There was no significant difference in the operating time between the two groups. Only one trial reported the time taken for employed people to return to work. The people belonging to the early laparoscopic cholecystectomy group returned to work 11 days, on average, earlier than the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy group. Four trials did not report any gallstone‐related complications during the waiting period. One trial reported five gallstone‐related complications, including two people with cholangitis. There were no reports of pancreatitis during the waiting time. Gallstone‐related morbidity was not reported in the remaining trial. Approximately one‐sixth of people belonging to the delayed group had either non‐resolution of symptoms or recurrence of symptoms before their planned operation and had to undergo emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy in five trials. Based on information from a varied number of participants as well as trials at high risk of bias, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy during acute cholecystitis appears safe and shortens the total hospital stay. The majority of the important outcomes occurred rarely and hence one cannot rule out that future trials may show that one treatment or another may be better in terms of complications. However, the trial size required to show such differences involves a clinical trial on more than 50,000 people and so it is unlikely that such large trials will be performed. Several smaller randomised trials may answer the questions through meta‐analyses.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Early vs. Delayed Gallbladder Removal Surgery

## What is this study about?

Researchers reviewed studies comparing two different timing approaches for removing the gallbladder in people with acute cholecystitis (sudden inflammation of the gallbladder caused by gallstones).

## Who was studied?

The review included 488 adults with acute cholecystitis who were healthy enough for laparoscopic surgery (a minimally invasive procedure using small incisions). Participants were mostly between 40-60 years old, and about half to three-quarters were women.

## What was compared?

- **Early surgery**: Gallbladder removal within 7 days of symptoms starting
- **Delayed surgery**: Gallbladder removal more than 6 weeks after the initial hospital visit

## What did the researchers find?

**Safety:**
- No deaths occurred in either group
- Bile duct injuries were rare in both groups (less than 1%)
- Other serious complications were similar between groups (about 5-6%)

**Hospital stay:**
- People who had early surgery spent about 4 fewer days in the hospital overall

**Surgery details:**
- Surgery time was similar for both approaches
- Similar numbers of people needed to switch from laparoscopic to open surgery (about 20% in each group)

**Waiting period concerns:**
- About 1 in 5 people waiting for delayed surgery had worsening symptoms or new problems before their scheduled operation
- These people needed emergency surgery instead

**Return to daily activities:**
- One study found people returned to work about 11 days sooner with early surgery

## What does this mean?

Early gallbladder removal appears safe and may reduce total hospital time compared to waiting. However, the studies had some quality limitations, and rare complications are difficult to measure accurately.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the clinical trial review

What was studied
- Researchers compared two timings for keyhole gallbladder removal (laparoscopic cholecystectomy) in people with sudden gallbladder inflammation:
  - Early surgery: within 7 days of symptoms
  - Delayed surgery: more than 6 weeks after the first hospital visit

Who was included
- Adults with acute gallbladder inflammation who were fit for keyhole surgery
- 6 randomized trials with 488 people total (244 early, 244 delayed)
- Average age: 40–60 years; 43%–80% female

What treatments were compared
- Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELC)
- Delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (DLC)

What outcomes were measured
- Death
- Serious problems (like bile duct injury)
- Need to switch to open surgery
- Time in the hospital
- Time in the operating room
- Return to work
- New gallstone problems while waiting for delayed surgery

Main results
- Deaths: none reported in 5 trials
- Bile duct injury: rare and similar in both groups (about 0.4% early vs 0.9% delayed)
- Other serious problems: similar (about 6.5% early vs 5.0% delayed)
- Switch to open surgery: similar (about 20% early vs 22% delayed)
- Hospital stay: early surgery shortened total hospital days by about 4 days
- Operating time: similar
- Return to work: one small trial found early surgery returned to work about 11 days sooner
- While waiting for delayed surgery: about 18% had symptoms that came back or did not improve and needed emergency surgery; 45% of these needed open surgery

Timing and methods
- Evidence came from studies found up to July 2012
- Trials were small and not blinded (higher risk of bias)

Safety
- Early and delayed surgery had similar safety based on reported serious problems
- Early surgery reduced total time in the hospital

What this means
- Early keyhole surgery during the same illness episode appears as safe as waiting and may shorten hospital time.
- Some people who wait may have symptoms return and need emergency surgery."
145,"Background
Approximately 600 million children of preschool and school age are anaemic worldwide. It is estimated that half of the cases are due to iron deficiency. Consequences of iron deficiency anaemia during childhood include growth retardation, reduced school achievement, impaired motor and cognitive development, and increased morbidity and mortality. The provision of daily iron supplements is a widely used strategy for improving iron status in children but its effectiveness has been limited due to its side effects, which can include nausea, constipation or staining of the teeth. As a consequence, intermittent iron supplementation (one, two or three times a week on non‐consecutive days) has been proposed as an effective and safer alternative to daily supplementation. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of intermittent iron supplementation, alone or in combination with other vitamins and minerals, on nutritional and developmental outcomes in children from birth to 12 years of age compared with a placebo, no intervention or daily supplementation. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases on 24 May 2011: CENTRAL (2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1948 to May week 2, 2011), EMBASE (1980 to 2011 Week 20), CINAHL (1937 to current), POPLINE (all available years) and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). On 29 June 2011 we searched all available years in the following databases: SCIELO, LILACS, IBECS and IMBIOMED. We also contacted relevant organisations (on 3 July 2011) to identify ongoing and unpublished studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi‐randomised trials with either individual or cluster randomisation. Participants were children under the age of 12 years at the time of intervention with no specific health problems. The intervention assessed was intermittent iron supplementation compared with a placebo, no intervention or daily supplementation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies against the inclusion criteria, extracted data from included studies and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. 
Main results
We included 33 trials, involving 13,114 children (˜49% females) from 20 countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia. The methodological quality of the trials was mixed. 
Nineteen trials evaluated intermittent iron supplementation versus no intervention or a placebo and 21 studies evaluated intermittent versus daily iron supplementation. Some of these trials contributed data to both comparisons. Iron alone was provided in most of the trials. 
Fifteen studies included children younger than 60 months; 11 trials included children 60 months and older, and seven studies included children in both age categories. One trial included exclusively females. Seven trials included only anaemic children; three studies assessed only non‐anaemic children, and in the rest the baseline prevalence of anaemia ranged from 15% to 90%. 
In comparison with receiving no intervention or a placebo, children receiving iron supplements intermittently have a lower risk of anaemia (average risk ratio (RR) 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37 to 0.72, ten studies) and iron deficiency (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.91, three studies) and have higher haemoglobin (mean difference (MD) 5.20 g/L, 95% CI 2.51 to 7.88, 19 studies) and ferritin concentrations (MD 14.17 µg/L, 95% CI 3.53 to 24.81, five studies). 
Intermittent supplementation was as effective as daily supplementation in improving haemoglobin (MD –0.60 g/L, 95% CI –1.54 to 0.35, 19 studies) and ferritin concentrations (MD –4.19 µg/L, 95% CI –9.42 to 1.05, 10 studies), but increased the risk of anaemia in comparison with daily iron supplementation (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.04 to1.47, six studies). Data on adherence were scarce and it tended to be higher among those children receiving intermittent supplementation, although this result was not statistically significant. 
We did not identify any differential effect of the type of intermittent supplementation regimen (one, two or three times a week), the total weekly dose of elemental iron, the nutrient composition, whether recipients were male or female or the length of the intervention. 
Authors' conclusions
Intermittent iron supplementation is efficacious to improve haemoglobin concentrations and reduce the risk of having anaemia or iron deficiency in children younger than 12 years of age when compared with a placebo or no intervention, but it is less effective than daily supplementation to prevent or control anaemia. Intermittent supplementation may be a viable public health intervention in settings where daily supplementation has failed or has not been implemented. Information on mortality, morbidity, developmental outcomes and side effects, however, is still lacking.","One, two or three times a week iron supplements for improving health and development among children under 12 years of age 
Approximately 600 million preschool and school‐age children are anaemic worldwide. It is estimated that half of these cases are due to a lack of iron. Iron deficiency anaemia during childhood may slow down growth, reduce motor and brain development, and increase illness and death. If anaemia is not treated promptly, these problems may persist later in life. Taking supplements containing iron (sometimes combined with folic acid and other vitamins and minerals) on a daily basis has shown to improve children's health but its use has been limited because supplements may produce side effects such as nausea, constipation or staining of the teeth. It has been suggested that giving iron one, two or three times a week (known as 'intermittent' supplementation) may reduce these side effects and be easier to remember, and thus encourage children to continue taking the iron supplements. 
We analysed 33 trials involving 13,314 children (49% females) from 20 countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia, to assess the effects of intermittent iron supplementation, alone or in combination with other vitamins and minerals, on nutritional and developmental outcomes in children from birth to 12 years of age compared with a placebo, no intervention.or daily supplementation. 
The studies were of mixed quality. Overall, the results of this review show that giving children supplements with iron alone or in combination with other vitamins and minerals one, two or three times a week approximately halves their risk of having anaemia in comparison with receiving no iron supplements or a placebo. Giving children supplements on a intermittent basis was as effective as daily supplementation for improving haemoglobin and ferritin concentrations, although, children receiving iron supplements intermittently were at higher risk of having anaemia. 
We aimed to examine the effects of intermittent supplementation on illness, death, and school and physical performance, as well as on other side effects, but there was insufficient information to draw firm conclusions. 
In summary, intermittent iron supplementation is efficacious to improve haemoglobin concentrations and reduce the risk of having anaemia or iron deficiency in children younger than 12 years of age when compared with a placebo or no intervention, but it is less effective than daily supplementation to prevent or control anaemia. Intermittent supplementation may be a viable public health intervention in settings where daily supplementation has failed or has not been implemented. Information on mortality, morbidity, developmental outcomes and side effects, however, is still lacking.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Giving Iron Supplements a Few Times Per Week to Children

## What is this study about?

Researchers wanted to find out if giving iron supplements to children a few times per week (instead of every day) helps prevent anemia, a condition where the blood doesn't have enough healthy red blood cells.

## Why is this important?

Around 600 million children worldwide have anemia. About half of these cases happen because children don't get enough iron. When children don't have enough iron, they may:
- Not grow as well as they should
- Have trouble learning in school
- Get sick more often
- Have problems with movement and thinking skills

Taking iron pills every day can cause uncomfortable side effects like upset stomach, constipation, or tooth staining. Because of these problems, many children stop taking their iron supplements.

## What did researchers do?

Researchers looked at 33 studies that included over 13,000 children from 20 countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. The studies tested children from newborns up to 12 years old. They compared children who took iron supplements 1-3 times per week with children who either:
- Took no supplements
- Took fake pills (placebo)
- Took iron supplements every day

## What did they find?

**Compared to taking no iron or fake pills:**
- Children taking iron a few times per week had less anemia
- Their blood iron levels improved
- They were less likely to have iron deficiency

**Compared to taking iron every day:**
- Taking iron a few times per week worked almost as well for improving blood iron levels
- However, children taking iron a few times per week had slightly higher rates of anemia than those taking it daily

## What does this mean?

Taking iron supplements a few times per week helps children avoid anemia better than taking nothing at all. While daily iron works slightly better, taking iron a few times per week might be a good option in places where daily supplements haven't worked well or aren't being used.

More research is needed to understand how this affects children's overall health, development, and side effects.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the study

What was the goal?
- To see if giving iron to children on some days (not every day) improves iron levels and helps prevent anemia, and how it compares to daily iron.

Who was in the studies?
- 33 studies with 13,114 children from birth to 12 years old.
- Studies took place in 20 countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia.
- Some children had anemia at the start; others did not.
- Searches included studies available up to mid-2011.

What did they test?
- Intermittent iron: iron given 1–3 times per week on non-consecutive days.
- Compared to: no iron or a placebo, or daily iron.
- Most studies gave iron alone; some combined iron with other vitamins/minerals.

Key outcomes measured
- Anemia (how many children had it)
- Iron deficiency
- Hemoglobin level (a measure of red blood cells)
- Ferritin level (a measure of iron stores)
- Adherence (how well children took the supplements)
- Safety and side effects (information was limited)

Main findings
- Intermittent iron vs no iron/placebo:
  - Lower risk of anemia.
  - Lower risk of iron deficiency.
  - Higher hemoglobin and ferritin levels.
- Intermittent iron vs daily iron:
  - Similar hemoglobin and ferritin levels overall.
  - Slightly higher risk of anemia with intermittent dosing than with daily dosing.
  - Adherence tended to be better with intermittent dosing (not clearly proven).

Did the schedule or dose matter?
- No clear differences by giving iron once, twice, or three times per week, by total weekly dose, by adding other nutrients, by child’s sex, or by how long the program ran.

Safety
- Data on side effects, illness, growth, and development were limited. The studies did not provide enough information to judge safety fully.

What does this mean?
- Giving iron a few times per week helps improve iron status and reduce anemia compared to no iron.
- Daily iron may prevent anemia a bit better than intermittent iron.
- Intermittent iron could be useful where daily iron is not possible or not well accepted.

Timeline
- Evidence comes from studies identified up to 2011. Newer studies may add information."
146,"Background
Quadriphasic oral contraceptives have been developed to reduce the adverse effects of oral contraceptives and are presented as more physiological since they mimic the natural cycle. However, suggested disadvantages of quadriphasic oral contraceptives include a possible increased risk of pill‐taking errors caused by the array of different color pills, complicated directions for catching up when a pill is missed, the higher price and potential inferiority in terms of side effects. 
Objectives
To compare the contraceptive effectiveness, bleeding pattern, minor side effects and acceptability of quadriphasic contraceptive pills versus monophasic contraceptive pills. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, POPLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP for trials comparing quadriphasic pills with monophasic pills. We contacted researchers and manufacturers of quadriphasic oral contraceptives to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing quadriphasic with monophasic oral contraceptives. Trials had to report on contraceptive effectiveness, bleeding patterns, minor side effects, ease of use or trial discontinuation. We excluded studies where the intervention was primarily used as a treatment for disorders or was administered for fewer than three consecutive cycles. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors abstracted and entered data into RevMan. We critically appraised the methodological quality of the included trials. For continuous variables, we computed the mean difference with 95% confidence interval (CI) using the random‐effects model. For dichotomous variables, we calculated the risk ratio with 95% CI using the random‐effects model. 
Main results
We included one double‐blind, double‐dummy RCT comparing a quadriphasic oral contraceptive composed of dienogest and estradiol valerate with a monophasic oral contraceptive composed of levonorgestrel and ethinylestradiol. Contraceptive effectiveness, intracyclic bleeding and discontinuation due to side effects were similar for quadriphasic and monophasic pills. The number of women experiencing withdrawal bleeding was higher in the monophasic group compared to the quadriphasic group. Users of quadriphasic pills reported fewer bleeding/spotting days and fewer bleeding/spotting episodes than users of monophasic pills but the report did not specify whether the bleeding/spotting was scheduled or unscheduled. More women using quadriphasic oral contraceptives reported breast pain compared to women using monophasic oral contraceptives. 
Authors' conclusions
The available evidence is insufficient to determine whether quadriphasic differ from monophasic oral contraceptives in contraceptive effectiveness, bleeding pattern, minor side effects and acceptability. Studies that compare quadriphasic and monophasic oral contraceptives with an identical progestogen and estrogen type are needed to determine whether the quadriphasic approach differs from the monophasic approach. Studies that compare quadriphasic pills with monophasic pills containing 30 μg ethinylestradiol are indicated to determine whether quadriphasic oral contraceptives have an advantage over the current, first choice oral contraceptive. Until then, we recommend monophasic pills containing 30 μg estrogen as the first choice for women starting oral contraceptive use.","Birth control pills with three phases versus one phase
Standard birth control pills contain two hormones: progestogen and estrogen. One‐phase birth control pills contain the same dose of progestogen and estrogen every day. Four‐phase birth control pills contain different amounts of progestogen and estrogen on different days. This review looked at how well one‐phase birth control pills and four‐phase birth control pills work to prevent pregnancy, how often they cause bleeding problems, how often users experience side effects and how many women stop using the pills. 
We did a computer search for randomized controlled trials comparing four‐phase birth control pills with one‐phase birth control pills. We also wrote to researchers and makers of birth control pills to find other trials. Studies had to report on pregnancy, bleeding problems, side effects or stopping the use of pills. We did not include studies where the pills were used as a treatment for disorders like acne, hirsutism, polycystic ovary syndrome, bleeding problems or endometrioses, or where the pills were administered for less than three months. We assessed whether the studies were conducted properly. 
We included one study comparing a four‐phase pill composed of the progestogen dienogest and the estrogen estradiol valerate with an one‐phase pill composed of the progestogen levonorgestrel and the estrogen ethinylestradiol. Four‐phase birth control pills and one‐phase birth control pills had similar pregnancy rates. The number of women with blood loss in the period between two menstruations was similar for four‐phase pills and one‐phase pills. More women using one‐phase birth control pills had a menstruation compared to women using four‐phase birth control pills. The number of women who stopped using the pills because of side effects was similar for four‐phase pills and one‐phase pills. Breast pain was reported more frequently by women who used four‐phase birth control pills than women who used one‐phase birth control pills. 
The presence of only one study made it impossible to adequately compare four‐phase birth control pills with one‐phase birth control pills. More studies are needed to determine whether four‐phase pills have advantages over one‐phase pills. Until then, we recommend one‐phase pills containing 30 μg estrogen for women starting to use birth control pills.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Two Types of Birth Control Pills

## What was this study about?

Researchers wanted to compare two types of birth control pills:
- **Quadriphasic pills**: These contain four different hormone doses throughout the monthly pack and were designed to better match natural hormone changes
- **Monophasic pills**: These contain the same hormone dose in each active pill throughout the month

## Why did researchers do this study?

Quadriphasic pills were created to potentially reduce side effects by mimicking natural hormone patterns. However, there were concerns that having four different colored pills might make them harder to use correctly and more expensive. Researchers wanted to see if quadriphasic pills worked better or had fewer side effects than standard monophasic pills.

## What did researchers find?

The researchers found only one study that met their requirements. This study compared one brand of quadriphasic pills with one brand of monophasic pills. The results showed:

- Both pill types worked similarly well at preventing pregnancy
- Both types had similar rates of people stopping due to side effects
- Women using quadriphasic pills had fewer bleeding and spotting days overall
- Women using monophasic pills had more regular withdrawal bleeding during their pill-free days
- Women using quadriphasic pills reported breast pain more often

## What does this mean?

There isn't enough evidence to determine whether quadriphasic pills are better or worse than monophasic pills. More studies are needed that compare pills with the same hormone types. Until more research is available, researchers recommend monophasic pills as the standard choice for women starting birth control pills.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the study

What was the goal?
- To compare two types of birth control pills: quadriphasic (hormone levels change during the cycle) and monophasic (same hormone dose each day).
- Researchers looked at how well they prevent pregnancy, bleeding patterns, minor side effects, and how acceptable they are to users.

Who was studied?
- People taking combined oral contraceptive pills in a randomized clinical trial.

What did they compare?
- Quadriphasic pill: dienogest + estradiol valerate.
- Monophasic pill: levonorgestrel + ethinylestradiol.
- The trial was double-blind and double-dummy (neither participants nor researchers knew who took which pill).

What outcomes did they measure?
- Contraceptive effectiveness (pregnancy prevention).
- Bleeding patterns (including spotting and withdrawal bleeding).
- Minor side effects.
- Stopping the pill because of side effects (discontinuation).
- Ease of use and acceptability.

Main findings
- Pregnancy prevention: Similar between the two pills.
- Bleeding during cycles: Similar.
- Withdrawal bleeding: More common with the monophasic pill.
- Bleeding/spotting days and episodes: Fewer with the quadriphasic pill, but it was not clear if this was during scheduled or unscheduled times.
- Side effects: More breast pain reported with the quadriphasic pill.
- Stopping due to side effects: Similar between groups.

Safety
- Minor side effects occurred with both types. Breast pain was more common with the quadriphasic pill. No other clear differences were shown.

Timing
- Trials had to include at least three pill cycles. The exact study duration was not stated.

Limits of the evidence
- Only one randomized trial met the criteria.
- The two pills used different types of estrogen and progestin, making direct comparison harder.
- More studies are needed, especially those using the same hormone types and comparing to monophasic pills with 30 micrograms of ethinylestradiol.

What does this mean?
- Current evidence is not enough to say quadriphasic pills are better or worse than monophasic pills.
- Based on available evidence, the authors recommend starting with a monophasic pill that contains 30 micrograms of estrogen."
147,"Background
Women who want to start intrauterine contraception (IUC) during the postpartum period might benefit from IUC insertion immediately after delivery. Postplacental insertion greatly reduces the risk of subsequent pregnancy and eliminates the need for a return visit to start contraception. Without the option of immediate insertion, many women may never return for services or may adopt less effective contraception. 
Objectives
Our aim was to examine the outcomes of IUC insertion immediately after placenta delivery (within 10 minutes), especially when compared with insertion at other postpartum times. We focused on successful IUC placement (insertion), subsequent expulsion, and method use. 
Search methods
We searched for trials until 1 April 2015. Sources included PubMed (MEDLINE), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), POPLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ICTRP. For the original review, the authors contacted investigators to identify other trials. 
Selection criteria
We sought randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with at least one treatment arm that involved immediate IUC placement (i.e., within 10 minutes of placenta delivery). Comparison arms could have included early postpartum insertion (from 10 minutes postplacental to hospital discharge) or standard insertion (during a postpartum visit). Trials could also have compared different IUC methods or insertion techniques. Delivery may have been vaginal or cesarean. Primary outcomes were placement (insertion), subsequent expulsion, and method use at study assessment. 
Data collection and analysis
For dichotomous outcomes, we used the Mantel‐Haenszel odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Earlier studies primarily reported results as life‐table rates. We aggregated trials in a meta‐analysis if they had similar interventions and outcome measures. A sensitivity analysis included studies with moderate or high quality evidence and sufficient outcome data. 
Main results
We included 15 trials. Seven studies reported from 2010 to 2014 were added to eight from the original 2001 review. Newer trials compared immediate postplacental insertion versus early (10 minutes to 48 hours) or standard insertion (during the postpartum visit). Of four with full reports, three were small trials. The other three studies had conference abstracts. The eight early trials examined immediate insertion of different devices or insertion techniques. Most studies were published in the 1980s, some with limited reporting. 
Our sensitivity analysis included trials with sufficient outcome data and moderate or high quality evidence. Four newer trials comparing insertion times met the inclusion criteria. Two studies used the levonorgestrel‐releasing intrauterine system (LNG‐IUS) after vaginal delivery. The other two trials placed IUC after cesarean section; one used the CuT 380A intrauterine device (IUD) and the other used the LNG‐IUS. 
A pilot trial compared immediate insertion versus early or standard insertion. In groups comparing immediate versus early insertion (N = 30), all women had the LNG‐IUS inserted. By six months, the groups had the same expulsion rate and did not differ significantly in IUC use. 
For immediate versus standard insertion, we conducted meta‐analyses of four trials. Insertion rates did not differ significantly between study arms. However, the trial from Uganda showed insertion was more likely for the immediate group, although the estimate was imprecise. In the meta‐analysis, expulsion by six months was more likely for the immediate group, but the confidence interval was wide (OR 4.89, 95% CI 1.47 to 16.32; participants = 210; studies = 4). IUC use at six months was more likely with immediate insertion than with standard insertion (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.01 to 4.09; participants = 243; studies = 4). Study arms did not differ in use at 3 or 12 months in individual small trials. 
Authors' conclusions
Recent trials compared different insertion times after vaginal or cesarean delivery. Evidence was limited because studies with full reports generally had small sample sizes. Overall, the quality of evidence was moderate; abstracts and older studies had limited reporting. Ongoing trials will add to the evidence, although some are small. Trials of adequate power are needed to estimate expulsion rates and side effects. 
The benefit of effective contraception immediately after delivery may outweigh the disadvantage of increased risk for expulsion. Frequent prenatal visits during the third trimester provide the opportunity to discuss effective contraceptive methods and desired timing for initiation. Clinical follow‐up can help detect early expulsion, as can educating women about expulsion signs and symptoms.","Intrauterine contraception soon after childbirth
Women have two main choices for intrauterine contraception (IUC): one that releases the hormone levonorgestrel, and one without hormones that contains copper. Beginning IUC use right after childbirth and before hospital discharge can be good for many reasons. The woman knows she is not pregnant, and the time and place are convenient for starting a method that works well. We looked at whether IUC would be more likely to come out on its own if put in right after birth of a baby. For women who wanted IUC but did not have it placed right away, we studied whether they returned later for insertion. 
Until 1 April 2015, we ran computer searches for randomized trials of IUC inserted within 10 minutes of placenta (afterbirth) delivery. We wrote to researchers to find more studies. Trials could compare different times for insertion as well as types of IUC and ways to insert the device. 
We found 15 trials. Seven recent studies compared IUC insertion right after childbirth versus early insertion (before hospital discharge) or later insertion (weeks after discharge). Four had full reports, although three were small studies. Insertion was as likely to occur when placed right after childbirth as when planned for later placement, except in a study from Uganda. For the four trials overall, the IUC came out more often on its own when placed right after childbirth than when inserted weeks later. Use at six months was more likely with insertion right after childbirth than weeks later. In single studies, the groups did not differ in use at 3 months or 12 months. 
Eight older studies looked at types of IUC put in right after childbirth. Changing IUC design did not seem to affect whether IUC stayed in or whether it was used later on. Inserting IUC by hand or with a holding instrument did not seem to make a difference. 
We found newer trials with full reports that compared placement times. The studies were of good quality. Ongoing trials will provide additional data, although some sample sizes are small. Larger studies would provide better information on whether the IUC came out on its own and on whether side effects occurred.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Birth Control Device Insertion Right After Delivery

## What was this study about?

Researchers reviewed studies on inserting intrauterine contraception (IUC)—a small device placed in the uterus to prevent pregnancy—right after childbirth. They wanted to see if inserting it immediately (within 10 minutes after the placenta comes out) works well compared to inserting it at other times after delivery.

## Why is this important?

Many women want to use IUC after having a baby but may not return for a follow-up appointment to get it inserted. Inserting the device right after delivery means they leave the hospital with birth control already in place, which helps prevent unplanned pregnancies.

## What did the researchers look at?

They examined 15 studies that compared:
- Inserting IUC immediately after delivery (within 10 minutes)
- Inserting it shortly after (10 minutes to 48 hours later)
- Inserting it weeks later at a regular postpartum checkup

They tracked whether the device was successfully inserted, whether it fell out (called ""expulsion""), and whether women were still using it months later.

## What did they find?

- **Insertion success**: The device could be inserted successfully at any timing
- **Device falling out**: When inserted immediately, the device was more likely to fall out within 6 months compared to later insertion
- **Continued use**: Women who had immediate insertion were more likely to be using the device at 6 months than those scheduled for later insertion

## What does this mean?

Having effective birth control right after delivery may be worth the higher risk of the device falling out, especially since many women don't return for later appointments. Doctors can check for problems during follow-up visits and teach women warning signs that the device may have fallen out.",0,Plano,"Plain-Language Summary

Purpose
- To compare placing an intrauterine contraceptive (IUC) right after birth (within 10 minutes of delivering the placenta) with placing it later.

Who was studied
- Women who had just given birth (vaginal or cesarean) and wanted an IUC.
- Studies included different IUC types, such as the levonorgestrel IUS (LNG-IUS) and the copper T 380A IUD.

What was tested
- Immediate postplacental insertion (within 10 minutes).
- Early postpartum insertion (10 minutes to 48 hours after birth).
- Standard insertion at a later postpartum visit.

Main outcomes measured
- Successful placement.
- IUC coming out on its own (expulsion).
- Continued use at 3, 6, and 12 months.

How the research was done
- Review of 15 randomized trials found up to April 1, 2015.
- Four newer, moderate-quality trials compared timing after vaginal or cesarean birth.

Key findings
- Immediate vs early (10 minutes to 48 hours): In a small pilot study, expulsion and use at 6 months were similar.
- Immediate vs standard (later clinic visit):
  - Successful placement: similar overall; one small study suggested higher placement with immediate insertion.
  - Expulsion by 6 months: higher with immediate insertion.
  - Use at 6 months: higher with immediate insertion.
  - Use at 3 or 12 months: no clear difference in small individual trials.

Timing of checks
- Outcomes were tracked at about 3, 6, and 12 months after birth.

Safety notes
- Main risk noted was higher chance of the IUC coming out when placed immediately.
- Data on other side effects were limited.
- Follow-up visits can help find early expulsion.
- Teaching people the signs of expulsion can help with early detection.

Limitations
- Many studies were small, and some older reports had limited details.
- More, larger trials are needed to better estimate expulsion rates and side effects.

What this means
- Placing an IUC right after birth may help more people be using it at 6 months.
- This benefit comes with a higher chance the device may come out, so follow-up and education are important."
148,"Background
Diverticulitis is a complication of the common condition, diverticulosis. Uncomplicated diverticulitis has traditionally been treated with antibiotics, as diverticulitis has been regarded as an infectious disease. Risk factors for diverticulitis, however, may suggest that the condition is inflammatory rather than infectious which makes the use of antibiotics questionable. 
Objectives
The objectives of this systematic review were to determine if antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis affects the risk of complications (immediate or late) or the need for emergency surgery. 
Search methods
For this update, a comprehensive systematic literature search was conducted in Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trial Registry Platform on February 2021. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including all types of patients with a radiologically confirmed diagnosis of left‐sided uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. Comparator and interventions included antibiotics compared to no antibiotics, placebo, or to any other antibiotic treatment (different regimens, routes of administration, dosage or duration of treatment). Primary outcome measures were complications and emergency surgery. Secondary outcomes were recurrence, late complications, elective colonic resections, length of hospital stay, length to recovery of symptoms, adverse events and mortality. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors performed the searches, identification and assessment of RCTs and data extraction. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or involvement of the third author. Authors of trials were contacted to obtain additional data if needed or for preliminary results of ongoing trials. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias was used to assess the methodological quality of the identified trials. The overall quality of evidence for outcomes was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Effect estimates were extracted as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals. Random‐effects meta‐analyses were performed with the Mantel‐Haenzel method. 
Main results
The authors included five studies. Three studies compared no antibiotics to antibiotics; all three were original RCTs of which two also published long‐term follow‐up information.  For the outcome of short‐term complications there may be little or no difference between antibiotics and no antibiotics (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.30 to 2.62; 3 studies, 1329 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The rate of emergency surgery within 30 days may be lower with no antibiotics compared to antibiotics (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.13, 1.71; 1329 participants; 3 studies; low‐certainty evidence). However, there is considerable imprecision due to wide confidence intervals for this effect estimate causing uncertainty which means that there may also be a benefit with antibiotics. 
One of the two remaining trials compared single to double compound antibiotic therapy and, due to wide confidence intervals, the estimate was imprecise and indicated an uncertain clinical effect between these two antibiotic regimens (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.11 to 4.58; 51 participants; 1 study; low‐certainty evidence). The last trial compared short to long intravenous administration of antibiotics and did not report any events for our primary outcomes. Both trials included few participants and one had overall high risk of bias. 
Since the first publication of this systematic review, an increasing amount of evidence supporting the treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis without antibiotics has been published, but the total body of evidence is still limited. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence on antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated acute diverticulitis suggests that the effect of antibiotics is uncertain for complications, emergency surgery, recurrence, elective colonic resections, and long‐term complications. The quality of the evidence is low. Only three RCTs on the need for antibiotics are currently available. More trials are needed to obtain more precise effect estimates.","Antibiotics for uncomplicated diverticulitis
Diverticulitis is a condition with inflammation of the so‐called diverticulae. A diverticulae is a weakness in the bowel wall. Diverticulae are common in the population, especially in the elderly above the age of 60 years, and are often asymptomatic. Diverticulitis may present as abdominal pain and tenderness accompanied by signs of infection, such as fever. In most cases, diverticulitis resolves without complications, however, some patients develop complications and may need emergency surgery. 
Uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is the focus of this review. It has traditionally been regarded as an infection with bacterial overgrowth in the large intestine and has been treated with antibiotics. Recently, it has been argued that diverticulitis is more likely to be an inflammatory rather than an infectious condition, making the use of antibiotics questionable. Consequently, a shift towards the use of therapeutic regimens without antibiotics has been seen. This present review investigates whether there is any existing clinical evidence supporting the use of antibiotics for uncomplicated diverticulitis. 
Five clinical trials in hospitalised patients were assessed. One trial investigated two different antibiotic treatments and a second study investigated the duration of intravenous antibiotic treatment. Three trials investigated the actual need for antibiotics when compared to no antibiotics of which two trials had published long‐term follow‐up results as separate records. None of the studies found a statistical difference in the tested antibiotic regimens. Comparing no antibiotic versus antibiotic treatment did not demonstrate any differences in the occurrence of complications like abscesses and perforations of the large intestine, or in the need for emergency surgery. 
Antibiotics can cause serious adverse effects, including life‐threatening allergic reactions or super‐infections of the intestine. Growing antibiotic resistance is an increasing problem rendering some infections impossible to treat with possible fatal outcomes. Therefore, strong arguments in favour of limiting the current use of antibiotics exist. Only three randomised controlled trials on the need of antibiotics are currently available and more are needed in order to obtain strong and reliable evidence. However, the newest evidence shows that the use of antibiotics for the treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is not superior to treatments that do not include antibiotics.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Antibiotics for Uncomplicated Diverticulitis

## What was this review about?

Researchers looked at whether antibiotics are needed to treat uncomplicated diverticulitis. Diverticulitis happens when small pouches in the colon (called diverticula) become inflamed. Doctors have traditionally treated this condition with antibiotics because they thought it was caused by infection. However, it might actually be caused by inflammation instead, which would mean antibiotics may not be necessary.

## What did the researchers do?

The research team searched medical databases through February 2021 for studies that tested antibiotic treatment in adults with uncomplicated diverticulitis confirmed by medical imaging. They found 5 studies to review:
- 3 studies compared using antibiotics versus not using antibiotics
- 1 study compared using one antibiotic versus two antibiotics together
- 1 study compared short versus long treatment with antibiotics given through an IV

## What did they find?

**Antibiotics versus no antibiotics:**
- There may be little to no difference in complications between people who took antibiotics and those who didn't
- People who didn't take antibiotics might have needed emergency surgery slightly less often within 30 days, but the results were unclear
- The researchers followed some patients for longer periods and looked at other outcomes like repeat episodes, planned surgeries, hospital stay length, recovery time, side effects, and deaths

**Different antibiotic approaches:**
The two studies comparing different antibiotic methods were too small to draw clear conclusions.

## What does this mean?

The evidence suggests that antibiotics may not be necessary for treating uncomplicated diverticulitis, but more research is needed to be certain. Only 3 studies have compared antibiotics to no antibiotics, and the quality of evidence is considered low. Doctors and patients should discuss treatment options based on individual circumstances.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

Purpose
- To find out if antibiotics help people with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis, or if they can safely get better without antibiotics.

Who was studied
- Adults with left-sided, uncomplicated acute diverticulitis confirmed by scans.
- Studies were randomized controlled trials.

What was compared
- Antibiotics vs no antibiotics (or placebo).
- Different antibiotic types (one drug vs two drugs).
- Short vs long courses of IV antibiotics.

What outcomes were measured
- Main: short-term complications and need for emergency surgery.
- Others: return of symptoms (recurrence), later complications, planned colon surgery, length of hospital stay, time to feel better, side effects, and death.

What the review found
- 5 trials were included. Three trials (1,329 people) compared antibiotics to no antibiotics.
- For short-term complications: little to no difference between antibiotics and no antibiotics.
- For emergency surgery within 30 days: results were uncertain; no clear benefit for antibiotics.
- For different antibiotic regimens (1 small trial, 51 people): no clear difference.
- For short vs long IV antibiotics (1 small trial): no clear difference for main outcomes.
- Many results were imprecise because of small study sizes.

Safety
- Side effects and deaths were tracked, but the evidence was too limited to show clear differences between groups.

Timeline and size
- Evidence was searched up to February 2021.
- Two trials also reported longer-term follow-up.
- Overall evidence quality was low.

What this means
- For uncomplicated acute diverticulitis, it is unclear if antibiotics improve outcomes like complications or need for emergency surgery.
- More and larger trials are needed to know when antibiotics are truly helpful."
149,"Background
Amphetamine dependence is a public health problem with medical, psychiatric, cognitive, legal and socioeconomic consequences. To date, no pharmacological treatment has been approved for this disorder, and psychotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment. In recent years, psychostimulants have been investigated as a possible replacement therapy. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of psychostimulant medications for amphetamine abuse or dependence. The influences of type of drug, type of dependence, comorbid disorders, clinical trial risk of bias and publication of data were also studied. 
Search methods
Relevant trials were searched in the following sources: PubMed (January 1966 to 6 June 2012), EMBASE (January 1988 to 6 June 2012), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library, Issue 5 of 12, May 2012), PsycINFO (January 1985 to 6 June 2012) and the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Drug and Alcohol Group (June 2012). We also searched the reference lists of retrieved trials, the list of studies citing the included trials and the main electronic registers of ongoing trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and EU Clinical Trials Register). Finally, we contacted investigators to request information about unpublished trials. Searches included non－English language literature. 
Selection criteria
All randomised, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐group clinical trials investigating the efficacy or safety of psychostimulants for amphetamine dependence or abuse conducted in an outpatient setting. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.
Main results
Eleven studies were included in the review (791 participants). Studied psychostimulants included dexamphetamine, bupropion, methylphenidate and modafinil. No significant differences were found between psychostimulants and placebo for any of the studied efficacy outcomes. Overall retention in studies was low (50.4%). Psychostimulants did not reduce amphetamine use (mean difference (MD) ‐0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.85 to 0.33) or amphetamine craving (MD 0.07, 95% CI ‐0.44 to 0.59) and did not increase sustained abstinence (relative risk (RR) 1.12, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.49). The proportion of adverse events inducing dropout was similar for psychostimulants and placebo (risk difference (RD) 0.01, 95% CI ‐0.03 to 0.04). The main findings did not change in any subgroup analysis. 
Authors' conclusions
Results of this review do not support the use of psychostimulant medications at the tested doses as a replacement therapy for amphetamine abuse or dependence. Future research could change this conclusion, as the numbers of included studies and participants are limited and information on relevant outcomes, such as efficacy according to the severity of dependence or craving, is still missing.","Efficacy of psychostimulant drugs for amphetamine abuse or dependence
Amphetamine dependence constitutes a public health problem with many consequences and complications. Amphetamine abuse refers to a maladaptive and hazardous pattern of use considered to be less severe than dependence. To date, no pharmacological treatment has been approved for amphetamine abuse or dependence, and psychotherapy remains the best treatment option. 
Long‐term amphetamine use reduces dopamine levels in the brain. Drugs increasing dopamine and mimicking the effects of amphetamines with lower abuse liability could be used as replacement therapy in amphetamine dependence. Several psychostimulants have been studied recently for this purpose. 
In this review, the efficacy and safety of psychostimulants for amphetamine abuse or dependence were studied. We found eleven studies enrolling 791 amphetamine‐dependent participants and assessing the effects of four different psychostimulants: dexamphetamine, bupropion, methylphenidate and modafinil. Psychosocial interventions were additionally provided to all participants. The studies were conducted in the USA, Australia or Northern Europe, and study length ranged from 8 to 20 weeks. 
Psychostimulants did not reduce amphetamine use or amphetamine craving and also did not increase sustained abstinence in comparison with placebo. Retention in treatment was similar and low with both treatments. Psychostimulants also did not increase the risk of adverse events that were intense enough to induce dropouts. 
Research with larger and longer trials is needed to determine whether psychostimulants can be a useful replacement therapy for patients with amphetamine abuse or dependence. The design of future trials should consider the level of dependence at study entry, the potency and the dose of the psychostimulant administered, the length of the trial and the representativeness of included participants.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Testing Medications for Amphetamine Dependence

## What was this review about?

Researchers wanted to find out if certain medications called psychostimulants could help people who are dependent on amphetamines. Amphetamine dependence causes serious health, mental, legal, and social problems. Currently, there are no approved medications for this condition, and counseling is the main treatment option.

## What did the researchers do?

They searched medical databases from 1966 to 2012 for studies that tested psychostimulant medications. They found 11 studies involving 791 people. These studies tested four different medications: dexamphetamine, bupropion, methylphenidate, and modafinil. All participants received either one of these medications or a placebo (inactive pill) and were treated as outpatients.

## What did they find?

The medications did not work better than placebo for helping people with amphetamine dependence. Specifically:

- The medications did not reduce how much amphetamine people used
- They did not reduce cravings for amphetamines
- They did not help people stay off amphetamines for longer periods
- About half of the participants (50%) dropped out of the studies before they ended
- Side effects were similar between the medication and placebo groups

## What does this mean?

Based on these studies, psychostimulant medications at the doses tested do not appear to be helpful for treating amphetamine dependence. However, more research is needed because only a limited number of studies and people were included in this review.",0,Plano,"Plain-Language Summary

Purpose
- To see if certain stimulant medicines can help people stop or reduce amphetamine use, and to check their safety.

Who was included
- Adults in outpatient programs with amphetamine abuse or dependence.
- 11 randomized, placebo-controlled studies with 791 total participants.

Medicines studied
- Dexamphetamine
- Bupropion
- Methylphenidate
- Modafinil

What researchers did
- Compared each medicine to a placebo (a pill with no active drug).
- Looked at how well people stayed in treatment and reduced or stopped amphetamine use.
- Checked side effects and dropouts due to side effects.

Main outcomes measured
- Amphetamine use (drug tests or reports)
- Craving
- Sustained abstinence (staying off amphetamines)
- Staying in the study (retention)
- Adverse events (side effects leading to stopping the study drug)

Key results
- No medicine worked better than placebo for:
  - Reducing amphetamine use
  - Lowering craving
  - Achieving sustained abstinence
- Retention was low overall (about half stayed in the studies).
- Side effects causing people to drop out were about the same for medicine and placebo.

Safety
- The proportion of dropouts due to side effects was similar between medicine and placebo groups.

Timing and sources
- Studies were found through searches of major databases and trial registers up to June 2012.

Limits
- Only 11 studies with a modest number of participants.
- Some important details (like how results vary by severity of dependence) were missing.

Bottom line
- At the tested doses, these stimulant medicines did not help people reduce or stop amphetamine use better than placebo, and they had similar side effect dropout rates. More research may be needed."
150,"Background
Approximately 3.7 million people died from acute coronary syndrome worldwide in 2012. Acute coronary syndrome, also known as myocardial infarction or unstable angina pectoris, is caused by a sudden blockage of the blood supplied to the heart muscle. Percutaneous coronary intervention is often used for acute coronary syndrome, but previous systematic reviews on the effects of drug‐eluting stents compared with bare‐metal stents have shown conflicting results with regard to myocardial infarction; have not fully taken account of the risk of random and systematic errors; and have not included all relevant randomised clinical trials. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of drug‐eluting stents versus bare‐metal stents in people with acute coronary syndrome. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, SCI‐EXPANDED, and BIOSIS from their inception to January 2017. We also searched two clinical trials registers, the European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration databases, and pharmaceutical company websites. In addition, we searched the reference lists of review articles and relevant trials. 
Selection criteria
Randomised clinical trials assessing the effects of drug‐eluting stents versus bare‐metal stents for acute coronary syndrome. We included trials irrespective of publication type, status, date, or language. 
Data collection and analysis
We followed our published protocol and the methodological recommendations of Cochrane. Two review authors independently extracted data. We assessed the risks of systematic error by bias domains. We conducted Trial Sequential Analyses to control the risks of random errors. Our primary outcomes were all‐cause mortality, major cardiovascular events, serious adverse events, and quality of life. Our secondary outcomes were angina, cardiovascular mortality, and myocardial infarction. Our primary assessment time point was at maximum follow‐up. We assessed the quality of the evidence by the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included 25 trials randomising a total of 12,503 participants. All trials were at high risk of bias, and the quality of evidence according to GRADE was low to very low. We included 22 trials where the participants presented with ST‐elevation myocardial infarction, 1 trial where participants presented with non‐ST‐elevation myocardial infarction, and 2 trials where participants presented with a mix of acute coronary syndromes. 
Meta‐analyses at maximum follow‐up showed no evidence of a difference when comparing drug‐eluting stents with bare‐metal stents on the risk of all‐cause mortality or major cardiovascular events. The absolute risk of death was 6.97% in the drug‐eluting stents group compared with 7.74% in the bare‐metal stents group based on the risk ratio (RR) of 0.90 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.03, 11,250 participants, 21 trials/22 comparisons, low‐quality evidence). The absolute risk of a major cardiovascular event was 6.36% in the drug‐eluting stents group compared with 6.63% in the bare‐metal stents group based on the RR of 0.96 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.11, 10,939 participants, 19 trials/20 comparisons, very low‐quality evidence). The results of Trial Sequential Analysis showed that we did not have sufficient information to confirm or reject our anticipated risk ratio reduction of 10% on either all‐cause mortality or major cardiovascular events at maximum follow‐up. 
Meta‐analyses at maximum follow‐up showed evidence of a benefit when comparing drug‐eluting stents with bare‐metal stents on the risk of a serious adverse event. The absolute risk of a serious adverse event was 18.04% in the drug‐eluting stents group compared with 23.01% in the bare‐metal stents group based on the RR of 0.80 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.86, 11,724 participants, 22 trials/23 comparisons, low‐quality evidence), and Trial Sequential Analysis confirmed this result. When assessing each specific type of adverse event included in the serious adverse event outcome separately, the majority of the events were target vessel revascularisation. When target vessel revascularisation was analysed separately, meta‐analysis showed evidence of a benefit of drug‐eluting stents, and Trial Sequential Analysis confirmed this result. 
Meta‐analyses at maximum follow‐up showed no evidence of a difference when comparing drug‐eluting stents with bare‐metal stents on the risk of cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.09, 9248 participants, 14 trials/15 comparisons, very low‐quality evidence) or myocardial infarction (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.18, 10,217 participants, 18 trials/19 comparisons, very low‐quality evidence). The results of the Trial Sequential Analysis showed that we had insufficient information to confirm or reject our anticipated risk ratio reduction of 10% on cardiovascular mortality and myocardial infarction. 
No trials reported results on quality of life or angina.
Authors' conclusions
The current evidence suggests that drug‐eluting stents may lead to fewer serious adverse events compared with bare‐metal stents without increasing the risk of all‐cause mortality or major cardiovascular events. However, our Trial Sequential Analysis showed that there currently was not enough information to assess a risk ratio reduction of 10% for all‐cause mortality, major cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, or myocardial infarction, and there were no data on quality of life or angina. The evidence in this review was of low to very low quality, and the true result may depart substantially from the results presented in this review. 
More randomised clinical trials with low risk of bias and low risks of random errors are needed if the benefits and harms of drug‐eluting stents for acute coronary syndrome are to be assessed properly. More data are needed on the outcomes all‐cause mortality, major cardiovascular events, quality of life, and angina to reduce the risk of random error.","Benefits and harms of drug‐eluting versus bare‐metal stents in people with acute coronary syndrome 
Background 
Acute coronary syndrome is a term applied to heart attacks as well as chest pain during rest. The syndrome is caused by decreased blood supply to the heart due to either a narrowing of the vessels supplying the heart or a blood clot. According to the World Health Organization, 3.7 million people died from acute coronary syndrome in 2012. Percutaneous coronary intervention, commonly known as coronary angioplasty, is used to treat the narrowed or blocked vessel of the heart by inflating a balloon to allow blood to flow through the vessel again. Coronary stents are then inserted into the vessel to ensure it remains open. Two types of stents are available for use, a stent that is coated with a drug intended to reduce the risk of future blockages (drug‐eluting stent) and an uncoated stent (bare‐metal stent). In this review, we aimed to assess the benefits and harms of drug‐eluting stents compared with bare‐metal stents. 
Study characteristics 
We searched scientific databases from their inception to January 2017 and found 25 trials where people were randomly allocated to either a group receiving drug‐eluting stents or a group receiving bare‐metal stents. The 25 trials (26 comparisons) included 12,503 adults with a mean age of 60.8 years. 
Key results 
The people receiving drug‐eluting stents did seem to have a reduced risk of experiencing a serious adverse event compared with those receiving bare‐metal stents, without affecting the risk of dying from any cause or specifically heart disease, or of having a heart attack. The serious adverse event likely to be avoided by those receiving drug‐eluting stents seems to be repeat balloon angioplasty. No data were reported on quality of life or chest pain (angina) after receiving the stent. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence should be interpreted with caution, as we judged the quality to be low to very low due to limitations of the included randomised clinical trials. The reason for the very low‐quality judgement was mainly due to all included trials being at high risk of bias. Consequently, the results may show more benefit of drug‐eluting stents than the 'real life' effect would show. Furthermore, most of the outcomes in our review lacked sufficient statistical power. Future well‐designed randomised clinical trials may therefore change the above‐mentioned results.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Comparing Two Types of Stents for Heart Attack Patients

## What was this study about?

When someone has a heart attack (also called acute coronary syndrome), blood flow to the heart muscle is suddenly blocked. Doctors often treat this by placing a small mesh tube called a stent inside the blocked blood vessel to keep it open. There are two main types of stents:
- **Drug-eluting stents** – coated with medication that slowly releases over time
- **Bare-metal stents** – plain metal tubes without medication

Researchers wanted to find out which type works better and is safer for people who have had a heart attack.

## What did the researchers do?

They reviewed 25 studies that included 12,503 people who had heart attacks. These studies compared outcomes between people who received drug-eluting stents and those who received bare-metal stents. The researchers looked at medical databases through January 2017 to find all relevant studies.

## What did they find?

**No clear difference in major outcomes:**
- About 7 out of 100 people died in both groups
- About 6-7 out of 100 people had major heart-related events in both groups
- Heart attack rates were similar in both groups

**Fewer serious problems with drug-eluting stents:**
- About 18 out of 100 people with drug-eluting stents had serious problems compared to 23 out of 100 with bare-metal stents
- Most of these problems involved needing another procedure to reopen the blood vessel

**Missing information:**
- No studies reported on quality of life or chest pain (angina)

## What does this mean?

Drug-eluting stents may cause fewer serious problems than bare-metal stents, particularly reducing the need for repeat procedures. However, the evidence quality was low, and more research is needed to be certain about the differences between these two types of stents.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

Purpose
- To compare two types of heart stents used during emergency treatment for a blocked heart artery: drug‑eluting stents (DES) and bare‑metal stents (BMS).
- To see benefits and harms, including death, heart problems, side effects, and quality of life.

Who was studied
- Adults treated for acute coronary syndrome (a sudden drop in blood flow to the heart).
- 25 randomized trials, 12,503 people in total.
- Most trials included people with ST‑elevation heart attacks.

What was done
- People were randomly given either a drug‑eluting stent or a bare‑metal stent during a heart procedure (angioplasty).
- Researchers looked at results at the longest follow‑up available for each trial.

Main outcomes measured
- Death from any cause.
- Major heart problems (combined outcome).
- Serious side effects (such as needing another procedure on the same artery).
- Death from heart causes and heart attacks.
- Quality of life and chest pain (angina).

Key results
- Death: No clear difference between DES and BMS (about 7.0% with DES vs 7.7% with BMS).
- Major heart problems: No clear difference.
- Serious side effects: Lower with DES (about 18.0% with DES vs 23.0% with BMS). Most of the reduction was fewer repeat procedures on the same artery.
- Death from heart causes and heart attacks: No clear difference.
- Quality of life and angina: Not reported.

Safety
- DES did not increase death or heart attack compared with BMS.
- DES likely reduces the need for another artery procedure.

Evidence quality and limits
- Overall evidence quality was low to very low.
- Many trials had a high risk of bias.
- There was not enough information to confirm a small (10%) change in risk for death or major heart events.
- More high‑quality trials are needed, especially reporting quality of life and angina."
151,"Background
Social skills programmes (SSP) are treatment strategies aimed at enhancing the social performance and reducing the distress and difficulty experienced by people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and can be incorporated as part of the rehabilitation package for people with schizophrenia. 
Objectives
The primary objective is to investigate the effects of social skills training programmes, compared to standard care, for people with schizophrenia. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register (November 2006 and December 2011) which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. We inspected references of all identified studies for further trials. 
A further search for studies has been conducted by the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group in 2015, 37 citations have been found and are currently being assessed by review authors. 
Selection criteria
We included all relevant randomised controlled trials for social skills programmes versus standard care involving people with serious mental illnesses. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) and 95% CIs. 
Main results
We included 13 randomised trials (975 participants). These evaluated social skills programmes versus standard care, or discussion group. We found evidence in favour of social skills programmes compared to standard care on all measures of social functioning. We also found that rates of relapse and rehospitalisation were lower for social skills compared to standard care (relapse: 2 RCTs, n = 263, RR 0.52 CI 0.34 to 0.79, very low quality evidence), (rehospitalisation: 1 RCT, n = 143, RR 0.53 CI 0.30 to 0.93, very low quality evidence) and participants’ mental state results (1 RCT, n = 91, MD ‐4.01 CI ‐7.52 to ‐0.50, very low quality evidence) were better in the group receiving social skill programmes. Global state was measured in one trial by numbers not experiencing a clinical improvement, results favoured social skills (1 RCT, n = 67, RR 0.29 CI 0.12 to 0.68, very low quality evidence). Quality of life was also improved in the social skills programme compared to standard care (1 RCT, n = 112, MD ‐7.60 CI ‐12.18 to ‐3.02, very low quality evidence). However, when social skills programmes were compared to a discussion group control, we found no significant differences in the participants social functioning, relapse rates, mental state or quality of life, again the quality of evidence for these outcomes was very low. 
Authors' conclusions
Compared to standard care, social skills training may improve the social skills of people with schizophrenia and reduce relapse rates, but at present, the evidence is very limited with data rated as very low quality. When social skills training was compared to discussion there was no difference on patients outcomes. Cultural differences might limit the applicability of the current results, as most reported studies were conducted in China. Whether social skills training can improve social functioning of people with schizophrenia in different settings remains unclear and should be investigated in a large multi‐centre randomised controlled trial.","Social skills programmes for people with schizophrenia
Social skills programmes (SSP) use behavioural therapy and techniques for teaching individuals to communicate their emotions and requests. This means they are more likely to achieve their goals, meet their needs for relationships and for independent living as well as getting on with other people and socially adjusting. Social skills programmes involve 'model learning' (role playing) which was introduced to improve general 'molecular' skills (eye contact, fluency of speech, gestures) and 'molar' skills (managing negative emotions, giving positive feedback). Social skills programmes enhance social performance and reduce the distress and difficulty experienced by people with schizophrenia. Social skills programmes can be incorporated as part of a rehabilitation package for people with schizophrenia. 
The main objective of this review is to investigate the effectiveness of social skills programmes, compared to standard care or discussion groups, for people with schizophrenia. Based on searches carried out in 2006 and 2011, this review includes 13 trials with a total of 975 participants. Authors chose seven main outcomes of interest, all data for these outcomes were rated to be very low quality. The review found significant differences in favour of social skills programmes compared to standard care on all measures of social functioning. Rates of relapse were lower for social skills compared to standard care and there was a significant difference in favour of social skills on people’s mental state. Quality of life was also improved in the social skills programme compared to standard care. However, when social skills programmes were compared to discussion groups, there were no significant differences in people’s social functioning, relapse rates, mental state or quality of life. 
Compared to standard care, social skills programmes may improve the social skills of people with schizophrenia and reduce relapse rates. However, at the moment evidence is very limited with data only of very low quality available. Cultural differences might also limit the relevance of current results, as most reported studies were conducted in China. Whether social skills programmes or training can improve the social functioning of people with schizophrenia in different settings remains unclear and should be further investigated in a large multi‐centre randomised controlled trial.

## What was this review about?

Researchers wanted to know if social skills training programs help people with schizophrenia. These programs teach people how to interact better with others and handle social situations. The goal is to help reduce stress and improve daily life.

## What did the researchers do?

They searched medical databases through 2011 for studies that compared social skills training to regular care. They found 13 studies with 975 people total. Most studies were done in China.

## What did they find?

When comparing social skills training to regular care:
- People who received social skills training showed better social abilities
- Fewer people had their symptoms return (relapse)
- Fewer people needed to go back to the hospital
- Mental health symptoms improved slightly
- Quality of life got better

However, when social skills training was compared to discussion groups (where people just talked together), there were no clear differences in results.

## What does this mean?

Social skills training might help people with schizophrenia improve their social abilities and reduce hospital visits compared to regular care alone. However, the researchers noted the evidence quality was very low, meaning we can't be completely confident in these findings. Most studies were done in China, so the results might not apply everywhere. More research with larger, better-designed studies in different locations is needed to know for sure if social skills training works.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

What is being studied
- Social skills programs are classes that help people practice everyday social tasks. The goal is to see if these programs help people with schizophrenia do better in daily life compared to standard care.

Who was in the studies
- Adults with serious mental illness, mainly schizophrenia.
- 13 randomized trials with 975 people. Many studies were done in China.

What treatments were compared
- Social skills programs vs. standard care.
- Some studies also compared social skills programs to a discussion group.

What outcomes were measured
- Social functioning (how well people manage social tasks).
- Relapse and rehospitalization.
- Mental state and overall improvement.
- Quality of life.
- Safety information (side effects) was not well reported.

Key results
- Compared to standard care:
  - Social functioning was better with social skills programs.
  - Relapse and rehospitalization were lower.
  - Mental state scores and overall improvement were better.
  - Quality of life was higher.
  - Note: The evidence for all these findings was very low quality.
- Compared to a discussion group:
  - No important differences were found in social functioning, relapse, mental state, or quality of life (very low quality evidence).

Timing
- Researchers searched medical databases in 2006 and 2011. An additional search in 2015 found 37 more citations that were still being assessed at that time.

Safety
- Side effects or harms were not clearly reported, so safety is uncertain.

What this means
- Social skills programs may help compared to standard care, but the evidence is weak and many studies were in one country. We need larger, high-quality studies in different settings to know for sure."
152,"Background
Primary malaria prevention on a large scale depends on two vector control interventions: indoor residual spraying (IRS) and insecticide‐treated mosquito nets (ITNs). Historically, IRS has reduced malaria transmission in many settings in the world, but the health effects of IRS have never been properly quantified. This is important, and will help compare IRS with other vector control interventions. 
Objectives
To quantify the impact of IRS alone, and to compare the relative impacts of IRS and ITNs, on key malariological parameters. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (September 2009), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to September 2009), EMBASE (1974 to September 2009), LILACS (1982 to September 2009), mRCT (September 2009), reference lists, and conference abstracts. We also contacted researchers in the field, organizations, and manufacturers of insecticides (June 2007). 
Selection criteria
Cluster randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled before‐and‐after studies (CBA) and interrupted time series (ITS) of IRS compared to no IRS or ITNs. Studies examining the impact of IRS on special groups not representative of the general population, or using insecticides and dosages not recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) were excluded. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently reviewed trials for inclusion. Two authors extracted data, assessed risk of bias and analysed the data. Where possible, we adjusted confidence intervals (CIs) for clustering. Studies were grouped into those comparing IRS with no IRS, and IRS compared with ITNs, and then stratified by malaria endemicity. 
Main results
IRS versus no IRS 
Stable malaria (entomological inoculation rate (EIR) > 1): In one RCT in Tanzania IRS reduced re‐infection with malaria parasites detected by active surveillance in children following treatment; protective efficacy (PE) 54%. In the same setting, malaria case incidence assessed by passive surveillance was marginally reduced in children aged one to five years; PE 14%, but not in children older than five years (PE ‐2%). In the IRS group, malaria prevalence was slightly lower but this was not significant (PE 6%), but mean haemoglobin was higher (mean difference 0.85 g/dL). 
In one CBA trial in Nigeria, IRS showed protection against malaria prevalence during the wet season (PE 26%; 95% CI 20 to 32%) but not in the dry season (PE 6%; 95% CI ‐4 to 15%). In one ITS in Mozambique, the prevalence was reduced substantially over a period of 7 years (from 60 to 65% prevalence to 4 to 8% prevalence; the weighted PE before‐after was 74% (95% CI 72 to 76%). 
Unstable malaria (EIR < 1): In two RCTs, IRS reduced the incidence rate of all malaria infections;PE 31% in India, and 88% (95% CI 69 to 96%) in Pakistan. By malaria species, IRS also reduced the incidence of P. falciparum (PE 93%, 95% CI 61 to 98% in Pakistan) and P. vivax (PE 79%, 95% CI 45 to 90% in Pakistan); There were similar impacts on malaria prevalence for any infection: PE 76% in Pakistan; PE 28% in India. When looking separately by parasite species, for P. falciparum there was a PE of 92% in Pakistan and 34% in India; forP. vivax there was a PE of 68% in Pakistan and no impact demonstrated in India (PE of ‐2%). 
IRS versus Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs) 
Stable malaria (EIR > 1): Only one RCT was done in an area of stable transmission (in Tanzania). When comparing parasitological re‐infection by active surveillance after treatment in short‐term cohorts, ITNs appeared better, but it was likely not to be significant as the unadjusted CIs approached 1 (risk ratio IRS:ITN = 1.22). When the incidence of malaria episodes was measured by passive case detection, no difference was found in children aged one to five years (risk ratio = 0.88, direction in favour of IRS). No difference was found for malaria prevalence or haemoglobin. 
Unstable malaria (EIR < 1): Two studies; for incidence and prevalence, the malaria rates were higher in the IRS group compared to the ITN group in one study. Malaria incidence was higher in the IRS arm in India (risk ratio IRS:ITN = 1.48) and in South Africa (risk ratio 1.34 but the cluster unadjusted CIs included 1). For malaria prevalence, ITNs appeared to give better protection against any infection compared to IRS in India (risk ratio IRS:ITN = 1.70) and also for both P. falciparum (risk ratio IRS:ITN = 1.78) and P. vivax (risk ratio IRS:ITN = 1.37). 
Authors' conclusions
Historical and programme documentation has clearly established the impact of IRS. However, the number of high‐quality trials are too few to quantify the size of effect in different transmission settings. The evidence from randomized comparisons of IRS versus no IRS confirms that IRS reduces malaria incidence in unstable malaria settings, but randomized trial data from stable malaria settings is very limited. Some limited data suggest that ITN give better protection than IRS in unstable areas, but more trials are needed to compare the effects of ITNs with IRS, as well as to quantify their combined effects. Ideally future trials should try and evaluate the effect of IRS in areas with no previous history of malaria control activities.","Indoor residual spraying for preventing malaria
Spraying houses with insecticides (indoor residual spraying; IRS) to kill mosquitoes is one of the main methods that have been used to control malaria on a large scale. IRS has helped to eliminate malaria from great parts of Asia, Russia, Europe, and Latin America, and successful IRS programmes have also been run in parts of Africa. 
Another successful method of mosquito control relies on the use of physical barriers such as bednets or curtains that can also be sprayed with insecticides (insecticide treated nets; ITN). This review aims to look at the health benefits of IRS and to compare this method with ITNs. 
This review does not assess the potentially adverse effects of insecticides used for IRS, and it includes not only randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but also controlled before‐and‐after studies (CBA) and interrupted time series (ITS), as these methods were considered suitably rigorous. 
Six studies were identified for inclusion (four cluster RCTs, one CBA and one ITS). Four of these studies were conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa, one in India and one in Pakistan. IRS reduced malaria transmission in young children by half compared to no IRS in Tanzania (an area where people are regularly exposed to malaria), and protected all age groups in India and Pakistan (where malaria transmission is more unstable and where more than one type of malaria is found).   
When compared with ITNs, IRS appeared more protective (according to the outcome chosen) in one trial conducted in an area of stable malaria transmission, but ITN seemed to be more protective than IRS in unstable areas. Unfortunately, the level of evidence is very limited and no firm conclusions should be drawn on the basis of this review. 
In conclusion, although IRS programmes have shown impressive success in malaria reduction throughout the world, there are too few well‐run trials to be able to quantify the effects of IRS in areas with different malaria transmission, or to properly compare IRS and ITN.  High‐quality and long‐duration trials on a large scale, done in areas where there has been little or no mosquito control are still urgently required. New trials should include an IRS arm and an ITN arm, and should also assess the combined effect of ITN and IRS, a very important question in view of malaria elimination.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Testing Indoor Spraying to Prevent Malaria

## What was this study about?

Researchers reviewed studies to see how well indoor insecticide spraying (IRS) works to prevent malaria. IRS means spraying the inside walls of homes with chemicals that kill mosquitoes. They also wanted to compare IRS to insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs).

## Why was this important?

IRS and bed nets are the two main ways communities try to prevent malaria on a large scale. While IRS has been used for many years around the world, researchers had never carefully measured exactly how well it works. This information helps health officials decide which prevention methods work best.

## What did the researchers do?

They searched for studies done through 2009 that tested IRS. They looked for studies that:
- Compared communities using IRS to communities not using IRS
- Compared IRS to bed nets
- Measured malaria cases, infections, or related health outcomes

They grouped studies by whether they were done in areas where malaria is common year-round (stable malaria) or areas where it comes and goes (unstable malaria).

## What did they find?

**IRS compared to no IRS:**

In areas with year-round malaria:
- IRS reduced new malaria infections in children by about half in one study
- IRS slightly reduced malaria cases in young children but not older children
- Children in areas with IRS had slightly higher blood counts

In areas with seasonal malaria:
- IRS reduced malaria infections by 31% to 88%
- IRS reduced the number of people with malaria parasites in their blood

**IRS compared to bed nets:**

In areas with year-round malaria, one study found little difference between IRS and bed nets.

In areas with seasonal malaria, bed nets appeared to work better than IRS in two studies.

## What does this mean?

IRS does help prevent malaria, especially in areas where malaria comes and goes seasonally. However, there weren't enough high-quality studies to know exactly how well IRS works in all situations. Some evidence suggests bed nets might work better than IRS in certain areas, but more research is needed to be sure. More studies are also needed to understand if using both methods together works better than either one alone.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary of the research review

Purpose
- To measure how well indoor residual spraying (IRS) prevents malaria.
- To compare IRS with insecticide-treated nets (ITNs).

Who was included
- Community studies from several countries in Africa and Asia.
- Whole villages or clusters were studied, not just individuals.
- Areas had either stable malaria (higher, year-round risk) or unstable malaria (lower, seasonal risk).

What was tested
- IRS: spraying long-lasting insecticides on indoor walls.
- Compared to no IRS, or to ITNs (bed nets treated with insecticide).

What outcomes were measured
- Malaria infections and illness episodes.
- Malaria parasite levels in blood (prevalence).
- Hemoglobin (a blood measure related to anemia).
- Results were grouped by stable vs unstable malaria areas.

Timeframe
- The research team searched medical databases up to September 2009.
- Some included studies followed communities for months to years (one for 7 years).

Key findings

IRS vs no IRS
- Stable malaria areas:
  - One trial in Tanzania showed IRS lowered new infections in children (about 54% protection).
  - Illness episodes in children 1–5 years were slightly lower (about 14% protection); not lower in older children.
  - Hemoglobin was higher with IRS. Malaria prevalence changes were small.
  - Other studies showed mixed results: one Nigeria study saw protection in the wet season; a Mozambique program saw large drops over 7 years.
- Unstable malaria areas:
  - Trials in India and Pakistan showed IRS reduced infections (about 31% to 88% protection).
  - IRS lowered both P. falciparum and P. vivax in Pakistan. Results were smaller or mixed in India.

IRS vs ITNs
- Stable malaria areas:
  - One trial in Tanzania found no clear difference between IRS and ITNs for illness, prevalence, or hemoglobin.
- Unstable malaria areas:
  - Two studies suggested ITNs may protect better than IRS. Malaria rates were higher with IRS than with ITNs in India, and possibly in South Africa.

Safety
- This review did not report detailed safety data. No major safety issues were described in the summary.

What this means
- IRS helps reduce malaria, especially in unstable (lower, seasonal) transmission areas.
- Evidence from high-quality trials is limited, especially in stable areas.
- Some data suggest ITNs may work better than IRS in unstable areas.
- More trials are needed to compare IRS and ITNs directly, and to test using them together."
153,"Background
This is an update of the original Cochrane review, last published in 2009 (Huertas‐Ceballos 2009). Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP), including children with irritable bowel syndrome, is a common problem affecting between 4% and 25% of school‐aged children. For the majority of such children, no organic cause for their pain can be found on physical examination or investigation. Many dietary inventions have been suggested to improve the symptoms of RAP. These may involve either excluding ingredients from the diet or adding supplements such as fibre or probiotics. 
Objectives
To examine the effectiveness of dietary interventions in improving pain in children of school age with RAP. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, eight other databases, and two trials registers, together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors, in June 2016. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing dietary interventions with placebo or no treatment in children aged five to 18 years with RAP or an abdominal pain‐related, functional gastrointestinal disorder, as defined by the Rome III criteria (Rasquin 2006). 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We grouped dietary interventions together by category for analysis. We contacted study authors to ask for missing information and clarification, when needed. We assessed the quality of the evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included 19 RCTs, reported in 27 papers with a total of 1453 participants. Fifteen of these studies were not included in the previous review. All 19 RCTs had follow‐up ranging from one to five months. Participants were aged between four and 18 years from eight different countries and were recruited largely from paediatric gastroenterology clinics. The mean age at recruitment ranged from 6.3 years to 13.1 years. Girls outnumbered boys in most trials. Fourteen trials recruited children with a diagnosis under the broad umbrella of RAP or functional gastrointestinal disorders; five trials specifically recruited only children with irritable bowel syndrome. The studies fell into four categories: trials of probiotic‐based interventions (13 studies), trials of fibre‐based interventions (four studies), trials of low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) diets (one study), and trials of fructose‐restricted diets (one study). 
We found that children treated with probiotics reported a greater reduction in pain frequency at zero to three months postintervention than those given placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.98 to ‐0.12; 6 trials; 523 children). There was also a decrease in pain intensity in the intervention group at the same time point (SMD ‐0.50, 95% CI ‐0.85 to ‐0.15; 7 studies; 575 children). However, we judged the evidence for these outcomes to be of low quality using GRADE due to an unclear risk of bias from incomplete outcome data and significant heterogeneity. 
We found that children treated with probiotics were more likely to experience improvement in pain at zero to three months postintervention than those given placebo (odds ratio (OR) 1.63, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.47; 7 studies; 722 children). The estimated number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was eight, meaning that eight children would need to receive probiotics for one to experience improvement in pain in this timescale. We judged the evidence for this outcome to be of moderate quality due to significant heterogeneity. 
Children with a symptom profile defined as irritable bowel syndrome treated with probiotics were more likely to experience improvement in pain at zero to three months postintervention than those given placebo (OR 3.01, 95% CI 1.77 to 5.13; 4 studies; 344 children). Children treated with probiotics were more likely to experience improvement in pain at three to six months postintervention compared to those receiving placebo (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.10 to 3.43; 2 studies; 224 children). We judged the evidence for these two outcomes to be of moderate quality due to small numbers of participants included in the studies. 
We found that children treated with fibre‐based interventions were not more likely to experience an improvement in pain at zero to three months postintervention than children given placebo (OR 1.83, 95% CI 0.92 to 3.65; 2 studies; 136 children). There was also no reduction in pain intensity compared to placebo at the same time point (SMD ‐1.24, 95% CI ‐3.41 to 0.94; 2 studies; 135 children). We judged the evidence for these outcomes to be of low quality due to an unclear risk of bias, imprecision, and significant heterogeneity. 
We found only one study of low FODMAP diets and only one trial of fructose‐restricted diets, meaning no pooled analyses were possible. 
We were unable to perform any meta‐analyses for the secondary outcomes of school performance, social or psychological functioning, or quality of daily life, as not enough studies included these outcomes or used comparable measures to assess them. 
With the exception of one study, all studies reported monitoring children for adverse events; no major adverse events were reported. 
Authors' conclusions
Overall, we found moderate‐ to low‐quality evidence suggesting that probiotics may be effective in improving pain in children with RAP. Clinicians may therefore consider probiotic interventions as part of a holistic management strategy. However, further trials are needed to examine longer‐term outcomes and to improve confidence in estimating the size of the effect, as well as to determine the optimal strain and dosage. Future research should also explore the effectiveness of probiotics in children with different symptom profiles, such as those with irritable bowel syndrome. 
We found only a small number of trials of fibre‐based interventions, with overall low‐quality evidence for the outcomes. There was therefore no convincing evidence that fibre‐based interventions improve pain in children with RAP. Further high‐quality RCTs of fibre supplements involving larger numbers of participants are required. Future trials of low FODMAP diets and other dietary interventions are also required to facilitate evidence‐based recommendations.","Dietary interventions for recurrent abdominal pain in children
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effects of dietary interventions on pain in children aged between five and 18 years with recurrent abdominal pain (RAP). 
Background 
Recurrent abdominal pain, or RAP, is a term used for unexplained episodes of stomachache or abdominal pain in children. Recurrent abdominal pain is a common condition, and most children are likely to be helped by simple measures. However, a range of treatments have been recommended to relieve abdominal pain, including making changes to the child's eating habits by adding supplements or excluding certain foods. 
Study characteristics 
This evidence is current to June 2016.
Nineteen studies met our inclusion criteria, including 13 studies of probiotics and four studies of fibre interventions. We also found one study of a diet low in substances known as FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) and one study of a fructose‐restricted diet. 
All of the studies compared dietary interventions to a placebo or control. The trials were carried out in eight countries and included a total of 1453 participants, aged between five and 18 years. Most children were recruited from outpatient clinics. Most interventions lasted four to six weeks. 
Key results 
Probiotics 
We found evidence from 13 studies suggesting that probiotics might be effective in improving pain in the shorter term. Most studies did not report on other areas such as quality of daily life. No harmful effects were reported, other than dry mouth in one study. We judged this evidence to be of moderate or low quality because some studies were small, showed varying results, or were at risk of bias. 
Fibre supplements 
We found no clear evidence of improvement of pain from four studies of fibre supplements. Most studies did not report on other areas such as quality of daily life. No harmful effects were reported. There were few studies of fibre supplements, and some of these studies were at risk of bias. We judged this evidence to be of low quality. 
Low FODMAP diets 
We found only one study evaluating the effectiveness of low FODMAP diets in children with RAP. 
Fructose‐restricted diets 
We found only one study evaluating the effectiveness of fructose‐restricted diets in children with RAP. 
Conclusion 
We found some evidence suggesting that probiotics may be helpful in relieving pain in children with RAP in the short term. Clinicians may therefore consider probiotic interventions as part of the management strategy for RAP. Further trials are needed to find out how effective probiotics are over longer periods of time and which probiotics might work best. 
We did not find convincing evidence that fibre supplements are effective in improving pain in children with RAP. Future larger, high‐quality studies are needed to test the effectiveness of fibre and low FODMAP diet treatments.",0,Plano,"# Plain Language Summary: Dietary Changes for Children with Recurring Stomach Pain

## What is this review about?

Many school-aged children (about 4 to 25 out of every 100) experience recurring stomach pain without a clear medical cause. Researchers wanted to find out if changing what children eat or adding supplements to their diet could help reduce this pain.

## What did the researchers study?

The review looked at 19 studies involving 1,453 children aged 4 to 18 years from eight countries. Most children were recruited from stomach specialist clinics. The studies tested four types of dietary changes:
- **Probiotics** (beneficial bacteria, tested in 13 studies)
- **Fiber supplements** (tested in 4 studies)
- **Low FODMAP diet** (limiting certain hard-to-digest carbohydrates, tested in 1 study)
- **Fructose-restricted diet** (limiting fruit sugar, tested in 1 study)

## What did they find?

**Probiotics:**
- Children taking probiotics had less frequent stomach pain and less intense pain compared to children taking placebo (inactive treatment)
- About 1 in 8 children who took probiotics experienced pain improvement
- Benefits were seen up to 3 months after treatment, and in some cases up to 6 months
- Probiotics appeared especially helpful for children with irritable bowel syndrome

**Fiber:**
- There wasn't enough evidence to show that fiber supplements helped reduce stomach pain

**Other diets:**
- Too few studies were done on low FODMAP and fructose-restricted diets to draw conclusions

**Safety:**
- No serious side effects were reported in any of the studies

## What does this mean?

Probiotics may help reduce stomach pain in children, and doctors might consider them as part of an overall treatment plan. However, more research is needed to understand which types of probiotics work best, how much to give, and how long the benefits last. More studies are also needed on fiber supplements and other dietary approaches before clear recommendations can be made.",0,Plano,"Plain-language summary

Purpose
- To see if diet changes help reduce stomach pain in school-aged children who have repeated belly pain.

Who was included
- 19 randomized controlled trials from 8 countries
- 1,453 children, mostly from gastroenterology clinics
- Ages 4 to 18 years (average ages 6.3 to 13.1); more girls than boys
- Follow-up lasted 1 to 5 months
- Children had recurrent abdominal pain or related functional gut disorders; 5 trials focused only on irritable bowel syndrome

What was tested
- Probiotics (13 studies)
- Fiber supplements (4 studies)
- Low FODMAP diet (1 study)
- Fructose-restricted diet (1 study)

How the studies were done
- Compared diet changes to placebo or no treatment
- Looked at pain improvement, pain frequency, and pain intensity
- Assessed evidence quality (GRADE)

Main findings
- Probiotics:
  - Reduced how often pain happened and how strong it felt at 0–3 months compared to placebo (low-quality evidence)
  - More children reported pain improvement at 0–3 months (moderate-quality evidence); about 8 children need probiotics for 1 extra child to feel better
  - In children with an irritable bowel syndrome pattern, probiotics improved pain at 0–3 months; benefits also seen at 3–6 months (both moderate-quality evidence)
- Fiber:
  - No clear improvement in pain or pain intensity at 0–3 months compared to placebo (low-quality evidence)
- Low FODMAP and fructose-restricted diets:
  - Only one small study each; not enough data to judge effectiveness

Safety
- Most studies monitored side effects; no major side effects were reported.

Limits
- Many studies were small and varied in methods and measures.
- Not enough data to judge effects on school, social life, or quality of life.
- Unclear which probiotic strains or doses work best; longer-term effects are unknown.

What this means
- Probiotics may help reduce belly pain in some children within a few months, including those with an irritable bowel syndrome pattern.
- There is no convincing evidence that fiber supplements help.
- Evidence is too limited to judge low FODMAP or fructose-restricted diets.
- More high-quality, larger, and longer studies are needed, especially to identify the best probiotic strains and doses."
154,"Background
Preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM) is associated with increased risk of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Women with PPROM have been predominantly managed in hospital. It is possible that selected women could be managed at home after a period of observation. The safety, cost and women's views about home management have not been established. 
Objectives
To assess the safety, cost and women's views about planned home versus hospital care for women with PPROM. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 July 2013) and the reference lists of all the identified articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi‐randomised trials comparing planned home versus hospital management for women with PPROM before 37 weeks' gestation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed clinical trials for eligibility for inclusion, risk of bias, and carried out data extraction. 
Main results
We included two trials (116 women) comparing planned home versus hospital management for PPROM. Overall, the number of included women in each trial was too small to allow adequate assessment of pre‐specified outcomes. Investigators used strict inclusion criteria and in both studies relatively few of the women presenting with PPROM were eligible for inclusion. Women were monitored for 48 to 72 hours before randomisation. Perinatal mortality was reported in one trial and there was insufficient evidence to determine whether it differed between the two groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 20.05).  There was no evidence of differences between groups for serious neonatal morbidity, chorioamnionitis, gestational age at delivery, birthweight and admission to neonatal intensive care. 
There was no information on serious maternal morbidity or mortality. There was some evidence that women managed in hospital were more likely to be delivered by caesarean section (RR (random‐effects) 0.28, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.15). However, results should be interpreted cautiously as there is moderate heterogeneity for this outcome (I² = 35%). Mothers randomised to care at home spent approximately 10 fewer days as inpatients (mean difference ‐9.60, 95% CI ‐14.59 to ‐4.61) and were more satisfied with their care. Furthermore, home care was associated with reduced costs. 
Authors' conclusions
The review included two relatively small studies that did not have sufficient statistical power to detect meaningful differences between groups. Future large and adequately powered randomised controlled trials are required to measure differences between groups for relevant pre‐specified outcomes. Special attention should be given to the assessment of maternal satisfaction with care and cost analysis as they will have social and economic implications in both developed and developing countries.","Planned home versus hospital care for rupture of the membranes before 37 weeks' gestation
Premature rupture of membranes before 37 weeks’ gestation (and where there is at least an hour between membrane rupture and the onset of contractions and labour) can have consequences for both the mother and the baby. It is estimated that after premature rupture of the membranes one‐half of women go into labour within a week, and three‐quarters within a fortnight. This means that the baby may be born prematurely and both mother and baby are at risk of infection. Where available, the majority of clinicians advise hospital care for the women to allow monitoring and early detection of any problems. It is however possible for some women to go home after a period of observation in hospital. The safety, cost and women's views about home management have not been established. 
We included two randomised controlled studies with 116 women in the review. These studies compared planned home versus hospital management for women with preterm, prelabour rupture of the membranes (PPROM). In both studies there were strict criteria for deciding whether women could be included; for example, women had to live within a certain distance of emergency facilities, and there had to be no signs that mothers and babies had infection or other problems. There was a period of monitoring in hospital for women in both groups. 
Results suggested that there were few differences in mothers' and babies' health for women cared for at home or in hospital including infant death, serious illness, or admission to intensive care baby units. 
There was some evidence that women managed in hospital were more likely to be delivered by caesarean section. Women cared for at home were likely to spend less time in hospital (spending approximately 10 fewer days as inpatients) and were more satisfied with their care. In addition, home care was associated with reduced costs. Overall, the number of women included in the two studies was too small to allow adequate assessment of outcomes.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
155,"Background
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common, life‐limiting, genetically inherited disease. It affects multiple organs, particularly the respiratory system. However, gastrointestinal problems such as constipation and distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) are also important and well‐recognised complications in CF. They share similar symptoms e.g. bloating, abdominal pain, but are distinct conditions. Constipation occurs when there is gradual faecal impaction of the colon, but DIOS occurs when there is an accumulation of faeces and sticky mucus, forming a mass in the distal part of the small intestine. The mass may partially block the intestine (incomplete DIOS) or completely block the intestine (complete DIOS). Symptoms of DIOS can affect quality of life and other aspects of CF health, such as airway clearance, exercise, sleep and nutritional status. Treatment of constipation and prevention of complete bowel obstruction are required for gastrointestinal management in CF. However, many different strategies are used in clinical practice and there is a lack of consensus. The importance of this topic was highlighted in a recent research priority setting exercise by the James Lind Alliance. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of laxative agents of differing types for preventing DIOS (complete and incomplete) in children and adults with CF. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of search: 09 September 2021. 
We also searched online trial registries. Date of last search: 12 October 2021.
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled parallel trials comparing laxative therapy for preventing DIOS (including osmotic agents, stimulants, mucolytics and substances with more than one action) at any dose to placebo, no treatment or an alternative laxative therapy, in people of any age with pancreatic sufficient or insufficient CF and any stage of lung disease. Randomised cross‐over trials were judged on an individual basis. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted outcome data and performed a risk of bias assessment for the included data. We judged the certainty of the evidence using GRADE criteria. 
Main results
We included one cross‐over trial (17 participants) with a duration of 12 months, in which participants were randomly allocated to either cisapride (a gastro‐prokinetic agent) or placebo for six months each. The trial had an unclear risk of bias for most domains but had a high risk of reporting bias. 
Radiograph scores revealed no difference in occurrence of DIOS between cisapride and placebo (narrative report, no data provided). There were no adverse effects. Symptom scores were the only secondary outcome within the review that were reported. Total gastrointestinal symptom scores favoured cisapride with a statistically significant mean difference (MD) of ‐7.60 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐14.73 to ‐0.47). There was no significant difference at six months between cisapride and placebo for abdominal distension, MD ‐0.90 (95% CI ‐2.39 to 0.59) or abdominal pain, MD ‐0.4 (95% CI ‐2.05 to 1.25). The global symptom scores (whether individuals felt better or worse) were reported in the paper to favour cisapride and be statistically significant (P < 0.05). 
We assessed the available data to be very low certainty. There was a great deal of missing data from the included trial and the investigators failed to report numerical data for many outcomes. The overall risk of bias of the trial was unclear and it had a high risk for reporting bias. There was also indirectness; the trial drug (cisapride) has since been removed from the market in several countries due to adverse effects, thus it has no current applicability for preventing DIOS. The included trial also had very few participants, which downgraded the certainty a further level for precision. 
Authors' conclusions
There is an absence of evidence for interventions for the prevention of DIOS. As there was only one included trial, we could not perform a meta‐analysis of the data. Furthermore, the included trial compared a prokinetic agent (cisapride) that is no longer licensed for use in a number of countries due to the risk of serious cardiac events, a finding that came to light after the trial was conducted. Therefore, the limited findings from the trial are not applicable in current clinical practice. 
Overall, a great deal more research needs to be undertaken on gastrointestinal complications in CF, as this is a very poorly studied area compared to respiratory complications in CF.","Which interventions are effective and safe for preventing distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) in cystic fibrosis? 
Background 
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited, life‐long condition that causes organ systems in the body to produce large amounts of thick and sticky mucus. The most commonly affected area is the lungs, in which thick mucus leads to recurrent chest infections and breathing difficulties. Another commonly affected area is the digestive system. Many people with CF suffer from bloating and abdominal pain which may be caused by constipation or distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS). In DIOS, overproduction of thick mucus combines with stool and sticks to the intestinal wall. This mass can partially block the intestine (incomplete DIOS) or completely block the intestine (complete DIOS). The latter causes severe pain, vomiting and is treated as a medical emergency. As part of effective care for people with CF, constipation should therefore be treated and complete bowel obstruction be prevented. It is also important to recognise that constipation and DIOS impact on other aspects of CF health. Bloating, abdominal pain and nausea may affect airway clearance, exercise and sleep. Nutritional status may also be affected due to decreased appetite and malabsorption. DIOS may affect the absorption of other medications taken by people with CF. Overall, DIOS can significantly impair quality of life. Different laxatives are currently used in clinics, but prescribing practices differ and there is no consensus on optimal treatment strategies. Hence, this review aimed to analyse the evidence for the preventing DIOS. 
Search date 
We last searched for evidence: 12 October 2021.
Trial characteristics 
We included one trial in the review, which included 17 people aged between 13 to 35 years. These people were randomly put into groups to take either a placebo drug (with no active medication) or cisapride for six months each and then to cross over and take the alternative treatment for a further six months. 
Key results 
The trial used radiography to diagnose DIOS, but did not provide any data and only stated that there was no difference between cisapride and placebo. The trial also stated that there were no adverse effects from the cisapride. The trial assessed participant‐reported total and individual gastrointestinal symptom scores. People in the cisapride group reported an improvement in total gastrointestinal symptom scores compared to those in the placebo group. However, there were no differences reported between groups for the individual symptom scores of abdominal pain and abdominal distension (swelling). Participants also reported global symptom scores, which showed that most people felt better taking cisapride compared to placebo. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The overall certainty of the evidence was very low. With one trial in this review, we could not combine data from different trials. The trial did not provide enough information about the methods used for allocating participants or about missing data and did not fully report certain results. The small number of participants also lowered the precision of the results. Since this trial was conducted, cisapride has been removed from the market in a number of countries due to rare but serious heart complications, therefore it has no applicability to current clinical practice.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
156,"Background
Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, yet ASCVD risk factor control and secondary prevention rates remain low. A fixed‐dose combination of blood pressure‐ and cholesterol‐lowering and antiplatelet treatments into a single pill, or polypill, has been proposed as one strategy to reduce the global burden of ASCVD. 
Objectives
To determine the effect of fixed‐dose combination therapy on all‐cause mortality, fatal and non‐fatal ASCVD events, and adverse events. We also sought to determine the effect of fixed‐dose combination therapy on blood pressure, lipids, adherence, discontinuation rates, health‐related quality of life, and costs. 
Search methods
We updated our previous searches in September 2016 of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ISI Web of Science, and DARE, HTA, and HEED. We also searched two clinical trials registers in September 2016. We used no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials of a fixed‐dose combination therapy including at least one blood pressure‐lowering and one lipid‐lowering component versus usual care, placebo, or an active drug comparator for any treatment duration in adults 18 years old or older, with no restrictions on presence or absence of pre‐existing ASCVD. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted the data for this update. We evaluated risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool. We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using fixed‐effect models when heterogeneity was low (I2 < 50%) and random‐effects models when heterogeneity was high (I2 ≥ 50%). We used the GRADE approach to evaluate the quality of evidence. 
Main results
In the initial review, we identified nine randomised controlled trials with a total of 7047 participants and four additional trials (n = 2012 participants; mean age range 62 to 63 years; 30% to 37% women) were included in this update. Eight of the 13 trials evaluated the effects of fixed‐dose combination (FDC) therapy in populations without prevalent ASCVD, and the median follow‐up ranged from six weeks to 23 months. More recent trials were generally larger with longer follow‐up and lower risk of bias. The main risk of bias was related to lack of blinding of participants and personnel, which was inherent to the intervention. Compared with the comparator groups (placebo, usual care, or active drug comparator), the effects of the fixed‐dose combination treatment on mortality (FDC = 1.0% versus control = 1.0%, RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.89,  I2 = 0%, 5 studies, N = 5300) and fatal and non‐fatal ASCVD events (FDC = 4.7% versus control = 3.7%, RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.66, I2 = 0%, 6 studies, N = 4517) were uncertain (low‐quality evidence). The low event rates for these outcomes and indirectness of evidence for comparing fixed‐dose combination to usual care versus individual drugs suggest that these results should be viewed with caution. Adverse events were common in both the intervention (32%) and comparator (27%) groups, with participants randomised to fixed‐dose combination therapy being 16% (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.25, 11 studies, 6906 participants, moderate‐quality evidence) more likely to report an adverse event . The mean differences in systolic blood pressure between the intervention and control arms was ‐6.34 mmHg (95% CI ‐9.03 to ‐3.64, 13 trials, 7638 participants, moderate‐quality evidence). The mean differences (95% CI) in total and LDL cholesterol between the intervention and control arms were ‐0.61 mmol/L (95% CI ‐0.88 to ‐0.35, 11 trials, 6565 participants, low‐quality evidence) and ‐0.70 mmol/L (95% CI ‐0.98 to ‐0.41, 12 trials, 7153 participants, moderate‐quality evidence), respectively. There was a high degree of statistical heterogeneity in comparisons of blood pressure and lipids (I2 ≥ 80% for all) that could not be explained, so these results should be viewed with caution. Fixed‐dose combination therapy improved adherence to a multidrug strategy by 44% (26% to 65%) compared with usual care (4 trials, 3835 participants, moderate‐quality evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
The effects of fixed‐dose combination therapy on all‐cause mortality or ASCVD events are uncertain. A limited number of trials reported these outcomes, and the included trials were primarily designed to observe changes in ASCVD risk factor levels rather than clinical events, which may partially explain the observed differences in risk factors that were not translated into differences in clinical outcomes among the included trials. Fixed‐dose combination therapy is associated with modest increases in adverse events compared with placebo, active comparator, or usual care but may be associated with improved adherence to a multidrug regimen. Ongoing, longer‐term trials of fixed‐dose combination therapy will help demonstrate whether short‐term changes in risk factors might be maintained and lead to expected differences in clinical events based on these changes.","Fixed‐dose combination drug therapy for the prevention of heart disease and stroke
Review question: We reviewed the evidence about the effect of fixed‐dose combination drug therapy on the prevention of heart attacks and strokes. We found 13 studies including 9059 participants. 
Background: We wanted to discover whether using fixed‐dose combination therapy was better or worse than other alternatives, such as usual care, placebo, or giving drugs separately, for the prevention of heart attacks and strokes. This report represents an update from a previous review published in 2014. 
Study characteristics: The evidence is current to September 2016. Four studies included individuals with a prior heart attack or stroke or with a high predicted risk for having an initial heart attack and five studies had long‐term (12 months or more) follow‐up. The main risk of bias was related to lack of blinding of participants and personnel, which was inherent to the intervention. Most study participants were middle‐aged men with moderate elevations in blood pressure or cholesterol. Two studies specifically included ethnic Aboriginal or Maori minorities in half of the study participants. The fixed‐dose combinations ranged from two to five drugs; all studies included at least one blood pressure‐lowering and one cholesterol‐lowering drug. 
Key results: The effects of fixed‐dose combination drug therapy on all‐cause mortality and fatal and non‐fatal heart attacks and strokes are uncertain, primarily due to the low number of participants experiencing these events in these studies (fewer than 5% for both) and comparisons with usual care (low‐quality evidence). Fixed‐dose combination drug therapy leads to more adverse events than control (32% versus 27%), including placebo (moderate‐quality evidence). This information is not surprising since aspirin, blood pressure‐lowering drugs and cholesterol drugs are known to increase the risk for side effects compared with placebo. Fixed‐dose combination therapy may modestly lower blood pressure (˜6 mmHg) and cholesterol (‐0.6 mmol/L in LDL cholesterol), but these effects were not consistent (moderate‐quality evidence for blood pressure and LDL cholesterol but low‐quality evidence of total cholesterol). Fixed‐dose combination therapy appears to improve adherence to medications to prevent ASCVD (moderate‐quality evidence). 
Quality of the evidence: The quality of evidence from these studies generally ranged from moderate to low. Ongoing trials of fixed‐dose combination drug therapy will likely inform clinical endpoints to guide decision‐making.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
157,"Background
Appendiceal phlegmon and abscess account for 2% to 10% of acute appendicitis. People with appendiceal phlegmon or abscess usually need an appendicectomy to relieve their symptoms and avoid complications. The timing of appendicectomy for appendiceal phlegmon or abscess is controversial. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of early versus delayed appendicectomy for appendiceal phlegmon or abscess, in terms of overall morbidity and mortality. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 7), MEDLINE Ovid (1950 to 23 August 2016), Embase Ovid (1974 to 23 August 2016), Science Citation Index Expanded (1900 to 23 August 2016), and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) (1978 to 23 August 2016). We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform search portal (23 August 2016) and ClinicalTrials.gov (23 August 2016) for ongoing trials. 
Selection criteria
We included all individual and cluster‐randomised controlled trials, irrespective of language, publication status, or age of participants, comparing early versus delayed appendicectomy in people with appendiceal phlegmon or abscess. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently identified the trials for inclusion, collected the data, and assessed the risk of bias. We performed meta‐analyses using Review Manager 5. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). 
Main results
We included two randomised controlled trials with a total of 80 participants in this review. 
1. Early versus delayed open appendicectomy for appendiceal phlegmon 
Forty participants (paediatric and adults) with appendiceal phlegmon were randomised either to early appendicectomy (appendicectomy as soon as appendiceal mass resolved within the same admission) (n = 20), or to delayed appendicectomy (initial conservative treatment followed by interval appendicectomy six weeks later) (n = 20). The trial was at high risk of bias. There was no mortality in either group. There is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of using either early or delayed open appendicectomy onoverall morbidity (RR 13.00; 95% CI 0.78 to 216.39; very low‐quality evidence), the proportion of participants who developed wound infection (RR 9.00; 95% CI 0.52 to 156.91; very low quality evidence) or faecal fistula (RR 3.00; 95% CI 0.13 to 69.52; very low quality evidence). The quality of evidence for increased length of hospital stay and time away from normal activities in the early appendicectomy group (MD 6.70 days; 95% CI 2.76 to 10.64, and MD 5.00 days; 95% CI 1.52 to 8.48, respectively) is very low quality evidence. The trial reported neither quality of life nor pain outcomes. 
2. Early versus delayed laparoscopic appendicectomy for appendiceal abscess 
Forty paediatric participants with appendiceal abscess were randomised either to early appendicectomy (emergent laparoscopic appendicectomy) (n = 20) or to delayed appendicectomy (initial conservative treatment followed by interval laparoscopic appendicectomy 10 weeks later) (n = 20). The trial was at high risk of bias. The trial did not report on overall morbidity or complications. There was no mortality in either group. We do not have sufficient evidence to determine the effects of using either early or delayed laparoscopic appendicectomy for outcomes relating to hospital stay between the groups (MD −0.20 days; 95% CI −3.54 to 3.14; very low quality of evidence). Health‐related quality of life was measured with the Pediatric Quality of Life Scale‐Version 4.0 questionnaire (a scale of 0 to 100 with higher values indicating a better quality of life). Health‐related quality of life score measured at 12 weeks after appendicectomy was higher in the early appendicectomy group than in the delayed appendicectomy group (MD 12.40 points; 95% CI 9.78 to 15.02) but the quality of evidence was very low. This trial reported neither the pain nor the time away from normal activities. 
Authors' conclusions
It is unclear whether early appendicectomy prevents complications compared to delayed appendicectomy for people with appendiceal phlegmon or abscess. The evidence indicating increased length of hospital stay and time away from normal activities in people with early open appendicectomy is of very low quality. The evidence for better health‐related quality of life following early laparoscopic appendicectomy compared with delayed appendicectomy is based on very low quality evidence. For both comparisons addressed in this review, data are sparse, and we cannot rule out significant benefits or harms of early versus delayed appendicectomy. 
Further trials on this topic are urgently needed and should specify a set of criteria for use of antibiotics, percutaneous drainage of the appendiceal abscess prior to surgery and resolution of the appendiceal phlegmon or abscess. Future trials should include outcomes such as time away from normal activities, quality of life and the length of hospital stay.","Early or delayed surgical removal of appendix in people with symptomatic complicated appendicitis 
Review question 
What are the risks and benefits of early versus delayed removal of appendix in people with symptomatic complicated appendicitis? 
Background 
The human appendix is a tube at the connection of the small and the large intestines. Possible functions of the appendix may be to protect the body against infection and to maintain healthy levels bacteria in the gut when recovering from diarrhoea. Appendicitis covers a variety of clinical conditions resulting from inflammation of the appendix. 
Complicated appendicitis is defined as appendiceal phlegmon (simple inflammatory mass without pus located in bottom right of the appendix) or appendiceal abscess (pocket of pus surrounding an acutely inflamed and/or ruptured appendix). People with this condition usually need surgical removal of the appendix to relieve their symptoms and avoid complications. The timing of surgical removal of the appendix is controversial. Immediate surgery is technically demanding. Some experts question the appropriateness of delayed appendectomy, as people are unlikely to experience a recurrence after a successful non‐surgical treatment. However, the true diagnosis could be uncertain in some cases, and postponing the appendectomy may delay diagnosis of underlying disease. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for all relevant randomised controlled trials up to 23 August 2016. We identified two trials involving 80 participants. One compared early versus delayed open appendicectomy in 40 children and adults with appendiceal phlegmon. The other trial compared early versus delayed keyhole (laparoscopic) appendicectomy (where surgery is performed through a very small incision) in 40 children with appendiceal abscess. Studies took place in the USA and India. The age of the individuals in the trials varied between 1 year and 84 years, and 27.5% were females. 
Key results 
Both two studies were small and had a number of limitations so we cannot be certain about how the effects of the two surgical approaches compare. From one trial in children and adults comparing open with delayed appendicectomy, there was insufficient evidence to show the effect of using either approach on the overall complication rate or the proportion of participants who developed wound infection. Our certainty in a longer stay in hospital stay and time away from normal activities with open appendicectomy is very low. There were no deaths in the study. Quality of life, and pain were not reported in this trial. 
The other trial in children with appendiceal abscess receiving either early or delayed keyhole appendicectomy did not report on overall complication rates. The trial did not provide enough evidence to show the effect of using either approach on the length of hospital stay among participants. We have very low certainty that children who had early keyhole appendicectomy had better quality of life compared with children who had delayed keyhole appendicectomy. The study did not report if there were any deaths, and did not provide information on pain, or time away from normal activities. 
At present the benefits and harms of early versus delayed appendicectomy are not well understood because the current information is based upon very low quality evidence. 
Quality of the evidence 
Both trials were at a high risk of bias. Overall, we judged the quality of the evidence to be very low. Thus, further well‐designed trials are urgently needed.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
158,"Background
Heart failure (HF) is a chronic disease with significant impact on quality of life and presents many challenges to those diagnosed with the condition, due to a seemingly complex daily regimen of self‐care which includes medications, monitoring of weight and symptoms, identification of signs of deterioration and follow‐up and interaction with multiple healthcare services. Education is vital for understanding the importance of this regimen, and adhering to it. Traditionally, education has been provided to people with heart failure in a face‐to‐face manner, either in a community or a hospital setting, using paper‐based materials or video/DVD presentations. In an age of rapidly‐evolving technology and uptake of smartphones and tablet devices, mHealth‐based technology (defined by the World Health Organization as mobile and wireless technologies to achieve health objectives) is an innovative way to provide health education which has the benefit of being able to reach people who are unable or unwilling to access traditional heart failure education programmes and services. 
Objectives
To systematically review and quantify the potential benefits and harms of mHealth‐delivered education for people with heart failure. 
Search methods
We performed an extensive search of bibliographic databases and registries (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, IEEE Xplore, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal), using terms to identify HF, education and mHealth. We searched all databases from their inception to October 2019 and imposed no restriction on language of publication. 
Selection criteria
We included studies if they were conducted as a randomised controlled trial (RCT), involving adults (≥ 18 years) with a diagnosis of HF. We included trials comparing mHealth‐delivered education such as internet and web‐based education programmes for use on smartphones and tablets (including apps) and other mobile devices, SMS messages and social media‐delivered education programmes, versus usual HF care. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risks of bias, and extracted data from all included studies. We calculated the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data and the odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous data with a 95% confidence interval (CI). We assessed heterogeneity using the I2 statistic and assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE criteria. 
Main results
We include five RCTs (971 participants) of mHealth‐delivered education interventions for people with HF in this review. The number of trial participants ranged from 28 to 512 participants. Mean age of participants ranged from 60 years to 75 years, and 63% of participants across the studies were men. Studies originated from Australia, China, Iran, Sweden, and The Netherlands. Most studies included participants with symptomatic HF, NYHA Class II ‐ III. 
Three studies addressed HF knowledge, revealing that the use of mHealth‐delivered education programmes showed no evidence of a difference in HF knowledge compared to usual care (MD 0.10, 95% CI −0.2 to 0.40, P = 0.51, I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 411 participants; low‐quality evidence). One study assessing self‐efficacy reported that both study groups had high levels of self‐efficacy at baseline and uncertainty in the evidence for the intervention (MD 0.60, 95% CI −0.57 to 1.77; P = 0.31; 1 study, 29 participants; very low‐quality evidence).Three studies evaluated HF self‐care using different scales. We did not pool the studies due to the heterogenous nature of the outcome measures, and the evidence is uncertain. None of the studies reported adverse events. Four studies examined health‐related quality of life (HRQoL). There was uncertainty in the evidence for the use of mHealth‐delivered education on HRQoL (MD −0.10, 95% CI −2.35 to 2.15; P = 0.93, I2 = 61%; 4 studies, 942 participants; very low‐quality evidence). Three studies reported on HF‐related hospitalisation. The use of mHealth‐delivered education may result in little to no difference in HF‐related hospitalisation (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.06; P = 0.10, I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 894 participants; low‐quality evidence). We downgraded the quality of the studies due to limitations in study design and execution, heterogeneity, wide confidence intervals and fewer than 500 participants in the analysis. 
Authors' conclusions
We found that the use of mHealth‐delivered educational interventions for people with HF shows no evidence of a difference in HF knowledge; uncertainty in the evidence for self‐efficacy, self‐care and health‐related quality of life; and may result in little to no difference in HF‐related hospitalisations. The identification of studies currently underway and those awaiting classification indicate that this is an area of research from which further evidence will emerge in the short and longer term.","mHealth‐delivered education interventions in heart failure, using smartphone, tablet and internet‐based programmes and apps 
Review question 
What is the randomised controlled trial evidence for mHealth‐delivered education interventions in heart failure (HF) knowledge, self‐care and self‐efficacy for people with HF when compared to traditional methods of patient education? 
Background 
Education is vital for self‐care (activities individuals undertake with the intention of improving health, preventing disease, limiting illness and restoring health) in HF. Traditionally, education has been provided to people with heart failure in a face‐to‐face manner, using paper‐based materials or video/DVD presentations. In an age of rapidly‐evolving technology and uptake of smartphones and tablet devices, mHealth‐based technology is a new way to provide health education, with the benefit of being able to reach people who are unable or unwilling to access traditional HF education programmes and services. 
Search date 
We found studies by searches conducted in October 2019.
Study characteristics 
We include in this review five randomised controlled trials (971 participants) of mHealth‐delivered education interventions for people with HF. The average age of participants ranged from 60 years to 75 years and 63% of participants were men. Studies came from Australia, China, Iran, Sweden and The Netherlands. 
Key results 
Five studies addressed HF knowledge; we found that the use of mHealth‐delivered education programmes showed no evidence of a difference in HF knowledge compared to usual care. One study assessing self‐efficacy reported uncertainty in the evidence for mHealth‐delivered education compared with usual care. Three studies evaluated HF self‐care using different scales. We did not combine the studies, because of the differences between the outcome measures, and the evidence is uncertain. The studies did not report any side effects of the interventions. Four studies examined health‐related quality of life and showed uncertainty in the evidence between mHealth‐delivered education and usual care. Three studies reported on HF‐related hospitalisation rates. The use of mHealth‐delivered education may result in little to no difference in HF‐related hospitalisations. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of the evidence as very low to low, due to limitations in study design and execution and fewer than 500 participants in the analysis. 
Conclusion 
There is no evidence for a difference in the use of mHealth‐delivered educational intervention for people with HF on HF knowledge. There is uncertainty in the evidence for self‐efficacy, self‐care and health‐related quality of life. There may be little to no difference in HF‐related hospitalisations, compared to usual care. 'Usual care' in this case means enrolment in a heart failure‐management programme (clinic‐ or home‐based). This is an area of HF research from which further evidence will emerge in the short and longer term.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
159,"Background
Tinnitus affects 10% to 15% of the adult population, with about 20% of these experiencing symptoms that negatively affect quality of life. In England alone there are an estimated ¾ million general practice consultations every year where the primary complaint is tinnitus, equating to a major burden on healthcare services. Clinical management strategies include education and advice, relaxation therapy, tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT), cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), sound enrichment using ear‐level sound generators or hearing aids, and drug therapies to manage co‐morbid symptoms such as insomnia, anxiety or depression. Hearing aids, sound generators and combination devices (amplification and sound generation within one device) are a component of many tinnitus management programmes and together with information and advice are a first line of management in audiology departments for someone who has tinnitus. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of sound therapy (using amplification devices and/or sound generators) for tinnitus in adults. 
Search methods
The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 23 July 2018. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting adults with acute or chronic subjective idiopathic tinnitus. We included studies where the intervention involved hearing aids, sound generators or combination hearing aids and compared them to waiting list control, placebo or education/information only with no device. We also included studies comparing hearing aids to sound generators, combination hearing aids to hearing aids, and combination hearing aids to sound generators. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were tinnitus symptom severity as measured as a global score on multi‐item tinnitus questionnaire and significant adverse effects as indicated by an increase in self‐reported tinnitus loudness. Our secondary outcomes were depressive symptoms, symptoms of generalised anxiety, health‐related quality of life and adverse effects associated with wearing the device such as pain, discomfort, tenderness or skin irritation, or ear infections. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics. 
Main results
This review included eight studies (with a total of 590 participants). Seven studies investigated the effects of hearing aids, four combination hearing aids and three sound generators. Seven studies were parallel‐group RCTs and one had a cross‐over design. In general, risk of bias was unclear due to lack of detail about sequence generation and allocation concealment. There was also little or no use of blinding. 
No data for our outcomes were available for any of our three main comparisons (comparing hearing aids, sound generators and combination devices with a waiting list control group, placebo or education/information only). Data for our additional comparisons (comparing these devices with each other) were also few, with limited potential for data pooling. 
Hearing aid only versus sound generator device only  
One study compared patients fitted with sound generators versus those fitted with hearing aids and found no difference between them in their effects on our primary outcome, tinnitus symptom severity measured with the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) at 3, 6 or 12 months (low‐quality evidence). The use of both types of device was associated with a clinically significant reduction in tinnitus symptom severity. 
Combination hearing aid versus hearing aid only  
Three studies compared combination hearing aids with hearing aids and measured tinnitus symptom severity using the THI or Tinnitus Functional Index. When we pooled the data we found no difference between them (standardised mean difference ‐0.15, 95% confidence interval ‐0.52 to 0.22; three studies; 114 participants) (low‐quality evidence). The use of both types of device was again associated with a clinically significant reduction in tinnitus symptom severity. 
Adverse effects were not assessed in any of the included studies.
None of the studies measured the secondary outcomes of depressive symptoms or depression, anxiety symptoms or generalised anxiety, or health‐related quality of life as measured by a validated instrument, nor the newly developed core outcomes tinnitus intrusiveness, ability to ignore, concentration, quality of sleep and sense of control. 
Authors' conclusions
There is no evidence to support the superiority of sound therapy for tinnitus over waiting list control, placebo or education/information with no device. There is insufficient evidence to support the superiority or inferiority of any of the sound therapy options (hearing aid, sound generator or combination hearing aid) over each other. The quality of evidence for the reported outcomes, assessed using GRADE, was low. Using a combination device, hearing aid or sound generator might result in little or no difference in tinnitus symptom severity. 
Future research into the effectiveness of sound therapy in patients with tinnitus should use rigorous methodology. Randomisation and blinding should be of the highest quality, given the subjective nature of tinnitus and the strong likelihood of a placebo response. The CONSORT statement should be used in the design and reporting of future studies. We also recommend the use of validated, patient‐centred outcome measures for research in the field of tinnitus.","Sound therapy (using amplification devices or sound generators) for tinnitus
Review question 
Is sound therapy (using amplification devices, sound generators or both) effective for tinnitus in adults? 
Background 
Tinnitus is the awareness of a sound in the ear or head without any outside source. It affects 10% to 15% of the adult population. About 20% of people with tinnitus experience symptoms that negatively affect their quality of life including sleep disturbances, difficulties with hearing and concentration, social isolation, anxiety, depression, irritation or stress. Tinnitus can be managed through education and advice, relaxation therapy, psychological therapy, or devices that improve hearing or generate sound such as sound generators or hearing aids. Sometimes drugs are prescribed to manage problems associated with tinnitus such as sleep problems, anxiety or depression. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the evidence from high‐quality clinical trials to work out the effects of sound therapy (hearing aids, sound generators and combination hearing aids) on adults with tinnitus. We particularly wanted to look at the effects of sound therapy on tinnitus severity and any side effects. 
Study characteristics 
Our review identified eight randomised controlled trials with 590 participants in total. Seven studies looked at the effects of hearing aids, four combination hearing aids and three sound generators. Seven studies allocated participants into parallel groups and in one study participants tried each intervention in a random order. The outcomes that we looked for were severity of tinnitus symptoms, depression, anxiety, quality of life and side effects. In general, the risk of bias in the studies was unclear. There was also little or no use of blinding. 
Key results 
We did not find any data for our outcomes for any of our three main comparisons (comparing hearing aids, sound generators and combination devices with a waiting list control group, placebo or education/information only). There were also few data for our additional comparisons (comparing these devices with each other) and it was difficult to pool (combine) the data. 
Hearing aid only versus sound generator device only  
One study compared patients fitted with sound generators with those fitted with hearing aids and found no difference between them in their effects on our primary outcome, tinnitus symptom severity, at 3, 6 or 12 months. The use of both types of device was associated with a clinically significant reduction in tinnitus symptom severity. 
Combination hearing aid versus hearing aid only  
Three studies compared combination hearing aids/sound generators with hearing aids alone and measured tinnitus symptom severity. When we combined the data for tinnitus symptom severity we found no difference between them. The use of both types of device was again associated with a clinically significant reduction in tinnitus symptom severity. 
Adverse effects were not assessed in any of the included studies.
None of the studies measured depressive symptoms or depression, anxiety symptoms or generalised anxiety, or other important outcomes of interest in this review. 
Quality of evidence 
Where outcomes that we were interested in for this review were reported, we assessed the quality of the evidence available as low. Using a hearing aid, sound generator or combination device might result in little or no difference in tinnitus symptom severity.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
160,"Background
Urinary schistosomiasis is caused by an intravascular infection with parasitic Schistosoma haematobium worms. The adult worms typically migrate to the venous plexus of the human bladder and excrete eggs which the infected person passes in their urine. Chronic infection can cause substantial morbidity and long‐term complications as the eggs become trapped in human tissues causing inflammation and fibrosis. We summarised evidence of drugs active against the infection. This is new edition of a review first published in 1997. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of drugs for treating urinary schistosomiasis.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE and LILACS and reference lists of articles up to 23 May 2014. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of antischistosomal drugs and drug combinations compared to placebo, no intervention, or each other. 
Data collection and analysis
Two researchers independently screened the records, extracted the data and assessed risk of bias. The primary efficacy outcomes were parasitological failure (defined as the continued presence of S. haematobium eggs in the urine at time points greater than one month after treatment), and percent reduction of egg counts from baseline. We presented dichotomous data as risk ratios (RR), and continuous data as mean difference (MD), alongside their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where appropriate we combined trials in meta analyses or tables. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included 30 RCTs enrolling 8165 participants in this review. Twenty‐four trials were conducted in children in sub‐Saharan Africa, and 21 trials were over 20 years old. Many studies were assessed as being at unclear risk of bias due to inadequate descriptions of study methods. 
Praziquantel 
On average, a single 40 mg/kg dose of praziquantel reduced the proportion of people still excreting eggs in their urine by around 60% compared to placebo at one to two months after treatment (treatment failure: RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.59, 864 participants, seven trials, high quality evidence). The proportion of people cured with praziquantel varied substantially between trials, from 22.5% to 83.3%, but was higher than 60% in five of the seven trials. At one to two months following praziquantel treatment at 40 mg/kg, the mean number of schistosome eggs in the urine was reduced by over 95% in five out of six trials (678 participants, six trials, high quality evidence). 
Splitting praziquantel 40 mg/kg into two doses over 12 hours probably has no benefits over a single dose, and in a single trial of 220 participants the split dose caused more vomiting (RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.86) and dizziness (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.94). 
Metrifonate 
A single dose of metrifonate 10 mg/kg reduced egg excretion (210 participants, one trial, at eight months), but was only marginally better than placebo at achieving cure at one month (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.94, 142 participants, one trial). In a single trial comparing one, two and three doses, the absolute number of participants cured improved from 47% after one dose to 81% after three doses (93 participants, one trial, low quality evidence). 
Two small trials compared 40 mg/kg single dose praziquantel with two or three doses of 10 mg/kg metrifonate and found no clear evidence of differences in cure (metrifonate 2 x 10 mg/kg at one month: RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.34, 72 participants, one trial; metrifonate 3 x 10 mg/kg at three months: RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.57, 100 participants, one trial. In one trial both drugs performed badly and in one trial both performed well. 
Other drugs 
Three trials have evaluated the antimalarial artesunate; with inconsistent results. Substantial antischistosomal effects were only seen in one of the three trials, which was at unclear risk of bias due to poor reporting of the trial methods. Similarly, another anti‐malarial mefloquine has been evaluated in two small trials with inconsistent effects. 
Adverse events were described as mild for all evaluated drugs, but adverse event monitoring and reporting was generally of low quality. 
Authors' conclusions
Praziquantel 40 mg/kg is the most studied drug for treating urinary schistosomiasis, and has the strongest evidence base. 
Potential strategies to improve future treatments for schistosomiasis include the combination of praziquantel with metrifonate, or with antimalarial drugs with antischistosomal properties such as artesunate and mefloquine. Evaluation of these combinations requires rigorous, adequately powered trials using standardized outcome measures.","Drugs for treating urinary schistosomiasis
What is urinary schistosomiasis and how is it treated? 
Urinary schistosomiasis is a disease caused by infection of people with the parasitic worm Schistosoma haematobium. These worms live in blood vessels around the infected person's bladder and the worm releases eggs which are released in the person's urine. If the urine is passed into ponds or lakes, the eggs can hatch and infect people that are washing or swimming there. Infection can cause blood in the urine and if left untreated can eventually lead to anaemia, malnutrition, kidney failure, or bladder cancer. Urinary schistosomiasis is diagnosed by looking for worm eggs in the urine. 
The disease occurs mainly in school‐aged children and young adults in sub‐Saharan Africa. The drug currently recommended for treatment is praziquantel, which can be given as a single dose, but other drugs such as metrifonate, artesunate, and mefloquine have also been evaluated. 
After examining the research published up to 23th May 2014, we included 30 randomized controlled trials, enrolling 8165 children and adults. 
What does the research say? 
On average, the standard dose of praziquantel cures around 60% of people at one to two months after treatment (high quality evidence), and reduces the number of schistosome eggs in the urine by over 95% (high quality evidence). 
Metrifonate, an older drug no longer in use, had little effect when given as a single dose but an improved effect when given as multiple doses two weeks apart. Two trials compared three doses of metrifonate with the single dose of praziquantel and found similar effects. 
Two more recent trials evaluated a combination of artesunate and praziquantel compared to praziquantel alone. In one trial artesunate improved cure and in one it made no difference. 
Authors conclusions 
Future treatments for schistosomiasis could include combining praziquantel with metrifonate, or with artesunate, but these need to be evaluated in high quality trials.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
161,"Background
Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are common in children and can involve both upper and lower airways. Many children experience frequent ARTI episodes or recurrent respiratory tract infections (RRTIs) in early life, which creates challenges for paediatricians, primary care physicians, parents and carers of children. 
In China, Astragalus (Huang qi), alone or in combination with other herbs, is used by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioners in the form of a water extract, to reduce the risk of ARTIs; it is believed to stimulate the immune system. Better understanding of the therapeutic mechanisms of Astragalus may provide insights into ARTI prevention, and consequently reduced antibiotic use. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of oral Astragalus for preventing frequent episodes of acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in children in community settings. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 12, 2015), MEDLINE (Ovid) (1946 to 31 December 2015), Embase (Elsevier) (1974 to 31 December 2015), AMED (Ovid) (1985 to 31 December 2015), Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (1979 to 31 December 2015) and Chinese Scientific Journals full text database (CQVIP) (1989 to 31 December 2015), China Biology Medicine disc (CBM 1976 to 31 December 2015) and Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform (WanFang) (1998 to 31 December 2015). 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral Astragalus as a sole Chinese herbal preparation with placebo to prevent frequent episodes of ARTIs in children. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures for this review. We assessed search results to identify relevant studies. We planned to extract data using standardised forms. Disagreements were to be resolved through discussion. Risk of bias was to be assessed using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We planned to use mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data and risk ratio (RR) or odds ratio (OR) to analyse dichotomous data, both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 
Main results
We identified 6080 records: 3352 from English language databases, 2724 from Chinese databases, and four from other sources. Following initial screening and deduplication, we obtained 120 full‐text papers for assessment. Of these, 21 were not RCTs; 55 did not meet the inclusion criteria because: participants were aged over 14 years; definition was not included for recurrent or frequent episodes;Astragalus preparation was not an intervention; Astragalus preparation was in the formula but was not the sole agent; the Astragalus preparation was not administered orally; or Astragalus was used for treatment rather than prevention of ARTI. A further 44 studies were excluded because they were not placebo‐controlled, although other inclusion criteria were fulfilled. 
No RCTs met our inclusion criteria.
Authors' conclusions
We found insufficient evidence to enable assessment of the effectiveness and safety of oral Astragalus as a sole intervention to prevent frequent ARTIs in children aged up to 14 years.","Can oral Astragalus (Huang qi) prevent frequent acute respiratory tract infections in children? 
Review question 
We assessed evidence for the benefits and harms of oral Astragalus used alone to prevent frequent episodes of acute respiratory infections (ARTIs) in children aged up to 14 years, compared to a dummy treatment. ARTIs include colds, sore throats, laryngitis, influenza, bronchitis and pneumonia. 
Background 
Many therapies are used to prevent ARTIs, especially in children. Astragalus, is a widely used and available herbal therapy that has been used for thousands of years in China to help prevent ARTIs. It is thought to boost immunity. Almost one in five children experience frequent ARTIs and treatment accounts for up to 75% of all prescribed antibiotics for children. Because most ARTIs are caused by viruses, antibiotics are not effective in treating these illnesses. 
Search date 
We searched the literature up to 31 December 2015.
Study characteristics 
We identified 6080 potentially relevant records. After removing duplicate records, and those that did not meet our inclusion criteria, we obtained 120 full‐text studies. We carefully assessed these studies for possible inclusion. We excluded most studies because: they presented unclear diagnosis criteria; Astragalus preparation was used with other agents; or Astragalus was not compared with a dummy treatment. No studies met our inclusion criteria and so we were unable to analyse any results. 
Study funding sources 
We could not assess study funding sources.
Key results 
We did not find any studies that compared use of oral Astragalus alone with a dummy treatment to prevent frequent episodes of ARTI in children aged up to 14 years. Well‐designed, conducted and reported studies investigating this issue are needed to enable assessment in the future.

162,"Background
Onychomycosis refers to fungal infections of the nail apparatus that may cause pain, discomfort, and disfigurement. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2007; a substantial amount of new research warrants a review exclusively on toenails. 
Objectives
To assess the clinical and mycological effects of topical drugs and device‐based therapies for toenail onychomycosis. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases up to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers, and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of topical and device‐based therapies for onychomycosis in participants with toenail onychomycosis, confirmed by positive cultures, direct microscopy, or histological nail examination. Eligible comparators were placebo, vehicle, no treatment, or an active topical or device‐based treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were complete cure rate (normal‐looking nail plus fungus elimination, determined with laboratory methods) and number of participants reporting treatment‐related adverse events. 
Main results
We included 56 studies (12,501 participants, average age: 27 to 68 years), with mainly mild‐to‐moderate onychomycosis without matrix involvement (where reported). Participants had more than one toenail affected. Most studies lasted 48 to 52 weeks; 23% reported disease duration (variable). Thirty‐five studies specifically examined dermatophyte‐caused onychomycosis. Forty‐three studies were carried out in outpatient settings. Most studies assessed topical treatments, 9% devices, and 11% both. 
We rated three studies at low risk of bias across all domains. The most common high‐risk domain was performance bias. We present results for key comparisons, where treatment duration was 36 or 48 weeks, and clinical outcomes were measured at 40 to 52 weeks. 
Based on two studies (460 participants), compared with vehicle, ciclopirox 8% lacquer may be more effective in achieving complete cure (risk ratio (RR) 9.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.72 to 50.14; low‐quality evidence) and is probably more effective in achieving mycological cure (RR 3.15, 95% CI 1.93 to 5.12; moderate‐quality evidence). Ciclopirox lacquer may lead to increased adverse events, commonly application reactions, rashes, and nail alteration (e.g. colour, shape). However, the 95% CI indicates that ciclopirox lacquer may actually make little or no difference (RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.92; low‐quality evidence). 
Efinaconazole 10% solution is more effective than vehicle in achieving complete cure (RR 3.54, 95% CI 2.24 to 5.60; 3 studies, 1716 participants) and clinical cure (RR 3.07, 95% CI 2.08 to 4.53; 2 studies, 1655 participants) (both high‐quality evidence) and is probably more effective in achieving mycological cure (RR 2.31, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.94; 3 studies, 1716 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). Risk of adverse events (such as dermatitis and vesicles) was slightly higher with efinaconazole (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.20; 3 studies, 1701 participants; high‐quality evidence). No other key comparison measured clinical cure. 
Based on two studies, compared with vehicle, tavaborole 5% solution is probably more effective in achieving complete cure (RR 7.40, 95% CI 2.71 to 20.24; 1198 participants), but probably has a higher risk of adverse events (application site reactions were most commonly reported) (RR 3.82, 95% CI 1.65 to 8.85; 1186 participants (both moderate‐quality evidence)). Tavaborole improves mycological cure (RR 3.40, 95% CI 2.34 to 4.93; 1198 participants; high‐quality evidence). 
Moderate‐quality evidence from two studies (490 participants) indicates that P‐3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer) is probably more effective than the comparators ciclopirox 8% lacquer or amorolfine 5% in achieving complete cure (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.32 to 4.48), but there is probably little or no difference between the treatments in achieving mycological cure (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.37). We found no difference in the risk of adverse events (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.92; 2 studies, 487 participants; low‐quality evidence). The most common events were erythema, rash, and burning. 
Three studies (112 participants) compared 1064‐nm Nd:YAG laser to no treatment or sham treatment. We are uncertain if there is a difference in adverse events (very low‐quality evidence) (two studies; 85 participants). There may be little or no difference in mycological cure at 52 weeks (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.85; 2 studies, 85 participants; low‐quality evidence). Complete cure was not measured. 
One study (293 participants) compared luliconazole 5% solution to vehicle. We are uncertain whether luliconazole leads to higher rates of complete cure (very low‐quality evidence). Low‐quality evidence indicates there may be little or no difference in adverse events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.16) and there may be increased mycological cure with luliconazole; however, the 95% CI indicates that luliconazole may make little or no difference to mycological cure (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.97). Commonly‐reported adverse events were dry skin, paronychia, eczema, and hyperkeratosis, which improved or resolved post‐treatment. 
Authors' conclusions
Assessing complete cure, high‐quality evidence supports the effectiveness of efinaconazole, moderate‐quality evidence supports P‐3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer) and tavaborole, and low‐quality evidence supports ciclopirox 8% lacquer. We are uncertain whether luliconazole 5% solution leads to complete cure (very low‐quality evidence); this outcome was not measured by the 1064‐nm Nd:YAG laser comparison. Although evidence supports topical treatments, complete cure rates with topical treatments are relatively low. 
We are uncertain if 1064‐nm Nd:YAG laser increases adverse events compared with no treatment or sham treatment (very low‐quality evidence). Low‐quality evidence indicates that there is no difference in adverse events between P‐3051 (ciclopirox hydrolacquer), luliconazole 5% solution, and their comparators. Ciclopirox 8% lacquer may increase adverse events (low‐quality evidence). High‐ to moderate‐quality evidence suggests increased adverse events with efinaconazole 10% solution or tavaborole 5% solution. 
We downgraded evidence for heterogeneity, lack of blinding, and small sample sizes. There is uncertainty about the effectiveness of device‐based treatments, which were under‐represented; 80% of studies assessed topical treatments, but we were unable to evaluate all of the currently relevant topical treatments. 
Future studies of topical and device‐based therapies should be blinded, with patient‐centred outcomes and an adequate sample size. They should specify the causative organism and directly compare treatments.","Are topical and device‐based treatments effective in people with fungal infections of the toenails? 
Review question 
We reviewed evidence about the effect of topical and device‐based treatments for fungal infections of the toenails (toenail onychomycosis) when compared against each other, placebo (an identical but inactive treatment), vehicle (inactive ingredients that help deliver an active treatment), or no treatment. We assessed adults, whose infection was diagnosed based on studying nail samples. 
Background 
Toenail onychomycosis causes pain, discomfort, and disfigurement. Topical and device‐based treatments can have less likelihood of drug interactions or side effects than oral drugs. Antifungal medications are either fungistatic (inhibiting fungal growth) or fungicidal (killing fungal pathogens). The shared goal of devices (e.g. laser, photodynamic therapy) is fungus destruction. 
Study characteristics 
In searches up to May 2019, we found 56 studies including 12,501 men or women (average age: 27 to 68 years) who had mainly mild‐to‐moderate toenail onychomycosis. Onychomycosis duration was under‐reported, but varied from months to years. Approximately 63% of the studies assessed onychomycosis caused by dermatophytes (fungi). Most studies lasted 48 to 52 weeks and were conducted in an outpatient setting. The studies used either device‐based or topical treatments, including lacquers and creams, alone or in combination, compared to each other, to no treatment, to vehicle, or to placebo. 
Key results 
For the following key results, treatment lasted 36 or 48 weeks, and outcomes were measured at 40 to 52 weeks (side effects were measured throughout the study). 
Compared to vehicle (no treatment), efinaconazole 10% topical solution is better at achieving complete cure (i.e. normal‐looking nail coupled with fungus elimination determined using laboratory methods) (high‐quality evidence). Tavaborole 5% solution (when compared to vehicle) and P‐3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer) (when compared to two other treatments: ciclopirox 8% lacquer or amorolfine 5%) are probably better at achieving this outcome (both moderate‐quality evidence). Ciclopirox 8% lacquer may lead to higher complete cure rates than vehicle, but rates are low (not all patients can be expected to achieve complete cure) (low‐quality evidence). 
Ciclopirox 8% lacquer and efinaconazole 10% are probably more effective at eliminating the fungus (mycological cure) than vehicle, but for P‐3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer) there is probably little or no difference compared to the two comparator treatments (all moderate‐quality evidence). Tavaborole 5% improves mycological cure compared to vehicle (high‐quality evidence). 
We found no evidence of a difference in side effects, including redness, rash, and burning, between P‐3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer) and the two other treatments (low‐quality evidence), and ciclopirox 8% lacquer may increase side effects, including application‐site reactions, rashes, and changes in the nail compared with vehicle, although treatment effects vary, so it is possible that it may actually make little or no difference (low‐quality evidence). Compared to vehicle, participants were slightly more likely to experience side effects (commonly dermatitis and fluid‐filled sacs) with efinaconazole 10% (high‐quality evidence) and probably more likely to experience side effects with tavaborole 5% (commonly, application‐site reactions, such as dermatitis, redness, and pain) (moderate‐quality evidence). 
We are uncertain of the effect of luliconazole 5% on complete cure when compared to vehicle (very low‐quality evidence); there may be little or no difference between these groups in side effects (dry skin, eczema, and thickening of the skin were commonly reported, but improved after stopping treatment), and luliconazole 5% solution might increase mycological cure; however, the effects of this treatment vary, so it is possible that it may actually make little or no difference to mycological cure (both low‐quality evidence). 
Three studies compared laser to no treatment or sham treatment, and there may be little or no difference in mycological cure (low‐quality evidence). Complete cure was not measured, and we are uncertain if there is a difference in side effects between groups (very low‐quality evidence). 
Efinaconazole 10% solution is more effective in achieving clinical cure than vehicle (high‐quality evidence); none of the other key comparisons measured this outcome. 
Quality of the evidence 
We base our conclusions on varied evidence quality. For complete cure, mycological cure, and side effects, quality ranged from low to high, with very low‐quality evidence found for three key results. 
Many studies were small, had design issues, and did not directly compare therapies. No studies reported quality of life.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
163,"Background
The frequency of skin ulceration makes an important contributor to the morbidity burden in people with sickle cell disease. Many treatment options are available to the healthcare professional, although it is uncertain which treatments have been assessed for effectiveness in people with sickle cell disease. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. 
Objectives
To assess the clinical effectiveness and harms of interventions for treating leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register. 
We searched LILACS (1982 to January 2020), ISI Web of Knowledge (1985 to January 2020), and the Clinical Trials Search Portal of the World Health Organization (January 2020). We checked the reference lists of all the trials identified. We also contacted those groups or individuals who may have completed relevant randomised trials in this area. 
Date of the last search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 13 January 2020; date of the last search of the Cochrane Wounds Group Trials Register: 17 February 2017. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of interventions for treating leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease compared to placebo or an alternative treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion. All three authors independently assessed the risk of bias of the included studies and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
Six studies met the inclusion criteria (198 participants with 250 ulcers). Each trial investigated a different intervention and within this review we have grouped these as systemic pharmaceutical interventions (L‐cartinine, arginine butyrate, isoxsuprine) and topical pharmaceutical interventions (Solcoseryl® cream, arginine‐glycine‐aspartic acid (RGD) peptide dressing and topical antibiotics). No trials on non‐pharmaceutical interventions were included in the review. All trials had an overall unclear or high risk of bias, and drug companies sponsored four of them. We were unable to pool findings due to the heterogeneity in outcome definitions, and inconsistency between the units of randomisation and analysis. 
Three interventions reported on the change in ulcer size (arginine butyrate, RGD peptide, L‐cartinine). Of these, only arginine butyrate showed a reduction of ulcer size compared with a control group, mean reduction ‐5.10 cm² (95% CI ‐9.65 to ‐0.55), but we are uncertain whether this reduces ulcer size compared to standard care alone as the certainty of the evidence has been assessed as very low. Three trials reported on complete leg ulcer closure (isoxsuprine, arginine butyrate, RGD peptide matrix; very low quality of evidence). None reported a clinical benefit. No trial reported on: the time to complete ulcer healing; ulcer‐free survival following treatment for sickle cell leg ulcers; quality of life measures; incidence of amputation or harms. 
Authors' conclusions
Given the very low quality of the evidence identified in this updated Cochrane Review we are uncertain whether any of the assessed pharmaceutical interventions reduce ulcer size or result in leg ulcer closure in treated participants compared to controls. However, this intervention was assessed as having a high risk of bias due to inadequacies in the single trial report. Other included studies were also assessed as having an unclear or high risk of bias. The harm profile of the all interventions remains inconclusive.","Treatments for leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease

Leg ulcers are a chronic complication for people living with sickle cell disease. Ulcers tend to be difficult to treat successfully, healing slowly over months or years. They can severely disrupt quality of life, increase disability, require extended absence from the workplace, and place a high burden of care on healthcare systems. We looked at whether treatments for leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease were effective and safe. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 13 January 2020.
Study characteristics 
In this updated Cochrane Review we have included six randomised controlled trials including 198 participants with 250 ulcers. Four of the randomised controlled trials were conducted in Jamaica and two in the USA. These trials included medications or dressings applied directly to the ulcer (topical medications) and medications given orally or intravenously (systemic medications). Given the very different modes of action of these two groups, we treated them separately throughout the review. The topical agents included Solcoseryl® cream, RGD peptide matrix dressing and topical antibiotics. Socoseryl aims to improve the use of oxygen by the skin tissue and so promote wound healing. Topical antibiotics are also used to prevent infection. The RGD peptide matrix is a gel that promotes cell growth. The systemic interventions included arginine butyrate, L‐cartinine, and isoxsuprine. Aginine butyrate, given intravenously, is thought to accelerate wound healing, L‐carnitine, given orally, is thought to improve tissue hypoxia, and isoxsuprine, given orally as isoxsuprine hydrochloride, is thought to widen blood vessels, so increasing blood flow to an affected wound. 
Key results 
Given the very low quality of the evidence we are uncertain whether any of the assessed pharmaceutical interventions reduce ulcer size or result in leg ulcer closure. None of the included trials reported on our other outcomes of interest: the time to complete ulcer healing; ulcer‐free survival following treatment for sickle cell leg ulcers; quality of life measures; incidence of amputation; or harms. 
Quality of the evidence 
There is very limited evidence available on the use of interventions to treat people with sickle cell disease and chronic leg ulceration. All randomised clinical trials that we included in this review were associated with an unclear or high risk of bias, providing very low‐quality evidence. This systematic review has shown the need for well‐designed, high‐quality randomised trials to assess the benefits and harms of interventions to improve the healing of leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
164,"Background
Injury to the abdomen can be blunt or penetrating. Abdominal injury can damage internal organs such as the liver, spleen, kidneys, intestine, and large blood vessels. There are controversies about the best approach to manage abdominal injuries. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of surgical and non‐surgical interventions in the management of abdominal trauma in a haemodynamically stable and non‐peritonitic abdomen. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, The Cochrane Library, Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid MEDLINE(R) In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid OLDMEDLINE(R), EMBASE Classic+EMBASE (Ovid), ISI WOS (SCI‐EXPANDED, SSCI, CPCI‐S & CPSI‐SSH), CINAHL Plus (EBSCO), and clinical trials registers, and screened reference lists. We ran the most recent search on 17 September 2015. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of surgical interventions and non‐surgical interventions involving people with abdominal injury who were haemodynamically stable with no signs of peritonitis. The abdominal injury could be blunt or penetrating. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently applied the selection criteria. Data were extracted by two authors using a standard data extraction form, and are reported narratively. 
Main results
Two studies are included, which involved a total of 114 people with penetrating abdominal injuries. Both studies are at moderate risk of bias because the randomisation methods are not fully described, and the original study protocols are no longer available. The studies were undertaken in Finland between 1992 and 2002, by the same two researchers. 
In one study, 51 people were randomised to surgery or an observation protocol. None of the participants in the study died. Seven people had complications: 5 (18.5%) in the surgical group and 2 (8.3%) in the observation group; the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.42; Fischer's exact). Among the 27 people who had surgery, 6 (22.2%) surgeries were negative laparotomies, and 15 (55.6%) were non‐therapeutic. 
In the other study, 63 people were randomised to diagnostic laparoscopy (surgery) or an observation protocol. There were no deaths and no unnecessary surgeries in either group. Four people did not receive the intervention they were assigned. There was no difference in therapeutic operations between the two groups: 3 of 28 in the diagnostic laparoscopy group versus 1 of 31 in the observation protocol group (P = 0.337). 
Authors' conclusions
Based on the findings of 2 studies involving a total of 114 people, there is no evidence to support the use of surgery over an observation protocol for people with penetrating abdominal trauma who have no signs of peritonitis and are stable.","Surgery versus observation for people with abdominal injury
Injury to the abdomen is common and can be blunt from road traffic crashes or falls, or penetrating from gun shots or stabbing. These injuries are usually associated with injury to the abdominal organs such as the liver, spleen, kidneys, intestine and its covering, and big blood vessels. Massive bleeding or leakage of abdominal content into the abdominal cavity can occur, which may threaten a person's life. Examination of the patient by the doctor (physical examination), though the most accurate method of assessing people, is insufficient to determine the extent of damage. On the other hand, a person should not have a surgical procedure unless it is necessary. There are reports that injuries can be missed even when surgery is carried out. 
Observing a patient with the hope that the person's injury heals naturally and intervening surgically if the need arises is known as selective non‐operative management (SNOM) or observation. An observation protocol is used when the person has no sign of internal bleeding or abdominal infection (peritonitis). Surgery is resorted to if, during observation, signs of bleeding or infection are observed. 
The authors of this review sought to identify every study where people with an abdominal injury were randomised to surgery or observation. The authors searched a variety of medical databases but only identified 2 studies, involving 51 and 63 people respectively, both of which took place in Finland and were conducted by the same researchers. Both studies included people with penetrating abdominal injuries, from having been stabbed. The review authors considered both studies to be at moderate risk of bias, since only part of the randomisation process was described and the study protocols were not available to enable full assessment of overall quality. 
In one study (1992‐1994) people received either an observation protocol or mandatory surgery. None of the people in the study died, and there was no difference in the number of people with medical complications between the study groups. One of the harms mentioned by the study authors was that surgery was performed on some people who did not actually need it. Unnecessary surgery can subject people to potential complications. 
In the other study (1997‐2002) people received an observation protocol or diagnostic laparoscopy (minimal surgery). No one died in either group, and there were no differences between the groups in the number of surgeries needed. There were no unnecessary surgeries in either group. 
Based on the findings of these two small studies, there is no evidence to support the use of surgical management over an observation protocol for people with abdominal trauma showing no signs of bleeding or infection. 
The authors recommend that future randomised controlled studies clearly report the type of injury, number of damaged organs, extent of damage of internal organs, and complications in the people included.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
165,"Background
People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at increased risk of pneumococcal disease, especially pneumonia, as well as acute exacerbations with associated morbidity and healthcare costs. 
Objectives
To determine the efficacy of injectable pneumococcal vaccination for preventing pneumonia in persons with COPD. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Airways COPD Trials Register and the databases CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase, using prespecified terms. Searches are current to November 2016. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing injectable pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) or pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV) versus a control or alternative vaccine type in people with COPD. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. For meta‐analyses, we subgrouped studies by vaccine type. 
Main results
For this update, we added five studies (606 participants), meaning that the review now includes a total of 12 RCTs involving 2171 participants with COPD. Average age of participants was 66 years, male participants accounted for 67% and mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was 1.2 L (five studies), 54% predicted (four studies). We assessed risks of selection, attrition and reporting bias as low, and risks of performance and detection bias as moderate. 
Compared with control, the vaccine group had a lower likelihood of developing community‐acquired pneumonia (CAP) (odds ratio (OR) 0.59 , 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 0.85; six studies, n = 1372; GRADE: moderate), but findings did not differ specifically for pneumococcal pneumonia (Peto OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.31; three studies, n = 1158; GRADE: low). The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) (preventing one episode of CAP) was 19 (95% CI 13 to 52). Mortality from cardiorespiratory causes did not differ between vaccine and control groups (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.66; three studies, n = 888; GRADE: moderate), nor did all‐cause mortality differ (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.40; five studies, n = 1053; GRADE: moderate). The likelihood of hospital admission for any cause, or for cardiorespiratory causes, did not differ between vaccine and control groups. Vaccination significantly reduced the likelihood of a COPD exacerbation (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.93; four studies, n = 446; GRADE: moderate). The NNTB to prevent a patient from experiencing an acute exacerbation was 8 (95% CI 5 to 58). Only one study (n = 181) compared the efficacy of different vaccine types ‐ 23‐valent PPV versus 7‐valent PCV ‐ and reported no differences for CAP, all‐cause mortality, hospital admission or likelihood of a COPD exacerbation, but investigators described a greater likelihood of some mild adverse effects of vaccination with PPV‐23. 
Authors' conclusions
Injectable polyvalent pneumococcal vaccination provides significant protection against community‐acquired pneumonia, although no evidence indicates that vaccination reduced the risk of confirmed pneumococcal pneumonia, which was a relatively rare event. Vaccination reduced the likelihood of a COPD exacerbation, and moderate‐quality evidence suggests the benefits of pneumococcal vaccination in people with COPD. Evidence was insufficient for comparison of different pneumococcal vaccine types.","Do injectable pneumococcal vaccines prevent pneumonia in people with COPD?
We wanted to find out if pneumococcal vaccination for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) reduces the risk of pneumonia and associated mortality. We found a total of 12 studies including 2171 participants. Evidence gathered in this review is current to December 2015. 
Background 
People with COPD are at increased risk of respiratory illness such as pneumonia due to a bacterium called Streptococcus pneumoniae, other community‐acquired pneumonias and acute COPD exacerbations. These illnesses increase mortality and are associated with increased healthcare costs. 
Study characteristics 
For this updated review, we identified five new studies (606 participants), bringing the total number of studies to 12, involving 2171 participants with COPD. The average age of participants was 66 years, 67% were male and participants had received a diagnosis of moderate to severe COPD. Eleven studies compared an injectable vaccine versus a control, and one study compared two different types of injectable vaccine. 
Key results 
People who were vaccinated were less likely to experience an episode of community‐acquired pneumonia; 19 people with COPD (95% confidence interval (CI) 13 to 52) would have to be vaccinated to prevent one episode of pneumonia. Vaccination made no difference in the risk of pneumococcal pneumonia due to S pneumoniae or in the chance of dying or of being admitted to hospital. People who were vaccinated were less likely to experience a COPD exacerbation; eight people with COPD (95% CI 5 to 58) would have to be vaccinated to prevent one person from having an acute exacerbation. We found no difference in effectiveness between the two types of injectable vaccine. 
Quality of the evidence 
Evidence in this review is generally independent and reliable, and we are moderately certain about the results. 
Conclusions 
In line with current guidance, this review suggests that all people with COPD should be given pneumococcal vaccination to provide some protection against community‐acquired pneumonia, and to reduce the chance of an acute exacerbation.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
166,"Background
There is significant uncertainty in the treatment of intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma which is defined by the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) as hepatocellular carcinoma stage B with large, multi‐nodular, Child‐Pugh status A to B, performance status 0 to 2, and without vascular occlusion or extrahepatic disease. 
Objectives
To assess the comparative benefits and harms of different interventions used in the treatment of intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma (BCLC stage B) through a network meta‐analysis and to generate rankings of the available interventions according to their safety and efficacy. However, we found only one comparison. Therefore, we did not perform the network meta‐analysis, and we assessed the comparative benefits and harms of different interventions versus each other, or versus placebo, sham, or no intervention (supportive treatment only) using standard Cochrane methodology. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and randomised clinical trials registers to September 2016 to identify randomised clinical trials on hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Selection criteria
We included only randomised clinical trials, irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status, in participants with intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma, irrespective of the presence of cirrhosis, size, or number of the tumours (provided they met the criteria of intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma), of presence or absence of portal hypertension, of aetiology of hepatocellular carcinoma, and of the future remnant liver volume. We excluded trials which included participants who had previously undergone liver transplantation. We considered any of the various interventions compared with each other or with no active intervention (supportive treatment only). We excluded trials which compared variations of the same intervention: for example, different methods of performing transarterial chemoembolisation. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We calculated the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using both fixed‐effect and random‐effects models based on available‐participant analysis with Review Manager. We assessed risk of bias according to Cochrane, controlled risk of random errors with Trial Sequential Analysis using Stata, and assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
Three randomised clinical trials, including 430 participants, met the inclusion criteria for this review; however, data from two trials with 412 participants could be included in only one primary outcome (i.e. mortality). All three trials were at high risk of bias. All three trials included supportive care as cointervention. The comparisons included in the two trials reporting on mortality were: systemic chemotherapy with sorafenib versus no active intervention; and transarterial chemoembolisation plus systemic chemotherapy with sorafenib versus transarterial chemoembolisation alone. The trials did not report the duration of follow‐up; however, it appeared that the participants were followed up for a period of about 18 to 30 months. The majority of the participants in the trials had cirrhotic livers. The trials included participants with intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma arising from viral and non‐viral aetiologies. The trials did not report the portal hypertension status of the participants. The mortality was 50% to 70% over a median follow‐up period of 18 to 30 months. There was no evidence of difference in mortality at maximal follow‐up between systemic chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy (hazard ratio 0.85, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.18; participants = 412; studies = 2; I2 = 0%; very low quality evidence). A subgroup analysis performed by stratifying the analysis by the presence or absence of transarterial chemoembolisation as cointervention did not alter the results. None of the trials reported on serious adverse events other than mortality, health‐related quality of life, recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma, or length of hospital stay. One of the trials providing data was funded by the pharmaceutical industry, the other did not report the source of funding, and the trial with no data for the review was also funded by the pharmaceutical industry. We found two ongoing trials. 
Authors' conclusions
Currently, there is no evidence from randomised clinical trials that people with intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma would benefit from systemic chemotherapy with sorafenib either alone or when transarterial chemoembolisation was used as a cointervention (very low quality evidence). We need high‐quality randomised clinical trials designed to measure differences in clinically important outcomes (e.g. all‐cause mortality or health‐related quality of life).","Treatment of intermediate‐stage primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma)
Background 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer) arises from the liver cells and is distinct from secondary liver cancer, arising from other parts of the body and spreading to the liver. Hepatocellular carcinoma can be classified in many ways. One classification is by Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) group stage which classifies the cancer based on how long the person is expected to live (life expectancy). This classification is broadly based on the size of the cancer, number of cancers in the liver, how well the liver works, and whether one's activities are affected by the cancer. People with intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma have large, multiple cancers, but they do not have full‐blown liver failure. Cancer is confined to the liver, and there is no restriction of daily activities. There is significant uncertainty in the treatment of people with intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma. We sought to resolve this uncertainty by searching for existing studies on the topic. We included all randomised clinical trials (well‐designed clinical trials where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) whose results were reported to September 2016. We included only trials in which participants with intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma had not undergone liver transplantation previously. Apart from using standard Cochrane methods which allow comparison of only two treatments at a time (direct comparison), we planned to use an advanced method which allows comparison of the many different treatments that are individually compared in the trials (network meta‐analysis). However, because there was only one comparison, we could only use standard Cochrane methodology. 
Study characteristics 
Only three trials with 430 participants met our inclusion criteria; however, two of the trials (412 participants) only reported death and no other measures of how well the treatments worked. All three trials included supportive care (treatment to prevent, control, or relieve complications and side effects and improve comfort and quality of life) as a co‐intervention. The trials assessed transarterial chemoembolisation (where anti‐cancer drugs block the blood supply and treat the cancer through the vessels supplying the cancer), chemotherapy using sorafenib (a drug which blocks cancer growth), or a combination of transarterial chemoembolisation and sorafenib. It appeared that the trials followed participants for about 18 to 30 months from the initiation of treatment. 
Two trials were funded by the pharmaceutical industry; one trial did not report the source of funding. 
Key results 
Over 18 to 30 months, 50% to 75% of participants died. There was no evidence of any difference between the people who received chemotherapy and those who did not receive chemotherapy. None of the trials reported complications, health‐related quality of life (a measure of a person's satisfaction with their life and health), cancer recurrence, or length of hospital stay. Overall, there is currently no evidence for benefit of any active treatment in addition to supportive treatment for intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma. There is significant uncertainty on this and further high‐quality randomised clinical trials are required. 
Quality of evidence 
The overall quality of evidence was low or very low and all the trials were at high risk of bias, which means that there is possibility of making the wrong conclusions, overestimating benefits, or underestimating harms of one treatment or the other because of the way that the trials were conducted.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
167,"Background
When women require induction of labour, oxytocin is the most common agent used, delivered by an intravenous infusion titrated to uterine contraction strength and frequency. There is debate over the optimum dose regimen and how it impacts on maternal and fetal outcomes, particularly induction to birth interval, mode of birth, and rates of hyperstimulation. Current induction of labour regimens include both high‐ and low‐dose regimens and are delivered by either continuous or pulsed infusions, with both linear and non‐linear incremental increases in oxytocin dose. Whilst low‐dose protocols bring on contractions safely, their potentially slow induction to birth interval may increase the chance of fetal infection and chorioamnionitis. Conversely, high‐dose protocols may cause undue uterine hyperstimulation and fetal distress. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness and safety of high‐ versus low‐dose oxytocin for induction of labour at term 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials Register (31 August 2014) and the reference lists of relevant papers. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials and quasi‐randomised controlled trials that compared oxytocin protocol for induction of labour for women at term, where high‐dose oxytocin is at least 100 mU oxytocin in the first 40 minutes, with increments delivering at least 600 mU in the first two hours, compared with low‐dose oxytocin, defined as less than 100 mU oxytocin in the first 40 minutes, and increments delivering less than 600 mU total in the first two hours. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Data were checked for accuracy. 
Main results
We have included nine trials, involving 2391 women and their babies in this review. Trials were at a moderate to high risk of bias overall. 
Results of primary outcomes revealed no significant differences in rates of vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours (risk ratio (RR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.14, two trials, 1339 women) or caesarean section (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.14, eight trials, 2023 women). There was no difference in serious maternal morbidity or death (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.82, one trial, 523 women), and no difference in serious neonatal morbidity or perinatal death (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.23 to 3.12, one trial, 781 infants). Finally, no trials reported on the number of women who had uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate changes. 
Results of secondary outcomes revealed no difference between time from induction to delivery (mean difference (MD) ‐0.90 hours, 95% CI ‐2.28 to +0.49 hours; five studies), uterine rupture (RR 3.10, 95% CI 0.50 to 19.33; three trials), epidural analgesia (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.18; two trials), instrumental birth (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.66; three trials), Apgar less than seven at five minutes (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.77 to 2.01, five trials), perinatal death (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.23 to 3.12; two trials), postpartum haemorrhage (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.34; five trials), or endometritis (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.53 to 3.43; three trials). Removal of high bias studies reveals a significant reduction of induction to delivery interval (MD ‐1.94 hours, 95% CI ‐0.99 to ‐2.89 hours, 489 women). A significant increase in hyperstimulation without specifying fetal heart rate changes was found in the high‐dose group (RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.55 to 2.25). 
No other secondary outcomes were reported: unchanged/unfavourable cervix after 12 to 24 hours, meconium‐stained liquor, neonatal intensive care unit admission, neonatal encephalopathy, disability in childhood, other maternal side‐effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea), maternal antibiotic use, maternal satisfaction, neonatal infection and neonatal antibiotic use. 
Authors' conclusions
The findings of our review do not provide evidence that high‐dose oxytocin increases either vaginal delivery within 24 hours or the caesarean section rate. There is no significant decrease in induction to delivery time at meta‐analysis but these results may be confounded by poor quality trials. High‐dose oxytocin was shown to increase the rate of uterine hyperstimulation but the effects of this are not clear. The conclusions here are specific to the definitions used in this review. Further trials evaluating the effects of high‐dose regimens of oxytocin for induction of labour should consider all important maternal and infant outcomes.","High‐dose versus low‐dose oxytocin infusion regimens for induction of labour
Some women do not begin labour spontaneously and may need assistance. This assistance, known as induction of labour, involves the use of an intervention to artificially commence uterine contractions for the mother. Oxytocin is a drug that is commonly given to women for induction of labour; however the most suitable dose to enable birth to occur safely for the mother and her baby, within a reasonable timeframe, is not known. 
We included nine randomised controlled trials involving 2391 women and their babies in this review. The trials were of moderate quality overall. All trials compared giving women a high dose versus a low dose of oxytocin for induction of labour. We found that women who had a high dose of oxytocin were not more likely to have a shorter induction to delivery interval or have a vaginal birth within 24 hours of receiving the treatment than women receiving a low dose of oxytocin. When poor‐quality trials are removed from analysis however, the induction to delivery interval was significantly shorter with high‐dose oxytocin compared to low‐dose oxytocin. The likelihood of having a caesarean was similar with the different doses of oxytocin for induction of labour. No differences were shown between the two groups of women in terms of serious complications, including death of the mother or her baby but women receiving the high‐dose oxytocin did have an increased risk of excessive uterine contractions (known as uterine hyperstimulation). No trials provided any information about the number of women with uterine hyperstimulation with changes in the babies' heart rate. Similarly, no trials assessed satisfaction of the mother or her caregivers. 
The trials were at moderate to high risk of bias overall. The definition of high‐ and low‐dose protocols and the outcomes measured varied considerably across the trials. The current evidence is not strong enough to recommend high‐dose over low‐dose regimens for routine induction of labour. We recommend that further research is carried out.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
168,"Background
Antibiotics alter the microbial balance commonly resulting in antibiotic‐associated diarrhea (AAD). Probiotics may prevent AAD via providing gut barrier, restoration of the gut microflora, and other potential mechanisms of action. 
Objectives
The primary objectives were to assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics (any specified strain or dose) used for the prevention of AAD in children. 
Search methods
MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and the Web of Science (inception to 28 May 2018) were searched along with registers including the ISRCTN and Clinicaltrials.gov. We also searched the NICE Evidence Services database as well as reference lists from relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomized, parallel, controlled trials in children (0 to 18 years) receiving antibiotics, that compare probiotics to placebo, active alternative prophylaxis, or no treatment and measure the incidence of diarrhea secondary to antibiotic use were considered for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
Study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were conducted independently by two authors. Dichotomous data (incidence of AAD, adverse events) were combined using a pooled risk ratio (RR) or risk difference (RD), and continuous data (mean duration of diarrhea) as mean difference (MD), along with corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). We calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) where appropriate. For studies reporting on microbiome characteristics using heterogeneous outcomes, we describe the results narratively. The certainty of the evidence was evaluated using GRADE. 
Main results
Thirty‐three studies (6352 participants) were included. Probiotics assessed included Bacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Clostridium butyricum, Lactobacilli spp., Lactococcus spp., Leuconostoc cremoris, Saccharomyces spp., orStreptococcus spp., alone or in combination. The risk of bias was determined to be high in 20 studies and low in 13 studies. Complete case (patients who did not complete the studies were not included in the analysis) results from 33 trials reporting on the incidence of diarrhea show a precise benefit from probiotics compared to active, placebo or no treatment control. 
After 5 days to 12 weeks of follow‐up, the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% (259/3232) compared to 19% (598/3120) in the control group (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.56; I² = 57%, 6352 participants; NNTB 9, 95% CI 7 to 13; moderate certainty evidence). Nineteen studies had loss to follow‐up ranging from 1% to 46%. After making assumptions for those lost, the observed benefit was still statistically significant using an extreme plausible intention‐to‐treat (ITT) analysis, wherein the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 12% (436/3551) compared to 19% (664/3468) in the control group (7019 participants; RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.49 to 0.77; P <0.00001; I² = 70%). An a priori available case subgroup analysis exploring heterogeneity indicated that high dose (≥ 5 billion CFUs per day) is more effective than low probiotic dose (< 5 billion CFUs per day), interaction P value = 0.01. For the high dose studies the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% (162/2029) compared to 23% (462/2009) in the control group (4038 participants; RR 0.37; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.46; P = 0.06; moderate certainty evidence). For the low dose studies the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% (97/1155) compared to 13% (133/1059) in the control group (2214 participants; RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.01; P = 0.02). Again, assumptions for loss to follow‐up using an extreme plausible ITT analysis was statistically significant. For high dose studies the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 13% (278/2218) compared to 23% (503/2207) in control group (4425 participants; RR 0.54; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.70; P <0.00001; I² = 68%; moderate certainty evidence). 
None of the 24 trials (4415 participants) that reported on adverse events reported any serious adverse events attributable to probiotics. Adverse event rates were low. After 5 days to 4 weeks follow‐up, 4% (86/2229) of probiotics participants had an adverse event compared to 6% (121/2186) of control participants (RD 0.00; 95% CI ‐0.01 to 0.01; P < 0.00001; I² = 75%; low certainty evidence). Common adverse events included rash, nausea, gas, flatulence, abdominal bloating, and constipation. 
After 10 days to 12 weeks of follow‐up, eight studies recorded data on our secondary outcome, the mean duration of diarrhea; with probiotics reducing diarrhea duration by almost one day (MD ‐0.91; 95% CI ‐1.38 to ‐0.44; P <0.00001; low certainty evidence). One study reported on microbiome characteristics, reporting no difference in changes with concurrent antibiotic and probiotic use. 
Authors' conclusions
The overall evidence suggests a moderate protective effect of probiotics for preventing AAD (NNTB 9, 95% CI 7 to 13). Using five criteria to evaluate the credibility of the subgroup analysis on probiotic dose, the results indicate the subgroup effect based on high dose probiotics (≥ 5 billion CFUs per day) was credible. Based on high‐dose probiotics, the NNTB to prevent one case of diarrhea is 6 (95% CI 5 to 9). The overall certainty of the evidence for the primary endpoint, incidence of AAD, based on high dose probiotics was moderate due to the minor issues with risk of bias and inconsistency related to a diversity of probiotic agents used. Evidence also suggests that probiotics may moderately reduce the duration of diarrhea, a reduction by almost one day. The benefit of high dose probiotics (e.g. Lactobacillus rhamnosus orSaccharomyces boulardii) needs to be confirmed by a large well‐designed multi‐centered randomized trial. It is premature to draw firm conclusions about the efficacy and safety of 'other' probiotic agents as an adjunct to antibiotics in children. Adverse event rates were low and no serious adverse events were attributable to probiotics. Although no serious adverse events were observed among inpatient and outpatient children, including small studies conducted in the intensive care unit and in the neonatal unit, observational studies not included in this review have reported serious adverse events in severely debilitated or immuno‐compromised children with underlying risk factors including central venous catheter use and disorders associated with bacterial/fungal translocation.","Probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic‐associated diarrhea in children
What is antibiotic‐associated diarrhea? 
Antibiotic‐associated diarrhea (AAD) occurs when antibiotics disturb the natural balance of ""good"" and ""bad"" bacteria in the intestinal tract causing harmful bacteria to multiply beyond their normal numbers. The symptoms of AAD include frequent watery bowel movements and crampy abdominal pain. 
What are probiotics? 
Probiotics are found in dietary supplements or yogurts and contain potentially beneficial bacteria or yeast. Probiotics may restore the natural balance of bacteria in the intestinal tract. 
What did the researchers investigate? 
The researchers investigated whether probiotics prevent AAD in children receiving antibiotic therapy and whether probiotics causes any harms (side effects). The researchers searched the medical literature extensively up to May 28, 2018. 
What did the researchers find? 
Thirty‐three studies were reviewed and provide the best available evidence. The studies tested 6352 children (3 days to 17 years of age) who were receiving probiotics co‐administered with antibiotics to prevent AAD. The participants received probiotics (Lactobacilli spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Streptococcus spp., or Saccharomyces boulardii alone or in combination), placebo (pills not including probiotics), other treatments thought to prevent AAD (i.e. diosmectite or infant formula) or no treatment. The studies were short‐term, ranging in length from 5 days to 12 weeks. Analyses showed that probiotics are effective for preventing AAD. The incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% (259/3232) compared to 19% (598/3120) in the control group, demonstrating a moderate reduction (11% fewer will suffer diarrhea). For every 9 children treated, probiotics will prevent one case of diarrhea. Further, evidence suggests that higher dose probiotics (≥ 5 billion CFUs per day) reduce the incidence of AAD. Eight per cent (162/2029) of the high dose probiotics group had AAD compared to 23% (462/2009) in the control group, demonstrating a moderate to large reduction (15% fewer suffer diarrhea). Probiotics were generally well tolerated, and minor side effects (e.g. rash, nausea, gas, flatulence, abdominal bloating, constipation) occurred infrequently. . Evidence suggested that probiotics are effective for a moderate reduction in duration of diarrhea (almost one day). Among the various probiotics evaluated, Lactobacillus rhamnosus or Saccharomyces boulardii at 5 to 40 billion colony forming units/day appear most appropriate for preventing AAD in children receiving antibiotics. It is premature to draw conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of 'other' probiotic agents for preventing AAD. Although no serious probiotic‐related side effects were observed among the mostly otherwise healthy children who participated in the studies, serious side effects have been reported in observational studies not included in this review, including severely debilitated or immuno‐compromised children with underlying risk factors including central venous catheter (a flexible tube used to give medicines) use and disorders associated with bacterial or fungal translocation (the passage of bacteria from the gut to other areas of the body).",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
169,"Background
A pressure ulcer is defined as ""an area of localized injury to the skin and/or underlying tissue, usually over a bony prominence, as a result of pressure, or pressure in combination with shear"". The use of phototherapy ‐ that is, light (or laser) used as an adjuvant, non‐surgical intervention, with the aim of having a therapeutic effect on healing ‐ has increased recently. 
Objectives
To determine the effects of phototherapy on the healing of pressure ulcers.
Search methods
In January 2014, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid EMBASE; Ovid MEDLINE (In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); and EBSCO CINAHL. We did not restrict the search by language or publication date. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of phototherapy (in addition to standard treatment) with sham phototherapy (in addition to standard treatment), another type of phototherapy (in addition to standard treatment) or standard or conventional treatment alone. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors assessed studies for relevance and design according to the selection criteria, extracted data and evaluated study quality. The authors made attempts to obtain missing data by contacting study authors. Disagreement was resolved by consensus and discussion with a third review author. 
Main results
We identified seven RCTs involving 403 participants. All the trials were at unclear risk of bias. Trials compared the use of phototherapy with standard care only (six trials) or sham phototherapy (one trial). Only one of the trials included a third arm in which another type of phototherapy was applied. Overall, there was insufficient evidence to determine the relative effects of phototherapy for healing pressure ulcers. Time to complete healing was reported in three studies. Two studies showed the ultraviolet (UV) treated group had a shorter mean time to complete healing than the control group (mean difference ‐2.13 weeks (95% CI ‐3.53 to ‐0.72, P value 0.003)). One study reported that the laser group had a longer mean time to complete healing than the control group (mean difference 5.77 weeks; 95% CI ‐0.25 to 11.79). However, this result should be interpreted with caution, as these were small studies and the findings may have been due to chance. Three studies reported proportions of ulcers healed with a variety of results. One study reported a different outcome measure, and the other two studies had different treatment durations. These variations did not allow us to pool the studies and draw any conclusions as to whether phototherapy is effective or not. Adverse effects were reported in only two studies that compared phototherapy with control; the risk ratio for adverse events was imprecise. One study reported risk ratio (RR) 0.72 (95%CI 0.18 to 2.80). However, another study reported RR 0.89 (95% CI: 0.71 to 1.12) based on the number of events in each group, rather than the number of people with events. Among five studies reporting the rate of change in ulcer area, three studies found no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Pooling was not undertaken because of differences in outcome measures reported. The results were based on data from trials with unclear risk of bias for which generation of the randomisation sequence, concealment allocation and blinding of outcome assessors were unclear. No studies reported on quality of life, length of hospital stay, pain or cost. 
Authors' conclusions
We are very uncertain as to the effects of phototherapy in treating pressure ulcers. The quality of evidence is very low due to the unclear risk of bias and small number of trials available for analysis. The possibility of benefit or harm of this treatment cannot be ruled out. Further research is recommended.","Phototherapy for treating pressure ulcers
What are pressure ulcers? 
Pressure ulcers (also called bed sores or pressure sores) are sores on the skin caused by constant pressure or friction. They usually affect people who are immobilised or find it difficult to move themselves, for example the elderly or paralysed. Pressure ulcers frequently occur on bony parts of the body, such as the heels and hips, and also on the coccyx (tail bone). Pressure ulcers do not always heal, and, if they do heal, healing can take a long time. 
What is phototherapy? 
Phototherapy is a treatment in which part of the body is exposed to daylight, a or light of a specific wavelength. It is used for treating a variety of diseases, and may involve lights and lasers. Phototherapy is used to treat pressure ulcers in the hope that it will reduce the time the ulcers take to heal. 
The purpose of this review 
This review tried to find out whether phototherapy treatment(s) given in addition to standard care (i.e. pressure relief, removal of dead tissue from the wound, infection control and application of dressings) improves healing times for pressure ulcers. Standard care plus phototherapy could be compared against standard care alone, or against standard care plus sham phototherapy, or against standard care plus another type of phototherapy. 
Findings of this review 
The review authors searched the medical literature up to 7 January 2014, and identified seven relevant medical trials, with a total of 403 participants. Six trials compared the use of phototherapy with standard care only; one trial compared it with standard care plus sham phototherapy. Only one trial included a third treatment group that investigated another type of phototherapy. 
Two trials reported the time taken for pressure ulcers to heal completely, and these showed an improvement in healing time for people in the phototherapy group who received treatment with ultraviolet light. However, this result should be interpreted with caution, as these were small, poor quality trials, at unclear risk of bias (i.e. with potentially misleading results), and the findings may have been due to chance. The other trials reported either conflicting results or various measures/time points among trials, which meant that we could not conclude whether or not phototherapy is effective for treating pressure ulcers. Two trials reported incidence of harmful (adverse) effects and noted no significant differences between the phototherapy and standard treatment groups. Four trials provided funding information, two from industry funding, the others from an institutional grant. No studies reported on quality of life, length of hospital stay, pain or cost. 
This review identified only a few, small studies provided with insufficient evidence to support the use of phototherapy as a routine treatment for pressure ulcers. More trials will need to be conducted before it can be established whether this treatment works and is safe.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
170,"Background
Efficacy and the risk of severe late effects have to be well‐balanced in treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Late adverse effects include secondary malignancies which often have a poor prognosis. To synthesise evidence on the risk of secondary malignancies after current treatment approaches comprising chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, we performed a meta‐analysis based on individual patient data (IPD) from patients treated for newly diagnosed HL. 
Objectives
We investigated several questions concerning possible changes in the risk of secondary malignancies when modifying chemotherapy or radiotherapy (omission of radiotherapy, reduction of the radiation field, reduction of the radiation dose, use of fewer chemotherapy cycles, intensification of chemotherapy). We also analysed whether these modifications affect progression‐free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE and Cochrane CENTRAL trials databases comprehensively in June 2010 for all randomised trials in HL since 1984. Key international trials registries were also searched. The search was updated in March 2015 without collecting further IPD (one further eligible study found) and again in July 2017 (no further eligible studies). 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for untreated HL patients which enrolled at least 50 patients per arm, completed recruitment by 2007 and performed a treatment comparison relevant to our objectives. 
Data collection and analysis
Study groups submitted IPD, including age, sex, stage and the outcomes secondary malignant neoplasm (SMN), OS and PFS as time‐to‐event data. We meta‐analysed these data using Petos method (SMN) and Cox regression with inverse‐variance pooling (OS, PFS) for each of the five study questions, and performed subgroup and sensitivity analyses to assess the applicability and robustness of the results. 
Main results
We identified 21 eligible trials and obtained IPD for 16. For four studies no data were supplied despite repeated efforts, while one study was only identified in 2015 and IPD were not sought. For each study question, between three and six trials with between 1101 and 2996 participants in total and median follow‐up between 6.7 and 10.8 years were analysed. All participants were adults and mainly under 60 years. Risk of bias was assessed as low for the majority of studies and outcomes. 
Chemotherapy alone versus same chemotherapy plus radiotherapy.  Omitting additional radiotherapy probably reduces secondary malignancy incidence (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.82, low quality of evidence), corresponding to an estimated reduction of eight‐year SMN risk from 8% to 4%. This decrease was particularly true for secondary acute leukemias. However, we had insufficient evidence to determine whether OS rates differ between patients treated with chemotherapy alone versus combined‐modality (hazard ratio (HR) 0.71, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.11, moderate quality of evidence). There was a slightly higher rate of PFS with combined modality, but our confidence in the results was limited by high levels of statistical heterogeneity between studies (HR 1.31, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.73, moderate quality of evidence). 
Chemotherapy plus involved‐field radiation versus same chemotherapy plus extended‐field radiation (early stages) . There is insufficient evidence to determine whether smaller radiation field reduces SMN risk (Peto OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.16, low quality of evidence), OS (HR 0.89, 95% C: 0.70 to 1.12, high quality of evidence) or PFS (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.21, high quality of evidence). 
Chemotherapy plus lower‐dose radiation versus same chemotherapy plus higher‐dose radiation (early stages).  There is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of lower‐radiation dose on SMN risk (Peto OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.50, low quality of evidence), OS (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.28, high quality of evidence) or PFS (HR 1.20, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.48, high quality of evidence). 
Fewer versus more courses of chemotherapy (each with or without radiotherapy; early stages).  Fewer chemotherapy courses probably has little or no effect on SMN risk (Peto OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.62), OS (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.73 to1.34) or PFS (HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.45).Outcomes had a moderate (SMN) or high (OS, PFS) quality of evidence. 
Dose‐intensified versus ABVD‐like chemotherapy  (with or without radiotherapy in each case). In the mainly advanced‐stage patients who were treated with intensified chemotherapy, the rate of secondary malignancies was low. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effect of chemotherapy intensification (Peto OR 1.37, CI 0.89 to 2.10, low quality of evidence). The rate of secondary acute leukemias (and for younger patients, all secondary malignancies) was probably higher than among those who had treatment with standard‐dose ABVD‐like protocols. In contrast, the intensified chemotherapy protocols probably improved PFS (eight‐year PFS 75% versus 69% for ABVD‐like treatment, HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.7 to 0.95, moderate quality of evidence). Evidence suggesting improved survival with intensified chemotherapy was not conclusive (HR: 0.85, CI 0.70 to 1.04), although escalated‐dose BEACOPP appeared to lengthen survival compared to ABVD‐like chemotherapy (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.79, moderate quality of evidence). 
Generally, we could draw valid conclusions only in terms of secondary haematological malignancies, which usually occur less than 10 years after initial treatment, while follow‐up within the present analysis was too short to record all solid tumours. 
Authors' conclusions
The risk of secondary acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS) is increased but efficacy is improved among patients treated with intensified chemotherapy protocols. Treatment decisions must be tailored for individual patients. Consolidating radiotherapy is associated with an increased rate of secondary malignancies; therefore it appears important to define which patients can safely be treated without radiotherapy after chemotherapy, both for early and advanced stages. For early stages, treatment optimisation methods such as use of fewer chemotherapy cycles and reduced field or reduced‐dose radiotherapy did not appear to markedly affect efficacy or secondary malignancy risk. Due to the limited amount of long‐term follow‐up in this meta‐analysis, further long‐term investigations of late events are needed, particularly with respect to secondary solid tumours. Since many older studies have been included, possible improvement of radiotherapy techniques must be considered when interpreting these results.","Optimisation of chemotherapy and radiotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma patients with respect to second cancers and survival 
Review question 
We aimed to compare various forms of treatment for newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma involving chemotherapy with or without additional radiotherapy. We particularly looked at the risk of second cancers caused by these treatments, although survival and elimination of Hodgkin lymphoma were also investigated. 
Background 
Since Hodgkin lymphoma often afflicts young people and highly effective treatments allow most patients to survive long after their diagnosis, curing the disease has to be weighed against the risk of causing long‐term adverse effects. Second cancers are a particularly severe form of late toxicity after chemotherapy and radiotherapy. We performed a meta‐analysis based on individual patient data from patients treated for newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma in order to compare second cancer risk, survival and Hodgkin‐free survival with various treatment options. These options included: (1) used of chemotherapy with or without additional radiotherapy; (2) use of a more extensive or more restricted radiation field; (3) use of a higher or lower radiation dose; (4) use of more or fewer courses of chemotherapy and (5) use of standard‐dose or dose‐intensified types of chemotherapy. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to July 2017, based on a total of 16 clinical trials which treated people between 1984 and 2007. Four eligible trials were excluded due to failure to obtain individual patient data, while one further eligible trial was identified only in 2015 and data were not sought. For each of the five study questions (see above), data from between three and six trials with between 1101 and 2996 participants were analysed. Each trial's data covered a follow‐up period of between six and 11 years. All included trials employed modern, widely accepted forms of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Patients were non‐elderly adults of both sexes with early or advances stage disease, according to study question. All trials were funded by public bodies or charities without any direct industry funding. 
Key results 
In the comparison of chemotherapy alone versus same chemotherapy plus radiotherapy (all stages), the use of chemotherapy without additional radiotherapy was associated with a lower second cancer risk but possibly at the cost of more growth or regrowth of the disease. 
In the comparison of chemotherapy plus involved‐field radiation versus same chemotherapy plus extended‐field radiation (early stages), neither second cancer risk, survival or Hodgkin‐free survival was markedly different. 
In the comparison of chemotherapy plus lower‐dose radiation versus same chemotherapy plus higher‐dose radiation (early stages), neither second cancer risk, survival or Hodgkin‐free survival was markedly different. 
In the comparison of fewer versus more courses of chemotherapy (early stages), neither second cancer risk, survival or Hodgkin‐free survival was markedly different. 
In the comparison of dose‐intensified versus ABVD‐like chemotherapy (advanced stages), dose‐intensified chemotherapy improved Hodgkin‐free survival, compared with ABVD‐like regimens, at the cost of a greater risk of secondary leukaemia. Evidence suggesting improved survival with intensified chemotherapy was not conclusive, although escalated‐dose BEACOPP appeared to lengthen survival. 
Quality of the evidence 
Evidence concerning survival and Hodgkin‐free survival was of at least moderate quality, while evidence concerning second cancer risk was partly of low quality due to the small numbers of second cancers observed in the trials and too short follow‐up. Thus, conclusions on second cancer risk remain tentative until more longer‐term data are available. Since many older studies have been included, possible improvement of radiotherapy techniques must be considered when interpreting these results. 
The risk of secondary leukaemia is increased among patients treated with intensified chemotherapy protocols; on the other hand these regimens improve Hodgkin‐free survival. Treatment decisions have to be tailored for the individual patients. Consolidating radiotherapy is associated with an increased rate of secondary malignancies; therefore it appears important to define a patient population that can safely be treated without radiotherapy after chemotherapy, both for early and advanced stages. For early stages, treatment optimisation methods such as use of fewer chemotherapy cycles and reduced field or reduced dose radiotherapy did not appear to markedly affect Hodgkin‐free survival or secondary malignancy risk.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
171,"Background
Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) performed to treat patients with severe diffuse emphysema was reintroduced in the nineties. Lung volume reduction surgery aims to resect damaged emphysematous lung tissue, thereby increasing elastic properties of the lung. This treatment is hypothesised to improve long‐term daily functioning and quality of life, although it may be costly and may be associated with risks of morbidity and mortality. Ten years have passed since the last version of this review was prepared, prompting us to perform an update. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to gather all available evidence from randomised controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) versus non‐surgical standard therapy in improving health outcomes for patients with severe diffuse emphysema. Secondary objectives included determining which subgroup of patients benefit from LVRS and for which patients LVRS is contraindicated, to establish the postoperative complications of LVRS and its morbidity and mortality, to determine which surgical approaches for LVRS are most effective and to calculate the cost‐effectiveness of LVRS. 
Search methods
We identified RCTs by using the Cochrane Airways Group Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) register, in addition to the online clinical trials registers. Searches are current to April 2016. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs that studied the safety and efficacy of LVRS in participants with diffuse emphysema. We excluded studies that investigated giant or bullous emphysema. 
Data collection and analysis
Two independent review authors assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. When possible, we combined data from more than one study in a meta‐analysis using RevMan 5 software. 
Main results
We identified two new studies (89 participants) in this updated review. A total of 11 studies (1760 participants) met the entry criteria of the review, one of which accounted for 68% of recruited participants. The quality of evidence ranged from low to moderate owing to an unclear risk of bias across many studies, lack of blinding and low participant numbers for some outcomes. Eight of the studies compared LVRS versus standard medical care, one compared two closure techniques (stapling vs laser ablation), one looked at the effect of buttressing the staple line on the effectiveness of LVRS and one compared traditional 'resectional' LVRS with a non‐resectional surgical approach. Participants completed a mandatory course of pulmonary rehabilitation/physical training before the procedure commenced. Short‐term mortality was higher for LVRS (odds ratio (OR) 6.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.22 to 11.79; 1489 participants; five studies; moderate‐quality evidence) than for control, but long‐term mortality favoured LVRS (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.95; 1280 participants; two studies; moderate‐quality evidence). Participants identified post hoc as being at high risk of death from surgery were those with particularly impaired lung function, poor diffusing capacity and/or homogenous emphysema. Participants with upper lobe‐predominant emphysema and low baseline exercise capacity showed the most favourable outcomes related to mortality, as investigators reported no significant differences in early mortality between participants treated with LVRS and those in the control group (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.23 to 3.29; 290 participants; one study), as well as significantly lower mortality at the end of follow‐up for LVRS compared with control (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.78; 290 participants; one study). Trials in this review furthermore provided evidence of low to moderate quality showing that improvements in lung function parameters other than forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), quality of life and exercise capacity were more likely with LVRS than with usual follow‐up. Adverse events were more common with LVRS than with control, specifically the occurrence of (persistent) air leaks, pulmonary morbidity (e.g. pneumonia) and cardiovascular morbidity. Although LVRS leads to an increase in quality‐adjusted life‐years (QALYs), the procedure is relatively costly overall. 
Authors' conclusions
Lung volume reduction surgery, an effective treatment for selected patients with severe emphysema, may lead to better health status and lung function outcomes, specifically for patients who have upper lobe‐predominant emphysema with low exercise capacity, but the procedure is associated with risks of early mortality and adverse events.","Lung volume reduction surgery for adults with diffuse emphysema
Review question 
Does lung volume reduction surgery improve lung function and quality of life, without leading to an increased chance of death, higher rates of illness after the procedure and higher costs for patients with severe emphysema, and which surgical methods lead to the best results in these patients? 
Background 
Emphysema causes severe damage to the lungs, which leads to breathing problems. Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) may help improve symptoms by removing the most diseased and non‐functioning parts of the lung. However, this procedure has been the centre of much controversy with its possible benefit being outweighed by potential harms and costs. 
Study characteristics 
This review examined the research published up to the 14th of April, 2016, and identified 11 studies involving 1760 participants. Eight of the studies compared LVRS versus standard medical care, one compared two closure techniques (stapling vs laser ablation), one looked at the effect of buttressing the staple line on the effectiveness of LVRS and one compared a traditional approach to LVRS with a 'non‐resectional' surgical approach. All participants completed a mandatory course of pulmonary rehabilitation/physical training before the procedure commenced. 
Key results 
This review found that people undergoing LVRS were at increased risk of death at three months after the procedure. By the end of follow‐up, death rates were lower for participants treated with LVRS than for those given standard medical care. Participants who were characterised by poor lung function with a particular distribution of diseased tissue in their lungs were at higher risk of death at three months and throughout one large study. One study identified a group of participants who responded better to LVRS than other participants, making them especially suitable for this treatment. The benefit of surgery for surviving participants was significant in terms of quality of life, exercise capacity and lung function, but costs of the procedure are relatively high, and patients had a greater chance of adverse events after the procedure. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the data reported is low to moderate in nature owing to some methodological issues of the trials (lack of blinding, unclear risk of bias). The results presented in this review are largely dominated by one influential study, which accounted for 68% of the participants.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
172,"Background
This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 3, 2012. Caffeine has been added to common analgesics such as paracetamol, ibuprofen, and aspirin, in the belief that it enhances analgesic efficacy. Evidence to support this belief is limited and often based on invalid comparisons. 
Objectives
To assess the relative efficacy of a single dose of an analgesic plus caffeine against the same dose of the analgesic alone, without restriction on the analgesic used or the pain condition studied. We also assessed serious adverse events. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE from inception to 28 August 2014, the Oxford Pain Relief Database, and also carried out Internet searches and contacted pharmaceutical companies known to have carried out trials that have not been published. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised, double‐blind studies that compared a single dose of analgesic plus caffeine with the same dose of the analgesic alone in the treatment of acute pain. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and quality of studies, and extracted data. Any disagreements or uncertainties were settled by discussion with a third review author. We sought any validated measure of analgesic efficacy, but particularly the number of participants experiencing at least 50% of the maximum possible pain relief over four to six hours, participants reporting a global evaluation of treatment of very good or excellent, or headache relief after two hours. We pooled comparable data to look for a statistically significant difference, and calculated numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNT) with caffeine. We also looked for any numerical superiority associated with the addition of caffeine, and information about any serious adverse events. 
Main results
We identified no new studies with available results for this update. The earlier review included 20 studies (7238 participants) in valid comparisons, but because we used different outcomes for some headache studies, the number of participants in the analyses of the effects of caffeine is now 4262 when previously it was 5243. The studies were generally of good methodological quality, using standard designs and mostly standard scales of pain measurement, although many of those treating postoperative pain were small. 
Most studies used paracetamol or ibuprofen, with 100 mg to 130 mg caffeine, and the most common pain conditions studied were postoperative dental pain, postpartum pain, and headache. There was a small but statistically significant benefit with caffeine used at doses of 100 mg or more, which was not dependent on the pain condition or type of analgesic. About 5% to 10% more participants achieve a good level of pain relief (at least 50% of the maximum over four to six hours) with the addition of caffeine, giving a NNT of about 14 (high quality evidence). 
Most comparisons individually demonstrated numerical superiority with caffeine, but not statistical superiority. One serious adverse event was reported with caffeine, but was considered unrelated to any study medication. 
We know of the existence of around 25 additional studies with almost 12,500 participants for which data for analysis were not obtainable. The additional analgesic effect of caffeine remained statistically significant but clinically less important even if all the known missing data had no effect; the bulk of the unobtainable data are reported to have similar results as this review. 
Authors' conclusions
The addition of caffeine (≥ 100 mg) to a standard dose of commonly used analgesics provides a small but important increase in the proportion of participants who experience a good level of pain relief.","Caffeine as an analgesic adjuvant for acute pain in adults
Caffeine is found in various plant products, and may be ingested in drinks like tea, coffee, and some soft drinks and energy drinks. Caffeine is a stimulant, and can improve alertness and prevent tiredness over short periods. It may disturb sleep in some people if taken before bed. Ordinary consumption of caffeine (less than 500 milligrams daily) is not harmful to health. Caffeine is commonly used in pain‐relieving medicines available from pharmacies without a prescription. An adjuvant is something that is added to a medicine to make it work better. 
This review examined whether caffeine improves the pain‐relieving effects of such medicines. We searched for studies up to August 2014 and included twenty studies (7238 participants) examining several pain conditions, including headache, post‐dental pain, postoperative pain following childbirth, and menstrual period pain. The studies were generally of good methodological quality, using standard designs and mostly standard scales of pain measurement. Many of those in post‐dental and postoperative pain were small, and small studies can overestimate benefits. 
A dose of caffeine equivalent to a mug of coffee added to a standard dose of common analgesics such as paracetamol or ibuprofen provided better pain relief. Analgesic plus caffeine increased the number of people who had a good level of pain relief by 5% to 10% compared with analgesic alone (high quality evidence). 
No serious adverse events were reported that were related to either the analgesic or caffeine in these studies (low quality evidence). It is unlikely that adding caffeine to an analgesic will be harmful if the recommended dose is not exceeded.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.

We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), as well as non‐randomised studies (NRSs), that included participants with epithelial ovarian cancer, irrespective of disease stage, who were treated with antigen‐specific active immunotherapy, irrespective of type of vaccine, antigen used, adjuvant used, route of vaccination, treatment schedule, and reported clinical or immunological outcomes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviews authors independently extracted the data. We evaluated the risk of bias for RCTs according to standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane, and for NRSs by using a selection of quality domains deemed best applicable to the NRS. 
Main results
We included 67 studies (representing 3632 women with epithelial ovarian cancer). The most striking observations of this review address the lack of uniformity in conduct and reporting of early‐phase immunotherapy studies. Response definitions show substantial variation between trials, which makes comparison of trial results unreliable. Information on adverse events is frequently limited. Furthermore, reports of both RCTs and NRSs frequently lack the relevant information necessary for risk of bias assessment. Therefore, we cannot rule out serious biases in most of the included trials. However, selection, attrition, and selective reporting biases are likely to have affected the studies included in this review. GRADE ratings were high only for survival; for other primary outcomes, GRADE ratings were very low. 
The largest body of evidence is currently available for CA‐125‐targeted antibody therapy (17 studies, 2347 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Non‐randomised studies of CA‐125‐targeted antibody therapy suggest improved survival among humoral and/or cellular responders, with only moderate adverse events. However, four large randomised placebo‐controlled trials did not show any clinical benefit, despite induction of immune responses in approximately 60% of participants. Time to relapse with CA‐125 monoclonal antibody versus placebo, respectively, ranged from 10.3 to 18.9 months versus 10.3 to 13 months (six RCTs, 1882 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Only one RCT provided data on overall survival, reporting rates of 80% in both treatment and placebo groups (three RCTs, 1062 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Other small studies targeting many different tumour antigens have presented promising immunological results. As these strategies have not yet been tested in RCTs, no reliable inferences about clinical efficacy can be made. Given the promising immunological results and the limited side effects and toxicity reported, exploration of clinical efficacy in large well‐designed RCTs may be worthwhile. 
Authors' conclusions
We conclude that despite promising immunological responses, no clinically effective antigen‐specific active immunotherapy is yet available for ovarian cancer. Results should be interpreted cautiously, as review authors found a significant dearth of relevant information for assessment of risk of bias in both RCTs and NRSs.","Antigen‐specific active immunotherapy for ovarian cancer
Background  Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynaecological cancers. Standard therapy consists of surgery and chemotherapy. Responses to chemotherapy are generally good; however, most women experience relapse, for which no curative treatment is available. The presence of certain immune cells in tumours is associated with longer survival. This suggests that stimulation of anti‐tumour immune responses (i.e. immunotherapy) might be a useful approach for improving outcomes among women with ovarian cancer. 
Review question This review evaluated the feasibility of antigen‐specific active immunotherapy. Antigen‐specific active immunotherapy aims to induce anti‐tumour immune responses through administration of a tumour antigen ‐ a molecule that is expressed by tumour cells and is hardly expressed by healthy cells. Reviewers collected information on clinical outcomes, immunological responses, and side effects. 
Main findings We identified 67 studies, which included 3632 women with ovarian cancer and were published between 1966 and 2017. The most frequently described strategy was administration of antibodies targeting the tumour antigen CA‐125 (2347 participants in 17 studies). Most of these studies primarily evaluated safety and immunological responses. Severe flu‐like and gastrointestinal symptoms occurred in 7% to 30% of participants. Researchers frequently detected antibodies and immune cells recognising the tumour antigen CA‐125, albeit response rates varied between studies. Despite these promising immunological responses, four large studies reported no survival advantage for participants treated with CA‐125‐directed antibody over those given placebo. 
For strategies not relying on antibody administration, similar conclusions cannot yet be drawn. Overall, study authors report that treatment was well tolerated and inflammatory side effects at the injection site were most frequently observed. Researchers observed responses of the immune system for most strategies studied, but the clinical benefit of these strategies remains to be evaluated in large trials. 
Certainty of the evidence and conclusions Because no high‐certainty evidence of clinical benefit is currently available, antibody therapy targeting CA‐125 should not be incorporated into standard treatment in its current form. 
Based on lack of uniformity in included studies, we strongly advocate universal adoption of response definitions, guidelines for adverse events reporting, and directives for trial conduct and reporting. Furthermore, results from ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are awaited, and further RCTs should be conducted.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
174,"Background
Portal hypertension commonly accompanies advanced liver disease and often gives rise to life‐threatening complications, including haemorrhage from oesophageal and gastrointestinal varices. Variceal haemorrhage commonly occurs in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis. Therefore, prevention is important. 
Band ligation, beta‐blockers, and sclerotherapy have been proposed as alternatives for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children. However, primary prophylaxis is not the current standard of care in paediatric patients because it is unknown whether those treatments are of benefit or harm when used for primary prophylaxis in children and adolescents. 
Objectives
To determine the benefits and harms of beta‐blockers compared with placebo or no intervention for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, LILACS, and Science Citation Index Expanded (April 2020). We screened the reference lists of the retrieved publications and manually searched the main paediatric gastroenterology and hepatology conference (NASPGHAN and ESPGHAN) abstract books from 2008 to December 2019. We searched clinicaltrials.gov, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the World Health Organization (WHO) for ongoing clinical trials. We imposed no language or document type restrictions on our search. 
Selection criteria
We planned to include randomised clinical trials, irrespective of blinding, language, or publication status to assess benefits and harms. We included observational studies, retrieved with the searches for randomised clinical trials, for a narrative report of harm. 
Data collection and analysis
We planned to summarise data from randomised clinical trials by standard Cochrane methodologies. We planned to asses risk of bias and use GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. Our primary outcomes were all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events and liver‐related morbidity, and health‐related quality of life. Our secondary outcomes were oesophageal variceal bleeding and adverse events not considered serious. We planned to use intention‐to‐treat principle. We planned to analyse data with RevMan Analysis. 
Main results
We found no randomised clinical trials that assessed beta‐blockers compared with sham or no intervention for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis. We found four observational studies that reported on harms. As a systematic search for observational studies was not planned, we only listed the reported harms in a table. 
Authors' conclusions
Randomised clinical trials assessing the benefits or harms of beta‐blockers versus placebo or no intervention for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis are lacking. Therefore, trials with adequate power and proper design, assessing the benefits and harms of beta‐blockers versus placebo on patient‐relevant clinical outcomes, such as mortality, quality of life, failure to control variceal bleeding, and adverse events are needed. Unless such trials are conducted and the results become published, we cannot make any conclusions regarding the benefits or harms of the two interventions.","Beta‐blockers versus placebo or no intervention for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal varices in children 
Background 
Portal hypertension is defined as an increase in the blood pressure within a system of veins (a type of blood vessel) called the portal venous system. This system drains blood from the gastrointestinal tract (gut) and spleen into the liver. Portal hypertension commonly accompanies advanced liver disease and often gives rise to life‐threatening complications, including haemorrhage (bleeding) from oesophageal (gullet) and gastrointestinal varices (enlarged or swollen veins) in the tube that connects the throat and stomach (the oesophagus) and the digestive tract. Portal vein thrombosis (a vascular disease of the liver) occurs when a blood clot lodges in the hepatic portal vein. Portal vein thrombosis results in portal hypertension leading among others to the formation of varices (e.g. oesophageal or gastric). 
In adults, numerous randomised clinical trials (studies where people are randomly allocated to one of two or more treatment groups) have demonstrated benefits of medicines called non‐selective beta‐blockers in decreasing the risk of first variceal haemorrhage. These preventive interventions have become the established standard in adults. However, it is unknown whether the preventive interventions are of benefit or cause harm when used in children and adolescents. 
AimsWe aimed to assess the benefits and harms of beta‐blockers versus placebo or no intervention for the prevention of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis. We searched for trials until April 2020. 
Key resultsWe found no randomised clinical trials to include in this systematic review. Therefore, we are unable to conclude whether beta‐blockers, when compared to placebo or no intervention, may be beneficial or not for children with oesophageal varices. There is a need for well‐designed and sufficiently large randomised clinical trials that include important clinical outcomes, such as death, quality of life, failure to control bleeding, and adverse events.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.

Commercially available preparations of garlic have been reported to have beneficial effects on some of the risk factors associated with atherosclerosis. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of garlic (both dried and non‐powdered preparations) for the treatment of peripheral arterial occlusive disease. 
Search methods
For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co‐ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched January 2013) and CENTRAL (2012, Issue 12). 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials of garlic therapy in patients with lower limb atherosclerosis were included. The main outcomes were objective measures of progression of underlying atherosclerosis (e.g. ankle pressure measurements, treadmill testing) and subjective measures (e.g. symptom progression). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors (RJ and JK) independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. One author (RJ) contacted investigators to obtain information needed for the review that could not be found in published reports. 
Main results
One eligible trial with 78 participants was found. Both men and women (aged 40 to 75) were included. The follow‐up period was short, 12 weeks only. 
After twelve weeks of treatment, pain‐free walking distance increased from 161 to 207 metres in the group receiving garlic and from 172 to 203 metres in the placebo group. This was not a statistically significant difference. There was no difference in change of systolic or diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, ankle and brachial pressures. No severe side effects were observed and nine patients taking garlic (28%) and four patients taking placebo (12%) complained of a noticeable garlic smell. 
Three trials were excluded from the review because they did not include any clinical measurements. 
Authors' conclusions
One small trial of short duration found no statistically significant effect of garlic on walking distance.","Garlic for peripheral arterial occlusive disease affecting the legs
The most common symptom of peripheral arterial occlusive disease is intermittent claudication, discomfort in the legs that is triggered by exercise and relieved with rest. The underlying cause is atherosclerosis. Risk factors associated with the development of peripheral arterial disease include cigarette smoking, raised blood cholesterol and other fats (lipids), high blood pressure and diabetes. Garlic has been used as a medicinal therapy since ancient times. The main active ingredient is an unstable odorous sulphurous compound called allicin so that active ingredients may be lost in processing, and with different types of preparation. Commercially available preparations of garlic are reported to have beneficial effects on some of the risk factors for vascular disease. With fresh garlic, at least seven cloves of garlic per day are needed. Apart from the odour, garlic has only minor gastrointestinal side effects. 
The review authors made a thorough search of the medical literature and found one controlled trial in which 78 participants with peripheral arterial occlusive disease were randomised to receive garlic or a placebo medication. The dose of garlic was two coated tablets of 200 mg oral standardised garlic powder twice daily. Both men and women, aged 40 to 75 years, were included although sixteen did not keep to their treatment.   After twelve weeks of treatment, pain‐free walking distance increased similarly whether receiving garlic or placebo. Similarly there was no difference in the changes in blood pressure, heart rate and pressure differences between the ankle and brachial pressures. No severe side effects were observed although more people taking garlic (28%) than placebo (12%) complained of a noticeable garlic smell. Peripheral arterial occlusive disease is a long‐term (chronic) condition and any improvements in symptoms would require longer‐term treatment and follow up than in this study.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
176,"Background
Approximately 20% of stroke patients experience clinically significant levels of anxiety at some point after stroke. Physicians can treat these patients with antidepressants or other anxiety‐reducing drugs, or both, or they can provide psychological therapy. This review looks at available evidence for these interventions. This is an update of the review first published in October 2011. 
Objectives
The primary objective was to assess the effectiveness of pharmaceutical, psychological, complementary, or alternative therapeutic interventions in treating stroke patients with anxiety disorders or symptoms. The secondary objective was to identify whether any of these interventions for anxiety had an effect on quality of life, disability, depression, social participation, caregiver burden, or risk of death. 
Search methods
We searched the trials register of the Cochrane Stroke Group (January 2017). We also searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; the Cochrane Library; 2017, Issue 1: searched January 2017); MEDLINE (1966 to January 2017) in Ovid; Embase (1980 to January 2017) in Ovid; the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1937 to January 2017) in EBSCO; and PsycINFO (1800 to January 2017) in Ovid. We conducted backward citation searches of reviews identified through database searches and forward citation searches of included studies. We contacted researchers known to be involved in related trials, and we searched clinical trials registers for ongoing studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised trials including participants with a diagnosis of both stroke and anxiety for which treatment was intended to reduce anxiety. Two review authors independently screened and selected titles and abstracts for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We performed a narrative review. We planned to do a meta‐analysis but were unable to do so as included studies were not sufficiently comparable. 
Main results
We included three trials (four interventions) involving 196 participants with stroke and co‐morbid anxiety. One trial (described as a 'pilot study') randomised 21 community‐dwelling stroke survivors to four‐week use of a relaxation CD or to wait list control. This trial assessed anxiety using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and reported a reduction in anxiety at three months among participants who had used the relaxation CD (mean (standard deviation (SD) 6.9 (± 4.9) and 11.0 (± 3.9)), Cohen's d = 0.926, P value = 0.001; 19 participants analysed). 
The second trial randomised 81 participants with co‐morbid anxiety and depression to paroxetine, paroxetine plus psychotherapy, or standard care. Mean levels of anxiety severity scores based on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM‐A) at follow‐up were 5.4 (SD ± 1.7), 3.8 (SD ± 1.8), and 12.8 (SD ± 1.9), respectively (P value < 0.01). 
The third trial randomised 94 stroke patients, also with co‐morbid anxiety and depression, to receive buspirone hydrochloride or standard care. At follow‐up, the mean levels of anxiety based on the HAM‐A were 6.5 (SD ± 3.1) and 12.6 (SD ± 3.4) in the two groups, respectively, which represents a significant difference (P value < 0.01). Half of the participants receiving paroxetine experienced adverse events that included nausea, vomiting, or dizziness; however, only 14% of those receiving buspirone experienced nausea or palpitations. Trial authors provided no information about the duration of symptoms associated with adverse events. The trial of relaxation therapy reported no adverse events. 
The quality of the evidence was very low. Each study included a small number of participants, particularly the study of relaxation therapy. Studies of pharmacological agents presented details too limited to allow judgement of selection, performance, and detection bias and lack of placebo treatment in control groups. Although the study of relaxation therapy had allocated participants to treatment using an adequate method of randomisation, study recruitment methods might have introduced bias, and drop‐outs in the intervention group may have influenced results. 
Authors' conclusions
Evidence is insufficient to guide the treatment of anxiety after stroke. Further well‐conducted randomised controlled trials (using placebo or attention controls) are required to assess pharmacological agents and psychological therapies.","Interventions for treating anxiety after stroke
Review question 
To determine whether any treatments might reduce the symptoms of anxiety, and subsequently improve quality of life, for people who have had a stroke. 
Background 
Anxiety after stroke occurs frequently and can be treated with antidepressants or other anxiety‐reducing drugs, or both, or with psychological therapy. 
Study characteristics 
Evidence is current to January 2017. We found three studies with 196 stroke survivors who had received a diagnosis of anxiety. One study assessed the effect of a relaxation CD used five times a week for one month for participants with a diagnosis of anxiety. Two studies assessed the use of antidepressants in participants who had both anxiety and depression. 
Key results 
One study found that participants were less anxious three months after using a relaxation CD when compared with those who were given no therapy. One study reported that participants were less anxious when treated with an antidepressant medicine (paroxetine), or with paroxetine and psychotherapy, than with standard care. This study reported that half of the participants receiving paroxetine experienced side effects that included nausea, vomiting, or dizziness. The third study also reported that participants were less anxious when treated with an antidepressant (buspirone hydrochloride) than with standard care, and only 14% of those receiving buspirone hydrocholoride reported nausea or palpitations. 
Quality of the evidence 
We judged that the quality of this evidence was very low. Studies were few and each included a small number of participants. Studies assessing antidepressants did not include comparison with a placebo drug, and information in both study reports was insufficient to permit assessment of whether other biases had been introduced. The study of relaxation therapy was very small, with loss of two participants who used the CD, and the study recruitment process may have attracted participants who had a positive bias towards psychological therapies. 
Conclusion 
Current evidence is insufficient to guide the treatment of anxiety after stroke. Additional well‐conducted randomised trials are needed.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
177,"Background
Pyrethroid long‐lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) have been important in the large reductions in malaria cases in Africa, but insecticide resistance in Anopheles mosquitoes threatens their impact. Insecticide synergists may help control insecticide‐resistant populations. Piperonyl butoxide (PBO) is such a synergist; it has been incorporated into pyrethroid‐LLINs to form pyrethroid‐PBO nets, which are currently produced by five LLIN manufacturers and, following a recommendation from the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2017, are being included in distribution campaigns. This review examines epidemiological and entomological evidence on the addition of PBO to pyrethroid nets on their efficacy. 
Objectives
To compare effects of pyrethroid‐PBO nets currently in commercial development or on the market with effects of their non‐PBO equivalent in relation to: 
1. malaria parasite infection (prevalence or incidence); and2. entomological outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group (CIDG) Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CAB Abstracts, and two clinical trial registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) up to 25 September 2020. We contacted organizations for unpublished data. We checked the reference lists of trials identified by these methods. 
Selection criteria
We included experimental hut trials, village trials, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with mosquitoes from the Anopheles gambiae complex or the Anopheles funestus group. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors assessed each trial for eligibility, extracted data, and determined the risk of bias for included trials. We resolved disagreements through discussion with a third review author. We analysed data using Review Manager 5 and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
Sixteen trials met the inclusion criteria: 10 experimental hut trials, four village trials, and two cluster‐RCTs (cRCTs). Three trials are awaiting classification, and four trials are ongoing.  
Two cRCTs examined the effects of pyrethroid‐PBO nets on parasite prevalence in people living in areas with highly pyrethroid‐resistant mosquitoes (< 30% mosquito mortality in discriminating dose assays). At 21 to 25 months post intervention, parasite prevalence was lower in the intervention arm (odds ratio (OR) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 0.95; 2 trials, 2 comparisons; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
In highly pyrethroid‐resistant areas, unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets led to higher mosquito mortality compared to unwashed standard‐LLINs (risk ratio (RR) 1.84, 95% CI 1.60 to 2.11; 14,620 mosquitoes, 5 trials, 9 comparisons; high‐certainty evidence) and lower blood feeding success (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.71; 14,000 mosquitoes, 4 trials, 8 comparisons; high‐certainty evidence). However, in comparisons of washed pyrethroid‐PBO nets to washed LLINs, we do not know if PBO nets had a greater effect on mosquito mortality (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.63; 10,268 mosquitoes, 4 trials, 5 comparisons; very low‐certainty evidence), although the washed pyrethroid‐PBO nets did decrease blood‐feeding success compared to standard‐LLINs (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.92; 9674 mosquitoes, 3 trials, 4 comparisons; high‐certainty evidence). 
In areas where pyrethroid resistance is moderate (31% to 60% mosquito mortality), mosquito mortality was higher with unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to unwashed standard‐LLINs (RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.11; 1007 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; moderate‐certainty evidence), but there was little to no difference in effects on blood‐feeding success (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.11; 1006 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; moderate‐certainty evidence). For washed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to washed standard‐LLINs, we found little to no evidence for higher mosquito mortality or reduced blood feeding (mortality: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.54; 329 mosquitoes, 1 trial, 1 comparison, low‐certainty evidence; blood feeding success: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.13; 329 mosquitoes, 1 trial, 1 comparison; low‐certainty evidence). 
In areas where pyrethroid resistance is low (61% to 90% mosquito mortality), studies reported little to no difference in the effects of unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to unwashed standard‐LLINs on mosquito mortality (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.57; 1580 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; moderate‐certainty evidence), and we do not know if there was any effect on blood‐feeding success (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.11; 1580 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; very low‐certainty evidence). For washed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to washed standard‐LLINs, we do not know if there was any difference in mosquito mortality (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.04; 1774 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; very low‐certainty evidence) or on blood feeding (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.33; 1774 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; low‐certainty evidence). 
In areas where mosquito populations are susceptible to insecticides (> 90% mosquito mortality), there may be little to no difference in the effects of unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to unwashed standard‐LLINs on mosquito mortality (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.26; 2791 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 2 comparisons; low‐certainty evidence). This is similar for washed nets (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.25; 2644 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 2 comparisons; low‐certainty evidence). We do not know if unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets had any effect on the blood‐feeding success of susceptible mosquitoes (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.12 to 2.22; 2791 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 2 comparisons; very low‐certainty evidence). The same applies to washed nets (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.91; 2644 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 2 comparisons; low‐certainty evidence). 
In village trials comparing pyrethroid‐PBO nets to LLINs, there was no difference in sporozoite rate (4 trials, 5 comparisons) nor in mosquito parity (3 trials, 4 comparisons). 
Authors' conclusions
In areas of high insecticide resistance, pyrethroid‐PBO nets have greater entomological and epidemiological efficacy compared to standard LLINs, with sustained reduction in parasite prevalence, higher mosquito mortality and reduction in mosquito blood feeding rates 21 to 25 months post intervention. Questions remain about the durability of PBO on nets, as the impact of pyrethroid‐PBO nets on mosquito mortality was not sustained over 20 washes in experimental hut trials, and epidemiological data on pyrethroid‐PBO nets for the full intended three‐year life span of the nets is not available. Little evidence is available to support greater entomological efficacy of pyrethroid‐PBO nets in areas where mosquitoes show lower levels of resistance to pyrethroids.","Pyrethroid‐PBO nets to prevent malaria
Background 
Bed nets treated with pyrethroid insecticides are an effective way to reduce malaria transmission and have been deployed across Africa. However, mosquitoes that spread malaria are now developing resistance to this type of insecticide. One way to overcome this resistance is to add another chemical ‐ piperonyl butoxide (PBO) ‐ to the net. PBO is not an insecticide, but it blocks the substance (an enzyme) inside the mosquito that stops pyrethroids from working. 
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if pyrethroid‐PBO nets provide additional protection against malaria when compared to standard pyrethroid‐only nets. 
Key messages 
Pyrethroid‐PBO nets were more effective than standard pyrethroid‐only nets in killing mosquitoes and preventing blood feeding in areas where mosquito populations are very resistant to pyrethroid insecticides (high‐certainty evidence). Pyrethroid‐PBO nets reduced the number of malaria infections in areas of high pyrethroid resistance (moderate‐certainty evidence), although further studies are needed to measure clinical outcomes for the full lifetime of the net. 
What was studied in the review? 
We included 16 trials conducted between 2010 and 2020 that compared standard pyrethroid nets to pyrethroid‐PBO nets. These consisted of 10 experimental hut trials that measured the impact of pyrethroid‐PBO nets on a wild population of mosquitoes, four village trials, and two cRCTs. The two cRCTs measured the impact of pyrethroid‐PBO nets on malaria infection in humans; all other studies recorded their impact on mosquito populations. We analysed hut and village studies to determine whether pyrethroid‐PBO nets were better for killing mosquitoes and preventing them from blood feeding. For both cRCT trials, we examined whether pyrethroid‐PBO nets reduced the number of malaria infections. As the benefit of adding PBO to nets is likely to depend on the level of pyrethroid resistance in the mosquito population, we performed separate analyses for studies conducted in areas of high, medium, and low levels of pyrethroid resistance. 
What are the main results of the review? 
When mosquitoes show high levels of resistance to pyrethroids, pyrethroid‐PBO nets perform better than standard pyrethroid‐only nets for killing mosquitoes and preventing them from blood feeding. As expected, this effect is not seen in areas where mosquitoes show low or no resistance to pyrethroid‐only insecticides. Two trials looked at the impact of using pyrethroid‐PBO nets on the number of people infected with the malaria parasite. These trials, involving 10,603 participants in total and conducted in an area where mosquitoes are very resistant to pyrethroids, found that fewer people were infected with malaria when the population used pyrethroid‐PBO nets than when standard pyrethroid‐only nets were used.

178,"Background
Corticosteroids are commonly used for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease. However, traditional corticosteroids can cause significant adverse events. Budesonide is an alternative glucocorticoid with limited systemic bioavailability. 
Objectives
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral budesonide for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease. 
Search methods
The following electronic databases were searched up to June 2014: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane IBD/FBD Group Specialised Trial Register, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Reference lists of articles, as well as conference proceedings were manually searched. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing budesonide to a placebo or active comparator were considered for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
Two independent investigators reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted the data and assessed study quality. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool The overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE criteria. Meta‐analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3.5 software. The primary outcome was induction of remission (defined by a Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) < 150) by week 8 to 16 of treatment. Secondary outcomes included: time to remission, mean change in CDAI, clinical, histological or endoscopic improvement, improvement in quality of life, adverse events and early withdrawal. We calculated the relative risk (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each dichotomous outcome and the mean difference and corresponding 95% CI for each continuous outcome. Data were analyzed on an intention‐to‐treat basis. A random‐effects model was used for the pooled analyses. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary outcomes and selected secondary outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE criteria. 
Main results
Fourteen studies (1805 patients) were included: Nine (779 patients) compared budesonide to conventional corticosteroids, three (535 patients) were placebo‐controlled, and two (491 patients) compared budesonide to mesalamine. Ten studies were judged to be at low risk of bias. Three studies were judged to be at high risk of bias due to open label design. One study was judged to be at high risk of bias due to selective reporting. After eight weeks of treatment, 9 mg budesonide was significantly more effective than placebo for induction of clinical remission. Forty‐seven per cent (115/246) of budesonide patients achieved remission at 8 weeks compared to 22% (29/133) of placebo patients (RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.73; 3 studies, 379 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was moderate due to sparse data (144 events). Budesonide was significantly less effective than conventional steroids for induction of remission at eight weeks. Fifty‐two per cent of budesonide patients achieved remission at week 8 compared to 61% of patients who received conventional steroids (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.97; 8 studies, 750 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was moderate due to risk of bias. Budesonide was significantly less effective than conventional steroids among patients with severe disease (CDAI > 300) (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.95). Studies comparing budesonide to mesalamine were not pooled due to heterogeneity (I2 = 81%). One study (n = 182) found budesonide to be superior to mesalamine for induction of remission at 8 weeks. Sixty‐eight per cent (63/93) of budesonide patients were in remission at 8 weeks compared to 42% (37/89) of mesalamine patients (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.16). The other study found no statistically significant difference in remission rates at eight weeks. Sixty‐nine per cent (107/154) of budesonide patients were in remission at 8 weeks compared to 62% (132/242) of mesalamine patients (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.32). Fewer adverse events occurred in those treated with budesonide compared to conventional steroids (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.76) and budesonide was better than conventional steroids in preserving adrenal function (RR for abnormal ACTH test 0.65, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.78). 
Authors' conclusions
Budesonide is more effective than placebo for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. Although short‐term efficacy with budesonide is less than with conventional steroids, particularly in those with severe disease or more extensive colonic involvement, the likelihood of adverse events and adrenal suppression with budesonide is lower. The current evidence does not allow for a firm conclusion on the relative efficacy of budesonide compared to 5‐ASA products.","Budesonide for treatment of people with active Crohn's disease.
What is Crohn's disease?  Crohn's disease is a debilitating long‐term (chronic) inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus. Symptoms include abdominal pain, non‐bloody diarrhea and weight loss. The most common initial treatment of the Crohn's disease is oral steroid therapy. Unfortunately, traditional steroids are usually absorbed into the body and cause significant unwanted side effects. These may include but are not limited to weight gain, diabetes, growth retardation, acne, mood instability, and high blood pressure. When people with Crohn's disease are experiencing symptoms of the disease it is said to be ‘active’; periods when the symptoms stop are called ‘remission’. 
What is budesonide?  Budesonide is a steroid that is quickly metabolized by the liver thereby reducing corticosteroid‐related side effects. 
What did the researchers investigate?  The researchers investigated whether budesonide produces remission in people with active Crohn's disease; and whether these medications cause any harms (side effects). The researchers searched the medical literature up to June 12, 2014. 
What did the researchers find?  The researchers identified 14 studies that included a total of 1805 participants. Nine studies (779 participants) compared budesonide to conventional corticosteroids, three studies (535 participants) compared budesonide to a placebo (e.g. a sugar pill), and two studies (491 participants) compared budesonide to mesalamine (an anti‐inflammatory drug composed of 5‐aminosalicylic acid). Ten studies were judged to be of high quality. Four studies were judged to be of low quality. 
Budesonide was superior to placebo for induction of remission. An increase in side effects was not seen with budesonide compared to placebo. Withdrawals due to disease worsening were similar in budesonide and placebo groups. Budesonide patients were more likely than placebo patients to experience adrenal suppression a condition in which the adrenal glands do not produce adequate amounts of steroid hormones. 
Budesonide was significantly less effective than conventional steroids for induction of remission in people with Crohn's disease. However, fewer side effects occurred in those treated with budesonide compared to conventional steroids and budesonide was better than conventional steroids in preserving adrenal function. 
One study (n = 182) found budesonide to be superior to mesalamine for induction of remission in patients with Crohn's disease whereas another study found no difference in remission rates. 
The current evidence does not allow for a firm conclusion on the relative efficacy of budesonide compared to 5‐aminosalicylic products. Budesonide is more effective than placebo for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. Although budesonide is less effective than conventional steroids for induction of remission the likelihood of side effects and adrenal suppression is lower than with conventional steroids.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
179,"Background
Endometrial cancer is one of the most common gynaecological cancers in developed countries. Treatment of advanced endometrial cancer usually involves radiotherapy, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy or a combination of these. However, survival outcomes are poor in advanced or metastatic disease. Better systemic treatment options are needed to improve survival and safety outcomes for these women. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is a frequently altered signalling pathway in endometrial cancer. Single‐arm studies have reported some encouraging results of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibition in advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitor‐containing regimens in women with locally‐advanced, metastatic or recurrent endometrial cancer. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE and Embase to 16 January 2019; and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov in July 2018. We also reviewed reference lists from included studies and endometrial cancer guidelines. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing a regimen with a PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitor (either alone or in combination with other treatments, such as chemotherapy or hormonal therapy) versus a comparator regimen without a PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitor. There were no restrictions on which comparator(s) were included. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data independently, and assessed risks of bias and the certainty of the evidence. The primary outcome measures were progression‐free survival and toxicity (grade 3/4 where available). We derived hazard ratios (HRs) for time‐to‐event outcomes and risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes. Secondary outcomes included overall survival, objective tumour response rate, quality of life and treatment‐related death. We used GRADEproGDT to assess the certainty of the evidence for the most important outcomes (by first‐line and second/third‐line therapy for progression‐free survival and overall survival). 
Main results
We included two RCTs involving 361 women. One study assessed the effects of the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus, in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel versus carboplatin/paclitaxel and bevacizumab in treatment‐naïve women with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. The second study compared the mTOR inhibitor ridaforolimus alone versus progestin or investigator choice of chemotherapy in women who had received prior treatment for metastatic or recurrent endometrial cancer. We identified five ongoing studies on the effects of PI3K and AKT inhibitors, metformin and dual mTOR inhibitors. 
For first‐line therapy, an mTOR inhibitor‐containing regimen may worsen progression‐free survival (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.93; 1 study, 231 participants; low‐certainty evidence), while for second/third‐line therapy, an mTOR inhibitor probably improves progression‐free survival compared to chemotherapy or endocrine therapy (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.91; 1 study, 95 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Data on toxicity were available from both studies: administering an mTOR inhibitor regimen may increase the risk of grade 3/4 mucositis (RR 10.42, 95% CI 1.34 to 80.74; 2 studies, 357 participants; low‐certainty evidence), but may result in little to no difference in risk of anaemia or interstitial pneumonitis (low‐certainty evidence for both toxicities). Overall, event rates were low. For first‐line therapy, an mTOR inhibitor‐containing regimen may result in little to no difference in overall survival compared to chemotherapy (HR 1.32, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.781 study, 231 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The finding was similar for second/third‐line therapy (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.61; 1 study, 130 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Administering mTOR inhibitor‐containing regimens may result in little to no difference in tumour response compared to chemotherapy or hormonal therapy in first‐line or second/third‐line therapy (first line: RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.17; 1 study, 231 participants; second/third line: RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.40; 1 study, 61 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
Neither study collected or reported quality‐of‐life data.
Authors' conclusions
Two RCTs have been reported to date, with low certainty of evidence. In a recurrent disease setting, mTOR inhibitors may result in improved progression‐free survival, but we found no clear benefit in overall survival or tumour response rate. We await the publication of at least five ongoing studies investigating the role of PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors in advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer before any conclusions can be drawn on their use.","Drugs targeting PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway for locally‐advanced, metastatic or recurrent endometrial cancer 
What is the aim of this review? To find out whether drugs that inhibit the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (known as PI3K, AKT and mTOR inhibitors) can improve survival of women diagnosed with locally‐advanced (cancer that has spread beyond the uterus/womb), metastatic or recurrent endometrial cancer. 
Key messages There is a low certainty of evidence from two clinical trials about the use of drugs targeting PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in women with locally‐advanced, metastatic or recurrent endometrial cancer. Based on the small number of completed studies, women who have received prior treatment for advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer and received an mTOR inhibitor may have a lower risk of their cancer progressing compared to those who received chemotherapy/hormonal therapy alone. However, in women who received mTOR inhibitor‐containing chemotherapy as part of their treatment when first diagnosed with advanced disease, mTOR inhibitor‐containing treatment may result in their disease progressing more quickly and probably with increased complications compared to chemotherapy or hormonal therapy alone. Although mTOR inhibitors may change how long it takes for their cancer to progress, there may be little or no difference in how long women lived after treatment (known as overall survival). We await the publication of at least five studies examining the role of PI3K, AKT and mTOR inhibitors in advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. 
What was studied in the review? Treatment for women with metastatic or recurrent endometrial cancer usually involves radiotherapy, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy or a combination of these to try to shrink or slow the growth of the cancer. The response of the cancer to these treatments is variable, but mostly modest. New treatments are needed to improve outcomes. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway within an endometrial cancer cell is involved in the growth of endometrial cancer, and various drugs have been developed to target this pathway with the aim of reducing the growth of endometrial cancer cells. These are known as PI3K, AKT and mTOR inhibitors. We found relevant studies looking at mTOR inhibitors. mTOR inhibitors can be given alone or in combination with other cancer treatment drugs. They may be given along with chemotherapy or endocrine therapy. mTOR inhibitors act by blocking cancer cells from dividing and reproducing. Their adverse events can include ulcers along the digestive tract (known as mucositis), inflammation of lung tissues (known as pneumonitis) and low red blood cell counts (anaemia). 
We include two studies that randomised 361 women. In one study, women received either an mTOR inhibitor (temsirolimus) in combination with other chemotherapy drugs, or the same chemotherapy drugs without the mTOR inhibitor and with a different targeted therapy (bevacizumab). This was given as part of their 'first‐line' treatment after their initial diagnosis of advanced endometrial cancer. In the second study, women with recurrent disease or who had been treated with chemotherapy at least once before received an mTOR inhibitor (ridaforolimus) on its own, compared with a chemotherapy or hormonal therapy and no mTOR inhibitor. 
What are the main results of the review? For women who received mTOR inhibitor drugs as part of their first treatment, there may be a higher risk of disease worsening with an mTOR inhibitor than with conventional treatment and bevacizumab. However, for women with recurrent disease who had received chemotherapy previously, receiving an mTOR inhibitor drug may reduce the risk of the disease worsening compared to further chemotherapy or hormonal treatments. These results are based on one study only in each treatment setting. 
There were side effects from mTOR inhibitors. Women may be more likely to experience ulcers within the digestive tract with mTOR inhibitors than women who received treatments without these drugs. There was probably little or no difference in the rates of inflammation of the lungs or anaemia between those who received mTOR inhibitors and those who did not, although we have only low certainty evidence about the result. None of the studies reported quality‐of‐life information. 
There are five clinical trials currently recruiting women. We hope to have a clearer answer in the next update of this review, once data from these studies are available.

180,"Background
Foot ulcers in people with diabetes are non‐healing, or poorly healing, partial, or full‐thickness wounds below the ankle. These ulcers are common, expensive to manage and cause significant morbidity and mortality. The presence of a wound has an impact on nutritional status because of the metabolic cost of repairing tissue damage, in addition to the nutrient losses via wound fluid. Nutritional interventions may improve wound healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effects of nutritional interventions on the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. 
Search methods
In March 2020 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effect of nutritional interventions on the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors, working independently, assessed included RCTs for their risk of bias and rated the certainty of evidence using GRADE methodology, using pre‐determined inclusion and quality criteria. 
Main results
We identified nine RCTs (629 participants). Studies explored oral nutritional interventions as follows: a protein (20 g protein per 200 mL bottle), 1 kcal/mL ready‐to‐drink, nutritional supplement with added vitamins, minerals and trace elements; arginine, glutamine and β‐hydroxy‐β‐methylbutyrate supplement; 220 mg zinc sulphate supplements; 250 mg magnesium oxide supplements; 1000 mg/day omega‐3 fatty acid from flaxseed oil; 150,000 IU of vitamin D, versus 300,000 IU of vitamin D; 250 mg magnesium oxide plus 400 IU vitamin E and 50,000 IU vitamin D supplements. The comparator in eight studies was placebo, and in one study a different dose of vitamin D. 
Eight studies reported the primary outcome measure of ulcer healing; only two studies reported a measure of complete healing. Six further studies reported measures of change in ulcer dimension, these studies reported only individual parameters of ulcer dimensions (i.e. length, width and depth) and not change in ulcer volume. 
All of the evidence identified was very low certainty. We downgraded it for risks of bias, indirectness and imprecision. 
It is uncertain whether oral nutritional supplement with 20 g protein per 200 mL bottle, 1 kcal/mL, nutritional supplement with added vitamins, minerals and trace elements, increases the proportion of ulcers healed at six months more than placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 1.53). It is also uncertain whether arginine, glutamine and β‐hydroxy‐β‐methylbutyrate supplement increases the proportion of ulcers healed at 16 weeks compared with placebo (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.40). 
It is uncertain whether the following interventions change parameters of ulcer dimensions over time when compared with placebo; 220 mg zinc sulphate supplement containing 50 mg elemental zinc, 250 mg magnesium oxide supplement, 1000 mg/day omega‐3 fatty acid from flaxseed oil supplement, magnesium and vitamin E co‐supplementation and vitamin D supplementation. It is also uncertain whether 150,000 IU of vitamin D, impacts ulcer dimensions when compared with 300,000 IU of vitamin D. 
Two studies explored some of the secondary outcomes of interest for this review. It is uncertain whether oral nutritional supplement with 20 g protein per 200 mL bottle, 1 kcal/mL, nutritional supplement with added vitamins, minerals and trace elements, reduces the number of deaths (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.06 to 14.60) or amputations (RR 4.82, 95% CI 0.24 to 95.88) more than placebo. It is uncertain whether arginine, glutamine and β‐hydroxy‐β‐methylbutyrate supplement increases health‐related quality of life at 16 weeks more than placebo (MD −0.03, 95% CI −0.09 to 0.03). It is also uncertain whether arginine, glutamine and β‐hydroxy‐β‐methylbutyrate supplement reduces the numbers of new ulcers (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.51), or amputations (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.69) more than placebo. 
None of the included studies reported the secondary outcomes cost of intervention, acceptability of the intervention (or satisfaction) with respect to patient comfort, length of patient hospital stay, surgical interventions, or osteomyelitis incidence. 
One study exploring the impact of arginine, glutamine and β‐hydroxy‐β‐methylbutyrate supplement versus placebo did not report on any relevant outcomes. 
Authors' conclusions
Evidence for the impact of nutritional interventions on the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes compared with no nutritional supplementation, or compared with a different dose of nutritional supplementation, remains uncertain, with eight studies showing no clear benefit or harm. It is also uncertain whether there is a difference in rates of adverse events, amputation rate, development of new foot ulcers, or quality of life, between nutritional interventions and placebo. More research is needed to clarify the impact of nutritional interventions on the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes.","Dietary supplements for treating foot ulcers in people with diabetes
What is the aim of this review? 
We wanted to find out whether nutritional supplements or special diets are effective in treating foot ulcers in people with diabetes. Researchers from Cochrane collected and analysed all relevant studies (randomised controlled trials (RCTs)) to answer this question and found nine studies for inclusion. RCTs are medical studies where the treatment or care people receive is are chosen at random. This type of trial provides the most reliable health evidence about whether different approaches to treatment or care make a difference. 
Key messages 
Of the nine studies that we identified, eight reported the outcomes we were interested in, primarily impact on ulcer healing. Findings from five studies showed very low‐certainty evidence regarding the effect of oral nutritional supplements in tablet form on the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. These five studies did not measure healing in such a way that we could be certain of the results, and they did not have enough participants for us to be certain of the effects. The results of three other studies also showed very low‐certainty evidence as to whether nutritional supplements in other forms have any impact on ulcer healing. Two of these studies showed very low‐certainty evidence as to whether nutritional supplement drinks have any impact on other outcomes such as death, likelihood of amputation, reduction in numbers of new ulcers, or people's quality of life. These studies were not well conducted and did not have enough participants involved for us to be certain of the effects. 
What was studied in the review? 
People with diabetes can develop foot ulcers. These are often due to reduced blood supply, reduced sensation, foot deformity, the presence of trauma, or a combination of all or some of these causes. Foot ulcers are a serious complication of diabetes and can result in serious consequences such as amputation. 
It is thought that foot ulcers, like other wounds, heal better, and more quickly, if people are well‐nourished. Food supplements containing certain vitamins and protein can be given to people with foot ulcers and diabetes to help to treat their wounds. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We found nine relevant studies dating from 2004 to 2019, involving 629 participants, 72% were men, aged, on average, 59.2 years. Most studies took place in hospital outpatient clinics. Three studies explored a different nutritional supplement drink and compared this with a drink that looked the same but did not have any added nutritional supplement. Five studies explored the effects of different types of nutritional tablets and compared these with tablets that did not contain any active ingredient, or nutritional supplement. One study compared two different doses of a vitamin D injection. One study did not report any of the outcomes of interest for this review. 
Two of the studies were sponsored by the manufacturers of the nutritional supplement, five studies were sponsored by Iranian university research funding. 
Findings from eight studies are unclear as to whether nutritional interventions improve the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes compared with no nutritional supplementation, or compared with a different dose of nutritional supplementation. One study reported adverse events and two studies reported numbers of amputations. Results are unclear as to whether there is a difference in the numbers of amputations or deaths between nutritional supplementation and no nutritional supplementation. It is also unclear if there is a difference in health‐related quality of life or number of ulcers that recur between nutritional supplementation and no nutritional supplementation. 
Overall, we judged the certainty of the evidence to be very low. None of the studies had enough participants, five did not measure outcomes in such a way that we could be certain of the results and the studies were not well conducted, so we are not very confident in the results. Additional studies at low risk of bias and of high‐certainty evidence are needed to clarify the role of nutritional interventions for the treatment of foot ulcers in people with diabetes.

181,"Background
Peripheral joint osteoarthritis is a major cause of pain and functional limitation. Few treatments are safe and effective. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of acupuncture for treating peripheral joint osteoarthritis.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 1), MEDLINE, and EMBASE (both through December 2007), and scanned reference lists of articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing needle acupuncture with a sham, another active treatment, or a waiting list control group in people with osteoarthritis of the knee, hip, or hand. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We calculated standardized mean differences using the differences in improvements between groups. 
Main results
Sixteen trials involving 3498 people were included. Twelve of the RCTs included only people with OA of the knee, 3 only OA of the hip, and 1 a mix of people with OA of the hip and/or knee. In comparison with a sham control, acupuncture showed statistically significant, short‐term improvements in osteoarthritis pain (standardized mean difference ‐0.28, 95% confidence interval ‐0.45 to ‐0.11; 0.9 point greater improvement than sham on 20 point scale; absolute percent change 4.59%; relative percent change 10.32%; 9 trials; 1835 participants) and function (‐0.28, ‐0.46 to ‐0.09; 2.7 point greater improvement on 68 point scale; absolute percent change 3.97%; relative percent change 8.63%); however, these pooled short‐term benefits did not meet our predefined thresholds for clinical relevance (i.e. 1.3 points for pain; 3.57 points for function) and there was substantial statistical heterogeneity. Additionally, restriction to sham‐controlled trials using shams judged most likely to adequately blind participants to treatment assignment (which were also the same shams judged most likely to have physiological activity), reduced heterogeneity and resulted in pooled short‐term benefits of acupuncture that were smaller and non‐significant. In comparison with sham acupuncture at the six‐month follow‐up, acupuncture showed borderline statistically significant, clinically irrelevant improvements in osteoarthritis pain (‐0.10, ‐0.21 to 0.01; 0.4 point greater improvement than sham on 20 point scale; absolute percent change 1.81%; relative percent change 4.06%; 4 trials;1399 participants) and function (‐0.11, ‐0.22 to 0.00; 1.2 point greater improvement than sham on 68 point scale; absolute percent change 1.79%; relative percent change 3.89%). In a secondary analysis versus a waiting list control, acupuncture was associated with statistically significant, clinically relevant short‐term improvements in osteoarthritis pain (‐0.96, ‐1.19 to ‐0.72; 14.5 point greater improvement than sham on 100 point scale; absolute percent change 14.5%; relative percent change 29.14%; 4 trials; 884 participants) and function (‐0.89, ‐1.18 to ‐0.60; 13.0 point greater improvement than sham on 100 point scale; absolute percent change 13.0%; relative percent change 25.21%). In the head‐on comparisons of acupuncture with the 'supervised osteoarthritis education' and the 'physician consultation' control groups, acupuncture was associated with clinically relevant short‐ and long‐term improvements in pain and function. In the head on comparisons of acupuncture with 'home exercises/advice leaflet' and 'supervised exercise', acupuncture was associated with similar treatment effects as the controls. Acupuncture as an adjuvant to an exercise based physiotherapy program did not result in any greater improvements than the exercise program alone. Information on safety was reported in only 8 trials and even in these trials there was limited reporting and heterogeneous methods. 
Authors' conclusions
Sham‐controlled trials show statistically significant benefits; however, these benefits are small, do not meet our pre‐defined thresholds for clinical relevance, and are probably due at least partially to placebo effects from incomplete blinding. Waiting list‐controlled trials of acupuncture for peripheral joint osteoarthritis suggest statistically significant and clinically relevant benefits, much of which may be due to expectation or placebo effects.","Acupuncture for osteoarthritis
This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of acupuncture on osteoarthritis. 
The review shows that in people with osteoarthritis, 
‐Acupuncture may lead to small improvements in pain and physical function after 8 weeks. 
‐Acupuncture may lead to small improvements in pain and physical function after 26 weeks. 
We often do not have precise information about side effects and complications. This is particularly true for rare but serious side effects. Possible side effects of acupuncture treatment include minor bruising and bleeding at the site of needle insertion. 
What is osteoarthritis and what is acupuncture? 
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease of the joints, such as your knee or hip. When the joint loses cartilage, the bone grows to try and repair the damage. Instead of making things better, however, the bone grows abnormally and makes things worse. For example, the bone can become misshapen and make the joint painful and unstable. This can affect your physical function or ability to use your knee. 
According to the philosophy of traditional acupuncture, energy circulates in 'meridians' located throughout the body.  Pain or ill health happens when something occurs to cause this meridian energy circulation to be blocked. The way to restore health is to stimulate the appropriate combination of acupuncture points in the body by inserting very thin needles.  Sometimes in painful conditions, electrical stimulation along with the needles is also used.  According to acupuncture theory, one way you can tell that acupuncture is relieving pain is that you may feel numbness or tingling, called de qi, where the needle is inserted. 
Best estimate of what happens to people with osteoarthritis who have acupuncture: 
Pain after 8 weeks: 
‐People who had acupuncture rated their pain to be improved by about 4 points on a scale of 0 to 20.  ‐People who received sham acupuncture rated their pain to be improved by about 3 points on a scale of 0 to 20. 
‐People who received acupuncture had a 1 point greater improvement on a scale of 0‐20.  (5% absolute improvement). 
Pain after 26 weeks: 
‐People who had acupuncture rated their pain to be improved by slightly more than 3 points on a scale of 0 to 20.  ‐People who received sham acupuncture rated their pain to be improved by slightly less than 3 points on a scale of 0 to 20. 
‐People who received acupuncture had under a 1 point greater improvement on a scale of 0‐20.  (2% absolute improvement).  
Physical function after 8 weeks : 
‐People who had acupuncture rated their function to be improved by about 11 points on a scale of 0 to 68.  ‐People who received sham acupuncture rated their function to be improved by about 8 points on a scale of 0 to 68. 
‐People who received acupuncture had about a 3 point greater improvement on a scale of 0‐68.  (4% absolute improvement)  
Physical function after 26 weeks : 
‐People who had acupuncture rated their function to be improved by about 11 points on a scale of 0 to 68.  ‐People who received sham acupuncture rated their function to be improved by about 10 points on a scale of 0 to 68.

182,"Background
Concerns regarding the safety of transfused blood have prompted reconsideration of the use of allogeneic (from an unrelated donor) red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, and a range of techniques to minimise transfusion requirements. 
Objectives
To examine the evidence for the efficacy of cell salvage in reducing allogeneic blood transfusion and the evidence for any effect on clinical outcomes. 
Search methods
We identified studies by searching CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1950 to June 2009), EMBASE (1980 to June 2009), the internet (to August 2009) and bibliographies of published articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials with a concurrent control group in which adult patients, scheduled for non‐urgent surgery, were randomised to cell salvage (autotransfusion) or to a control group who did not receive the intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
Data were independently extracted and the risk of bias assessed. Relative risks (RR) and weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Data were pooled using a random‐effects model. The primary outcomes were the number of patients exposed to allogeneic red cell transfusion and the amount of blood transfused. Other clinical outcomes are detailed in the review. 
Main results
A total of 75 trials were included. Overall, the use of cell salvage reduced the rate of exposure to allogeneic RBC transfusion by a relative 38% (RR 0.62; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.70). The absolute reduction in risk (ARR) of receiving an allogeneic RBC transfusion was 21% (95% CI 15% to 26%). In orthopaedic procedures the RR of exposure to RBC transfusion was 0.46 (95% CI 0.37 to 0.57) compared to 0.77 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.86) for cardiac procedures. The use of cell salvage resulted in an average saving of 0.68 units of allogeneic RBC per patient (WMD ‐0.68; 95% CI ‐0.88 to ‐0.49). Cell salvage did not appear to impact adversely on clinical outcomes. 
Authors' conclusions
The results suggest cell salvage is efficacious in reducing the need for allogeneic red cell transfusion in adult elective cardiac and orthopaedic surgery. The use of cell salvage did not appear to impact adversely on clinical outcomes. However, the methodological quality of trials was poor. As the trials were unblinded and lacked adequate concealment of treatment allocation, transfusion practices may have been influenced by knowledge of the patients' treatment status potentially biasing the results in favour of cell salvage.","Cell salvage (collecting a patient's own blood during surgery) for reducing transfusions with donated blood 
Some patients who undergo surgery require blood transfusions to compensate for the blood loss that occurs during the procedure. Often the blood used for the transfusion has been donated by a volunteer. The risks associated with receiving volunteer donor blood that has been screened by a competently managed modern laboratory are considered minimal, with the risk of contracting diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C being extremely low. However there is concern in many developing countries, where there is a high prevalence of such infections and transfusion services are inadequately equipped to screen donor blood as thoroughly. Although in developed countries the risks of acquiring a disease from transfused blood are low, the financial costs associated with providing a safe and reliable blood product are escalating. Therefore there is much attention being placed on alternative strategies to minimise the need for transfusions of donor blood. 
'Cell salvage' or 'autotransfusion' is one technique designed to reduce the use of such transfusions. It involves the collection of a patient's own blood from surgical sites which can be transfused back into the same person during or after surgery, as required. 
The authors undertook this systematic review to examine the evidence for the effectiveness of cell salvage in reducing the need for blood transfusions of donor blood in adults (over 18 years) undergoing surgery. 
The authors found 75 studies investigating the effectiveness of cell salvage in orthopaedic (36 studies), cardiac (33 studies), and vascular (6 studies) surgery. Overall, the findings show that cell salvage reduces the need for transfusions of donated blood. The authors conclude that there appears to be sufficient evidence to support the use of cell salvage in cardiac and orthopaedic surgery. Cell salvage does not appear to cause any adverse clinical outcomes. 
As the methodological quality of the trials was poor, the findings may be biased in favour of cell salvage. Large trials of high methodological quality that assess the relative effectiveness, safety, and cost‐effectiveness of cell salvage in different surgical procedures should be the focus of future research in this area.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
183,"Background
Available evidence on the effects of a high fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) of 60% to 90% compared with a routine fraction of inspired oxygen of 30% to 40%, during anaesthesia and surgery, on mortality and surgical site infection has been inconclusive. Previous trials and meta‐analyses have led to different conclusions on whether a high fraction of supplemental inspired oxygen during anaesthesia may decrease or increase mortality and surgical site infections in surgical patients. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of an FIO2 equal to or greater than 60% compared with a control FIO2 at or below 40% in the perioperative setting in terms of mortality, surgical site infection, respiratory insufficiency, serious adverse events and length of stay during the index admission for adult surgical patients. 
We looked at various outcomes, conducted subgroup and sensitivity analyses, examined the role of bias and applied trial sequential analysis (TSA) to examine the level of evidence supporting or refuting a high FIO2 during surgery, anaesthesia and recovery. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, International Web of Science, the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information Database (LILACS), advanced Google and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) up to February 2014. We checked the references of included trials and reviews for unidentified relevant trials and reran the searches in March 2015. We will consider two studies of interest when we update the review. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized clinical trials that compared a high fraction of inspired oxygen with a routine fraction of inspired oxygen during anaesthesia, surgery and recovery in individuals 18 years of age or older. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors extracted data independently. We conducted random‐effects and fixed‐effect meta‐analyses, and for dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RRs). We used published data and data obtained by contacting trial authors. 
To minimize the risk of systematic error, we assessed the risk of bias of the included trials. To reduce the risk of random errors caused by sparse data and repetitive updating of cumulative meta‐analyses, we applied trial sequential analyses. We used Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
We included 28 randomized clinical trials (9330 participants); in the 21 trials reporting relevant outcomes for this review, 7597 participants were randomly assigned to a high fraction of inspired oxygen versus a routine fraction of inspired oxygen. 
In trials with an overall low risk of bias, a high fraction of inspired oxygen compared with a routine fraction of inspired oxygen was not associated with all‐cause mortality (random‐effects model: RR 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.36; GRADE: low quality) within the longest follow‐up and within 30 days of follow‐up (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.99, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.60; GRADE: low quality). In a trial sequential analysis, the required information size was not reached and the analysis could not refute a 20% increase in mortality. Similarly, when all trials were included, a high fraction of inspired oxygen was not associated with all‐cause mortality to the longest follow‐up (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.33) or within 30 days of follow‐up (Peto OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.29), both of very low quality according to GRADE. Neither was a high fraction of inspired oxygen associated with the risk of surgical site infection in trials with low risk of bias (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.17; GRADE: low quality) or in all trials (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.07; GRADE: low quality). A high fraction of inspired oxygen was not associated with respiratory insufficiency (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.99), serious adverse events (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.43) or length of stay (mean difference ‐0.06 days, 95% CI ‐0.44 to 0.32 days). 
In subgroup analyses of nine trials using preoperative antibiotics, a high fraction of inspired oxygen was associated with a decrease in surgical site infections (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.97; GRADE: very low quality); a similar effect was noted in the five trials adequately blinded for the outcome assessment (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.96; GRADE: very low quality). We did not observe an effect of a high fraction of inspired oxygen on surgical site infections in any other subgroup analyses. 
Authors' conclusions
As the risk of adverse events, including mortality, may be increased by a fraction of inspired oxygen of 60% or higher, and as robust evidence is lacking for a beneficial effect of a fraction of inspired oxygen of 60% or higher on surgical site infection, our overall results suggest that evidence is insufficient to support the routine use of a high fraction of inspired oxygen during anaesthesia and surgery. Given the risk of attrition and outcome reporting bias, as well as other weaknesses in the available evidence, further randomized clinical trials with low risk of bias in all bias domains, including a large sample size and long‐term follow‐up, are warranted.","The effects of giving adult patients a high inspiratory oxygen fraction around the time of surgery 
Review question 
The normal air that we breathe contains 21% oxygen. This systematic review assesses the beneficial and harmful effects of a percentage of inspired oxygen of 60% to 90% compared with a routine percentage of 30% to 40% given during anaesthesia, during surgery and in the immediate recovery period on the numbers of deaths and surgical site infections reported in adult surgical patients. 
Background 
Reduced lung and circulatory function during surgery can lead to reduced levels of oxygen (hypoxia). Also, oxygen levels are often low in wounds at the end of surgery. This may impair bacterial killing and wound healing. Trials and previous meta‐analyses have led to different conclusions as to whether a high percentage of inspired oxygen during anaesthesia may decrease or increase the risk of death or surgical site infections. This systematic review used improved Cochrane methodology for carrying out systematic reviews to reassess available evidence derived from randomized clinical trials. 
Study characteristics 
We identified 28 randomized clinical trials. Eight trials with 4918 participants reported on risk of death, and 15 trials with 7219 participants reported on surgical site infections within 14 to 30 days of surgery. Four trials reported serious adverse events, three trials respiratory insufficiency, nine trials length of stay during the associated hospital admission and one trial quality of life. All trials were conducted without direct industry funding. 
The number of participants in each trial ranged from 38 to 2012. The mean age of participants was 50 years (range 15 to 92 years) and 63% were women. Types of surgery included abdominal surgery (eight trials), caesarean section (four trials), breast surgery (one trial), orthopaedic surgery (two trials) and various other surgical procedures (four trials). 
Key results 
A high percentage of inspired oxygen was not statistically associated with increased risk of death, or with a decrease in surgical site infections, in all trials that measured these outcomes, in trials of highest quality and in those with longest follow‐up. 
An increased risk of adverse events could not be proved right or wrong for a high percentage of inspired oxygen during anaesthesia and surgery. 
Quality and quantity of the evidence 
Only five of the included trials had low risk of bias. The trials randomly assigned 9330 participants, of whom only 7537 participants provided data for this review. The number of participants required to detect or reject a 20% relative risk reduction in deaths was not reached; therefore the observed results were uncertain.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
184,"Background
It has been suggested that in comparison with open radical cystectomy, robotic‐assisted radical cystectomy results in less blood loss, shorter convalescence, and fewer complications with equivalent short‐term oncological and functional outcomes; however, uncertainty remains as to the magnitude of these benefits. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of robotic‐assisted radical cystectomy versus open radical cystectomy in adults with bladder cancer. 
Search methods
Review authors conducted a comprehensive search with no restrictions on language of publication or publication status for studies comparing open radical cystectomy and robotic‐assisted radical cystectomy. The date of the last search was 1 July 2018 for the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE (1999 to July 2018), PubMed Embase (1999 to July 2018), Web of Science (1999 to July 2018), Cancer Research UK (www.cancerresearchuk.org/), and the Institute of Cancer Research (www.icr.ac.uk/). We searched the following trials registers: ClinicalTrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov/), BioMed Central International Standard Randomized Controlled Trials Number (ISRCTN) Registry (www.isrctn.com), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. 
Selection criteria
We searched for randomised controlled trials that compared robotic‐assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with open radical cystectomy (ORC). 
Data collection and analysis
This study was based on a published protocol. Primary outcomes of the review were recurrence‐free survival and major postoperative complications (class III to V). Secondary outcomes were minor postoperative complications (class I and II), transfusion requirement, length of hospital stay (days), quality of life, and positive margins (%). Three review authors independently assessed relevant titles and abstracts of records identified by the literature search to determine which studies should be assessed further. Two review authors assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and rated the quality of evidence according to GRADE. We used Review Manager 5 to analyse the data. 
Main results
We included in the review five randomised controlled trials comprising a total of 541 participants. Total numbers of participants included in the ORC and RARC cohorts were 270 and 271, respectively. 
Primary outomes  
Time‐to‐recurrence: Robotic cystectomy and open cystectomy may result in a similar time to recurrence (hazard ratio (HR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 1.43); 2 trials; low‐certainty evidence). In absolute terms at 5 years of follow‐up, this corresponds to 16 more recurrences per 1000 participants (95% CI 79 fewer to 123 more) with 431 recurrences per 1000 participants for ORC. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and imprecision. 
Major complications (Clavien grades 3 to 5): Robotic cystectomy and open cystectomy may result in similar rates of major complications (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.48); 5 trials; low‐certainty evidence). This corresponds to 11 more major complications per 1000 participants (95% CI 44 fewer to 89 more). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and imprecision. 
Secondary outcomes  
Minor complications (Clavien grades 1 and 2): We are very uncertain whether robotic cystectomy may reduce minor complications (very low‐certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and for very serious imprecision. 
Transfusion rate: Robotic cystectomy probably results in substantially fewer transfusions than open cystectomy (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.80; 2 trials; moderate‐certainty evidence). This corresponds to 193 fewer transfusions per 1000 participants (95% CI 262 fewer to 92 fewer) based on 460 transfusion per 1000 participants for ORC. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations. 
Hospital stay: Robotic cystectomy may result in a slightly shorter hospital stay than open cystectomy (mean difference (MD) ‐0.67, 95% CI ‐1.22 to ‐0.12); 5 trials; low‐certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and imprecision. 
Quality of life: Robotic cystectomy and open cystectomy may result in a similar quality of life (standard mean difference (SMD) 0.08, 95% CI 0.32 lower to 0.16 higher; 3 trials; low‐certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and imprecision. 
Positive margin rates: Robotic cystectomy and open cystectomy may result in similar positive margin rates (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.56 to 2.40; 5 trials; low‐certainty evidence). This corresponds to 8 more (95% CI 21 fewer to 67 more) positive margins per 1000 participants based on 48 positive margins per 1000 participants for ORC. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and imprecision. 
Authors' conclusions
Robotic cystectomy and open cystectomy may have similar outcomes with regard to time to recurrence, rates of major complications, quality of life, and positive margin rates (all low‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain whether the robotic approach reduces rates of minor complications (very low‐certainty evidence), although it probably reduces the risk of blood transfusions substantially (moderate‐certainty evidence) and may reduce hospital stay slightly (low‐certainty evidence). We were unable to conduct any of the preplanned subgroup analyses to assess the impact of patient age, pathological stage, body habitus, or surgeon expertise on outcomes. This review did not address issues of cost‐effectiveness.","Robotic versus open radical cystectomy for bladder cancer in adults
Review question 
For patients with bladder cancer that involves the deep muscle wall, does use of a robotic device lead to better or worse outcomes than open surgery? 
Background 
Patients with bladder cancer that involves the deep muscle wall are best treated by an operation that removes the entire bladder and creates an artificial bladder or channel from the bowel to allow urine to drain to the outside world. This has been done traditionally through open surgery using one large incision. Recently, this operation has been performed with robotic assistance using several small incisions. It is uncertain which approach is better. 
Study characteristics 
We performed a comprehensive literature search until 1 July 2018. We found five trials comparing robotic assisted versus open surgery. The total number of participants in these trials was 541. Four studies were conducted in the USA and one in the UK. 
Key results 
There may be little to no difference in the time to recurrence, the rate of major complications or minor complications, quality of life, and rates of positive margins (signalling that cancer may have been left behind). Robotic surgery probably results in fewer blood transfusions and may lead to a slightly shorter hospital stay when compared with open surgery. 
Certainty of evidence 
Reviewers rated the certainty of evidence as low for most outcomes, except for minor complications (very low) and transfusions (moderate). This means that the true results for these outcomes could be quite different.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
185,"Background
Drug resistance is common in focal epilepsy. In this update, we summarised the current evidence regarding add‐on levetiracetam in treating drug‐resistant focal epilepsy. The original review was published in 2001 and last updated in 2012. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness of levetiracetam when used as an add‐on treatment for people with drug‐resistant focal epilepsy. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web, which includes the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register and CENTRAL), MEDLINE Ovid, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) to November 2018. We contacted the manufacturers of levetiracetam and researchers in the field to seek any ongoing or unpublished trials. 
Selection criteria
Randomised, placebo‐controlled trials of add‐on levetiracetam treatment in people with drug‐resistant focal epilepsy. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trials for bias, extracted data, and evaluated the overall certainty of the evidence. Outcomes investigated included 50% or greater reduction in focal seizure frequency (response), treatment withdrawal, adverse effects (including a specific analysis of changes in behaviour), cognitive effects, and quality of life (QoL). Primary analysis was intention‐to‐treat. We performed meta‐analysis for all outcomes using a Mantel‐Haenszel approach and calculated risk ratios (RR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all estimates apart from adverse effects (99% CIs). We assessed heterogeneity using a Chi² test and the I² statistic. 
Main results
This update included 14 trials (2455 participants), predominantly possessing low risks of bias. Participants were adults in 12 trials (2159 participants) and children in the remaining two (296 participants). The doses of levetiracetam tested were 500 mg/day to 4000 mg/day in adults, and 60 mg/kg/day in children. Treatment ranged from 12 to 24 weeks. When individual doses were examined, levetiracetam at either 500 mg/day or 4000 mg/day did not perform better than placebo for the 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency outcome (500 mg: RR 1.60, 95% CI 0.71 to 3.62; P = 0.26; 4000 mg: RR 1.64, 95% CI 0.59 to 4.57; P = 0.34). Levetiracetam was significantly better than placebo at all other individual doses (1000 mg to 3000 mg). RR was significantly in favour of levetiracetam compared to placebo when results were pooled across all doses (RR 2.37, 95% CI 2.02 to 2.78; 14 studies, 2455 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Dose–response analysis demonstrated that the odds of achieving response (50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency) were increased by nearly 40% (odds ratio (OR) 1.39, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.58) for each 1000 mg increase in dose of levetiracetam. There were important levels of heterogeneity across multiple comparisons. 
Participants were not significantly more likely to experience treatment withdrawal with levetiracetam than with placebo (pooled RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.40; 13 studies, 2428 participants; high‐certainty evidence). 
Somnolence was the most common adverse effect, affecting 13% of participants, and it was significantly associated with levetiracetam compared to placebo (pooled RR 1.62, 99% CI 1.19 to 2.20; 13 studies, 2423 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Changes in behaviour were negligible in adults (1% affected; RR 1.79, 99% CI 0.59 to 5.41), but significant in children (23% affected; RR 1.90, 99% CI 1.16 to 3.11). Levetiracetam had a positive effect on some aspects of cognition and QoL in adults and worsened certain aspects of child behaviour. 
Authors' conclusions
Overall, this review update finds that in both adults and children with drug‐resistant focal epilepsy, levetiracetam added on to usual care is more effective than placebo at reducing seizure frequency, it is unlikely to be stopped by patients, and it has minimal adverse effects outside of potential worsening behaviour in children. These findings are unchanged from the previous review update in 2012. This review update contributes two key additional findings: 1. a 500 mg daily dose of levetiracetam is no more effective than placebo at reducing seizures; and 2. the odds of response (50% reduction in seizure frequency) are increased by nearly 40% for each 1000 mg increase in dose of levetiracetam. 
It seems reasonable to continue the use of levetiracetam in both adults and children with drug‐resistant focal epilepsy.","Levetiracetam add‐on for drug‐resistant focal epilepsy
This is an updated version of the Cochrane Review first published in 2001 and last updated in Issue 9, 2012 of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. 
Background and objective 
Epilepsy is a one of the most common disorders of the brain, affecting over 70 million people worldwide. Levetiracetam is an antiepileptic drug widely used around the world. In this review, we summarised the current evidence regarding its effectiveness when used as a treatment added on to usual care in people experiencing focal epilepsy that responds poorly to medication. 
Methods 
The evidence is current to 26 November 2018. Fourteen studies in which people were randomly assigned to either levetiracetam or a dummy tablet (placebo) were included, with a total of 2455 participants (296 of whom were children). Everybody had their usual medications continued, meaning that nobody was left without taking an antiepileptic medicine. Among other things, we looked at how many people had their frequency of seizures reduced by 50% or more when taking levetiracetam versus when taking the placebo tablet. We combined the results of all of these people in order to increase our confidence in how effective levetiracetam is. 
Key results 
Levetiracetam significantly reduced the frequency of seizures in both adults and children. Just over half of children responded to levetiracetam, and 34% of adults also responded. These responses were much higher than in the placebo groups, indicating that levetiracetam was better than placebo. The most effective doses were those of 1000 mg to 3000 mg levetiracetam. For every 1000 mg increase in dose, the chances that levetiracetam would reduce seizures (fits) appeared to improve by 40%. We noticed that the results were very different in each study we looked at. Therefore, although we could see that levetiracetam works, it was difficult for us to be certain about how large that effect actually is. 
Levetiracetam was generally tolerated well by adults and children. Most people managed to complete their course of levetiracetam during the studies. There were very few side effects with levetiracetam. The only side effect that was significantly associated with levetiracetam was somnolence (sleepiness). However, we also noticed that the behaviour of some children taking levetiracetam could worsen significantly. 
Overall, it seems reasonable to add levetiracetam to a patient's usual antiepileptic medications if they have focal epilepsy that has responded poorly to other medications.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
186,"Background
Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in young children account for 1.4 million deaths annually worldwide. Antibiotics could be beneficial in preventing LRTIs in high‐risk children, and may also help prevent school absenteeism and work days missed by children and/or carers. While it is well documented that the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis for RTIs decreases over time, there are no reviews that describe the use of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent LRTIs in high‐risk children aged 12 years and under. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of antibiotic prophylaxis in the prevention of bacterial LRTIs in high‐risk children aged 12 years and under. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 1) and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), MEDLINE and MEDLINE In‐Process (OvidSP) (1946 to 13 February 2015), EMBASE (OvidSP) (1974 to 12 February 2015), Science Citation Index Expanded (1945 to 13 February 2015) and Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science (Web of Science Core Collection) (1990 to 13 February 2015). We searched for ongoing studies on ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization ICTRP. We handsearched the bibliographies of retrieved full texts of relevant studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral or intravenous antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment to prevent infections in high‐risk children aged 12 years and under. We used a combination of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Health Service (NHS), American Academy of Paediatrics (AAP) and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines to define conditions at higher risk of complications. Our primary outcome was the incidence of bacterial lower respiratory infections. Secondary outcomes included clinical function, hospital admission, mortality, growth, use of secondary antibiotics, time off school or parental work, quality of life and adverse events. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data using a customised data extraction sheet, assessed the risk of bias of included studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' criteria, and used the GRADE criteria to rate the quality of the evidence. We used a random‐effects model for meta‐analysis. We presented the results narratively where we could not statistically combine data. 
Main results
We included 10 RCTs of high‐risk children using antibiotics (azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, co‐trimoxazole, isoniazid, oral penicillin V or vancomycin) to prevent LRTIs. Three studies included HIV‐infected children (n = 1345), four cystic fibrosis (n = 429) and one each sickle cell disease (n = 219), cancer (n = 160) and low birth weight neonates with underlying respiratory disorders (n = 40). The study duration ranged from seven days to three years. The quality of the evidence from studies including children with HIV infection, cystic fibrosis or cancer was moderate. Due to inadequate data, we were unable to rate the quality of the evidence for two studies: one in children with sickle cell disease (low risk of bias), and another in low birth weight neonates with underlying respiratory disorders (high risk of bias). 
In HIV‐infected children receiving continuous isoniazid prophylaxis, there was no significant difference in the incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis (risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32 to 1.29, I2 statistic = 47%, P value = 0.21). There was no significant effect on mortality with co‐trimoxazole or isoniazid prophylaxis (RR 0.82, 0.46 to 1.46, I2 statistic = 76%, P value = 0.58); however, analysis of one study that used co‐trimoxazole showed a significant reduction in mortality (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.85, P value = 0.001). There was a significant decrease in the rates of hospital admission per child‐year of follow‐up with co‐trimoxazole prophylaxis in one study (P value = 0.01). There was no evidence of increased adverse events due to antibiotic prophylaxis (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.64, I2 statistic = 22%, P value = 0.28); however, there was scant reporting of antibiotic resistance ‐ the one study that did assess this found no increase. 
In two studies of children with cystic fibrosis receiving ciprofloxacin prophylaxis, there was no significant difference in Pseudomonas infections (RR 0.76, 0.44 to 1.31, I2 statistic = 0%, P value = 0.33). In two studies assessing the benefit of azithromycin prophylaxis, there was a significant reduction in the frequency of pulmonary exacerbations (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.76, I2 statistic = 0%, P value < 0.0001). The effect of antibiotic prophylaxis on growth in children with cystic fibrosis was inconsistent across the studies. There was an increased risk of emergence of pathogenic strains with either azithromycin or ciprofloxacin prophylaxis in two studies reporting this outcome. There was no significant difference in the quality of life (one study). In three studies, there was no significant increase in the frequency of adverse events with prophylaxis with azithromycin (two studies) or ciprofloxacin (one study). There was no evidence of increased antibiotic resistance in two studies. 
In the one study of children with sickle cell disease, a significantly lesser proportion of children with pneumococcal septicaemia was reported with penicillin V prophylaxis (P value = 0.0025). 
In the one study of children with cancer there was a significant decrease in Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia with trimethoprim‐sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis (RR 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.47, P value < 0.01). There was no significant increase in the frequency of adverse events with antibiotic prophylaxis. 
In low birth weight children with underlying respiratory disorders, there was no significant difference in the proportion of children with pulmonary infection with vancomycin prophylaxis (P value = 0.18). 
No included studies reported time off school or carer time off work.
Authors' conclusions
There is inconclusive evidence that antibiotic prophylaxis in certain groups of high‐risk children can reduce pneumonia, exacerbations, hospital admission and mortality in certain conditions. However, limitations in the evidence base mean more clinical trials assessing the effectiveness of antibiotics for preventing LRTIs in children at high risk should be conducted. Specifically, clinical trials assessing the effectiveness of antibiotics for preventing LRTIs in congenital heart disease, metabolic disease, endocrine and renal disorders, neurological disease or prematurity should be a priority.","Antibiotics for the prevention of lower respiratory tract infections in children at high risk aged 12 years and under 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence for antibiotics to prevent bacterial lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in children aged 12 years and under who are at increased chance of contracting such infections. 
Background 
Annually, about 1.4 million children die from respiratory tract infections. One in five of these deaths occur in children under five years old. Using antibiotics to prevent LRTI in high‐risk children aged 12 years and under may be beneficial. However, no review currently describes the evidence for using antibiotics to prevent LRTI in this population. 
Study characteristics 
In February 2015, we searched for studies examining the effect of antibiotics to prevent LRTI in children aged 12 years and under with an increased risk of contracting such infections. 
We included 10 studies; three examined the effectiveness of antibiotics in 1345 children with HIV, four in 429 children with cystic fibrosis, one in 219 children with sickle cell disease, one in 160 children undergoing treatment for cancer, and one in 40 children who were underweight at birth with underlying breathing problems. 
The study duration was between 18.9 and 24.7 months for children with HIV, between six and 36 months in children with cystic fibrosis, 15 months in one study of children with sickle cell disease, 13 to 24 months in one study of children with cancer, and seven days in low birth weight newborns with underlying respiratory problems. 
Study funding sources 
Of three studies that included children with HIV, one was funded by an International Aid Agency, another by government and the third by a charity. 
Of four studies that included children with cystic fibrosis, three were funded by charities and one by government. 
The one study that included children with sickle cell disease was funded by government and the study that included children with cancer was funded by government, industry and charity. 
The funding source for the study that included newborns with underlying respiratory disorders was not specified. 
Key results 
In children with HIV, antibiotics did not reduce the likelihood of contracting tuberculosis. Overall there was no improvement in death rates, but there was a marked reduction in hospital admission with antibiotic use in one study. 
In children with cystic fibrosis, antibiotics did not reduce the likelihood of infection with Pseudomonas bacteria, but there was a reduction in flare‐ups, where bacterial infection makes it harder for the child to breathe. 
In one study of children with sickle cell disease, antibiotics reduced the likelihood of contracting blood infections. 
In one study of children with cancers, antibiotics reduced the likelihood of contracting Pneumocystis infection in the lungs. 
In low birth weight newborns with respiratory disorders, antibiotics did not reduce the likelihood of lung infections. 
Quality of the evidence 
In children with HIV, we rated the overall quality of the evidence for two studies that examined the effect of antibiotics for preventing tuberculosis as moderate because of differences in how the antibiotics were administered. We rated the quality of the evidence for antibiotic use in reducing deaths as moderate because of differences in the types of antibiotics used. Due to lack of data, we could not rate the quality of the evidence for hospital admissions. 
In children with cystic fibrosis, we rated the overall quality of the evidence for two studies that examined the effect of antibiotics in reducing the likelihood of Pseudomonas infection as moderate because of differences in the types of antibiotics used. We rated the quality of the evidence for the effect of antibiotics in reducing 'flare‐ups' as high. 
In children with cancer, we rated the quality of the evidence for the effect of antibiotics in reducing the likelihood of Pneumocystis infection as moderate because of the likelihood of indirectness of the study results. 
Due to lack of data, we could not rate the quality of the evidence for the effect of antibiotics in reducing the likelihood of blood infections in children with sickle cell disease, or in reducing the likelihood of lung infections in low birth weight newborns with respiratory disorders; the two studies had low probability and high probability of bias respectively.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
187,"Background
Critically ill patients require regular body position changes to minimize the adverse effects of bed rest, inactivity and immobilization. However, uncertainty surrounds the effectiveness of lateral positioning for improving pulmonary gas exchange, aiding drainage of tracheobronchial secretions and preventing morbidity. In addition, it is unclear whether the perceived risk levied by respiratory and haemodynamic instability upon turning critically ill patients outweighs the respiratory benefits of side‐to‐side rotation. Thus, lack of certainty may contribute to variation in positioning practice and equivocal patient outcomes. 
Objectives
To evaluate effects of the lateral position compared with other body positions on patient outcomes (mortality, morbidity and clinical adverse events) in critically ill adult patients. (Clinical adverse events include hypoxaemia, hypotension, low oxygen delivery and global indicators of impaired tissue oxygenation.) We examined single use of the lateral position (i.e. on the right or left side) and repeat use of the lateral position (i.e. lateral positioning) within a positioning schedule. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1950 to 23 May 2015), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1937 to 23 May 2015), the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) (1984 to 23 May 2015), Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (1901 to 23 May 2015), Web of Science (1945 to 23 May 2015), Index to Theses in Great Britain and Ireland (1950 to 23 May 2015), Trove (2009 to 23 May 2015; previously Australasian Digital Theses Program (1997 to December 2008)) and Proquest Dissertations and Theses (2009 to 23 May 2015; previously Proquest Digital Dissertations (1980 to 23 May 2015)). We handsearched the reference lists of potentially relevant reports and two nursing journals. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized and quasi‐randomized trials examining effects of lateral positioning in critically ill adults. We included manual or automated turns but limited eligibility to studies that included duration of body position of 10 minutes or longer. We examined each lateral position versus at least one comparator (opposite lateral position and/or another body position) for single therapy effects, and the lateral positioning schedule (repeated lateral turning) versus other positioning schedules for repetitive therapy effects. 
Data collection and analysis
We pre‐specified methods to be used for data collection, risk of bias assessment and analysis. Two independent review authors carried out each stage of selection and data extraction and settled differences in opinion by consensus, or by third party adjudication when disagreements remained unresolved. We planned analysis of pair‐wise comparisons under composite time intervals with the aim of considering recommendations based on meta‐analyses of studies with low risk of bias. 
Main results
We included 24 studies of critically ill adults. No study reported mortality as an outcome of interest. Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examined lateral positioning for pulmonary morbidity outcomes but provided insufficient information for meta‐analysis. A total of 22 randomized trials examined effects of lateral positioning (four parallel‐group and 18 cross‐over designs) by measuring various continuous data outcomes commonly used to detect adverse cardiopulmonary events within critical care areas. However, parallel‐group studies were not comparable, and cross‐over studies provided limited data as the result of unit of analysis errors. Eight studies provided some data; most of these were single studies with small effects that were imprecise. We pooled partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) as a measure to detect hypoxaemia from two small studies of participants with unilateral lung disease (n = 19). The mean difference (MD) between lateral positions (bad lung down versus good lung down) was approximately 50 mmHg (MD ‐49.26 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐67.33 to ‐31.18; P value < 0.00001). Despite a lower mean PaO2 for bad lung down, hypoxaemia (mean PaO2 < 60 mmHg) was not consistently reported. Furthermore, pooled data had methodological shortcomings with unclear risk of bias. We had similar doubts regarding internal validity for other studies included in the review. 
Authors' conclusions
Review authors could provide no clinical practice recommendations based on the findings of included studies. Available research could not eliminate the uncertainty surrounding benefits and/or risks associated with lateral positioning of critically ill adult patients. Research gaps include the effectiveness of lateral positioning compared with semi recumbent positioning for mechanically ventilated patients, lateral positioning compared with prone positioning for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and less frequent changes in body position. We recommend that future research be undertaken to address whether the routine practice of repositioning patients on their side benefits all, some or few critically ill patients.","Lateral positioning for critically ill adult patients
We reviewed the evidence on the effects of turning critically ill adults from side to side while lying on a hospital bed. We found 24 studies. 
Background 
Nurses change the body position of critically ill patients as frequently as every two hours to prevent bed sores and other complications associated with immobility. Turning from side to side may also help loosen and drain secretions accumulated within the lungs. Routine lateral repositioning is a relatively safe standard practice. However, if a patient's blood pressure or oxygen level drops to a dangerously low reading during the position change, urgent medical attention is required. Most events resolve quickly, but for some patients these events may be slow to resolve and are potentially life‐threatening. We wanted to discover whether routine lateral repositioning is better than other positioning strategies including less frequent turns, and whether a lateral position may cause more adverse events. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to May 2015.
Study characteristics 
We included randomized studies of critically ill adults receiving treatment in intensive care units and in other critical care areas. We selected studies that included lateral positioning after a single turn or following repetitive turns. The duration of each body position was 10 minutes or longer. Comparisons included the other lateral position (opposite side), as well as supine (lying on your back), semi recumbent (lying on your back with your upper body elevated to a 45‐degree angle) and prone (lying on your stomach) positions. 
Results 
We found 24 eligible studies. No studies reported on mortality. Two studies reported on pulmonary morbidity following cardiac surgery, but available data were insufficient for analysis. The other studies reported measures that we included to identify clinical adverse events. Most of these studies did not report results in a way that could be combined for review of evidence, and trial design was often dissimilar. We compared two studies of critically ill adults with unilateral lung disease (one 'bad lung' and one 'good lung'). Oxygen levels within the blood were lower for 'bad lung down' (side lying with the 'bad lung' lowermost). However, the sample was small, both studies were of poor quality and very low oxygen levels in the blood were not consistently found across studies. Therefore, results need to be viewed with caution. 
Conclusion 
We found no clear evidence on the effectiveness of routine lateral repositioning or the effects of a single turn for critically ill patients. Good quality studies are needed to find out whether routine lateral repositioning is still recommended for most critically ill patients, and whether one body position is best avoided for some.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
188,"Background
Acute cough due to upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is a common symptom. Non‐prescription, over‐the‐counter (OTC) medicines are frequently recommended as a first‐line treatment, but there is little evidence as to whether these drugs are effective. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of oral OTC cough preparations for acute cough in children and adults in community settings. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March week 3 2014), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2014), CINAHL (January 2010 to March 2014), LILACS (January 2010 to March 2014), Web of Science (January 2010 to March 2014) and the UK Department of Health National Research Register (March 2010). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral OTC cough preparations with placebo in children and adults suffering from acute cough in community settings. We considered all cough outcomes; secondary outcomes of interest were adverse effects. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened potentially relevant citations, extracted data and assessed study quality. We performed quantitative analysis where appropriate. 
Main results
Due to the small numbers of trials in each category, the limited quantitative data available and the marked differences between trials in terms of participants, interventions and outcome measurement, we felt that pooling of the results was inappropriate. 
We included 29 trials (19 in adults, 10 in children) involving 4835 people (3799 adults and 1036 children). All studies were placebo‐controlled RCTs. However, assessment of the risk of bias of the included studies was limited by poor reporting, particularly for the earlier studies. 
In the adult studies, six trials compared antitussives with placebo and had variable results. Three trials compared the expectorant guaifenesin with placebo; one indicated significant benefit, whereas the other two did not. One trial found that a mucolytic reduced cough frequency and symptom scores. Two studies examined antihistamine‐decongestant combinations and found conflicting results. Four studies compared other combinations of drugs with placebo and indicated some benefit in reducing cough symptoms. Three trials found that antihistamines were no more effective than placebo in relieving cough symptoms. 
In the child studies, antitussives (data from three studies), antihistamines (data from three studies), antihistamine‐decongestants (two studies) and antitussive/bronchodilator combinations (one study) were no more effective than placebo. No studies using expectorants met our inclusion criteria. The results of one trial favoured active treatment with mucolytics over placebo. One trial tested two paediatric cough syrups and both preparations showed a 'satisfactory response' in 46% and 56% of children compared to 21% of children in the placebo group. One new trial indicated that three types of honey were more effective than placebo over a three‐day period. 
Twenty‐one studies reported adverse effects. There was a wide range across studies, with higher numbers of adverse effects in participants taking preparations containing antihistamines and dextromethorphan. 
Authors' conclusions
The results of this review have to be interpreted with caution because the number of studies in each category of cough preparations was small. Availability, dosing and duration of use of over‐the‐counter cough medicines vary significantly in different countries. Many studies were poorly reported making assessment of risk of bias difficult and studies were also very different from each other, making evaluation of overall efficacy difficult. There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC medicines in acute cough. This should be taken into account when considering prescribing antihistamines and centrally active antitussive agents in children; drugs that are known to have the potential to cause serious harm.","Over‐the‐counter (OTC) medications for acute cough in children and adults in community settings 
Review question 
We undertook a review to determine the effectiveness of over‐the‐counter cough medicines in reducing cough in children and adults in community settings. We found 29 trials involving 4835 people. 
Background 
Acute cough is a common and troublesome symptom in children and adults suffering from acute upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Many people self prescribe over‐the‐counter (OTC) cough preparations, and health practitioners often recommend their use for the initial treatment of cough. There is substantial variation between countries in the availability and guidelines for use of many of these preparations. 
Study characteristics 
We identified a broad range of studies of different types of preparations used at different dosages in both adults and children. 
Key results 
The evidence is current up to March 2014. We found no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC medications in acute cough. Nineteen studies reported adverse effects of these medications and described infrequent, mainly minor side effects such as nausea, vomiting, headache and drowsiness. 
Quality of the evidence 
The results of this review have to be interpreted with caution because the number of studies in each category of cough preparations was small. Many studies were poorly reported making assessment of risk of bias difficult. While all studies were placebo‐controlled randomised controlled trials only a minority reported their methods of allocation and randomisation and there was lack of reporting of blinding of outcome assessors and whether cough outcome measures were validated. In addition, studies supported by pharmaceutical companies or other providers were more likely to have positive results. Studies were very different from each other in terms of treatment types, treatment duration and outcomes measured, making evaluation of overall effectiveness of OTC cough medicines difficult.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
189,"Background
Healthcare professionals are important contributors to healthcare quality and patient safety, but their performance does not always follow recommended clinical practice. There are many approaches to influencing practice among healthcare professionals. These approaches include audit and feedback, reminders, educational materials, educational outreach visits, educational meetings or conferences, use of local opinion leaders, financial incentives, and organisational interventions. In this review, we evaluated the effectiveness of patient‐mediated interventions. These interventions are aimed at changing the performance of healthcare professionals through interactions with patients, or through information provided by or to patients. Examples of patient‐mediated interventions include 1) patient‐reported health information, 2) patient information, 3) patient education, 4) patient feedback about clinical practice, 5) patient decision aids, 6) patients, or patient representatives, being members of a committee or board, and 7) patient‐led training or education of healthcare professionals. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of patient‐mediated interventions on healthcare professionals' performance (adherence to clinical practice guidelines or recommendations for clinical practice). 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE, Ovid in March 2018, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in March 2017, and ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry (ICTRP) in September 2017, and OpenGrey, the Grey Literature Report and Google Scholar in October 2017. We also screened the reference lists of included studies and conducted cited reference searches for all included studies in October 2017. 
Selection criteria
Randomised studies comparing patient‐mediated interventions to either usual care or other interventions to improve professional practice. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes using Mantel‐Haenszel statistics and the random‐effects model. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) using inverse variance statistics. Two review authors independently assessed the certainty of the evidence (GRADE). 
Main results
We included 25 studies with a total of 12,268 patients. The number of healthcare professionals included in the studies ranged from 12 to 167 where this was reported. The included studies evaluated four types of patient‐mediated interventions: 1) patient‐reported health information interventions (for instance information obtained from patients about patients' own health, concerns or needs before a clinical encounter), 2) patient information interventions (for instance, where patients are informed about, or reminded to attend recommended care), 3) patient education interventions (intended to increase patients' knowledge about their condition and options of care, for instance), and 4) patient decision aids (where the patient is provided with information about treatment options including risks and benefits). For each type of patient‐mediated intervention a separate meta‐analysis was produced. 
Patient‐reported health information interventions probably improve healthcare professionals' adherence to recommended clinical practice (moderate‐certainty evidence). We found that for every 100 patients consulted or treated, 26 (95% CI 23 to 30) are in accordance with recommended clinical practice compared to 17 per 100 in the comparison group (no intervention or usual care). We are uncertain about the effect of patient‐reported health information interventions on desirable patient health outcomes and patient satisfaction (very low‐certainty evidence). Undesirable patient health outcomes and adverse events were not reported in the included studies and resource use was poorly reported. 
Patient information interventions may improve healthcare professionals' adherence to recommended clinical practice (low‐certainty evidence). We found that for every 100 patients consulted or treated, 32 (95% CI 24 to 42) are in accordance with recommended clinical practice compared to 20 per 100 in the comparison group (no intervention or usual care). Patient information interventions may have little or no effect on desirable patient health outcomes and patient satisfaction (low‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of patient information interventions on undesirable patient health outcomes because the certainty of the evidence is very low. Adverse events and resource use were not reported in the included studies. 
Patient education interventions probably improve healthcare professionals' adherence to recommended clinical practice (moderate‐certainty evidence). We found that for every 100 patients consulted or treated, 46 (95% CI 39 to 54) are in accordance with recommended clinical practice compared to 35 per 100 in the comparison group (no intervention or usual care). Patient education interventions may slightly increase the number of patients with desirable health outcomes (low‐certainty evidence). Undesirable patient health outcomes, patient satisfaction, adverse events and resource use were not reported in the included studies. 
Patient decision aid interventions may have little or no effect on healthcare professionals' adherence to recommended clinical practice (low‐certainty evidence). We found that for every 100 patients consulted or treated, 32 (95% CI 24 to 43) are in accordance with recommended clinical practice compared to 37 per 100 in the comparison group (usual care). Patient health outcomes, patient satisfaction, adverse events and resource use were not reported in the included studies. 
Authors' conclusions
We found that two types of patient‐mediated interventions, patient‐reported health information and patient education, probably improve professional practice by increasing healthcare professionals' adherence to recommended clinical practice (moderate‐certainty evidence). We consider the effect to be small to moderate. Other patient‐mediated interventions, such as patient information may also improve professional practice (low‐certainty evidence). Patient decision aids may make little or no difference to the number of healthcare professionals' adhering to recommended clinical practice (low‐certainty evidence). 
The impact of these interventions on patient health and satisfaction, adverse events and resource use, is more uncertain mostly due to very low certainty evidence or lack of evidence.","Patient‐mediated interventions to improve professional practice
What is the aim of the review? 
Our aim with this Cochrane review was to assess whether patients can change the performance of healthcare professionals. We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 25 studies. 
Key message 
This review suggests that patients may change healthcare professionals’ practice though the following three strategies: 1) strategies where patients give healthcare professionals information about themselves; 2) strategies where patients are given healthcare information; and 3) strategies where patients take part in patient education. Patient decision aids may make little or no difference to healthcare professionals’ practice, however, the certainty is low, and these results should be interpreted carefully. We still need more research about the best ways in which patients can change professional practice and about the impact it has on patients’ health. 
What was studied in the review? 
Many strategies have been tested to see if they can improve healthcare professionals’ practice and make sure that patients receive the best available care. These strategies include sending reminders to healthcare professionals, giving them further education, or giving them financial rewards. These strategies have mostly had only small or moderate effects. Another way of changing what healthcare professionals do is through the patients themselves. These strategies are called 'patient‐mediated interventions'. 
What are the main results of the review? 
The studies in this review assessed different patient‐mediated strategies compared to usual care or no strategies. 
Strategies where patients give information to healthcare professionals 
In these studies, patients gave information about their own health, concerns or needs to the doctor. This was usually done by filling in a questionnaire in the waiting area before a consultation. The doctor was then given this information before or at the consultation. The review shows that these strategies: 
‐ probably improve the extent to which healthcare professionals follow recommended clinical practice (moderate‐certainty evidence). 
We are uncertain about the effect of these strategies on patient health, patient satisfaction and resource use because these outcomes were not measured in the studies or because the certainty of the evidence is very low. 
Strategies where information was given to patients 
In these studies, patients were given information about recommended care or were reminded to use services, for instance to go for a check‐up. The review shows that these strategies: 
‐ may improve the extent to which healthcare professionals follow recommended clinical practice (low‐certainty evidence); 
‐ may have little or no effect on patient satisfaction (low‐certainty evidence);
‐ may have little or no effect on some patient health outcomes, such as the number of patients who reach controlled blood pressure (low‐certainty evidence). However, we are uncertain about the effect of these strategies on other patient health outcomes because the certainty of the evidence is very low. We also lack information to draw conclusions about resource use. 
Patient education strategies 
In these studies, patients took part in patient education such as self‐management programmes, for instance to increase their knowledge about their condition. The review shows that these strategies: 
‐ probably improve the extent to which healthcare professionals follow recommended clinical practice (moderate‐certainty evidence); 
‐ may slightly improve some patient health outcomes such as the number of patients who reach controlled blood pressure (low‐certainty evidence). However, we are uncertain about the effect of these strategies on other patient health outcomes, patient satisfaction and resource use because these outcomes were not measured in the included studies. 
Patient decision aid strategies 
In the one study that assessed effect of patient decision aids, patients were given a decision aid consisting of a booklet, personal worksheet, and audiotape to make decisions about their medical management. The review shows that these strategies: 
‐ may have little or no effect on the extent to which healthcare professionals follow recommended clinical practice (low‐certainty evidence) 
We are uncertain about the effect of these strategies on patient health, patient satisfaction and resource use because these outcomes were not measured in the studies or because the certainty of the evidence is very low.

190,"Background
General anaesthesia combined with epidural analgesia may have a beneficial effect on clinical outcomes. However, use of epidural analgesia for cardiac surgery is controversial due to a theoretical increased risk of epidural haematoma associated with systemic heparinization. This review was published in 2013, and it was updated in 2019. 
Objectives
To determine the impact of perioperative epidural analgesia in adults undergoing cardiac surgery, with or without cardiopulmonary bypass, on perioperative mortality and cardiac, pulmonary, or neurological morbidity. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase in November 2018, and two trial registers up to February 2019, together with references and relevant conference abstracts. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including adults undergoing any type of cardiac surgery under general anaesthesia and comparing epidural analgesia versus another modality of postoperative pain treatment. The primary outcome was mortality. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We included 69 trials with 4860 participants: 2404 given epidural analgesia and 2456 receiving comparators (systemic analgesia, peripheral nerve block, intrapleural analgesia, or wound infiltration). The mean (or median) age of participants varied between 43.5 years and 74.6 years. Surgeries performed were coronary artery bypass grafting or valvular procedures and surgeries for congenital heart disease. We judged that no trials were at low risk of bias for all domains, and that all trials were at unclear/high risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel taking care of study participants. 
Epidural analgesia versus systemic analgesia  
Trials show there may be no difference in mortality at 0 to 30 days (risk difference (RD) 0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.01 to 0.01; 38 trials with 3418 participants; low‐quality evidence), and there may be a reduction in myocardial infarction at 0 to 30 days (RD −0.01, 95% CI −0.02 to 0.00; 26 trials with 2713 participants; low‐quality evidence). Epidural analgesia may reduce the risk of 0 to 30 days respiratory depression (RD −0.03, 95% CI −0.05 to −0.01; 21 trials with 1736 participants; low‐quality evidence). There is probably little or no difference in risk of pneumonia at 0 to 30 days (RD −0.03, 95% CI −0.07 to 0.01; 10 trials with 1107 participants; moderate‐quality evidence), and epidural analgesia probably reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter at 0 to 2 weeks (RD −0.06, 95% CI −0.10 to −0.01; 18 trials with 2431 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). There may be no difference in cerebrovascular accidents at 0 to 30 days (RD −0.00, 95% CI −0.01 to 0.01; 18 trials with 2232 participants; very low‐quality evidence), and none of the included trials reported any epidural haematoma events at 0 to 30 days (53 trials with 3982 participants; low‐quality evidence). Epidural analgesia probably reduces the duration of tracheal intubation by the equivalent of 2.4 hours (standardized mean difference (SMD) −0.78, 95% CI −1.01 to −0.55; 40 trials with 3353 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). Epidural analgesia reduces pain at rest and on movement up to 72 hours after surgery. At six to eight hours, researchers noted a reduction in pain, equivalent to a reduction of 1 point on a 0 to 10 pain scale (SMD −1.35, 95% CI −1.98 to −0.72; 10 trials with 502 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). Epidural analgesia may increase risk of hypotension (RD 0.21, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.33; 17 trials with 870 participants; low‐quality evidence) but may make little or no difference in the need for infusion of inotropics or vasopressors (RD 0.00, 95% CI −0.06 to 0.07; 23 trials with 1821 participants; low‐quality evidence). 
Epidural analgesia versus other comparators  
Fewer studies compared epidural analgesia versus peripheral nerve blocks (four studies), intrapleural analgesia (one study), and wound infiltration (one study). Investigators provided no data for pulmonary complications, atrial fibrillation or flutter, or for any of the comparisons. When reported, other outcomes for these comparisons (mortality, myocardial infarction, neurological complications, duration of tracheal intubation, pain, and haemodynamic support) were uncertain due to the small numbers of trials and participants. 
Authors' conclusions
Compared with systemic analgesia, epidural analgesia may reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, respiratory depression, and atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, as well as the duration of tracheal intubation and pain, in adults undergoing cardiac surgery. There may be little or no difference in mortality, pneumonia, and epidural haematoma, and effects on cerebrovascular accident are uncertain. Evidence is insufficient to show the effects of epidural analgesia compared with peripheral nerve blocks, intrapleural analgesia, or wound infiltration.","Epidural analgesia for heart surgery with or without the heart lung machine in adults
Review question 
We set out to determine from randomized controlled trials the effect of epidural pain relief on the number of deaths following surgery and risk of heart, lung, or nerve complications in adults undergoing heart surgery. 
This review was first published in 2013, and it was updated in 2019.
Background 
For epidural pain relief, a local anaesthetic, an opioid, or a mixture of both drugs is given through a catheter in the epidural space, which is the space immediately outside the membrane surrounding the cord. Epidural analgesia could reduce the risk of complications after surgery, such as lung infections including pneumonia, difficulty in breathing (respiratory failure), heart attack, and irregular heart rhythm caused by atrial fibrillation. A concern is that for cardiac surgery, the blood has to be thinned to reduce blood clotting, which may increase the chance of bleeding around the spinal cord. The collection of blood puts pressure on the spinal cord and can cause permanent nerve damage and disability. 
Study characteristics 
We included randomized controlled trials involving adults undergoing any type of cardiac surgery under general anaesthesia with or without cardiopulmonary bypass where researchers compared epidural pain relief around the time of surgery against other forms of pain relief. Surgeries performed were coronary artery bypass grafting or valvular procedures and surgeries for congenital heart disease. The average age of participants was between 43 and 75 years. Outcomes were measured up to one year after surgery. 
We included 69 studies with 4860 participants. Where stated, the studies were funded by governmental resources (five studies), charity (eight), institutional resources (23), or in part by the industry (two). In all, 31 trials did not mention the source of funding. The evidence is current to November 2018. 
Key results 
When researchers compared epidural analgesia versus systemic pain relief (e.g. by an analgesic given directly into a vein), they could not detect any difference in the number of deaths in the first 30 days after surgery (38 studies, 3418 participants). There might be a difference in the number of people experiencing heart attacks (26 studies, 2713 participants). These findings were supported by low‐quality evidence. We found a small reduction in the risk of respiratory depression with epidural pain relief (21 studies, 1736 participants), but not in the risk of pneumonia (10 studies, 1107 participants) (low‐ or moderate‐quality evidence). The reduced risk of respiratory depression was more obvious when cardiopulmonary bypass was needed for cardiac surgery. Epidural analgesia reduced the risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter early in recovery at zero to two weeks (18 studies, 2431 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). The number of cerebrovascular accidents was not clearly different (18 studies, 2232 participants), and no lasting neurological complications or epidural haematomas were reported (53 studies, 3982 participants; very low‐ or low‐quality evidence). Although epidural analgesia may have reduced the duration of tracheal intubation, this was noted mainly in older studies, and clinical practices have changed since that time (40 trials, 3353 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). 
We found only six studies that compared epidural pain relief versus application of local anaesthetic on the body surface to produce peripheral nerve blocks directly into the space around the lungs (intrapleural analgesia) and onto the surgical wound (wound infiltration). These studies provided low‐ or very low‐quality evidence and did not report on many of the outcomes for this review. Study authors reported no heart attacks and no epidural haematomas. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of evidence as moderate, low, or very low. We included too few participants in our review to rule out any differences in the number of patient deaths between epidural analgesia and systemic analgesia, nor to see any increase in epidural haematomas.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
191,"Background
Systemic corticosteroid therapy is central to the management of acute asthma. The use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) may also be beneficial in this setting. 
Objectives
To determine the benefit of ICS for the treatment of patients with acute asthma managed in the emergency department (ED). 
Search methods
We identified controlled clinical trials from the Cochrane Airways Group specialised register of controlled trials. Bibliographies from included studies, known reviews, and texts also were searched. The latest search was September 2012. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs. Studies were included if patients presented to the ED or its equivalent with acute asthma, and were treated with ICS or placebo, in addition to standard therapy. Two review authors independently selected potentially relevant articles, and then independently selected articles for inclusion. Methodological quality was independently assessed by two review authors. There were three different types of studies that were included in this review: 1) studies comparing ICS vs. placebo, with no systemic corticosteroids given to either treatment group, 2) studies comparing ICS vs. placebo, with systemic corticosteroids given to both treatment groups, and 3) studies comparing ICS alone versus systemic corticosteroids. For the analysis, the first two types of studies were included as separate subgroups in the primary analysis (ICS vs. placebo), while the third type of study was included in the secondary analysis (ICS vs. systemic corticosteroid). 
Data collection and analysis
Data were extracted independently by two review authors if the authors were unable to verify the validity of extracted information. Missing data were obtained from the authors or calculated from other data presented in the paper. Where appropriate, individual and pooled dichotomous outcomes were reported as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where appropriate, individual and pooled continuous outcomes were reported as mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% CIs. The primary analysis employed a fixed‐effect model and a random‐effects model was used for sensitivity analysis. Heterogeneity is reported using I‐squared (I2) statistics.

Twenty trials were selected for inclusion in the primary analysis (13 paediatric, seven adult), with a total number of 1403 patients. Patients treated with ICS were less likely to be admitted to hospital (OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.62; 12 studies; 960 patients) and heterogeneity (I2 = 27%) was modest. This represents a reduction from 32 to 17 hospital admissions per 100 patients treated with ICS in comparison with placebo. Subgroup analysis of hospital admissions based on concomitant systemic corticosteroid use revealed that both subgroups indicated benefit from ICS in reducing hospital admissions (ICS and systemic corticosteroid versus systemic corticosteroid: OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.81; 5 studies; N = 433; ICS versus placebo: OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.52; 7 studies; N = 527). However, there was moderate heterogeneity in the subgroup using ICS in addition to systemic steroids (I2 = 52%). Patients receiving ICS demonstrated small, significant improvements in peak expiratory flow (PEF: MD 7%; 95% CI 3% to 11%) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1: MD 6%; 95% CI 2% to 10%) at three to four hours post treatment). Only a small number of studies reported these outcomes such that they could be included in the meta‐analysis and most of the studies in this comparison did not administer systemic corticosteroids to either treatment group. There was no evidence of significant adverse effects from ICS treatment with regard to tremor or nausea and vomiting. In the secondary analysis of studies comparing ICS alone versus systemic corticosteroid alone, heterogeneity among the studies complicated pooling of data or drawing reliable conclusions. 
Authors' conclusions
ICS therapy reduces hospital admissions in patients with acute asthma who are not treated with oral or intravenous corticosteroids. They may also reduce admissions when they are used in addition to systemic corticosteroids; however, the most recent evidence is conflicting. There is insufficient evidence that ICS therapy results in clinically important changes in pulmonary function or clinical scores when used in acute asthma in addition to systemic corticosteroids. Also, there is insufficient evidence that ICS therapy can be used in place of systemic corticosteroid therapy when treating acute asthma. Further research is needed to clarify the most appropriate drug dosage and delivery device, and to define which patients are most likely to benefit from ICS therapy. Use of similar measures and reporting methods of lung function, and a common, validated, clinical score would be helpful in future versions of this meta‐analysis.","Early use of inhaled corticosteroids in the emergency department treatment of acute asthma 
Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in the world. It is estimated that 300 million people of all ages, and all ethnic backgrounds, suffer from asthma, with 1 in every 250 deaths worldwide attributed to asthma. In an asthma attack, the airways (passages to the lungs) narrow from muscle spasm and swelling (inflammation). Corticosteroid drugs can be used to reduce the swelling. Corticosteroids can be inhaled, or taken systemically by mouth (orally) or through a drip into the veins (intravenously). 
Standard treatment for asthma attacks is to administer beta2‐agonists (to open up the airways) and systemic corticosteroids (to reduce the inflammation). The purpose of this review was to determine if the use of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) agents is beneficial in emergency department treatment settings. A total of 90 studies were identified for this review; 20 were deemed relevant and selected for inclusion (13 paediatric, 7 adult), with a total number of 1403 patients. 
This review found that inhaled corticosteroids used alone or in combination with systemic corticosteroids helped to relieve asthma attacks, were well tolerated and had few side effects. However, the most effective drug and dosage are unclear. The studies in the review included a variety of ICSmedications: beclomethasone (Beclovent/Becloforte/QVAR), budesonide (Pulmicort), dexamethasone sodium phosphate, fluticasone propionate (Flovent or Flixotide), Flunisolide (Aerobid) and triamcinolone (Azmacort). The review also found that ICS administered in this setting resulted in fewer hospital admissions. There was a reduction from 32 to 17 hospital admissions per hundred patients treated with ICS agents compared with placebo. At this time there is insufficient evidence to support using ICS agents alone as a replacement for systemic corticosteroid therapy in acute asthma attacks 
However, there are many unanswered questions about the use of ICS in the emergency department treatment setting. Future research should focus on optimal dosage, dosage frequency and delivery device, identification of effective ICS agents, clearly defined outcomes (such as admissions criteria, pulmonary function testing and follow‐up after discharge from emergency departments).",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
192,"Background
Cardenolides are naturally occurring plant toxins which act primarily on the heart. While poisoning with the digitalis cardenolides (digoxin and digitoxin) are reported worldwide, cardiotoxicity from other cardenolides such as the yellow oleander are also a major problem, with tens of thousands of cases of poisoning each year in South Asia. Because cardenolides from these plants are structurally similar, acute poisonings are managed using similar treatments. The benefit of these treatments is of interest, particularly in the context of cost since most poisonings occur in developing countries where resources are very limited. 
Objectives
To determine the efficacy of antidotes for the treatment of acute cardenolide poisoning, in particular atropine, isoprenaline (isoproterenol), multiple‐dose activated charcoal (MDAC), fructose‐1,6‐diphosphate, sodium bicarbonate, magnesium, phenytoin and anti‐digoxin Fab antitoxin. 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Controlled Trials Register of the Cochrane Collaboration, Current Awareness in Clinical Toxicology, Info Trac, www.google.com.au, and Science Citation Index of studies identified by the previous searches. We manually searched the bibliographies of identified articles and personally contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials where antidotes were administered to patients with acute symptomatic cardenolide poisoning were identified. 
Data collection and analysis
We independently extracted data on study design, including the method of randomisation, participant characteristics, type of intervention and outcomes from each study. We independently assessed methodological quality of the included studies. A pooled analysis was not appropriate. 
Main results
Two randomised controlled trials were identified, both were conducted in patients with yellow oleander poisoning. One trial investigated the effect of MDAC on mortality, the relative risk (RR) was 0.31 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.83) indicating a beneficial effect. The second study found a beneficial effect of anti‐digoxin Fab antitoxin on the presence of cardiac dysrhythmias at two hours post‐administration; the RR was 0.60 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.81). Other benefits were also noted in both studies and serious adverse effects were minimal. Studies assessing the effect of antidotes on other cardenolides were not identified. One ongoing study investigating the activated charcoal for acute yellow oleander self‐poisoning was also identified. 
Authors' conclusions
There is some evidence to suggest that MDAC and anti‐digoxin Fab antitoxin may be effective treatments for yellow oleander poisoning. However, the efficacy and indications of these interventions for the treatment of acute digitalis poisoning is uncertain due to the lack of good quality controlled clinical trials. Given pharmacokinetic differences between individual cardenolides, the effect of antidotes administered to patients with yellow oleander poisoning cannot be readily translated to those of other cardenolides. Unfortunately cost limits the use of antidotes such as anti‐digoxin Fab antitoxin in developing countries where cardenolide poisonings are frequent. More research is required using relatively cheap antidotes which may also be effective.","Antidotes for acute cardenolide (cardiac glycoside) poisoning

193,"Background
Dental caries (tooth decay) is one of the commonest diseases which afflicts mankind, and has been estimated to affect up to 80% of people in high‐income countries. Caries adversely affects and progressively destroys the tissues of the tooth, including the dental pulp (nerve), leaving teeth unsightly, weakened and with impaired function. The treatment of lesions of dental caries, which are progressing through dentine and have caused the formation of a cavity, involves the provision of dental restorations (fillings). This review updates the previous version published in 2009. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of adhesive bonding on the in‐service performance and longevity of dental amalgam restorations. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 21 January 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 12), MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to 21 January 2016) and EMBASE via Ovid (1980 to 21 January 2016). We also searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en) (both to 21 January 2016) for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing adhesively bonded versus traditional non‐bonded amalgam restorations in conventional preparations utilising deliberate retention, in adults with permanent molar and premolar teeth suitable for Class I and II amalgam restorations only. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened papers, extracted trial details and assessed the risk of bias in the included study. 
Main results
One trial with 31 patients who received 113 restorations was included. At two years, 50 out of 53 restorations in the non‐bonded group survived, and 55 of 60 bonded restorations survived with five unaccounted for at follow‐up. Post‐insertion sensitivity was not significantly different (P > 0.05) at baseline or two‐year follow‐up. No fractures of tooth tissue were reported and there was no significant difference between the groups or matched pairs of restorations in their marginal adaptation (P > 0.05). 
Authors' conclusions
There is no evidence to either claim or refute a difference in survival between bonded and non‐bonded amalgam restorations. This review only found one under‐reported trial. This trial did not find any significant difference in the in‐service performance of moderately sized adhesively bonded amalgam restorations, in terms of their survival rate and marginal integrity, in comparison to non‐bonded amalgam restorations over a two‐year period. In view of the lack of evidence on the additional benefit of adhesively bonding amalgam in comparison with non‐bonded amalgam, it is important that clinicians are mindful of the additional costs that may be incurred.","Adhesively or non‐adhesively bonded amalgam restorations for dental caries
Review question 
Does adding adhesive designed to bond dental amalgam fillings to teeth make the fillings perform better and last longer than fillings without it? 
Background 
Tooth decay is a common problem affecting both children and adults. Cavities form in the teeth by the action of acid produced by bacteria present in dental plaque or biofilm. 
A number of techniques and a variety of materials can be used to restore or fill teeth affected by decay. One of the most commonly used and comparatively cheap filling materials is dental amalgam (a mixture of mercury and metal alloy particles). The review authors sought to evaluate the added benefit of using an adhesive to bond amalgam to tooth structure to see if bonded fillings would last longer and perform better. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence in this review, carried out by authors from the Cochrane Oral Health Group, is up to date as of 21 January 2016. One trial with 31 participants (21 male, 10 female) who received 113 restorations was included. The study took place in the UK in a university dental hospital environment. Participants were chosen who were suitable for routine dental treatment. The comparison made was between teeth in the same person on opposite sides of the mouth, one treated with the bonded technique, the other without. At two years no difference was found. 
Key results 
Only one study, which provided limited information, showed that for medium sized fillings there was no difference in sensitivity between the bonded and non‐bonded fillings after their placement and that bonding of amalgam to tooth did not have any effect on the survival of the filling over a two‐year period. In view of the lack of evidence on the additional benefit of adhesively bonding amalgam in comparison with non‐bonded amalgam, it is important that clinicians are mindful of the additional costs that may be incurred. 
There is a wide range of bonding agents developed over a number of years that are available for use by dentists. It is therefore very disappointing that there is such a lack of suitable trials of their effectiveness. 
Quality of the evidence 
There was only one included study and it provides insufficient evidence that adhesively bonded amalgam restorations perform any better than non‐adhesively bonded amalgam restoration when followed up for two years. 
The quality of the evidence is low. In addition, the university dental clinic setting may mean that the participants are not representative of the general population and the treatment offered not typical of that in general dental practice so the results may not be generalisable.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
194,"Background
The World Health Organization (WHO) in 2015 stated atovaquone‐proguanil can be used in travellers, and is an option in malaria‐endemic areas in combination with artesunate, as an alternative treatment where first‐line artemisinin‐based combination therapy (ACT) is not available or effective. This review is an update of a Cochrane Review undertaken in 2005. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of atovaquone‐proguanil (alone and in combination with artemisinin drugs) versus other antimalarial drugs for treating uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in adults and children. 
Search methods
The date of the last trial search was 30 January 2020. Search locations for published trials included the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. To include recently published and unpublished trials, we also searched ClinicalTrials.gov, the metaRegister of Controlled Trials and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting efficacy and safety data for atovaquone‐proguanil or atovaquone‐proguanil with a partner drug compared with at least one other antimalarial drug for treating uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum infection. 
Data collection and analysis
For this update, two review authors re‐extracted data and assessed certainty of evidence. We meta‐analyzed data to calculate risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for treatment failures between comparisons, and for safety outcomes between and across comparisons. Outcome measures include unadjusted treatment failures and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)‐adjusted treatment failures. PCR adjustment differentiates new infection from recrudescent infection. 
Main results
Seventeen RCTs met our inclusion criteria providing 4763 adults and children from Africa, South‐America, and South‐East Asia. Eight trials reported PCR‐adjusted data to distinguish between new and recrudescent infection during the follow‐up period. In this abstract, we report only the comparisons against the three WHO‐recommended antimalarials which were included within these trials. 
There were two comparisons with artemether‐lumefantrine, one trial from 2008 in Ethiopia with 60 participants had two failures with atovaquone‐proguanil compared to none with artemether‐lumefantrine (PCR‐adjusted treatment failures at day 28). A second trial from 2012 in Colombia with 208 participants had one failure in each arm (PCR‐adjusted treatment failures at day 42). 
There was only one comparison with artesunate‐amodiaquine from a 2014 trial conducted in Cameroon. There were six failures with atovaquone‐proguanil at day 28 and two with artesunate‐amodiaquine (PCR‐adjusted treatment failures at day 28: 9.4% with atovaquone‐proguanil compared to 2.9% with artesunate‐amodiaquine; RR 3.19, 95% CI 0.67 to 15.22; 1 RCT, 132 participants; low‐certainty evidence), although there was a similar number of PCR‐unadjusted treatment failures (9 (14.1%) with atovaquone‐proguanil and 8 (11.8%) with artesunate‐amodiaquine; RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.91; 1 RCT, 132 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
There were two comparisons with artesunate‐mefloquine from a 2012 trial in Colombia and a 2002 trial in Thailand where there are high levels of multi‐resistant malaria. There were similar numbers of PCR‐adjusted treatment failures between groups at day 42 (2.7% with atovaquone‐proguanil compared to 2.4% with artesunate‐mefloquine; RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.34; 2 RCTs, 1168 participants; high‐certainty evidence). There were also similar PCR‐unadjusted treatment failures between groups (5.3% with atovaquone‐proguanil compared to 6.6% with artesunate‐mefloquine; RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.3; 1 RCT, 1063 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
When atovaquone‐proguanil was combined with artesunate, there were fewer treatment failures with and without PCR‐adjustment at day 28 (PCR‐adjusted treatment failures at day 28: 2.16% with atovaquone‐proguanil compared to no failures with artesunate‐atovaquone‐proguanil; RR 5.14, 95% CI 0.61 to 43.52; 2 RCTs, 375 participants, low‐certainty evidence) and day 42 (PCR‐adjusted treatment failures at day 42: 3.82% with atovaquone‐proguanil compared to 2.05% with artesunate‐atovaquone‐proguanil (RR 1.84, 95% CI 0.95 to 3.56; 2 RCTs, 1258 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence). In the 2002 trial in Thailand, there were fewer treatment failures in the artesunate‐atovaquone‐proguanil group compared to the atovaquone‐proguanil group at day 42 with PCR‐adjustment. 
Whilst there were some small differences in which adverse events were more frequent in the atovaquone‐proguanil groups compared to comparator drugs, there were no recurrent associations to suggest that atovaquone‐proguanil is strongly associated with any specific adverse event. 
Authors' conclusions
Atovaquone‐proguanil was effective against uncomplicated P falciparum malaria, although in some instances treatment failure rates were between 5% and 10%. The addition of artesunate to atovaquone‐proguanil may reduce treatment failure rates. Artesunate‐atovaquone‐proguanil and the development of parasite resistance may represent an area for further research.","What are the benefits and risks of atovaquone‐proguanil for treating uncomplicated malaria caused by the Plasmodium falciparum parasite? 
What is the aim of this review? 
The most common, and most serious, type of malaria is caused by Plasmodium falciparum. In its mild (uncomplicated) form, the symptoms are fever, headaches, muscle pain, and vomiting. The disease can become severe and life‐threatening if it is not treated soon enough or with the right medicines. 
This review aimed to find out whether atovaquone‐proguanil is effective and safe for treating uncomplicated cases of P falciparum malaria. We aimed to achieve this by comparing the results of studies that had compared atovaquone‐proguanil to other malaria treatments. 
Key messages 
Atovaquone‐proguanil is as effective for treating uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria as artesunate‐mefloquine. It may be less effective than artemether‐lumefantrine, artesunate‐amodiaquine, and artesunate‐atovaquone‐proguanil, though more robust evidence is needed to confirm this. Side effects seem similar with atovaquone‐proguanil. 
What was studied in this review? 
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends treating uncomplicated malaria with oral (by mouth) artemisinin‐based combination medicines (called ACTs). 
ACTs are not always available worldwide and, in some places, Plasmodium falciparum is becoming resistant to recommended treatments (the medicines stop working). We looked at the evidence about the benefits and harms of combinations of medicines that are not artemisinin‐based, but contain atovaquone‐proguanil. This is an oral treatment commonly used by people from non‐malaria areas to prevent them catching malaria when they travel to malaria areas. We wanted to find out whether it works as well for treating uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria as ACTs and other malaria treatments. 
We searched for randomized controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared atovaquone‐proguanil against other malaria treatments. These studies provide the most robust evidence about the effects of a treatment. We compared results, summarized the evidence, and rated our confidence in the evidence. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We found 17 studies involving 4763 adults and children in Africa, South America, and South East Asia. People were followed for 28 days to one year. 
Fifteen studies compared atovaquone‐proguanil against 12 different antimalarial treatments (ACTs in five studies; other therapies that combined several medicines in two studies; single medicines in nine studies). 
Five studies compared atovaquone‐proguanil plus another medicine (artesunate or chloroquine) against atovaquone‐proguanil alone (three studies); atovaquone‐proguanil plus a different medicine (one study); a combination of therapies that did not include atovaquone‐proguanil (one study); or single medicines (two studies). 
In 15 studies, the researchers and people who were treated knew which medicines participants received. Pharmaceutical companies funded 10 studies. 
Atovaquone‐proguanil against ACTs recommended by the WHO 
Atovaquone‐proguanil may work less well to clear Plasmodiumfalciparum parasites from the blood or prevent them from returning (treatment success) than artemether‐lumefantrine (rates of success compared 28 and 42 days after treatment; one study). However this evidence was based on one small study. 
Atovaquone‐proguanil may work as well as, or less well than, artesunate‐amodiaquine depending on whether new infections appearing after the start of treatment were counted or not (rates of success compared three and 28 days after treatment; one study). However this evidence was based on one small study of children aged under five years. 
When new infections after the start of treatment were excluded, there is strong evidence of little to no difference in treatment success between atovaquone‐proguanil and artesunate‐mefloquine after 42 days (two studies). When new infections were counted, atovaquone‐proguanil may be better than artesunate‐mefloquine, but this evidence was based on the imprecise results of one study. 
Atovaquone‐proguanil against atovaquone‐proguanil plus artesunate 
Compared to atovaquone‐proguanil plus artesunate, atovaquone‐proguanil may be less successful at treating uncomplicated malaria after three and 28 days, however this evidence is based on the results of two small studies. It is probably less successful at treating uncomplicated malaria after 42 days (two studies). 
Side effects 
Studies reported several side effects, such as nausea and vomiting, or headaches. Overall, they were similar between groups.

195,"Background
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is carbohydrate intolerance first recognised during pregnancy and associated with complications for mothers and babies. Probiotics are naturally occurring micro‐organisms, which when ingested in adequate amounts, may confer health benefits. Evidence of the role of probiotics as treatment for GDM is limited. 
Objectives
To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of probiotics in treating women with GDM on maternal and infant outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (24 July 2019), and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the use of probiotics versus placebo/standard care for the treatment of GDM. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, checked data accuracy, and assessed risk of bias of included trials. The certainty of evidence for selected maternal and infant/child outcomes was assessed using GRADE. 
Main results
Nine RCTs (695 pregnant women with GDM) comparing probiotics versus placebo were identified. The overall risk of bias in the nine RCTs was low to unclear and the evidence was downgraded for imprecision due to the small numbers of women participating in the trials. The trials were carried out in hospitals and universities in Iran (seven trials), Thailand (one trial) and Ireland (one trial). All trials compared probiotics with placebo. 
Maternal outcomes 
We are uncertain if probiotics have any effect compared with placebo on hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, (risk ratio (RR) 1.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 3.53; participants = 256; studies = 3; low‐certainty evidence) and mode of birth as caesareans (average RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.35; participants = 267; studies = 3; low‐certainty evidence) because the certainty of evidence is low and the 95% CIs span possible benefit and possible harm. 
No trials reported primary outcomes of: mode of birth as vaginal/assisted and subsequent development of type 2 diabetes. 
We are uncertain if probiotics have any effect compared with placebo on induction of labour (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.37; participants = 127; studies = 1; very low‐certainty evidence). 
For other secondary maternal outcomes, we are uncertain if there are differences between probiotics and placebo for: postpartum haemorrhage; weight gain during pregnancy intervention and total gestational weight gain; fasting plasma glucose and need for extra pharmacotherapy (insulin). Probiotics may be associated with a slight reduction in triglycerides and total cholesterol. 
In probiotics compared with placebo, there was evidence of reduction in markers for insulin resistance (HOMA‐IR) and HOMA‐B; and insulin secretion. There was also an increase in quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI). 
Probiotics were associated with minor benefits in relevant bio‐markers with evidence of a reduction in inflammatory markers high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein (hs‐CRP), interleukin 6 (IL‐6), and marker of oxidative stress malondialdehyde; and an increase in antioxidant total glutathione, but we are uncertain if there is any difference in total antioxidant capacity. 
No trials reported secondary outcomes: perineal trauma, postnatal weight retention or return to pre‐pregnancy weight and postnatal depression. 
Infant/child/adult outcomes 
We are uncertain if probiotics have any effect, compared with placebo, on the risk of large‐for‐gestational‐age babies (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.52; participants = 174; studies = 2; low‐certainty evidence) or infant hypoglycaemia (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.84; participants = 177; studies = 3; low‐certainty evidence) because the certainty of evidence is low and the 95% CIs span possible benefit and possible harm. 
No trials reported primary outcomes of: perinatal (fetal/neonatal) mortality; or neurosensory disability. 
For other secondary outcomes, we are uncertain if there is any difference between probiotics and placebo in gestational age at birth, preterm birth, macrosomia, birthweight, head circumference, length, infant hypoglycaemia, and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions. 
There was evidence of a reduction in infant hyperbilirubinaemia with probiotics compared with placebo. 
No trials reported secondary outcomes: infant adiposity, and later childhood adiposity.
There were no adverse events reported by any of the trials.
Authors' conclusions
Low‐certainty evidence means we are not certain if there is any difference between probiotic and placebo groups in maternal hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, caesareans; and large‐for‐gestational‐age babies. 
There were no adverse events reported by the trials.
Due to the variability of probiotics used and small sample sizes of trials, evidence from this review has limited ability to inform practice. Well‐designed adequately‐powered trials are needed to identify whether probiotics may improve maternal blood glucose levels and/or infant/child/adult outcomes; and whether they can be used to treat GDM.","Probiotics as an added treatment for gestational diabetes to improve mother and baby outcomes 
What is the issue? 
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is carbohydrate intolerance resulting in high blood glucose levels, first recognised during pregnancy. Pregnant women with GDM are at risk of high blood pressure, labour induction, and caesareans. Their babies are at risk of being born large, birth difficulties, respiratory distress, low blood glucose at birth and jaundice that can cause brain injury. There is increased risks of having long‐term diabetes in the mother, and the baby being overweight. Probiotics are micro‐organisms naturally in food and are in fermented milk, yogurt, or capsules. There are many different probiotics; the two most used are Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, and if consumed in adequate amounts may confer health benefits. 
Why is this important? 
Probiotics need to be safe and maternal blood glucose levels carefully managed during pregnancy. 
Women with GDM may receive dietary and physical activity education with monitoring blood glucose levels as initial management. When blood glucose levels are above a certain threshold, women with GDM are prescribed glucose‐lowering medications including metformin and/or insulin. This review aimed to determine the safety and effectiveness of probiotics in treating women with GDM. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for evidence for randomised controlled trials (latest July 2019). We identified nine studies, involving 695 women with GDM. All trials compared probiotics with placebo. The certainty of the evidence was assessed as very low or low. The overall risk of bias was low to unclear. 
Seven trials were conducted in Iran; one in Thailand, and one in Ireland. Trials took place in hospitals and universities. 
We are uncertain if there is any difference between probiotic and placebo in rates of: high blood‐pressure disorders (three studies, 256 participants, low‐certainty evidence); caesarean section (three studies, 267 women, low‐certainty evidence); and large‐for‐gestational‐age babies (two studies, 174 participants, low‐certainty evidence). 
We are uncertain if there is any difference between probiotic and placebo for induction of labour (one study, 127 participants, very low‐certainty evidence) and low blood glucose levels in the newborn (three studies, 177 participants, low‐certainty evidence). We are also uncertain if there is any difference between probiotics and placebo for heavy bleeding immediately after birth, weight gain during pregnancy or total gestational weight gain. 
We are uncertain if there is any difference in fasting blood glucose between probiotics and placebo (seven studies, 554 participants). Probiotics may be assoicated with a slight reduction in triglycerides and total cholesterol (four studies, 320 participants). There was reduction in insulin secretion with probiotics (seven studies, 505 participants). One trial (60 participants) showed no difference between groups in need for insulin. 
Biomarkers, did show a reduction in insulin resistance (HOMA‐IR), (seven studies, 505 participants) and insulin resistance and β cell function (HOMA‐B) (two studies,130 participants) with probiotics. Quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) increased (four studies, 276 participants) with probiotics. 
Inflammatory markers, hs‐CRP (four studies, 248 participants) and interleukin 6 (two studies, 128 participants) were reduced with probiotics. Antioxidant total glutathione was increased (two studies, 120 participants) and the oxidative stress biomarker malondialdehyde was reduced with probiotics (three studies, 176 participants). We are uncertain if there is any difference in total antioxidant capacity (four studies 266 participants). 
For the newborn baby, we are uncertain if there is any difference between groups for: birthweight, gestational age at birth, preterm births, large babies, head circumference and length scores, or need for admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. The number of babies with high levels of bilirubin was reduced with probiotics. 
No adverse events were reported by the trials.
What does this mean? 
Based on the clinical trials available, the evidence is limited to support the use of probiotics as treatment for women with GDM to improve pregnancy outcomes for mothers and their babies. Larger well‐designed randomised controlled trials are needed to assess the effects of probiotics on management of glucose levels and when available, they can be included in the update of this review.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
196,"Background
Gastrointestinal paralysis, nausea and vomiting and pain are major clinical problems following abdominal surgery. Anaesthetic and analgesic techniques that reduce pain and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), while preventing or reducing postoperative ileus, may reduce postoperative morbidity, duration of hospitalization and hospital costs. This review was first published in 2001 and was updated by new review authors in 2016. 
Objectives
To compare effects of postoperative epidural analgesia with local anaesthetics versus postoperative systemic or epidural opioids in terms of return of gastrointestinal transit, postoperative pain control, postoperative vomiting, incidence of anastomotic leak, length of hospital stay and costs after abdominal surgery. 
Search methods
We identified trials by conducting computerized searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2014, Issue 12), MEDLINE (from 1950 to December 2014) and EMBASE (from 1974 to December 2014) and by checking the reference lists of trials retained. When we reran the search in February 2016, we added 16 potential new studies of interest to the list of ‘Studies awaiting classification' and will incorporate these studies into formal review findings during the next review update. 
Selection criteria
We included parallel randomized controlled trials comparing effects of postoperative epidural local anaesthetic versus regimens based on systemic or epidural opioids. 
Data collection and analysis
We rated the quality of studies by using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. Two review authors independently extracted data and judged the quality of evidence according to the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group) scale. 
Main results
We included 128 trials with 8754 participants in the review, and 94 trials with 5846 participants in the analysis. Trials included in the review were funded as follows: charity (n = 19), departmental resources (n = 8), governmental sources (n = 15) and industry (in part or in total) (n = 15). The source of funding was not specified for the other studies. 
Results of 22 trials including 1138 participants show that an epidural containing a local anaesthetic will decrease the time required for return of gastrointestinal transit as measured by time to first flatus after an abdominal surgery (standardized mean difference (SMD) ‐1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.71 to ‐0.86; high quality of evidence; equivalent to 17.5 hours). The effect is proportionate to the concentration of local anaesthetic used. A total of 28 trials including 1559 participants reported a decrease in time to first faeces (stool) (SMD ‐0.67, 95% CI ‐0.86 to ‐0.47; low quality of evidence; equivalent to 22 hours). Thirty‐five trials including 2731 participants found that pain on movement at 24 hours after surgery was also reduced (SMD ‐0.89, 95% CI ‐1.08 to ‐0.70; moderate quality of evidence; equivalent to 2.5 on scale from 0 to 10). From findings of 22 trials including 1154 participants we did not find a difference in the incidence of vomiting within 24 hours (risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.23; low quality of evidence). From investigators in 17 trials including 848 participants we did not find a difference in the incidence of gastrointestinal anastomotic leak (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.32; low quality of evidence). Researchers in 30 trials including 2598 participants noted that epidural analgesia reduced length of hospital stay for an open surgery (SMD ‐0.20, 95% CI ‐0.35 to ‐0.04; very low quality of evidence; equivalent to one day). Data on costs were very limited. 
Authors' conclusions
An epidural containing a local anaesthetic, with or without the addition of an opioid, accelerates the return of gastrointestinal transit (high quality of evidence). An epidural containing a local anaesthetic with an opioid decreases pain after abdominal surgery (moderate quality of evidence). We did not find a difference in the incidence of vomiting or anastomotic leak (low quality of evidence). For open surgery, an epidural containing a local anaesthetic would reduce the length of hospital stay (very low quality of evidence).","Epidural local anaesthetics for prevention of postoperative gastrointestinal paralysis, vomiting and pain after abdominal surgery 
Background 
Pain and gut paralysis (movement failure) commonly occur after abdominal surgery. Following laparotomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy and colectomy, approximately 10.3% of patients will have temporary gut paralysis. This may prolong length of hospital stay and may increase costs of the procedure. Among the possible ways to treat pain after abdominal surgery are an epidural and injections of opioids (morphine‐like substances or pain killers). An epidural consists of inserting a catheter (a narrow tube) into the epidural space (the virtual space surrounding the membrane that contains cerebrospinal fluid and the spinal cord) and infusing a solution of local anaesthetic (substance that cuts pain transmission to the brain) (alone or in combination with opioids) to anaesthetize the abdomen. This Cochrane review compares the effects of an epidural containing a local anaesthetic with those of an opioid‐based regimen on the postoperative course after abdominal surgery. 
Search dates 
The evidence is current to December 2014. When we reran the search in February 2016, we added 16 potential new studies of interest to the list of ‘Studies awaiting classification' and will incorporate them into formal review findings during the next review update. 
Study characteristics 
We included 128 trials with 8754 participants of both sexes aged between 33 and 76 years in the review and 94 trials with 5846 participants in the analysis. Three trials reported that their trial was officially registered. 
Study funding sources  
Trials included in the review were funded as follows: charity (n = 19), departmental resources (n = 8), governmental sources (n = 15) and industry (in part or in total) (n = 15). The source of funding was not specified for the other trials. 
Key results 
We found that an epidural containing a local anaesthetic reduces the time required for return of gut function compared with an opioid‐based regimen (equivalent to 17 hours). An epidural providing a local anaesthetic and an opioid also reduce pain (equivalent to a reduction of 2.5 on a scale from 0 to 10 for pain on movement at 24 hours after surgery) and time spent in hospital for open surgery (equivalent to one day). We found no evidence that an epidural with a local anaesthetic would affect the incidence of vomiting or poor healing of the gut. 
Quality of evidence 
We rated the quality of the evidence as high for return of gastrointestinal function, moderate for pain treatment, low for no effect on vomiting or healing of the gut and very low for reduced time spent in the hospital after open surgery.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
197,"Background
Depression is common in people with non‐communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and chronic respiratory conditions. The co‐existence of depression and NCDs may affect health behaviours, compliance with treatment, physiological factors, and quality of life. This in turn is associated with worse outcomes for both conditions. Behavioural activation is not currently indicated for the treatment of depression in this population in the UK, but is increasingly being used to treat depression in adults. 
Objectives
To examine the effects of behavioural activation compared with any control group for the treatment of depression in adults with NCDs. 
To examine the effects of behavioural activation compared with each control group separately (no treatment, waiting list, other psychological therapy, pharmacological treatment, or any other type of treatment as usual) for the treatment of depression in adults with NCDs. 
Search methods
We searched CCMD‐CTR, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases, and two trial registers on 4 October 2019 to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of behavioural activation for depression in participants with NCDs, together with grey literature and reference checking. We applied no restrictions on date, language, or publication status to the searches. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs of behavioural activation for the treatment of depression in adults with one of four NCDs: cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and chronic respiratory conditions. Only participants with a formal diagnosis of both depression and an NCD were eligible. Studies were included if behavioural activation was the main component of the intervention. We included studies with any comparator that was not behavioural activation, and regardless of reported outcomes. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane, including independent screening of titles/abstracts and full‐text manuscripts, data extraction, and risk of bias assessments in duplicate. Where necessary, we contacted study authors for more information. 
Main results
We included two studies, contributing data from 181 participants to the analyses.
Both studies recruited participants from US hospital clinics; one included people who were recovering from a stroke and the other women with breast cancer. For both studies, the intervention consisted of eight weeks of face‐to‐face behavioural therapy, with one study comparing to poststroke treatment as usual and the other comparing to problem‐solving therapy. 
Both studies were at risk of performance bias and potential conflict of interest arising from author involvement in the development of the intervention. For one study, risks of selection bias and reporting bias were unclear and the study was judged at high risk of attrition bias. 
Treatment efficacy (remission) was greater for behavioural activation than for comparators in the short term (risk ratio (RR) 1.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 2.38; low‐certainty evidence) and medium term (RR 1.76, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.08; moderate‐certainty evidence), but these estimates lacked precision and effects were reduced in the long term (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.23; moderate‐certainty evidence). We found no evidence of a difference in treatment acceptability in the short term (RR 1.81, 95% CI 0.68 to 4.82) and medium term (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.25 to 3.10) (low‐certainty evidence). 
There was no evidence of a difference in depression symptoms between behavioural activation and comparators (short term: MD –1.15, 95% CI –2.71 to 0.41; low‐certainty evidence). One study found no difference for quality of life (short term: MD 0.40, 95% CI –0.16 to 0.96; low‐certainty evidence), functioning (short term: MD 2.70, 95% CI –6.99 to 12.39; low‐certainty evidence), and anxiety symptoms (short term: MD –1.70, 95% CI –4.50 to 1.10; low‐certainty evidence). 
Neither study reported data on adverse effects.
Authors' conclusions
Evidence from this review was not sufficient to draw conclusions on the efficacy and acceptability of behavioural activation for the treatment of depression in adults with NCDs. A future review may wish to include, or focus on, studies of people with subthreshold depression or depression symptoms without a formal diagnosis, as this may inform whether behavioural activation could be used to treat mild or undiagnosed (or both) depressive symptoms in people with NCDs. Evidence from low‐resource settings including low‐ and middle‐income countries, for which behavioural activation may offer a feasible alternative to other treatments for depression, would be of interest.","Behavioural activation therapy for depression in adults with long‐term physical conditions
Depression is common in adults with long‐term physical conditions. Long‐term physical illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, or chronic respiratory conditions, can impact on mental health. Mental health problems can also affect how people cope with a physical condition. Behavioural activation is a type of talking therapy used to treat depression in adults and it could be an alternative to other psychological therapies or medication. This review assesses the effects of behavioural activation on depression for people with long‐term physical conditions. 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of behavioural activation with adults who were diagnosed with depression and cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, or a chronic respiratory condition. An RCT is a study with a control group, in which participants are allocated to the treatment and control groups at random. We searched a variety of online databases, including regional databases and trial registries. The search, conducted on 4 October 2019, identified 6066 records. After screening records, we included two studies in this review and 181 participants contributed data to the analyses. 
Both studies recruited participants from US hospitals. One study included participants recovering from a stroke and the other included women with breast cancer. In both studies, participants received behavioural activation delivered in eight weekly, face‐to‐face sessions. One study compared behavioural activation with poststroke treatment as usual, while the other compared behavioural activation with problem‐solving therapy, a talking therapy. 
Low to moderate‐certainty evidence suggested that behavioural activation may be more effective in the treatment of depression than included comparators, but these estimates were imprecise and effects were reduced in the longer term. There was no evidence of any differences between groups in the number of people who dropped out of the studies, depression symptoms, quality of life, physical functioning, or anxiety symptoms. The studies did not report on side effects during the study period. 
There were several limitations to the included studies. In both studies, participants were aware of the treatment they received. Also, researchers were involved in the design of the intervention in both studies, and may, therefore, have had an interest in a favourable outcome for behavioural activation. In one study, missing data caused by participants dropping out of the study may have influenced results. 
We did not find enough evidence in this review to know whether behavioural activation should be used to treat depression in adults with long‐term physical conditions.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
198,"Background
Asthma is the most common respiratory disorder complicating pregnancy, and is associated with a range of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. There is strong evidence however, that the adequate control of asthma can improve health outcomes for mothers and their babies. Despite known risks of poorly controlled asthma during pregnancy, a large proportion of women have sub‐optimal asthma control, due to concerns surrounding risks of pharmacological agents, and uncertainties regarding the effectiveness and safety of different management strategies. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of interventions (pharmacologic and non‐pharmacologic) for managing women's asthma in pregnancy on maternal and fetal/infant outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (2 June 2014) and the Cochrane Airways Group's Trials Register (4 June 2014). 
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing any intervention used to manage asthma in pregnancy, with placebo, no intervention, or an alternative intervention. We included pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions (including combined interventions). Cluster‐randomised trials were eligible for inclusion (but none were identified). Cross‐over trials were not eligible for inclusion. 
We included multi‐armed trials along with two‐armed trials. We also included studies published as abstracts only. 
Data collection and analysis
At least two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. 
Main results
We included eight trials in this review, involving 1181 women and their babies. Overall we judged two trials to be at low risk of bias, two to be of unclear risk of bias, and four to be at moderate risk of bias. 
Five trials assessed pharmacological agents, including inhaled corticosteroids (beclomethasone or budesonide), inhaled magnesium sulphate, intravenous theophylline, and inhaled beclomethasone verus oral theophylline. Three trials assessed non‐pharmacological interventions, including a fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO)‐based algorithm versus a clinical guideline‐based algorithm to adjust inhaled corticosteroid therapy, a pharmacist‐led multi‐disciplinary approach to management versus standard care, and progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) versus sham training. 
The eight included trials were assessed under seven separate comparisons.
Pharmacological interventions 
Primary outcomes: one trial suggested that inhaled magnesium sulphate in addition to usual treatment could reduce exacerbation frequency in acute asthma (mean difference (MD) ‐2.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐3.21 to ‐2.39; 60 women). One trial assessing the addition of intravenous theophylline to standard care in acute asthma did not report on exacerbations (65 women). No clear difference was shown in the risk of exacerbations with the use of inhaled beclomethasone in addition to usual treatment for maintenance therapy in one trial (risk ratio (RR) 0.36; 95% CI 0.13 to 1.05; 60 women); a second trial also showed no difference, however data were not clearly reported to allow inclusion in a meta‐analysis. No difference was shown when inhaled beclomethasone was compared with oral theophylline for maintenance therapy (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.59 to 1.33; one trial, 385 women). None of these trials reported on neonatal intensive care admissions. 
Secondary outcomes: inhaled magnesium sulphate in acute asthma was shown to improve lung function measures (one trial, 60 women); intravenous theophylline in acute asthma was not associated with benefits (one trial, 65 women). No clear differences were seen with the addition of inhaled corticosteroids to routine treatment in three trials (374 women). While inhaled beclomethasone, compared with oral theophylline, significantly reduced treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects in one trial (384 women), no other differences were observed, except for higher treatment adherence with theophylline. Four of the five trials did not report on adverse effects. 
Non‐pharmacological interventions 
Primary outcomes: in one trial, the use of a FENO‐based algorithm was shown to significantly reduce asthma exacerbations (RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.90; 220 women); and a trend towards fewer neonatal hospitalisations was observed (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.21 to 1.02; 214 infants). No exacerbations occurred in one trial assessing pharmacist‐led management; this approach did not reduce neonatal intensive care admissions (RR 1.50; 95% CI 0.27 to 8.32; 58 infants). One trial (64 women) assessing PMR did not report on exacerbations or neonatal intensive care admissions. 
Secondary outcomes: the use of a FENO‐based algorithm to adjust therapy led to some improvements in quality of life scores, as well as more frequent use of inhaled corticosteroids and long‐acting β‐agonists, and less frequent use of short‐acting β‐agonists (one trial, 220 women). The FENO‐based algorithm was associated with fewer infants with recurrent episodes of bronchiolitis in their first year of life, and a trend towards fewer episodes of croup for infants. Pharmacist‐led management improved asthma control scores at six months (one trial, 60 women); PMR improved lung function and quality of life measures (one trial, 64 women). No other differences between comparisons were observed. 
Authors' conclusions
Based on eight included trials, of moderate quality overall, no firm conclusions about optimal interventions for managing asthma in pregnancy can be made. Five trials assessing pharmacological interventions did not provide clear evidence of benefits or harms to support or refute current practice. While inhaled magnesium sulphate for acute asthma was shown to reduce exacerbations, this was in one small trial of unclear quality, and thus this finding should be interpreted with caution. Three trials assessing non‐pharmacological interventions provided some support for the use of such strategies, however were not powered to detect differences in important maternal and infant outcomes. While a FENO‐based algorithm reduced exacerbations, the effects on perinatal outcomes were less certain, and thus widespread implementation is not yet appropriate. Similarly, though positive effects on asthma control were shown with PMR and pharmacist‐led management, the evidence to date is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. 
In view of the limited evidence base, further randomised trials are required to determine the most effective and safe interventions for asthma in pregnancy. Future trials must be sufficiently powered, and well‐designed, to allow differences in important outcomes for mothers and babies to be detected. The impact on health services requires evaluation. Any further trials assessing pharmacological interventions should assess novel agents or those used in current practice. Encouragingly, at least five trials have been identified as planned or underway.","Interventions for managing asthma in pregnancy
Asthma is the most common disorder of the respiratory system (the organs that help you breathe) in pregnancy, affecting up to one in eight women. During pregnancy asthma can improve, worsen or remain unchanged. Poorly controlled asthma may lead to complications for mothers including pre‐eclampsia (high blood pressure and protein in the urine), gestational diabetes (high blood glucose) and caesarean birth; complications for babies may include death, preterm birth (before 37 weeks of pregnancy) and being born low birthweight. Maintaining adequate control of asthma during pregnancy, including effective management and prevention of exacerbations, is the goal of management. In pregnancy, women may be concerned about risks of taking medications, and their health professionals may be uncertain about best management strategies. 
This review aimed to assess how effective and safe different interventions are for managing asthma during pregnancy. We were able to include eight randomised controlled trials involving 1181 women and their babies. The trials were of moderate quality overall. Five trials assessed medications. Inhaled magnesium sulphate helped to reduce further exacerbations for women with acute asthma, and helped to improve their lung function (one trial of unclear quality, 60 women). For ongoing therapy for pregnant women with stable asthma, the effect of inhaled corticosteroids on asthma exacerbations was not clear (two trials, 155 women; but data only analysed from one trial, 60 women); no difference was seen in the chance of exacerbations when inhaled corticosteroids were compared with oral theophylline, however more women receiving theophylline stopped treatment because of side effects (one trial, 385 women). Three trials assessed non‐drug interventions. Adjusting women's asthma medications according to how much nitric oxide they exhaled (their fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO)) was shown to reduce exacerbations and improve their quality of life (one trial, 220 women). Progressive muscle relaxation improved women's lung function and quality of life (one trial, 64 women), and asthma management led by a pharmacist helped to improve asthma control (one trial, 60 women). 
Overall, we did not find enough evidence of benefits and harms from the randomised trials to be sure about the best way to manage asthma in pregnancy, although some interventions were promising. We need larger, high‐quality trials, which should report on important health outcomes for mothers and babies, including longer‐term outcomes for babies into childhood and adulthood. Five trials are currently being planned or are underway assessing interventions for asthma in pregnancy.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
199,"Background
Long‐term physical conditions affect 10% to 12% of children and adolescents worldwide; these individuals are at greater risk of developing psychological problems, particularly anxiety and depression. Access to face‐to‐face treatment for such problems is often limited, and available interventions usually have not been tested with this population. As technology improves, e‐health interventions (delivered via digital means, such as computers and smart phones and ranging from simple text‐based programmes through to multimedia and interactive programmes, serious games, virtual reality and biofeedback programmes) offer a potential solution to address the psychological needs of this group of young people. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of e‐health interventions in comparison with attention placebos, psychological placebos, treatment as usual, waiting‐list controls, or non‐psychological treatments for treating anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group's Controlled Trials Register (CCMDTR to May 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 8, 2017), Web of Science (1900 ‐ 18 August 2016, updated 31 August 2017) and Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO (cross‐search 2016 to 18 Aug 2017). We hand‐searched relevant conference proceedings, reference lists of included articles, and the grey literature to May 2016. We also searched international trial registries to identify unpublished or ongoing trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐randomised trials, and cross‐over trials of e‐health interventions for treating any type of long‐term physical condition in children and adolescents (aged 0 to 18 years), and that measured changes in symptoms or diagnoses of anxiety, depression, or subthreshold depression. We defined long‐term physical conditions as those that were more than three‐months' duration. We assessed symptoms of anxiety and depression using patient‐ or clinician‐administered validated rating scales based on DSM III, IV or 5 (American Psychological Association 2013), or ICD 9 or 10 criteria (World Health Organization 1992). Formal depressive and anxiety disorders were diagnosed using structured clinical interviews. Attention placebo, treatment as usual, waiting list, psychological placebo, and other non‐psychological therapies were eligible comparators. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently reviewed titles, abstracts, and full‐text articles; discrepancies were resolved through discussion or addressed by a third author. When available, we used odds ratio (OR) to compare dichotomous data and standardised mean differences (SMD) to analyse continuous data, both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We undertook meta‐analysis when treatments, participants, and the underlying clinical question were adequately similar. Otherwise, we undertook a narrative analysis. 
Main results
We included five trials of three interventions (Breathe Easier Online, Web‐MAP, and multimodal cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)), which included 463 participants aged 10 to 18 years. Each trial contributed to at least one meta‐analysis. Trials involved children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions, such as chronic headache (migraine, tension headache, and others), chronic pain conditions (abdominal, musculoskeletal, and others), chronic respiratory illness (asthma, cystic fibrosis, and others), and symptoms of anxiety or depression. Participants were recruited from community settings and hospital clinics in high income countries. 
For the primary outcome of change in depression symptoms versus any control, there was very low‐quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e‐health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD ‐0.06, 95% CI ‐0.35 to 0.23; five RCTs, 441 participants). For the primary outcome of change in anxiety symptoms versus any comparator, there was very low‐quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e‐health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD ‐0.07, 95% CI ‐0.29 to 0.14; two RCTs, 324 participants). For the primary outcome of treatment acceptability, there was very low‐quality evidence that e‐health interventions were less acceptable than any comparator (SMD 0.46, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.69; two RCTs, 304 participants). 
For the secondary outcome of quality of life, there was very low‐quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e‐health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD ‐0.83, 95% CI ‐1.53 to ‐0.12; one RCT, 34 participants). For the secondary outcome of functioning, there was very low‐quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e‐health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD ‐0.08, 95% CI ‐0.33 to 0.18; three RCTs, 368 participants). For the secondary outcome of status of long‐term physical condition, there was very low‐quality evidence meaning that it could not be determined whether e‐health interventions were clearly better than any comparator (SMD 0.06, 95% CI ‐0.12 to 0.24; five RCTs, 463 participants). 
The risk of selection bias was considered low in most trials. However, the risk of bias due to inadequate blinding of participants or outcome assessors was considered unclear or high in all trials. Only one study had a published protocol; two trials had incomplete outcome data. All trials were conducted by the intervention developers, introducing another possible bias. No adverse effects were reported by any authors. 
Authors' conclusions
At present, the field of e‐health interventions for the treatment of anxiety or depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions is limited to five low quality trials. The very low‐quality of the evidence means the effects of e‐health interventions are uncertain at this time, especially in children aged under 10 years. 
Although it is too early to recommend e‐health interventions for this clinical population, given their growing number, and the global improvement in access to technology, there appears to be room for the development and evaluation of acceptable and effective technologically‐based treatments to suit children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions.","E‐health interventions for anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions 
Why is this review important? 
More than one in ten children and adolescents worldwide have long‐term physical conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, and cancer. They are more likely to develop psychological problems, which include anxiety or depression. Treating such problems early can prevent difficulties with friendships, family life, school, and future mental health problems. Accessing traditionally delivered face‐to‐face therapy can be difficult, due to the limited number of services. As technology improves, and therapies become available on computers and mobile telephones, e‐health interventions (delivered by digital means and ranging from simple text‐based programmes through to multimedia and interactive programmes, serious games, virtual reality and biofeedback programmes) may be useful to treat anxiety and depression in these children and adolescents. 
Who will be interested in this review? 
This review will be of interest to parents, children and adolescents, mental healthcare providers, service commissioners, and professionals caring for children with long‐term physical conditions. 
What questions does this review aim to answer? 
This review aimed to answer the following questions: 1) Are e‐health interventions better than a selected range of other therapies or waiting list in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions? and 2) Are e‐health interventions acceptable to these children and adolescents? 
Which studies were included in the review? 
We searched reference databases to find all randomised controlled trials, cluster‐randomised trials, and cross‐over trials of e‐health interventions for treating anxiety or depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions that were published between 1970 and August 2017. Trials had to be randomised controlled trials that included children and young people with either symptoms or formal diagnoses of anxiety or depression. We included five trials, with a total of 463 young people, in the review. 
What does the evidence from the review tell us? 
We included five trials of three e‐health interventions (Breathe Easier Online, Web‐MAP, and multimodal cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)), undertaken with children aged 10 to 18 years old. Although some of these interventions were acceptable to users, none of them were clearly any better than a selected range of other therapies or waiting list at reducing symptoms of anxiety or depression.The very low quality of the evidence means the effects of e‐health interventions are uncertain at this time, especially in children aged under 10 years. The review authors rated the overall risk of bias in the trials as high or uncertain. 
What should happen next? 
Further research should be undertaken to develop more effective e‐health interventions to treat anxiety and depression in children and adolescents with long‐term physical conditions.",1,Técnico,No response generated.,1,Técnico,No response generated.
