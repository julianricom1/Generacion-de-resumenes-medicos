"Background
Beta‐blockers are an essential part of standard therapy in adult congestive heart failure and therefore, are expected to be beneficial in children. However, congestive heart failure in children differs from that in adults in terms of characteristics, aetiology, and drug clearance. Therefore, paediatric needs must be specifically investigated. This is an update of a Cochrane review previously published in 2009. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of beta‐adrenoceptor‐blockers (beta‐blockers) in children with congestive heart failure. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS up to November 2015. Bibliographies of identified studies were checked. No language restrictions were applied. 
Selection criteria
Randomised, controlled, clinical trials investigating the effect of beta‐blocker therapy on paediatric congestive heart failure. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted and assessed data from the included trials.
Main results
We identified four new studies for the review update; the review now includes seven studies with 420 participants. Four small studies with 20 to 30 children each, and two larger studies of 80 children each, showed an improvement of congestive heart failure with beta‐blocker therapy. A larger study with 161 participants showed no evidence of benefit over placebo in a composite measure of heart failure outcomes. The included studies showed no significant difference in mortality or heart transplantation rates between the beta‐blocker and control groups. No significant adverse events were reported with beta‐blockers, apart from one episode of complete heart block. A meta‐analysis of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and fractional shortening (LVFS) data showed a very small improvement with beta‐blockers. 
However, there were vast differences in the age, age range, and health of the participants (aetiology and severity of heart failure; heterogeneity of diagnoses and co‐morbidities); there was a range of treatments across studies (choice of beta‐blocker, dosing, duration of treatment); and a lack of standardised methods and outcome measures. Therefore, the primary outcomes could not be pooled in meta‐analyses. 
Authors' conclusions
There is not enough evidence to support or discourage the use of beta‐blockers in children with congestive heart failure, or to propose a paediatric dosing scheme. However, the sparse data available suggested that children with congestive heart failure might benefit from beta‐blocker treatment. Further investigations in clearly defined populations with standardised methodology are required to establish guidelines for therapy. Pharmacokinetic investigations of beta‐blockers in children are also required to provide effective dosing in future trials.","Beta blockers in children who have heart failure
Review question 
What are the effects of beta blockers in treating children who are diagnosed with heart failure? 
Background 
Heart failure occurs when the heart muscle does not pump blood effectively. This can cause symptoms such as breathlessness, swelling of the legs, and tiredness. Heart failure can occur at any age, but it is more common in older people. It is also more common among children who were born prematurely or who have congenital heart disease. Beta blockers are drugs that are used to treat heart failure by slowing down the heart rate and reducing the force of the heart's contractions. They are commonly used in adults with heart disease, but their use in children is less well established. 
Study characteristics 
This review included seven randomised controlled trials involving 417 children aged 1 month to 18 years. All of the children had heart failure due to congenital or acquired heart disease and were treated with beta blockers. The trials compared beta blockers with placebo (dummy treatment) or other treatments. The length of follow‐up ranged from 1 to 24 months. 
Key results 
The review found that beta blockers may improve heart function in children, but there was not enough information to determine whether they reduce death or the need for heart transplantation. There was no evidence that beta blocker treatment increased the risk of side effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally poor. The studies were small, and there were differences in how they were conducted. For example, different types of beta blocker were used, and the dose and duration of the treatment varied. Also, the studies did not report the same outcomes. These factors mean that we cannot be certain about the benefits and harms of beta blockade in children.
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use beta blockers to treat children with heart failures. Further research is needed to determine the benefits of beta blocking in children and to establish which children will benefit most from this treatment. 
Certainty of the证据质量 
本研究的质量总体较差。这些研究规模较小，且执行方式存在差异。例如，使用的β阻滞剂类型不同，治疗剂量和时间也不同。此外，这些研究也没有报告相同的结局。这些因素意味着我们不能确定β阻断剂在儿童中的益处和危害。 
结论 
目前尚无证据推荐或反对使用β阻滞后治疗儿童心力衰竭。需要进一步的研究来确定β受体阻滞在儿童中是否有益，并确定哪些儿童将从这种治疗中获益最多。
Beta‐blockade for children with heart failure
What is the issue? 
Heart failure means that the heart is unable to pump blood around the body effectively. This can cause symptoms such as breathlessness, swelling of the legs, and tiredness. Heart failure can be caused by many different conditions, including congenital heart disease (heart problems present at birth), infections, and damage to the heart muscle. Beta‐blockades are drugs that reduce the activity of the heart and lower blood pressure. They are used to treat high blood pressure and heart disease in adults, but their use in children has not been studied extensively. 
Why is this important? 
Beta‐blocking drugs may be useful in treating heart failure in children. However they have side effects that may be harmful to children, so they should only be used if the benefits outweigh the risks. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing beta‐blocking agents with placebo or no treatment in children under 18 years old with heart disease. We found 20 RCTs involving 657 children. The trials were conducted between 1974 and 2103. The children had different types of heart disease, and were treated with different doses of beta blockers. The studies were of varying quality. 
The results of the studies were mixed. Some showed that beta‐blocks reduced the number of deaths and hospital admissions, and improved the function of the left ventricle (the main pumping chamber of the hear). Other studies showed no effect on these outcomes. 
We found no evidence that beta blockers worsened the condition of children with severe heart failure. However the studies included too few children to draw firm conclusions about this. 
How does this affect what you do in practice? 
There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of any beta‐ blocker in children who have heart failure due to congenital or acquired heart disease or cardiomyopathy. 
Further research is needed to determine whether beta‐ blockers improve survival and quality of life in children and adolescents with heart diseases. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the current evidence is low. There is a need for further research to determine the role of beta blockade in children, particularly in those with severe disease. 
Key messages 
• There is not sufficient evidence to show that beta blockade improves survival in children or adolescents with congenital, acquired or cardiogenic heart failure 
• Beta blockade may improve the function and structure of the failing heart in children 
• More research is required to determine which children will benefit most from beta blockade and how best to dose them 
• The safety of beta blocking agents in children needs to be determined 
What is a systematic review? 
A systematic review is an overview of primary research on a specific research question that aims to identify, appraise and synthesise all relevant studies. Systematic reviews should present evidence clearly, completely, accurately and transparently. 
This review protocol was published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews in 22013 as part of the Coordinating Group on Trials of Cardiac Therapy (Cochrane Heart) Review Group's programme of work.","Beta blockers in children who have congestive (heart) failure
Review question 
What are the effects of beta blockers in treating children who suffer from congestive failure? 
Background 
Congestive heart disease is a condition where the heart is unable to pump blood around the body effectively. It can cause symptoms such as breathlessness, tiredness, swelling of the legs, and fluid build‐up in the lungs. Beta blockers are drugs that slow down the heart rate and reduce the force of the heart muscle's contractions. They are used to treat high blood pressure and angina (chest pain). They are also used to prevent heart attacks. In adults, beta blockers are an important part of the treatment for congestive failures. However they may not work in the same way in children because their hearts are different from those of adults. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of beta blocker treatment in children aged 0 to less than 18 years old with congestious heart failure (CHF). We found seven RCTs involving 417 children. The studies were conducted in the USA, Europe, and Japan. The children had different types of CHF, including congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy, and dilated cardiomyopathies. The length of follow‐up ranged from 1 month to 1 year. 
Key results 
The studies showed that beta blockers improved the symptoms of CHFs in children, but did not show any difference in survival or heart transplants compared to other treatments. There were no serious side effects of the drugs. However the studies were too small to show whether beta blockers improve the function of the left ventricle of the child's heart. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was good, but there were differences in how the children were treated and what outcomes were measured. This made it difficult to compare the results. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use beta blockers for children with CHF. More research is needed to determine the benefits and risks of these drugs.

Beta‐blockade in children and adolescents with congestiv
heart failure
What is the issue? 
Heart failure is a condition where the heart is unable to pump enough blood around the body. Heart failure can occur at any age, but is more common in older people. It is often caused by other diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attacks, and heart valve problems. Beta‐blockades are drugs that slow down the heart rate and reduce the force of the heartbeat. They are used to treat heart failure in adults, but their use in children is less clear. 
Why is this important? 
Children with heart failure may have different symptoms and responses to treatment than adults. Beta blockers are expensive and can cause side effects. It would be useful to know if they are safe and effective in children. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for all studies comparing beta‐blocking drugs with placebo (dummy treatment) or no treatment in children aged 0 to 18 years with heart disease leading to heart failure. We found only one study that compared beta‐blocks with placebo in children under 16 years old. This study showed that beta‐bloking drugs improved survival in children who had had a heart attack. However the study was small and poorly designed. There were no studies comparing different types of beta blockers, or comparing beta blockers with other treatments. 
The evidence on the benefits and harms of beta blockade in children was limited. There is not yet enough evidence for us to recommend whether beta‐blocked drugs should be used in children or how they should be given. More research is needed to find out which children will benefit most from beta blockers and what dose is best. 
Search date: 27 January 2015. 
How did we analyse the evidence? 
Our review included only one randomised controlled trial. We assessed the quality of the evidence as low to moderate. 
Key results 
One study (34 children) compared beta blockers (propranolol) with placebo. Children were followed up for 12 months. 
Survival was better in the group receiving beta blockers. 
No adverse events were reported. 
Quality of life was not measured. 
We found no studies that compared different types or doses of beta blocker, or compared beta blockade with other therapies. 
There was no evidence on how long treatment should last. 
Further research is required to determine the role of beta blocking drugs in children, and to identify the optimal dose and duration of therapy. 
Trial registration number: ISRCTN91095309. 
Plain language summary 
Beta‐blocking agents in children 
Heart disease can lead to heart muscle becoming weak and unable to work properly. This is called heart failure and can happen at any time of life. Beta blocking drugs are used in adults with heart problems to improve heart function. However it is not known if these drugs are safe or effective in young people. 
This review looked at the evidence from studies comparing the use and non‐use of beta blockage in children (aged 0‐18) with heart conditions that lead to failure. The review found only a single study that looked at beta blockers in children younger than 15 years old, and this study was too small and badly designed to draw any firm conclusions. There was no information about the safety or effectiveness of beta blocks in children over 14 years old or in children of any age with other heart problems. 
More research is urgently needed to determine whether beta blocking agents are safe in children as well as adults, and whether they are effective in improving heart function and survival.

"Background
The frequency of skin ulceration makes an important contributor to the morbidity burden in people with sickle cell disease. Many treatment options are available to the healthcare professional, although it is uncertain which treatments have been assessed for effectiveness in people with sickle cell disease. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. 
Objectives
To assess the clinical effectiveness and harms of interventions for treating leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register. 
We searched LILACS (1982 to January 2020), ISI Web of Knowledge (1985 to January 2020), and the Clinical Trials Search Portal of the World Health Organization (January 2020). We checked the reference lists of all the trials identified. We also contacted those groups or individuals who may have completed relevant randomised trials in this area. 
Date of the last search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 13 January 2020; date of the last search of the Cochrane Wounds Group Trials Register: 17 February 2017. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of interventions for treating leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease compared to placebo or an alternative treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion. All three authors independently assessed the risk of bias of the included studies and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
Six studies met the inclusion criteria (198 participants with 250 ulcers). Each trial investigated a different intervention and within this review we have grouped these as systemic pharmaceutical interventions (L‐cartinine, arginine butyrate, isoxsuprine) and topical pharmaceutical interventions (Solcoseryl® cream, arginine‐glycine‐aspartic acid (RGD) peptide dressing and topical antibiotics). No trials on non‐pharmaceutical interventions were included in the review. All trials had an overall unclear or high risk of bias, and drug companies sponsored four of them. We were unable to pool findings due to the heterogeneity in outcome definitions, and inconsistency between the units of randomisation and analysis. 
Three interventions reported on the change in ulcer size (arginine butyrate, RGD peptide, L‐cartinine). Of these, only arginine butyrate showed a reduction of ulcer size compared with a control group, mean reduction ‐5.10 cm² (95% CI ‐9.65 to ‐0.55), but we are uncertain whether this reduces ulcer size compared to standard care alone as the certainty of the evidence has been assessed as very low. Three trials reported on complete leg ulcer closure (isoxsuprine, arginine butyrate, RGD peptide matrix; very low quality of evidence). None reported a clinical benefit. No trial reported on: the time to complete ulcer healing; ulcer‐free survival following treatment for sickle cell leg ulcers; quality of life measures; incidence of amputation or harms. 
Authors' conclusions
Given the very low quality of the evidence identified in this updated Cochrane Review we are uncertain whether any of the assessed pharmaceutical interventions reduce ulcer size or result in leg ulcer closure in treated participants compared to controls. However, this intervention was assessed as having a high risk of bias due to inadequacies in the single trial report. Other included studies were also assessed as having an unclear or high risk of bias. The harm profile of the all interventions remains inconclusive.","Interventions for treating skin ulcers (leg ulcers) in people living with sickl
Pharmaceutical treatments for sickling haemoglobin (HbS) leg ulcera
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of pharmaceutical treatments for HbS leg ulceration. 
Background 
Leg ulcers are common in people with sickle‐cell disease. They can be painful and distressing, and may lead to hospital admission. They are difficult to heal, and often recur. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published up to December 2017. We found 13 trials involving 432 participants. 
Key results 
The pharmaceutical interventions tested were: 
• oral L‐carntine 
• isoxuprine 
• arginine (a type of amino acid) 
• Solcoseryl cream 
• RGD peptides 
• antibiotics. 
We found no evidence that any of these interventions reduced ulcer size, or resulted in leg ulcus closure. The quality of this evidence was very low, which means we are very uncertain about its effects. 
The quality of most of the trials was poor, and we could not combine the results of the different trials because they used different methods to measure the same outcomes. 
Quality of the research evidence 
The evidence is current to December, 2107. The overall quality of research evidence was low to very low for all outcomes. This means that we are unsure about the effects of these pharmaceutical interventions. 
What does this mean? 
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of any of our pharmaceutical interventions for treating Hb S leg ulcs. More research is needed to find out if these interventions work, and how safe they are. 
Trial registration

a Leg ulcers occur when blood flow to the skin is blocked by sickle cells. 
Review methods 
We followed the Cochraneliberal standards for conducting systematic reviews. We searched electronic databases and reference lists of relevant articles. We contacted experts in the field to identify additional studies. Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies, extracted data and assessed the risk of biases. We used GRADE to assess the quality of each outcome. We did not pool the results because of differences in the way outcomes were measured. 
Main results 
We included 12 RCTs (431 participants) and one ongoing trial (10 participants). The trials were conducted in the USA, UK, Italy, France, Spain, Greece, Turkey, and Iran. The trials lasted between two weeks and six months. 
Oral L‐carnitine 
One trial (40 participants) compared oral Lcarnitinewith placebo. It found that L‐ carnitine did not reduce ulcer area. The trial was poorly designed and reported, so we are not sure whether L‐ carntine works or not. 
Isosuprine and arginine 
Two trials (130 participants), compared isoxusprine with placebo and argininesupplementation with placebo. Both trials found that neither isoxuspri ne nor arginine supplementation improved ulcer healing. The evidence was of very lowquality, so it is likely that these interventions do not work. 
Solcoseryl® cream 
One small trial (20 participants, 10 in each group) compared Solcoserylcream with placebo ointment. It did not find any difference between the groups in terms of ulcer healing, but the trial was too small to detect a difference. 
RGD peptides 
One large trial (300 participants; 150 in the treatment group and 149 in the control group) found that RGD peptidetreatment did not improve ulcer healing compared with placebo treatment. The results were based on the intention‐to‐treat analysis, which includes all participants who were randomised, regardless of whether they received the treatment or not, and is considered to be the best method of analysing trial results. The risk of the trial being biased was unclear. 
Antibiotics 
One ongoing trial is investigating the effect of antibiotics on ulcer healing in peoplewith Hb SC disease. It will include 160 participants. The final results are expected in 23022. 
No trials reported any adverse events.

Leg ulceration is a common complication of sickle-cell disease. People with sickl‐cell anaemia experience episodes of pain and tissue damage known as vaso‐occlusive crises. These can lead to leg ulcera‐tion. Ulceration is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. 
This review aimed to assess whether any interventions are effective in treating leg ulceration in people living with sick‐le‐Cell disease. We found six studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were small and poorly designed. They did not report on many of the outcomes that we were interested in.

Pharmaceutical treatments for sickling anaemia leg ulcera
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of pharmaceutical treatments for leg ulceration in people with sickling haemoglobinopathies. 
Background 
Leg ulcers are common in people who have sickling disorders such as sickle‐cell disease. They can be painful and distressing, and may lead to amputation if they do not heal. There is no cure for sickled blood cells, so treatment focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any pharmaceutical treatment for leg ulceration in sickling disorder patients with a placebo or another treatment. We did not include any studies where the treatment was applied to the skin or wound surface. We found 12 studies involving 347 participants. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that any pharmaceutical treatments reduce ulcer area or increase the number of ulcers that heal completely. We are uncertain about the effect of these treatments because the evidence is of very low certainty. This means that the true effect could be different from what we observed. The studies were small and poorly designed, which makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions. 
Quality of the research 
The studies were poorly designed and reported, and most were at high risk for bias. This makes it hard to trust the results. 
Certainty of the证据质量 
The研究设计和报告都很差，大多数都有高偏倚风险。这使得很难相信结果。"
"Background
Critically ill patients require regular body position changes to minimize the adverse effects of bed rest, inactivity and immobilization. However, uncertainty surrounds the effectiveness of lateral positioning for improving pulmonary gas exchange, aiding drainage of tracheobronchial secretions and preventing morbidity. In addition, it is unclear whether the perceived risk levied by respiratory and haemodynamic instability upon turning critically ill patients outweighs the respiratory benefits of side‐to‐side rotation. Thus, lack of certainty may contribute to variation in positioning practice and equivocal patient outcomes. 
Objectives
To evaluate effects of the lateral position compared with other body positions on patient outcomes (mortality, morbidity and clinical adverse events) in critically ill adult patients. (Clinical adverse events include hypoxaemia, hypotension, low oxygen delivery and global indicators of impaired tissue oxygenation.) We examined single use of the lateral position (i.e. on the right or left side) and repeat use of the lateral position (i.e. lateral positioning) within a positioning schedule. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1950 to 23 May 2015), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1937 to 23 May 2015), the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) (1984 to 23 May 2015), Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (1901 to 23 May 2015), Web of Science (1945 to 23 May 2015), Index to Theses in Great Britain and Ireland (1950 to 23 May 2015), Trove (2009 to 23 May 2015; previously Australasian Digital Theses Program (1997 to December 2008)) and Proquest Dissertations and Theses (2009 to 23 May 2015; previously Proquest Digital Dissertations (1980 to 23 May 2015)). We handsearched the reference lists of potentially relevant reports and two nursing journals. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized and quasi‐randomized trials examining effects of lateral positioning in critically ill adults. We included manual or automated turns but limited eligibility to studies that included duration of body position of 10 minutes or longer. We examined each lateral position versus at least one comparator (opposite lateral position and/or another body position) for single therapy effects, and the lateral positioning schedule (repeated lateral turning) versus other positioning schedules for repetitive therapy effects. 
Data collection and analysis
We pre‐specified methods to be used for data collection, risk of bias assessment and analysis. Two independent review authors carried out each stage of selection and data extraction and settled differences in opinion by consensus, or by third party adjudication when disagreements remained unresolved. We planned analysis of pair‐wise comparisons under composite time intervals with the aim of considering recommendations based on meta‐analyses of studies with low risk of bias. 
Main results
We included 24 studies of critically ill adults. No study reported mortality as an outcome of interest. Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examined lateral positioning for pulmonary morbidity outcomes but provided insufficient information for meta‐analysis. A total of 22 randomized trials examined effects of lateral positioning (four parallel‐group and 18 cross‐over designs) by measuring various continuous data outcomes commonly used to detect adverse cardiopulmonary events within critical care areas. However, parallel‐group studies were not comparable, and cross‐over studies provided limited data as the result of unit of analysis errors. Eight studies provided some data; most of these were single studies with small effects that were imprecise. We pooled partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) as a measure to detect hypoxaemia from two small studies of participants with unilateral lung disease (n = 19). The mean difference (MD) between lateral positions (bad lung down versus good lung down) was approximately 50 mmHg (MD ‐49.26 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐67.33 to ‐31.18; P value < 0.00001). Despite a lower mean PaO2 for bad lung down, hypoxaemia (mean PaO2 < 60 mmHg) was not consistently reported. Furthermore, pooled data had methodological shortcomings with unclear risk of bias. We had similar doubts regarding internal validity for other studies included in the review. 
Authors' conclusions
Review authors could provide no clinical practice recommendations based on the findings of included studies. Available research could not eliminate the uncertainty surrounding benefits and/or risks associated with lateral positioning of critically ill adult patients. Research gaps include the effectiveness of lateral positioning compared with semi recumbent positioning for mechanically ventilated patients, lateral positioning compared with prone positioning for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and less frequent changes in body position. We recommend that future research be undertaken to address whether the routine practice of repositioning patients on their side benefits all, some or few critically ill patients.","Lateral positioning for critically ill people
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of changing the position of critically ill hospital patients from lying on their back to lying on one side. 
Background 
Critically unwell people who are admitted to intensive care units often need to be kept in bed for long periods of time. This can cause problems such as poor breathing, reduced blood flow to the lungs, and build up of fluid in the lungs. To prevent these problems, doctors and nurses regularly change the position in which the patient lies. One way of doing this is to turn them onto their side. However it is not known if this helps the patient. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that compared turning a patient onto their sides with keeping them in another position. We found 26 studies involving 1,676 participants. Most of the studies were carried out in intensive care wards. The studies varied widely in terms of how they were designed and what they measured. 
Key results 
The studies did not show any difference between turning a person onto their sid and keeping them lying on the back. Turning a person on their side did not improve breathing, reduce fluid build up in the lung, or reduce the risk of death. There was no difference in the number of people who had to be turned back onto their backs because of problems such a low blood pressure. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low. This means that we cannot be sure that turning a critically ill person onto one side is better than keeping them on their backs. More research is needed to find out if turning a critical ill person on to their side improves their health. 
Certainty of the main results 
Turning a critically unwell person onto the side does not improve their breathing, fluid build in the lugs, or the risk that they will die. There is no difference between keeping them flat on their front or back. The quality of evidence is low.
Lateral positioning for preventing complications in critically‐ill adults
Review question 
What are the effects of different lateral positioning strategies for preventing adverse cardiocirculatory and respiratory events in critically –ill adults? 
Background 
Critically ill patients are often placed in lateral positions to improve blood flow to the heart and lungs, and to prevent complications such as pneumonia. Lateral positioning involves placing the patient on their side, either manually or automatically. This review aimed to determine whether there are any benefits or harms associated with different lateral positions and positioning schedules. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 15 May 16. We found 25 studies involving 1286 participants. Most studies were conducted in intensive care units (ICUs) and compared lateral positioning with supine positioning (lying flat on the back). Some studies compared different lateral postures, or different frequency of lateral turning. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that lateral positioning improves survival or reduces the number of days spent in ICU or hospital. There was also no evidence of benefit or harm in terms of the number or severity of adverse events. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally poor. Most of the studies were small and had high risk of biases. The studies did not report mortality as a primary outcome. The evidence on the effects on hypoxia (low levels of oxygen in the blood) was based on only two small trials. 
Conclusions 
There is currently no evidence to support or refute the use of lateral positions for preventing cardiociruclatory and respiratory complications in ICU patients. Further research is needed to determine the effects and safety of different types of lateral position, and different frequencies of lateral repositioning. 
Certainty of the review evidence 
We rated the certainty of the main findings as very low. This means we are very uncertain about the effects.
Lateral positioning for critically ill adults
Background
Lying on one's side may improve blood flow to the brain and heart, and may help to clear secretions from the airways. Lateral positioning may also reduce the risk of developing pressure sores. However it is not known if this position improves survival rates in critically ill people. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of lateral versus non‐lateral positioning on mortality, morbidity and quality of life in critically‐ill adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 22 August 2017. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing lateral versus any other position in critically sick adults. We excluded studies involving children, pregnant women, and those with spinal cord injury. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrance. We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We identified 16 studies (11 RCTs and five quasi‐RCTs) involving 1466 participants. The majority of studies were conducted in intensive care units (ICUs) and involved participants with acute respiratory failure. Most studies were at high risk of selection bias due to lack of blinding. Only one study was at low risk of performance bias. All studies were rated as having unclear risk for detection bias. 
We found no evidence that lateral positioning reduces mortality (low‐certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in the incidence of pneumonia (low certainty evidence). 
There was no difference in duration of mechanical ventilation (high certainty evidence), length of ICU stay (low certa","Lateral positioning in mechanically ventilated critically ill people
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of changing the position of critically ill mechanically ventilating people from lying on their back to lying on one side. 
Background 
Critically unwell people who are unable to breathe independently often need to be supported by a machine called a ventilator. This machine helps them to breathe by pushing air into their lungs through a tube placed in their throat. Critically ill people who cannot breathe independently are usually placed in bed and kept still. This can cause problems such as poor breathing, lung infections and pressure sores. Turning these people from their back onto their side can help prevent these problems. However we do not know how often people should be turned or which side they should lie on. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 1 June 2105. We found 16 studies involving 1367 participants. All the studies were carried out in intensive care units. The studies compared turning people from the back to the side with leaving people lying on the back. The length of time between each turn varied from once every hour to once every six hours. The number of turns per day ranged from three to eight times. 
Key results 
The studies did not find any difference in death rates between turning people regularly and leaving them lying on back. There was no difference in the number of people who developed lung infections. However there was a small increase in the risk of low blood pressure when people were turned. There were no differences in the numbers of people with pressure soars or in the amount of time spent in intensive therapy units. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally good but most were small and only lasted a few days. We are therefore uncertain about the effect of turning people on their sides. More research is needed to confirm our findings. 
Conclusions 
There is little evidence to show that turning people who have been intubated and are receiving mechanical ventilation from lying flat on their backs to lying sideways improves survival or reduces the risk developing lung infections or pressure socers. However turning people may increase the risk that their blood pressure will fall. More studies are needed to clarify the effects on mortality and morbidity of turning critically unwell mechanically ventilate people from supine to lateral positions.

Lateral positioning in adults with acute respiratory failure
Review question 
What are the effects of different lateral positions on outcomes in adults who have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or other forms of acute respiratory insufficiency? 
Background 
Acute respiratory failure is a common complication of critical illness. It can occur in people who have pneumonia, sepsis, trauma, burns, or other conditions that cause inflammation in the lungs. Acute respiratory distress is a life‐threatening condition that requires mechanical ventilation to support breathing. Mechanical ventilation can cause lung injury, which may worsen the patient's condition. Lateral positioning involves placing the patient on their side rather than lying flat on their back. Lying on the side may improve blood flow to the lungs and reduce the risk of complications such as pneumonia. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 15 May 14. We found 25 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved 1303 participants. The studies compared the effects on outcomes of different body positions, including lateral positions, in patients with acute lung injury or ARDS. Most studies compared lateral positions with supine (lying on the back) positions. Some studies compared different types of lateral positions. Other studies compared repeated lateral turning with other positioning strategies. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that lateral positioning improves survival or reduces the need for mechanical ventilation. We also found no clear evidence that any type of lateral position is better than others. There was little evidence that repeated lateral positioning is better or worse than other positioning methods. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. This was because many studies were small and had important limitations in how they were conducted. The evidence is current to 30 May 09. 
Conclusions 
There is currently no evidence to support or refute the use of lateral body positioning in patients who have ARDS or other acute lung injuries. Further research is needed to determine whether lateral positioning has benefits for patients with ARDS and other acute respiratory conditions. 
Certainty of the证据质量目前尚无证据支持或反驳在患有急性呼吸窘迫综合征（ARDS）或其他急性肺损伤的患者中使用侧卧位。需要进一步研究以确定侧卧是否对ARDS和其他急性呼吸系统疾病患者有益。
Lateral positioning of the body for critically ill adults
What is the issue? 
Lateral (side lying) positioning is a common practice in intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide. It is used to improve breathing, reduce complications such as pneumonia and to help prevent bedsores. 
What did we do? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing lateral positioning with other positions (such as sitting up, lying on your back or prone) in critically ill people. We also looked at studies that compared different types of lateral positions. We found 16 studies involving 1,006 participants. 
We assessed the quality of the evidence and found that there were many problems with the way the studies were conducted. This meant that we could not be sure about the results. 
The studies were small and had many problems. They did not report important outcomes such as death, lung infections, or the need for mechanical ventilation. 
There was one study that compared lateral positioning to sitting up. This study showed that sitting up improved breathing more than lateral positioning. 
One study compared different ways of turning people onto their sides. This showed that turning people more often improved breathing. 
How reliable is this evidence? 
The evidence is current to June 2016. We rated the quality as very low to moderate. This means that we have little confidence in the results of the studies. 
Conclusion 
We found no evidence that routine lateral positioning improves breathing or reduces complications in critically unwell people. There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine lateral or any other position for critically unill people. 
More research is needed to determine the best position for people who are critically unll. 
Why is this important? 
This review provides information for clinicians, researchers and policy makers. It will help them decide which position is best for critically sick people. It may also help them to design better studies to answer this question. 
Background 
Lying on your side is a commonly used practice in ICUs worldwide. Lateral positioning is used for a number of reasons including to improve ventilation, reduce the risk of pneumonia and prevent bed sores. This review aimed to find out if lateral positioning is better than other positions for critically illness people."
"Background
Surgery for anorectal fistula may result in recurrence, or impairment of continence. The ideal treatment for anorectal fistulae should be associated with low recurrence rates, minimal incontinence and good quality of life. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and morbidity of operative procedures for chronic anal fistula, primary outcomes being recurrence and incontinence. 
Search methods
The following databases were searched: EMBASE (Webspirs 5.1, Silver Platter version 2.0, 1950‐2009); Medline (Webspirs 5.1, Silver Platter version 2.0, 1950‐2009); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2009 issue 4)and the IndMed ( Indian Medline, www.indmed.nic.in) database. We restricted our search to the English literature. The Indian Journal of Surgery was electronically searched (issues between 2003 and vol 71, Oct 2009). We also searched all primary trial registers (Indian, Australian, Chinese, WHO, ISRCTN and American). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing operative procedures for anorectal fistulae were considered. Non randomised trials and cohort studies were examined where data on recurrence and function were available. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers (TJ and BP) independently selected the trials for inclusion in the review. Disagreements were solved by discussion. Where disagreement persisted and published results made data extraction difficult, we obtained clarification from the authors. REVMAN 5 was used for statistical analysis. Quality of the trials were assessed and allowances made for subgroup analysis and prevention of publication bias, using funnel plots if needed. 
Main results
Ten randomised controlled trials were available for analysis. The quality of included studies was adequate, though in some trials the numbers were small and they were inadequately powered for equivalence or to detect significant differences. Comparisons were made between various modalities of treatments. There were no significant difference in recurrence rates or incontinence rates in any of the studied comparisons except in the case of advancement flaps. There were more recurrences in the glue plus flap group, a significant difference that favoured the flap only technique. It was also noted that Fibrin glue and advancement flap procedures report low incontinence rates.In the review of literature of non‐randomised trials, most trials on fibrin glue indicate good healing in simple fistulae with low incontinence rates. 
Authors' conclusions
There are very few randomized controlled trials comparing the various modalities of surgery for fistula in ano. While post operative pain, time to healing and discharge from hospital affect quality of life, recurrence and incontinence are the most important. As it turns out, there seems to be no major difference between the various techniques used as far as recurrence rates are concerned. 
The use of Fibrin glue and advancement flaps are associated with low incontinence rates. 
There is a crying need for well powered, well conducted randomised controlled trials comparing various modes of treatment of fistula in ano. Newer operations like the anal fistula plug and the LIFT procedure need to be evaluated by randomised clinical trials.","Operative procedures for treating chronic anal fissure
Review question 
What are the benefits and harms of different surgical procedures for the treatment of chronic anal fissture? 
Background 
An anal fisture is a tract that connects the anus to the skin around the anus. Anal fistulas are usually caused by infection after an abscess has formed. They can also occur after surgery for haemorrhoids. The main symptoms are pain and discharge of pus or blood. Anal fisstures can be treated surgically. The aim of surgery is to remove the fistula and prevent it from recurring. However, surgery can cause complications such as incontinance (loss of control over bowel movements), which can have a major impact on quality of live. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised and non‐ randomised studies of surgical procedures to treat anal fisssure. We found ten randomised clinical trials that compared different surgical techniques. The trials involved 647 people. Most of the participants had a fistula that had been present for at least three months. The studies were conducted in hospitals in India, the UK, the USA and Australia. The average age of participants was 35 years. 
Key results 
There was no evidence that one surgical procedure was better than another in terms of preventing recurrence of the fisture. There was no difference in the number of people who developed incontinace after surgery. However there was a higher rate of recurrence in people who had both fibrin glue injection and advancement flap surgery compared with those who had advancement flap surgery alone. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally good. However the sample size was small in some studies and this reduced the power of the study to detect a difference between groups. 
Conclusions 
There is no evidence to suggest that one type of surgery for anal fisstrue is better than any other. However more research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Certainty of the review evidence 
We rated the certainty of the overall evidence as moderate. This means that we are fairly confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect. 
Trial registration 
This review is up‐to‐date to 25 October 2109.
Fistula in Ano: What is the best way to treat it? 
What is the issue? 
Fistulas in ano are abnormal connections between the anal canal and the skin around the anus. They are common in people who have had an abscess (a collection of pus) around their anus. Fistulas can also develop after surgery for haemorrhoids (piles). They can cause pain, discomfort and bleeding. They may also cause faecal incontinency (leaking of faeces). 
How did we answer our question? 
We searched for all relevant studies up to March 2014. We found 16 studies involving 1375 participants. 
What did we find out? 
There are many different ways to treat fistulas in the anus, but we do not know which is the most effective. We looked at the following treatments: 
• Fibring glue (a type of glue that seals wounds) 
• Advancement flap (a piece of tissue taken from inside the anus and moved to the outside to seal the fistula) 
We found that there is no difference between these two treatments in terms of how many people had their fistulas heal without needing further treatment. However, fewer people needed to take painkillers after having an advancement flap compared to those who had fibrin sealant. 
We also found that fewer people had faecal leakage after having a fistula treated with an advancement flap compared to fibrin sealing. 
This review shows that there are very limited data available to help us decide which treatment is best for people with fistulas. We need more research to help make this decision. 
Who can benefit from this review? 
People who have a fistulas, doctors who treat them and researchers who are interested in finding out more about the best ways to manage fistulas.
What should happen next? 
Further research is needed to find out which treatment works best for fistulas and to find the best methods for treating them. 
Key messages 
• There are many ways to close fistulas (abnormal connections between parts of the body) in the anal area. 
• We reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness of different treatments for fistul in ano, including fibrin (a protein found in blood) glue and the advancement flap procedure. 
Fibrin sealants are a type of medical glue that can be used to close wounds. The advancement flap is a surgical procedure where a piece of skin is taken from the inside of the anus (the rectum) and moved outside the anus to close the fistulas opening. 
In this review, we found that both treatments are equally effective in closing fistulas without causing further problems. However fewer people who had an advancement procedure needed to use painkillings than those who received fibrin. 
Fewer people who received an advancement had faecally incontinent (leaked faecies) than those treated with fibrin, but the difference was not statistically significant. 
It is not possible to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of these treatments based on the evidence available. More research is required to determine which treatment might be best for patients with fistula. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies included in this review was generally good. However the number of people included in each study was small. This means that the results of the review may not be reliable. 
Reviewers' conclusions 
There were very few randomised trials comparing different treatments of fistulas of the anal region. We do not yet know which treatment has the best outcomes for patients. 
More randomised studies are needed to determine the best treatment for fistulous disease.","Operative procedures for treating chronic anal (perianal) fistula
Review question 
What are the best operative procedures to treat chronic anal or perianal fistula? 
Background 
An anal fistul is an abnormal connection between the skin around the anus and the lining of the rectum. It is a common complication of abscesses around the anal area. Fistulas can be treated by surgery, but this can result in complications such as recurrence of the fistula or loss of control over bowel movements (incontinence). The ideal surgical procedure would have a low risk of these complications. 
Study characteristics 
This review included ten randomised studies involving 664 participants. All the studies compared different surgical procedures for fistulas. The studies were conducted in India, Pakistan, Iran, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia. The main outcome measures were recurrence of fistula and incontinent of faeces. Other outcomes included pain, time to return to work, and complications. The review was updated in 22nd March 2103. 
Key results 
There was no difference in the risk of recurrence of anal fistulas among the different surgical techniques. The risk of incontinency was lower with the use of advancement flap compared to fibrin glue alone. However, the risk was higher with the addition of fibrin to the advancement flap. There was no significant effect of the type of anaesthesia on the risk for recurrence or incontenency. 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of the evidence was moderate. This means that there is a reasonable degree of confidence in the findings. However the number of participants in each study was small. 
Conclusions 
There is no evidence that one surgical technique is better than another for treating anal fistuas. The choice of technique should be based on the surgeon's preference and the patient's needs. 
Certainty of the review evidence 
Moderate certainty.

Fistula in Ano: What is the best way to treat it? 
Background 
A fistula is an abnormal connection between two organs or between an organ and the skin. Fistulas can occur anywhere in the body but are most common in the digestive system. A fistula can develop when an abscess (a collection of pus) forms in the anus and spreads through the tissue around it. This may lead to a fistula between the anus (the opening through which faeces leave the body) and the vagina or the skin around the anus. Fistula in the anal region is called a fistulain ano. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To find out whether one type of surgery is better than another for treating fistulain ano. We looked at the evidence available up to March 2014. 
Key results 
We found 15 studies involving 673 people who had fistulaein ano. The studies compared different types of surgery. We found that there was no difference between any of these types of treatment in terms of how many people had their fistula heal without needing further treatment. However, there was a higher rate of incontinency (leaking of faecae) after treatment with fibrin (a protein involved in blood clotting) glue and an advancement flap (a piece of tissue taken from elsewhere in the patient's body and moved to the fistula site). 
How reliable is this evidence? 
The studies we found were of variable quality. Some of them were too small to show a difference between treatments. In addition, the studies did not always measure the same things, so it was difficult to compare the results. 
Conclusions 
There are currently no well‐designed studies comparing the different typesof surgery for treating a fistuain ano, and there is a need for more research in this area. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the available evidence is low. This means that the true effect of the different treatments could be quite different from what we observed in the studies.

"Background
The optimal haemoglobin threshold for use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in anaemic patients remains an active field of research. Blood is a scarce resource, and in some countries, transfusions are less safe than in others because of inadequate testing for viral pathogens. If a liberal transfusion policy does not improve clinical outcomes, or if it is equivalent, then adopting a more restrictive approach could be recognised as the standard of care.  
Objectives
The aim of this review update was to compare 30‐day mortality and other clinical outcomes for participants randomised to restrictive versus liberal red blood cell (RBC) transfusion thresholds (triggers) for all clinical conditions. The restrictive transfusion threshold uses a lower haemoglobin concentration as a threshold for transfusion (most commonly, 7.0 g/dL to 8.0 g/dL), and the liberal transfusion threshold uses a higher haemoglobin concentration as a threshold for transfusion (most commonly, 9.0 g/dL to 10.0 g/dL). 
Search methods
We identified trials through updated searches: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1946 to November 2020), Embase (1974 to November 2020), Transfusion Evidence Library (1950 to November 2020), Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index (1990 to November 2020), and trial registries (November 2020). We  checked the reference lists of other published reviews and relevant papers to identify additional trials. We were aware of one trial identified in earlier searching that was in the process of being published (in February 2021), and we were able to include it before this review was finalised. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised trials of surgical or medical participants that recruited adults or children, or both. We excluded studies that focused on neonates. 
Eligible trials assigned intervention groups on the basis of different transfusion schedules or thresholds or 'triggers'. These thresholds would be defined by a haemoglobin (Hb) or haematocrit (Hct) concentration below which an RBC transfusion would be administered; the haemoglobin concentration remains the most commonly applied marker of the need for RBC transfusion in clinical practice. We included trials in which investigators had allocated participants to higher thresholds or more liberal transfusion strategies compared to more restrictive ones, which might include no transfusion. As in previous versions of this review, we did not exclude unregistered trials published after 2010 (as per the policy of the Cochrane Injuries Group, 2015), however, we did conduct analyses to consider the differential impact of results of trials for which prospective registration could not be confirmed.   
Data collection and analysis
We identified trials for inclusion and extracted data using Cochrane methods. We pooled risk ratios of clinical outcomes across trials using a random‐effects model. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We conducted predefined analyses by clinical subgroups. We defined participants randomly allocated to the lower transfusion threshold as being in the 'restrictive transfusion' group and those randomly allocated to the higher transfusion threshold as being in the 'liberal transfusion' group. 
Main results
A total of 48 trials, involving data from 21,433 participants (at baseline), across a range of clinical contexts (e.g. orthopaedic, cardiac, or vascular surgery; critical care; acute blood loss (including gastrointestinal bleeding); acute coronary syndrome; cancer; leukaemia; haematological malignancies), met the eligibility criteria. The haemoglobin concentration used to define the restrictive transfusion group in most trials (36) was between 7.0 g/dL and 8.0 g/dL.  Most trials included only adults; three trials focused on children. 
The included studies were generally at low risk of bias for key domains including allocation concealment and incomplete outcome data. 
Restrictive transfusion strategies reduced the risk of receiving at least one RBC transfusion by 41% across a broad range of clinical contexts (risk ratio (RR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.66; 42 studies, 20,057 participants; high‐quality evidence), with a large amount of heterogeneity between trials (I² = 96%). 
Overall, restrictive transfusion strategies did not increase or decrease the risk of 30‐day mortality compared with liberal transfusion strategies (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.15; 31 studies, 16,729 participants; I² = 30%; moderate‐quality evidence) or any of the other outcomes assessed (i.e. cardiac events (low‐quality evidence), myocardial infarction, stroke, thromboembolism (all high‐quality evidence)). High‐quality evidence shows that the liberal transfusion threshold did not affect the risk of infection (pneumonia, wound infection, or bacteraemia). Transfusion‐specific reactions are uncommon and were inconsistently reported within trials. 
We noted less certainty in the strength of evidence to support the safety of restrictive transfusion thresholds for the following predefined clinical subgroups: myocardial infarction, vascular surgery, haematological malignancies, and chronic bone‐marrow disorders. 
Authors' conclusions
Transfusion at a restrictive haemoglobin concentration decreased the proportion of people exposed to RBC transfusion by 41% across a broad range of clinical contexts. Across all trials, no evidence suggests that a restrictive transfusion strategy impacted 30‐day mortality, mortality at other time points, or morbidity (i.e. cardiac events, myocardial infarction, stroke, pneumonia, thromboembolism, infection) compared with a liberal transfusion strategy. 
Despite including 17 more randomised trials (and 8846 participants), data remain insufficient to inform the safety of transfusion policies in important and selected clinical contexts, such as myocardial infarction, chronic cardiovascular disease, neurological injury or traumatic brain injury, stroke, thrombocytopenia, and cancer or haematological malignancies, including chronic bone marrow failure.  
Further work is needed to improve our understanding of outcomes other than mortality. Most trials compared only two separate thresholds for haemoglobin concentration, which may not identify the actual optimal threshold for transfusion in a particular patient. Haemoglobin concentration may not be the most informative marker of the need for transfusion in individual patients with different degrees of physiological adaptation to anaemia. Notwithstanding these issues, overall findings provide good evidence that transfusions with allogeneic RBCs can be avoided in most patients with haemoglobin thresholds between the range of 7.0 g/dL and 8.0 g/dL. Some patient subgroups might benefit from RBCs to maintain higher haemoglobin concentrations; research efforts should focus on these clinical contexts.","Red blood cell transfusions for anaemia
Review question 
What are the effects of different thresholds for red blood cells (R BC) transfus ions in people with anaemia? 
Background 
Anaemia is a common condition characterised by low levels of red cells in the blood. Anaemia can be caused by many different factors, including blood loss, poor nutrition, chronic illness, and cancer. Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body, so people with severe anaemia may experience symptoms such as tiredness, shortness of breath, and dizziness. 
People with anaem ia may receive red blood transfusions to increase their red blood count. However, there is no agreement about when to give these transfusions. Some doctors believe that giving transfusions too early can cause problems, whereas others think that waiting until the patient is very unwell is dangerous. 
This review looked at the effects on death and other outcomes of different strategies for deciding when to transfuse red bloods. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to November 2 02 1. We found 24 studies involving 16,700 participants. The studies compared different thresholds or triggers for transfusing red blood s. In some studies, the threshold was based on the level of haemog lobin (H b) in the patient's blood, whereas in others it was based o n the level o f haemat ocrit ( H ct). Haemoglobin is the protein in red blood c ells that carries oxygen, and haematcrit is the proportion of the blood that is made up of red c ellen s. 
Key results 
The studies were carried out in hospitals in 12 different countries, mainly in North America and Europe. Most of the studies involved people who had surgery, but some also involved people with other medical conditions. 
The evidence is current to November20 21. 
We found that a restrictive transfu sion strategy (lower threshold for red cell transfusion) was associated with fewer deaths within 3 0 days of transfusion, but there was no difference in the number of people who needed intensive care or had a stroke. There was also no difference between the two strategies in the length of time that participants spent in hospital. 
There was no evidence of any difference between restrictive and liberal transfu si ons in the risk of developing infections, or in the need to use blood products other than red blood cel ls. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evid ence was moderate. This means that we are fairly confident that the results of the review are reliable, but further research may change our confidence in the results. 
Conclusions 
A restrictive transfus ion strategy (lowe r threshold for re d blood cell transfu sion) was assoc iated with fewer dea ths within 1 month of transfu tion, but this was not accompanied by any other benefits. A liberal transfusio n strategy (higher threshold for r ed blood cell tran sufi on) was not associated with any harm. 
What is the impact on healthcare? 
Deciding when to use red blood ce ll transfusions is a difficult decision for doctors. This review suggests that a restric tive transfusion strategy (l ow threshold for R BC transfusion ) is associated with a reduction in deaths within a month of receiving a transfusion. However , this was accompanied by no other benefits, and there was little evidence of harm associated with using a liberal strategy (high threshold for tran suffion). 
What should happen next? 
Further research is needed to find out whether a restrictive strategy is better than a liberal one for people with different types of anaemia. More research is also needed to investigate the effects o f different thresholds on the risk o f developing infections. 
Certainty of the main results 
Certaint y of the results for 3o day mortality was moderate, and the results were similar across studies. Certainty of other results was low, and they varied across studies.
Certainty o f the results was assessed as moderate for 1 mo nth mortality, and similar across studie s. Certaint y o f other results wa s low, a nd they varie d across studies
Transfusion thresholds for red blood cell transfusion
Background
Red blood cells (RBCs) are the most frequently transfused blood product. Transfusions may be given to patients with anaemia (low levels of haemoglobi
Blood transfusions: should we be more restrictive? 
Background 
Blood transfusion is a life‐saving intervention that can improve survival and reduce complications in people who have lost blood due to surgery, trauma, or disease. However, there is uncertainty about how much blood should be given to people who need a transfusion. 
This review compares the effects of giving blood transfusions when the haemoglobina measure of oxygen‐carrying capacity of the blood – is lower than 7 g/dl (restrictive transfusions) versus higher than 8 g/dI (liberal transfusions). 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing restrictive versus liberal transfusions in people with anaemia or bleeding. We included 43 studies involving 21,000 participants. Most studies were conducted in hospital settings, and most participants had undergone surgery or had cancer. 
Key results 
Restriction of blood transfusion reduced the number of people who received a transfused blood product by 39%. Restrictive blood transfusio did not change the risk that a person would die within 3 months of the transfusion, or the risk they would develop complications such as heart attack, stroke or infection. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was high. This means that we can be confident that the results of this review are reliable. 
What does this mean for health care practice? 
Health care providers may consider restricting blood transfutions to people with haemogobin levels below 7g/dl. This may help to reduce the number people who receive a blood transfussion without changing their risk of death or other complications. 
Further research is needed to determine whether these findings apply to people undergoing surgery, people with cancer, and people with other types of anaemia.
Red blood cell transfusion: how low can we go?
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aims to find out whether giving red blood cells (RBCs) to people with low levels of haemoglobins (the oxygen‐carrying protein in red bloods cells) is safe and effective. 
Why is this question important? 
People who have had surgery or have serious illness often have low levels (concentrations) of haemo‐globin in their blood. This is because the body uses up its stores of iron to make new red blood cell. If the haemoglo‐bin concentration is too low, the person may feel tired and weak. In some cases, it may be necessary to give them red blood‐cell transfusions. However, there is concern that transfusing people with too many red bloodcells may cause problems. For example, it might increase the risk of heart attack or stroke. 
How did we search for the evidence? 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also searched reference lists of relevant articles. We included studies published up to 25 January 2019. 
What are the main results of the review? 18 RCTs involving 10,644 participants were included in this review. The studies were conducted in hospitals in Europe, North America, and Asia. The participants were adults who had undergone surgery or had serious illness. The main results are summarised below. 
Haemoglobin transfusion thresholds 
The studies compared two different thresholds for transfusing red bloodcell. The first threshold was 7 g/dl (grams per decilitre) or 8 g/dI. The second threshold was lower, at 6 g/d1 or 7g/d1. 
Across all the studies, transfusing at the lower threshold decreased the number of people who received red blood-cell transfusions by 39%. 
There was no difference in deaths within 30 days of transfusing. There was no evidence of any other differences in death rates or in the number or type of complications. 
Subgroup analyses 
The results were similar when we looked at the studies separately according to the type of surgery or illness. 
Myocardial infarcion 
In the studies of people with myocardial in‐farction (heart attack), there was no clear difference in the rate of death. There were fewer deaths in the studies where the transfusion threshold was set at 7 or 6g/dl. 
Vascular surgery 
In studies of vascular surgery (surgery to repair blood vessels), there were fewer people who died in the group where the threshold was at 8g/dI rather than 7or 6gd1. There is no clear evidence of a difference in other complications.","Red blood cell transfusions for anaemia in adults and children
Review question 
What is the effect of different thresholds for red blood cells (RBS) transfusioins on death and other outcomes in people with anaemia? 
Background 
Anaemia is a common condition where there are fewer red bloods cells than normal in the blood. Anaemia can occur due to many reasons, including blood loss, poor nutrition, or chronic disease. Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body. People with anaemic may feel tired and weak. Red cell transfusion is when blood is given through a vein to replace lost red blood. Red cells are a scarce and precious resource. In some countries they are less available than in other countries. Blood is also tested for viruses and other infections before it is given to patients. If giving red cells is not necessary, it is better not to give them. This is because it is safer and saves blood for those who really need it. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to November 21, 21. We found 26 studies involving 16,579 participants. All studies compared two different thresholds or triggers for red cell transfusino. One group of participants received a transfusion when their haemoglobin concentration was below a certain level. The other group of people received a red cell tranfusion when their hemoglobin concentration was above a certain value. The studies were carried out in hospitals in the USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Most of the studies involved adults. Four studies involved children. 
Key results 
We found that the risk of death within 3 months was similar between the two groups. There was no difference in the number of people who had to stay in hospital longer than planned. There were no differences in the numbers of people with kidney failure, heart failure, or stroke. There is not enough evidence to say whether the risk is higher or lower for other outcomes such as infections, blood clots, or organ damage. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidene was moderate to low. This means that we have some confidence in the results but we cannot be sure that they are correct. 
Conclusions 
There is not enougth evidence to show that a restrictive or liberal transfuion policy improves survival or other outcomes. More research is needed to find out what the best policy is. 
Certainty of the results 
The certainty of the resutls was moderate for 3 month mortality and low for other clinical outcome measures.
Transfusion thresholds and strategies for red cell transfusion
Background
Red blood cells (RBCs) are the most frequently transfused blood component worldwide. Transfusions can improve survival and reduce symptoms in people with anaemia (a condition where there are insufficient red blood cells). However, the risks associated with RBCs include infection, transmission of blood-borne diseases, and adverse reactions such as fever, chills, and allergic reactions. There is also evidence that RBC  transfusions may increase the risk for death, heart attack, stroke, and other complications. 
There is considerable variation in the amount of RBC units given to patients who have received a blood transfusion, and the decision to give a transfusion is based on a number of factors, including the patient's age, sex, weight, and underlying health status. The decision is also influenced by the type of procedure performed, the amount and rate of blood loss, and whether the patient has any underlying conditions that affect their ability to make new red blood cells. 
This review aimed to assess the effects of different thresholds for RCB transfusion on mortality, morbidity, and quality of life in adults and children. We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different thresholds or strategies for RRC transfusion among adults and/or children. The main outcomes of interest were death, serious adverse events, and hospital length of stay. 
Study characteristics
We found 48 RCTs that involved 22,933 people (at the time of enrolment). Most of these trials were conducted in adults undergoing surgery or intensive care, but some were conducted among people with gastrointestinal bleeding, acute coronary syndromes, cancer, leukaemias, and haematologic malignancies. 
Key results
In general, the trials were well designed and conducted. However, some trials were small and had a high risk of missing important outcomes. 
People who received a transfusions when their haemaglobin levels were below 7 g/dl were less likely to receive a transfussion than people who received transfusions at higher haemogloblin levels. This finding was consistent across a wide range of settings, including surgery, intensive care units, and emergency departments. 
However, the effect of transfusing at lower haemogobin levels on death, hospital length stay, and serious adverse effects was unclear. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was moderate. The evidence is current up to 29 April 2o16. 
Conclusions
We conclude that transfusing RBC at lower thresholds reduces the number of people who receive a RBC unit, but the effect on death and serious side effects is uncertain. More research is needed to determine the effects on death.

Transfusions in patients with anaemia
What is the aim of this review? 
This review assesses the benefits and harms of different levels of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in people with anaemic conditions. 
Why is this important? 
Anaemia is a common condition in which the number of red cells in the blood is lower than normal. Anaemia can be caused by many different conditions, such as bleeding, iron deficiency, chronic disease, and cancer. People with anaemias may experience symptoms such as tiredness, shortness of breath, and dizziness. 
People with anaemics may require RBCs to improve their symptoms or to prevent complications. However, there is uncertainty about how much RBC should be given to people with different types of anaemia. 
How did we search for the evidence? 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases up to 24 February 2107. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted authors of relevant studies. 
What did we find? 
Our search identified 43 randomised controlled trials involving 22,000 people. The trials compared different levels or thresholds of RBC administration in people who had anaemia due to different causes. 
In most trials, the restrictive threshold was defined as a haemogoblin concentration (the amount of oxygen-carrying protein in the red blood cells) of 7 to 8 g/dl (grams per decilitre). The liberal threshold varied between 10 and 12 g/dll. 
Most trials involved adults, but three trials included children. The quality of the evidence was generally good. 
Overall results showed that a more restrictive transfusing strategy reduced the proportion receiving at lease one RCB transfusion, but did not change the risk for death or other adverse events. 
Results for specific clinical groups were mixed. For example, in people undergoing surgery, a restrictive strategy reduced deaths and the need for RBC. In people with heart problems, a liberal strategy reduced death and the risk developing a blood clot. 
For some clinical groups, the evidence is uncertain. 
More research is needed to determine the best transfusion level for people with specific types of anemia.
Red blood cell transfusion: how low should we go? 
Background 
Red blood cells (RBCs) are the most commonly used blood component in the world. They are given to people who have lost too much blood through injury or illness, or who have a condition that prevents them from making enough red blood cells. Giving RBC to people with low levels of red blood cell is called 'transfusion'. Transfusions are usually given when the level of red cells in the blood is less than 7 g/dl. However, some doctors believe that giving RBC at lower levels of 8 g/d or even lower might be better for the person receiving the transfusion. This review aimed to find out whether transfusing RBC when the blood has a lower level of haemoglobins (the protein in red blood that carries oxygen around the body) was better or worse for the patient. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 29 March 2016. We included 50 studies involving 16,400 participants. All the studies were randomised controlled trials. In these studies, participants were randomly assigned to receive either a transfusion when their haemogobin level was below 7g/dl or a transfusions when their hemoglobin level was lower, down to 6 g/d, 5 g/d and even 4 g/d. 
Key results 
The review found that transfusing at a lower haemoglbin level reduced the number of people who received a transfussion. However there was no difference in the number who died within 30 days of the transfussion, or in the numbers who had other complications such as heart attack, stroke or infection. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally good, but there were some limitations. For example, many of the trials did not report on important outcomes such as death or heart attacks. Some trials did report on these outcomes, but they were not reported consistently. Also, most of the trial compared only one threshold for haemooglobin concentration with another. This means that it is difficult to know what the actual optimal threshold is for transfusing. 
Conclusions 
Transfusing at lower haemoeglobin levels reduces the number people who receive a transfusssion. However it does not appear to affect the number that die within 1 month of the tranfusion, or the number with other complications. Further research is needed in some clinical contexts such as chronic cardiovascular diseases, neurological injuries, stroke and cancer. 
Trial registration 
This review is updated from the previous version published in 2102. The previous version was registered as PROSPERO CRD4200901469. 
Review methods 
We identified studies by searching electronic databases and checking reference lists. Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies and the certainty of the results using GRADE. 
We included 11 new studies in this update. The main results of the review are presented in a 'Summary of findings' table. 
The main results are: 
Transfusion at a restrictive threshold of 6.5 g/ dl or lower reduced the proportion exposed to transfusion (risk ratio (RR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI)  0.48 to 072, 13 studies, 4415 participants, high‐quality evidence). Transfusion at 7 to 8g/dL reduced the exposure to transfussion (RR 085, 069 to 1.04, 27 studies,12,000participants, moderate‐quality证据"
"Background
Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is a disease entity that describes a physiology in which there is persistence of increased pulmonary arterial pressure. PPHN is characterised by failure to adapt to a functional postnatal circulation with a fall in pulmonary vascular resistance. PPHN is responsible for impairment in oxygenation and significant neonatal mortality and morbidity. Prostanoids and their analogues may be useful therapeutic interventions due to their pulmonary vasodilatory and immunomodulatory effects. 
Objectives
Primary objective 
• To determine the efficacy and safety of prostanoids and their analogues (iloprost, treprostinil, and beraprost) in decreasing mortality and the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) among neonates with PH 
Secondary objective 
• To determine the efficacy and safety of prostanoids and their analogues (iloprost, treprostinil, and beraprost) in decreasing neonatal morbidity (necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), chronic lung disease (CLD), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), length of hospital stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation) and improving neurodevelopmental outcomes among neonates with PH 
Comparisons 
• Prostanoids and their analogues at any dosage or duration used to treat PPHN versus ‘standard treatment without these agents’, placebo, or inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) therapy 
• Prostanoids and their analogues at any dosage or duration used to treat refractory PPHN as an ‘add‐on’ therapy to iNO versus iNO alone 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 9), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 16 September 2018), Embase (1980 to 16 September 2018), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to 16 September 2018). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings of the Pediatric Academic Societies (1990 to 16 September 2018), and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials and quasi‐randomized trials. We contacted authors who have published in this field as discerned from the reference lists of identified clinical trials and review authors' personal files. 
Selection criteria
Randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials evaluating prostanoids or their analogues (at any dose, route of administration, or duration) used in neonates at any gestational age less than 28 days' postnatal age for confirmed or suspected PPHN. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal to conduct a systematic review and to assess the methodological quality of included studies (neonatal.cochrane.org/en/index.html). Three review authors independently assessed the titles and abstracts of studies identified by the search strategy and obtained full‐text versions for assessment if necessary. We designed forms for trial inclusion or exclusion and for data extraction. We planned to use the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence. 
Main results
We did not identify any eligible neonatal trials evaluating prostanoids or their analogues as sole agents in the treatment of PPHN. 
Authors' conclusions
Implications for practice 
Currently, no evidence shows the use of prostanoids or their analogues as pulmonary vasodilators and sole therapeutic agents for the treatment of PPHN in neonates (age 28 days or less). 
Implications for research 
The safety and efficacy of different preparations and doses and routes of administration of prostacyclins and their analogues in neonates must be established. Well‐designed, adequately powered, randomized, multi‐center trials are needed to address the efficacy and safety of prostanoids and their analogues in the treatment of PPHN. These trials should evaluate long‐term neurodevelopmental and pulmonary outcomes, in addition to short‐term outcomes.","Prostaglandins for persistent pulmonary hypertension in newborns
What is the issue? 
Persistent pulmonary hypertensions of the new born (PPHn) is when the blood vessels in the lungs do not relax properly after birth. This can cause breathing difficulties and low levels of oxygen in the blood. Babies with PPHn often require extra oxygen and sometimes need to be put on a ventilator to help them breathe. Prostaglandin is a hormone that helps the blood flow through the lungs. It is thought that prostaglandin might help babies with PPNH. 
Why is this important? 
Babies with PPPN are at risk of dying or having long term health problems. There is no standard treatment for PPH. Some doctors use prostagandins to treat babies with PPnH. However, we do not know if prostaglands are effective and safe. 
What evidence did we find? 
We found five studies involving 357 babies with persistent pulmonary hypertenstion. Four studies compared prostagladins with other treatments. One study compared prostoglandins with placebo (a dummy treatment). 
The evidence is current to September 17, 2108. 
We are unsure whether prostaglads are effective for treating PPH in babies. We are also unsure about the safety of prostaglanls. 
There was not enough evidence to show whether prostoglands were better than other treatments for babies with severe PPH who needed extra oxygen or a ventilatior. 
The studies were small and poorly designed. The studies did not report on the number of babies who died or had long term problems. 
How does this affect what you do in practice? 
There is not enough good quality evidence to say whether prostglandins are effective or safe for treating babies with pPH. More research is needed. 
Where can I get more information?

Prostaglandin E1 and its analogues for the prevention and treatment of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN)
Review question 
What are the effects of prostaglandin (PG) E1 or its analogs on the prevention or treatment of pulmonary hypertension in newborns? 
Background 
Pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the lungs) is a serious condition that can occur in newborn babies. It can be caused by a number of factors including birth defects, infection, and blood clots. In some cases, the cause is unknown. This condition is called persistent pulmonary hypertensive disease of the new born (PPHND). It is a leading cause of death in newborn infants. 
Prostagandins are chemicals that are naturally produced in the body. They are involved in many processes such as blood clotting, inflammation, and the widening of blood vessels. Prostaglandins are available as drugs and are used to treat a variety of conditions. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to September 17, 2108. We found no studies that evaluated prostagandins or their derivatives as a single agent in the prevention of PPNH. 
Key results 
We did find one study that evaluated the effect of prostoglandin on the treatment PPNHD. This study was conducted in 34 newborns with PPNND. The study compared the effect on blood pressure of prostagonlandin versus placebo (a dummy drug). The study showed that prostagrandin reduced blood pressure but it did not improve survival. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the study was low because it was small and had a high risk of bias. Therefore, we cannot draw firm conclusions about the effects prostagalandins on the blood pressure or survival of newborns. 
Conclusions 
There is currently no evidence showing the use prostagelandins or its derivatives as pulmonary dilators and single therapeutic agents in PPNHN. Further research is needed to determine the safety and effectiveness of prostaganlandins and its derivatives in the management of PNNH.","Prostanoids for persistent pulmonary hypertension in newborns
Review question 
What is the effect of prostaoids and prostanoid analogues on mortality, morbidity, and neurodevelopment in neonates who have persistent pulmonary hypeension? 
Background 
Persistent pulmonary hypepression of the newbor (PPH) is an abnormality of the circulatory system in which blood pressure in the lungs remains high after birth. This can lead to insufficient oxygen supply to the brain and other organs, which can result in death or long‐term disability. Prostanois are a group of drugs that are used to reduce blood pressure. They are often used in adults with heart disease, but they have not been widely used in newborn babies. 
Study characteristics 
We included eight studies involving 547 infants. All studies compared prostaniods with no treatment or with inhaled nitrates. 
Key results 
Prostaniod treatment did not reduce deaths or the need to use a machine to support breathing. There was no difference between groups in the number of babies who developed necrotising enterocolits (a condition where the bowel wall becomes inflamed and damaged), chronic respiratory disease, or retinopathies (damage to the retina of the eye). There was also no difference in the length of time the babies stayed in hospital or the time spent on a ventilator. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was moderate to low. The studies were small and had some methodological problems. 
Conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to show whether prostaniois are effective in treating PPH. More research is needed to establish whether prostonoids are effective and safe for treating PPNH. 
Certainty of the review evidence 
We rated the certainty of the available evidence as low to very low. This means that we are uncertain about the effect that prostanooids have on mortality and morbiditie in neonate with PPH, and that further research is likely to change our conclusions. 
Trial registration 
This review is up to date to 23 September 18.
Prostaglandin analogues for the prevention and treatment of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN)
Review question 
What are the effects of prostaglandin analogue therapy on the prevention or treatment of pulmonary hypertension in newborn infants? 
Background 
Persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPH) occurs when the blood vessels in the lungs remain constricted after birth. This means that blood does not flow easily through the lungs, and oxygen levels in the blood may be low. This condition can be life threatening. Prostaglandins are hormones that cause the blood vessel walls to relax, which allows more blood to flow through them. Prostacyclin is one type of prostaganoid. It is produced naturally in the body and causes the blood to thin and the blood pressure to fall. Prostanoids are synthetic drugs that mimic prostacyclin. They are used to treat PPH. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomized trials comparing prostagladin analogs with placebo or other treatments for PPH in newborns. We found no trials that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
There is currently no evidence showing the use prostaglanin analoges as pulmonary dilators and single therapeutic agents in PPH of newborns (age less than or equal to 27 days). 
Quality of the evidence 
We did find some trials that evaluated prostaglansin analoge therapy in newborn babies with PPH, but they were not randomized trials. Therefore, we could not include these trials in our review. 
We need well‐desinged, adequately‐powered, randomized multicenter trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of prostoglandin and its analogues. These trails should evaluate both short‐ and long‐ term outcomes. 
Certainty of the Evidence 
We rated the certainty of the available evidence as very low. The main reasons for this rating were: 
· The number of trials was small. 
· There was high risk of bias in the trials. 
The certainty of evidence will improve as more trials are conducted and reported."
"Background
High intake of added sugar have been suggested to impact the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Knowledge on the subject can contribute to preventing CVD. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of a high versus low‐added sugar consumption for primary prevention of CVD in the general population. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science (CPCI‐S) on 2 July 2021. We also conducted a search of ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal for ongoing or unpublished trials. The search was performed together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We imposed no restriction on language of publication or publication status. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cross‐over trials, that compared different levels of added sugar intake. Exclusion criteria were: participants aged below 18 years; diabetes mellitus (type 1 and 2); and previous CVD. Primary outcomes were incident cardiovascular events (coronary, carotid, cerebral and peripheral arterial disease) and all‐cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL‐cholesterol, HDL‐cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose and adverse events (gastrointestinal symptoms and impaired dental health). 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We included 21 RCTs (1110 participants completing the interventions) examining the effects of different levels of added sugar intake with a mean duration of 14 weeks. The study participants were generally described as healthy and the mean age ranged from 22 to 57 years. 
No studies reported on cardiovascular events or all‐cause mortality. There was minimal effect of low intake of added sugar on total cholesterol levels (MD 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.21; I² = 0%; 16 studies; 763 participants; low certainty of evidence) and triglycerides (MD 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.17; I² = 3%; 14 studies; 725 participants) but no evidence of effect on LDL‐cholesterol and HDL‐cholesterol. There was minimal effect on diastolic blood pressure (MD 1.52, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.37; I² = 0%; 13 studies; 873 participants) and on systolic blood pressure (MD 1.44, 95% 0.08 to 2.80; I² = 27%, 14 studies; 873 participants; low certainty of evidence), but no evidence of effect on fasting plasma glucose. 
Only one study reported on dental health, with no events. No other trials reported adverse events (impaired dental health or gastrointestinal symptoms). 
All results were judged as low‐quality evidence according to GRADE. The risk of bias was generally unclear, five studies were classified at an overall low risk of bias (low risk in at least four domains, not including other bias). 
Authors' conclusions
No trials investigating the effect of added sugar on cardiovascular events or all‐cause mortality were identified in our searches. Evidence is uncertain whether low intake of added sugar has an effect on risk factors for CVD; the effect was small and the clinical relevance is, therefore, uncertain. Practical ways to achieve reductions in dietary added sugar includes following current dietary recommendations. 
Future trials should have longer follow‐up time and report on all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular events in order to clarify the effect of added sugar on these outcomes. Future trials should also aim for more direct interventions and preferably be more independent of industry funding.","Effects of high versus lower added sugar consumption on cardiovascular disease in the primary prevention setting: a systematic review and meta‐analysis of randomised trials
Background
Added sugars are sweeteners added to foods and beverages during processing or preparation. Added sugars include sucrose (table sugar), fructose (fruit sugar), glucose, and syrups such as corn syrup. Added sugar is found in many processed foods and drinks, including soft drinks, cakes, biscuits, confectionery, and breakfast cereals. High intake of these sugars has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. This review aimed to determine whether reducing added sugar in the diet reduces the risk of heart attack, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases. 
Study characteristics
This review included 11 studies involving 1,112 participants. The studies were conducted between 2 and 12 months. The participants were mostly adults without cardiovascular disease who were overweight or obese. The average age of participants ranged from about 23 to over 50 years. The interventions lasted between 10 days and 6 months. In most studies, participants were given a reduced amount of added sugars in their diet. In some studies, the participants were asked to reduce their overall calorie intake. 
Key results
The studies did not report on the number of people who had a heart attack or stroke. The results showed that reducing added sugars may slightly improve total cholesterol and trigylceride levels. However, the results were uncertain because the studies were small and of short duration. The quality of the studies was moderate to high. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of evidence was low to very low. The low number of studies and small sample sizes made it difficult to draw conclusions. The evidence was also limited by the short duration of the interventions. 
Conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to determine if reducing added sugars in the diets of healthy people prevents heart attacks, strokes, or other cardiovascular disease events. Further research is needed to determine the effects on cardiovascular health of reducing added sucrose and fructose in the long term. 
Certainty of the Evidence
The certainty of the body of evidence for the primary outcome (cardiovascular disease events) was very low due to the small number of participants and the short follow‐up period. The certainty of other outcomes was low due mainly to the high risk of bias in the included studies.
Low intake of sugars in adults
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aimed to find out if reducing the amount of added sugars in the diet improves health in adults. 
What was studied in this review?
Added sugars are sugars that are added to foods and drinks during processing or preparation. They do not include sugars that occur naturally in foods such as fruit, vegetables, milk, and grains. Added sugars can be found in many processed foods and beverages, such as sweets, cakes, biscuits, soft drinks, and breakfast cereals. 
The review authors searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared diets with different amounts of added suga","Added sugar intake and cardiovascular disease
Review question 
What is the effect of a low versus high intake of sugar on cardiovascular disease? 
Background 
Cardiovascular disease (heart attack, stroke, heart failure) is the leading cause of death worldwide. High intake of sugars has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. This review aimed to find out whether reducing the amount of sugar we eat could reduce our risk of developing cardiovascular disease, and if so, how much less sugar would be needed. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 2 June 2 02 1. The studies included in this review were randomised control trials (a type of study where people are randomly put into one of two groups: one group receives the intervention (e.g. a low‐sugar diet), and the other group does not receive the intervention). We included studies that compared the effects between different levels (amounts) of added sugars in the diet. We excluded studies that included people who had already developed cardiovascular disease or diabetes. We included 11 studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
The studies included 783 participants. The average age of participants ranged from about 23 to about 56 years old. The length of time that participants were followed up ranged from four weeks to six months. 
We found no studies that reported on the number of people who developed cardiovascular events such as heart attacks or strokes. We found very little difference between the groups in terms of total cholesterol (a measure of fat in the blood) and in triglyceride levels (another measure of fats in the body). We found no differences in blood pressure or in the levels of good cholesterol (HDL cholesterol) or bad cholesterol (LDL cholesterol). We did not find any studies that looked at the effects on weight. 
Quality of the evidence 
We judged the quality of the available evidence to be low because the studies were short term and few in number. We need more research to answer this question. 
Conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether reducing added sugar in the diets of healthy people will reduce their risk of heart attack, strokes or other cardiovascular disease events. Further research is needed to determine the effects. 
Certainty of the main results 
Low certainty.

Low intake of sugar may reduce risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease
Review question 
We reviewed the effects of reducing added sugar in the diet on risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and related risk factors such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and body weight. 
Background 
Added sugars are sugars added to foods during processing or preparation. They include table sugar (sucrose), high fructose corn syrup, honey, and syrups. Added sugars are found in many processed foods and beverages, including soft drinks, cakes, and biscuits. Added sugar is different from naturally occurring sugars, which are found mainly in fruits and milk. 
The World Health Organization recommends limiting intake of free sugars to less than 10% of daily energy intake. This is equivalent to about 50 grams (g) of sugar per day for an average adult. The WHO also suggests that a further reduction to below 5% of total energy intake would provide additional health benefits. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomized controlled trials comparing reduced intake of sugars with usual intake of sugary foods and drinks. We included only trials where participants were followed up for at least six months. We did not include trials where people were given sugar substitutes instead of sugar. We found 17 trials involving 1,092 participants. The trials lasted between six months and two years. Most trials were conducted in the USA and involved adults. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that reducing added sugars in the diets of adults reduces the risk of CVD or death from any cause. We also found no effect of reducing sugar on blood pressure or cholesterol levels. However, we found some evidence that reduced sugar intake may lead to a small reduction in body weight, although this effect was not consistent across all trials. 
Quality of the evidence 
We judged the quality of the available evidence as low. This means that there is uncertainty about the size of the effect, and future research may change the estimate of the effects. 
Conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether reducing added sugary food and drink leads to improvements in health. Further research is needed to determine if reducing added sucrose in the long term can improve health. 
Trial registration 
This review is registered with the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS) under the identifier CRST2017070028. 
Plain language summary 
Reducing added sugar may lower risk factors linked to heart disease 
Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Heart disease is caused by a build‐up of fatty deposits in the arteries, which can lead to narrowing of the arteries and blockages. Risk factors for heart disease include high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels in the blood. These risk factors can be lowered by eating a healthy diet and taking regular exercise. 
Added sugar is sugar added to food and drinks during processing. It is different to naturally occurring sugar, which is found in fruit and milk products. Added sugary drinks and foods are often high in calories and can contribute to weight gain. Weight gain is a risk factor for heart diseases. 
We wanted to find out if reducing the amount of added sugars consumed lowers the risk factors that increase the chance of developing heart disease. We searched for all randomized controlled studies that compared reducing added dietary sugars with normal consumption of sugared foods and drink. We looked at how much sugar was reduced, and how long the studies lasted. We focused on studies that lasted at least half a year. We excluded studies where people received sugar substitutes rather than sugar. 
Our search found 21 studies involving 2,018 people. We combined the results of 18 studies involving a total of 200 people. The studies lasted between half ayear and twoyears. Most studies were conducted among adults living in the United States. 
Most studies measured blood pressure. We saw no difference in blood pressure between those who reduced their sugar intake and those who did not. We observed a small difference in bodyweight between those people who reduced sugar and those people whose sugar intake remained unchanged. However the difference was small, and it is possible that future studies will show no difference. 
Some studies measured cholesterol levels and blood sugar levels. We could not find any evidence that lowering sugar intake affected these measures. 
None of the studies reported deaths or heart attacks. 
Overall, we concluded that there was not enough evidence to show that reducing sugar intake lowers the chance that someone will develop heart disease or die from any reason. We need more studies to find answers to this question. 
What is the bottom line? 
We do not know whether reducing sugar in your diet lowers the chances of developing cardiovascular disease. More research is required to find the answer.

"Background
Pyrethroid long‐lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) have been important in the large reductions in malaria cases in Africa, but insecticide resistance in Anopheles mosquitoes threatens their impact. Insecticide synergists may help control insecticide‐resistant populations. Piperonyl butoxide (PBO) is such a synergist; it has been incorporated into pyrethroid‐LLINs to form pyrethroid‐PBO nets, which are currently produced by five LLIN manufacturers and, following a recommendation from the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2017, are being included in distribution campaigns. This review examines epidemiological and entomological evidence on the addition of PBO to pyrethroid nets on their efficacy. 
Objectives
To compare effects of pyrethroid‐PBO nets currently in commercial development or on the market with effects of their non‐PBO equivalent in relation to: 
1. malaria parasite infection (prevalence or incidence); and2. entomological outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group (CIDG) Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CAB Abstracts, and two clinical trial registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) up to 25 September 2020. We contacted organizations for unpublished data. We checked the reference lists of trials identified by these methods. 
Selection criteria
We included experimental hut trials, village trials, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with mosquitoes from the Anopheles gambiae complex or the Anopheles funestus group. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors assessed each trial for eligibility, extracted data, and determined the risk of bias for included trials. We resolved disagreements through discussion with a third review author. We analysed data using Review Manager 5 and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
Sixteen trials met the inclusion criteria: 10 experimental hut trials, four village trials, and two cluster‐RCTs (cRCTs). Three trials are awaiting classification, and four trials are ongoing.  
Two cRCTs examined the effects of pyrethroid‐PBO nets on parasite prevalence in people living in areas with highly pyrethroid‐resistant mosquitoes (< 30% mosquito mortality in discriminating dose assays). At 21 to 25 months post intervention, parasite prevalence was lower in the intervention arm (odds ratio (OR) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 0.95; 2 trials, 2 comparisons; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
In highly pyrethroid‐resistant areas, unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets led to higher mosquito mortality compared to unwashed standard‐LLINs (risk ratio (RR) 1.84, 95% CI 1.60 to 2.11; 14,620 mosquitoes, 5 trials, 9 comparisons; high‐certainty evidence) and lower blood feeding success (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.71; 14,000 mosquitoes, 4 trials, 8 comparisons; high‐certainty evidence). However, in comparisons of washed pyrethroid‐PBO nets to washed LLINs, we do not know if PBO nets had a greater effect on mosquito mortality (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.63; 10,268 mosquitoes, 4 trials, 5 comparisons; very low‐certainty evidence), although the washed pyrethroid‐PBO nets did decrease blood‐feeding success compared to standard‐LLINs (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.92; 9674 mosquitoes, 3 trials, 4 comparisons; high‐certainty evidence). 
In areas where pyrethroid resistance is moderate (31% to 60% mosquito mortality), mosquito mortality was higher with unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to unwashed standard‐LLINs (RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.11; 1007 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; moderate‐certainty evidence), but there was little to no difference in effects on blood‐feeding success (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.11; 1006 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; moderate‐certainty evidence). For washed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to washed standard‐LLINs, we found little to no evidence for higher mosquito mortality or reduced blood feeding (mortality: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.54; 329 mosquitoes, 1 trial, 1 comparison, low‐certainty evidence; blood feeding success: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.13; 329 mosquitoes, 1 trial, 1 comparison; low‐certainty evidence). 
In areas where pyrethroid resistance is low (61% to 90% mosquito mortality), studies reported little to no difference in the effects of unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to unwashed standard‐LLINs on mosquito mortality (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.57; 1580 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; moderate‐certainty evidence), and we do not know if there was any effect on blood‐feeding success (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.11; 1580 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; very low‐certainty evidence). For washed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to washed standard‐LLINs, we do not know if there was any difference in mosquito mortality (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.04; 1774 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; very low‐certainty evidence) or on blood feeding (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.33; 1774 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; low‐certainty evidence). 
In areas where mosquito populations are susceptible to insecticides (> 90% mosquito mortality), there may be little to no difference in the effects of unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to unwashed standard‐LLINs on mosquito mortality (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.26; 2791 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 2 comparisons; low‐certainty evidence). This is similar for washed nets (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.25; 2644 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 2 comparisons; low‐certainty evidence). We do not know if unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets had any effect on the blood‐feeding success of susceptible mosquitoes (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.12 to 2.22; 2791 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 2 comparisons; very low‐certainty evidence). The same applies to washed nets (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.91; 2644 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 2 comparisons; low‐certainty evidence). 
In village trials comparing pyrethroid‐PBO nets to LLINs, there was no difference in sporozoite rate (4 trials, 5 comparisons) nor in mosquito parity (3 trials, 4 comparisons). 
Authors' conclusions
In areas of high insecticide resistance, pyrethroid‐PBO nets have greater entomological and epidemiological efficacy compared to standard LLINs, with sustained reduction in parasite prevalence, higher mosquito mortality and reduction in mosquito blood feeding rates 21 to 25 months post intervention. Questions remain about the durability of PBO on nets, as the impact of pyrethroid‐PBO nets on mosquito mortality was not sustained over 20 washes in experimental hut trials, and epidemiological data on pyrethroid‐PBO nets for the full intended three‐year life span of the nets is not available. Little evidence is available to support greater entomological efficacy of pyrethroid‐PBO nets in areas where mosquitoes show lower levels of resistance to pyrethroids.","Piperonyl Butoxide (p‐BO)‐containing long‐lasti

al nets (pyrethroids‐p‐B
O nets) for preventing malaria
Background
Malaria is a major cause of death worldwide, especially among young children and pregnant women. Insecticide‐treated bed nets (ITNs) are one of the most effective ways of preventing malaria. Pyrethro
id
‐treat
ed nets (PTN) are the most common type of ITN. PTNs are effective at killing mosquitoes when they land on them. However, mosquitoes can develop resistance to pyr
ethro
ids, which means that the nets become less effective. One way to overcome this problem is to add a chemical called piperonylbutoxide (p
‐BO
) to the nets. This chemical makes the nets more effective against resistant mosquitoes. 
This review looked at the effects on malaria of using pyrethr
oid
‐p
BO
 nets compared to py
ethroid
 nets. 
Study characteristics
The review included 16 studies, including three studies that were still ongoing at the time of the review. All of the studies were conducted in Africa. The studies compared the effects in people of using p
‐BOD
‐conta
ining nets with the effects when people used non‐piperony

ntaining nets. The majority of the trials were done in experimental huts, where people slept under the nets and mosquitoes were released inside the huts. Some of the other trials were conducted outside the h
uts
, where the people slept in their own homes and the nets were distributed to the whole community. 
Key results
The studies showed that pyrethro
id‐pBO nets were more effective than pyre
throid
‐only nets at killing mosqui

. However
, the studies did not show that pyrthroid p‐BO nets reduced the number of malaria infections in people. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the eviden
ce was low to very low because of problems with the way the studies wer
e
designed and carried out. The evidence was also limited by the small number of studies and participants. 
Conclusions
There is no evidence that py

pyr

Authors' conclusions
There was no evidence of a difference between pyrethrop

Background 
Malaria kills millions of people every year, especially children and women who are pregnant. Insects called mosquitoes spread malaria. One of the best ways to prevent malaria is to use insecticide

We wanted to find out if pBOD‐cont

Pyrethroids plus piperonyl butoxide (PBO) in long‐lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN): a systematic review and meta‐analysis
Background
Long‐lasting nets treated with insecticides (long‐lasting treated nets (LTNs)) have been used to reduce malaria transmission. Insecticide resistance has developed against most of the commonly used insecticides, including pyrethrins. Pyrethrin‐based LTNs are still effective at killing mosquitoes when they are washed, but this may be reduced by the development of resistance. PBO is a synergist that enhances the effectiveness of pyretroids. This review aimed to assess the impact of pyreteoids plus PBO (pyrethriods‐PBo) on malaria transmission in areas where there is pyrethin‐based insecticide resistance. 
Study characteristics
We included 16 trials (10 experimental hut trials and six village trials) that were conducted in Africa and Asia. All trials were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) except one cluster‐randomised trial (c‐RCT). 
Key results
In areas with high pyretherin resistance, pyrethroind‐Pbo nets were more effective than standard pyrethen‐based nets at reducing mosquito mortality and blood feeding. In areas with moderate pyrethein resistance (30 to less than 61% mosquito kill), we do no know if pyrething‐PbO nets were better than standard nets at killing mosquitos. In both high and moderate resistance areas, we did not find any evidence that pyretehrin‐P‐B0 nets were associated with a reduction in malaria infection rates. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence varied. Most of the studies were well designed, but some were small and had high attrition rates. The certainty of the findings was low because of the small number of studies and the high risk of bias. 
Conclusions
Pyretroid‐pbo nets may be more effective at reducing malaria transmission than standard‐pyrethen nets in areas of high pyretroid resistance. Further research is needed to determine whether pyreten‐p‐b0 nets are more effective in areas that have moderate pyretroin resistance.
Pyrethroids and piperonyl butoxide (PBO) for preventing malaria
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of bednets treated with pyrethrins (a type of insecticide) and p‐butylphenol (P‐BP) or piperonil butoxide PBO (PPO) for reducing malaria transmission. 
Background 
Malaria is a disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to humans through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Malaria remains a major cause of illness and death worldwide, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Bednets treated against mosquitoes are one of the most effective ways to prevent malaria. However, mosquitoes can develop resistance to insecticides used to treat bednets. Pyrethrums are a group of insecticides that are commonly used to kill mosquitoes. P‐BP and PPO are chemicals that can be added to pyretherum to make it more effective. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 30 June 2016. We included 11 studies involving 13,335 people living in areas where malaria is common. The studies were conducted in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Malawi. 
Key results 
The studies showed that bednets containing pyrethroin and P‐PO or P‐PPO were better at killing mosquitoes than untreated bednets, but there is uncertainty about how much better they are. The bednets also reduced the number of mosquitoes that fed on people sleeping under them. However the studies were small and had some problems with their design, so we cannot be sure that the results are reliable. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies varied. We rated the certainty of the results as very low to moderate. This means that we have some concerns about the reliability of the findings. 
We need more research to find out whether bednets with pyrithroin and piroxifen B or piroxicam PBO are better at preventing malaria than other types of bednet. 
Certainty of the main results 
We rated the evidence as very uncertain for the following outcomes: 
• Effectiveness of pyrethin‐P‐PO versus untreated bednet on malaria cases in children aged less than five years (very low‐quality evidence). We did not find any studies that looked at this outcome. 
• Number of malaria cases per 1,000 children aged between six months and five years over a year (very uncertain evidence). There was only one study that looked for this outcome, but it was too small to give us any useful information. 
For the following outcome, we rated the results of the best study as moderate‐quality: 
Effectiveness of bed nets treated with piroxyfen B or pyrethen‐PPO versus bed nets without insecticide on malaria incidence in children under five years old (moderate‐quality). 
For all other outcomes, we did not have enough data to rate the certainty.
Pyrethroids and piperonyl butoxide (PBO) in long‐lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN): a systematic review and meta‐analysis of laboratory studies
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aimed to find out whether adding piperonyml butoxide (PBo) to long‐ lasting insecticidial nets (Llin) improves their effectiveness against mosquitoes. 
Why is this important? 
Mosquitoes transmit many diseases such as malaria, dengue fever and Zika virus. LLINs are one of the most effective ways to protect people from mosquito bites. However, mosquitoes have become resistant to some of the insecticides used in LLIN. PBO is a chemical that can help insecticides kill mosquitoes more effectively. Adding PBO to LLIN could improve their effectiveness. 
What did this review find? 
We found 13 studies that tested the effectiveness of LLIN with and without PBO. We included studies that compared the effectiveness against susceptible (not resistant) and resistant mosquitoes. We also included studies comparing LLIN that were washed and unwashed. 
We did not find any differences in the effectiveness between LLIN containing PBO and LLIN without PBo against susceptible mosquitoes. However we found that LLIN treated with PBO killed more resistant mosquitoes than LLIN not treated with PBo. 
Washing LLIN can reduce their effectiveness, especially against resistant mosquitoes, because the insecticide is washed off. We found that washing LLIN reduced their effectiveness even more when they contained PBO than when they did not contain PBO, although the difference was small. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?
The evidence is current to February 2018. 
Key messages 
• LLIN plus PBO are more effective at killing resistant mosquitoes compared to LLin without Pbo. 
• There is little evidence that LLin plus PBo are more or less effective than LLin alone against susceptible mosquitos.

Pyrethrum plus piperonyl butoxide (PBO) treated bednets for preventing malaria
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of pyethroid plus pibonylbutoxide (pyrethrin‐Pbo) treated nets compared to other types of nets for preventing infection with the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. 
Background 
Malaria is a disease caused by parasites transmitted to humans through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Malaria is widespread in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Asia, Africa, Central and South America, Hispaniola, and Oceania. Malarial infections can be prevented by sleeping under insecticide‐treated bednets (ITNs), which are treated with insecticides that kill or repel mosquitoes. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to January 24,  2107. We included 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 12,779 participants. All studies were conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa. 
Key results 
The review found that pyrethrins plus pirolylbutoxides (PBo) treated netts were more effective than untreated nets at reducing the number of mosquitoes that fed on people (2 trials), and at reducing malaria infection in children aged 6 to 59 months (1 trial). There was no evidence that pyrthrin plus PBo treated nets were more or less effective than standard long‐lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) at reducing infection in young children. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. This means that we are uncertain about the true effect of pyrthrins and PBo on malaria infection. 
Certainty of the main results 
There is low certainty evidence that the use of pythrin and PBO treated nets reduces the number mosquitoes that feed on people. There is also low certainty that pythrim and Pbo treated nets reduce malaria infection among young children, but this result is based on only one trial. There was very low certainty of evidence that PBo nets are more effective at reducing mosquito bites than untreated or standard LLINS. There were no studies that evaluated the effect of PBo treatment on the number and type of mosquitoes in the environment. 
What is the bottom line? 
Pyrethrims plus PBO are more efficacious than untreated and standard LLISNs at reducing mosquitoes that bite people and malaria infection rates in young African children. However, the evidence is limited and further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Further research is also needed to determine the durability and cost‐effectiveness of Pbo treatment on nets. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?

Review question 
What are the effects on malaria transmission of adding piperonyml buseoxide (a chemical that makes insecticides more effective) to pyriethroid‐based long‐lastin insecticidel nets (pyrethroids are chemicals used to kill insects) compared with pyrethrion‐based nets? 
Background 
Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites that are transmitted to humans by the bite of infected female Anophele mosquitoes. Malaria remains a major cause of death worldwide, particularly among young children and pregnant women. Long‐lasting insecitcidal nets (or LLINs), which are treated with insecticides, are one of the most cost‐effective ways to prevent malaria. However, the widespread use of LLIN has led to the emergence of insecticide resistant mosquitoes, which can survive after biting a person who has slept under an LLIN. Insecticide resistance is a major threat to the success of malaria control programmes. 
Piperonylbutoxine (PBo) is a chemical that can be added to pyretroid‐treated nets to make them more effective against insecticide-resistant mosquitoes. This chemical is called a synergis. The World Health Organisation (WHO), the main international organization responsible for global health, recommends the use of pyretroind‐PBo nets. This systematic review was conducted to assess the effectiveness of pyrthroid-PBo nets compared with their non-PBo equivalent. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to September 19, 2102. We found 16 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These were experimental hut studies, village studies, and randomised controlled trials (RCT) with mosquitos from the anopheles gambie complex or anophele funest group. Two RCTs examined whether pyrethin‐Pbo nets reduced the number of malaria parasites in people who lived in areas where mosquitoes were highly resistant to pythroids (< 40% mortality in the discriminating dos assays). Four RCT were ongoing. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to September 25, 120, and is of low quality. We did not find any evidence that pyretheroid‐Pb nets were better than pyrethroind‐only nets at reducing the number or density of malaria‐causing mosquitoes in the environment. We also did not have enough evidence to determine whether pyretrod‐P‐Bo nets were more effective than pyretroids‐only at reducing malaria infections in people. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low because the studies were small and had some methodological limitations. We need further research to determine the effectiveness and safety of pythroid P‐Bo LLIN in preventing malaria. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is no evidence that the addition o P‐bo to pyethroid LLIN improves the control of malaria in areas of high pyretriod resistance. Further research is needed to determine if pyrethrop‐Bo is more effective at reducing malarial infections in areas that are highly resistant.

Pyrethroids plus piperonyl butoxide (PBO) for malaria control
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether adding piperonyml butoxide (PBo) to insecticide‐treated bednets (ITNs) containing pyrethrins (a type of insecticide) can reduce malaria transmission and improve health outcomes. 
Background 
Malaria is a major cause of death worldwide, especially among children under five years old. Insecticide‐ treated bednets are one of the most effective ways to prevent malaria. Pyrethrin‐containing bednets kill mosquitoes when they land on them, and also repel them so they do not bite. Adding piperonil butoxide to pyrethin‐contaning bednets may increase their effectiveness by preventing the mosquitoes from fighting off the pyretherin. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 31 March 2017. We included 16 studies, which involved more than 15,024 participants. 
Key results 
We found that adding pB0 to pyrherthin‐treatment bednets reduced the number of mosquitoes that survived after landing on the net (high‐certaint evidence). This is important because fewer surviving mosquitoes means fewer bites and less chance of malaria transmission. We also found that the addition of pB to pyrerthin‐coated bednets decreased the number mosquitoes that fed on human blood (high certainty evidence). We do not yet know if this will translate into fewer cases of malaria. 
We did not find any studies that looked at the effects on malaria cases, deaths, or other health outcomes, such as anaemia. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence varied. The evidence was of high certainty for the effect of pyrerthrin plus pB on mosquito survival and blood‐feeding success. The quality of evidence was very low for the effects pyrerthrins plus pBo on mosquito survivorship and blood feeding when the nets were washed. The certainty of the effect on blood‐fed mosquitoes was low because of the small number of studies. The effect on malaria transmission was uncertain because there were no studies that measured this outcome. 
Conclusions 
Adding piperone butoxide may increase the effectiveness of pyrtherin‐treatd bednets against mosquitoes. This may be important for reducing malaria transmission in areas where mosquitoes have become resistant to pytherin treatment. However, we need more research to determine if this translates into fewer malaria cases. 
Certainty of the main results 
High certainty: pyrertherin plus pbo increased mosquito mortality and decreased blood‐feed success. Very low certainty: the effect was uncertain when the bednets were washed, and the effect could not be determined for malaria transmission because there was no evidence. 
Authors' conclusions 
Pyrethrino‐plus‐piperonylbutoxide (pyrethri‐PBo‐) treated bed nets may be more effective than standard pyrethro‐treatebed nets in reducing malaria transmisioin in areas of pythertin resistance. However the evidence is limited and further research is needed to confirm these findings.
Pyrethroids and piperonyl butoxide (PBO) in long‐lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN): a systematic review and meta‐analysis
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aimed to find out whether adding piperonyml butoxide (PPO) to long‐ lasting insecticidial nets ( LLINs) improves their effectiveness against mosquitoes. 
Why is this important? 
Mosquitoes can carry many diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, and yellow fever. LLIN are one of the most effective ways to prevent mosquito bites. They are treated with insecticides that kill mosquitoes when they land on them. However, mosquitoes have become resistant to these insecticides over time. This means that the insecticides are less effective at killing mosquitoes. Adding PBO to LLIN may help to overcome this problem by making the insecticide more effective. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for studies up to 31 October 2017. We found 13 studies involving 14 different types of LLIN. These were tested in 12 countries across Africa and Asia. Most of the studies were carried out in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia. 
The studies compared LLIN treated with pyrethrins (a type of insecticide) and PBO with LLIN that only had pyrethin. The studies also compared LLN treated with permethrin (another type of pyretherin) and pBO with untreated LLIN, and LLIN with permetherin and PPO with untreated nets. 
We found that LLIN containing pyrethsirin and pB0 killed more mosquitoes than LLIN without pBO. However the studies did not show that LLN with pyrherthin and pBo were better at stopping mosquitoes biting people. 
There was not enough evidence to say whether LLIN made with permethyl and pbo were better than untreated LLN at killing mosquitos or stopping them biting people.
What does this mean? 
LLIN containing pBO may be better at killing more mosquitoes. However it is not clear whether this will stop more people being bitten by mosquitoes. More research is needed to find the best way to use LLIN to protect people from mosquito bites and the diseases they carry.

Pyrethroids plus piperonyl butoxide (PBO) versus standard long‐lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) for preventing malaria
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether pyrethrino‐Piperonylbutoxide (PPO) long‐lastin g insecticid al nets (P‐PPO LLINs) are better than standard long lasting insectic idal nets (S‐LL INs) at preventing malaria. 
Background 
Malaria is a serious disease caused by parasites that are spread through the bite of infected mosquitoes. Malaria is common in many parts of the world, especially in sub‐Saharan Africa. Mosquitoes can become resistant to insecticide over time, which means that they are less likely to die when they come into contact with the insecticide. This makes it harder to control malaria. Insecticide‐treated bed nets are one way to prevent malaria. They are usually treated with pyrethinoids, which are a type of insecticide that kills mosquitoes. PBO is another type of chemical that works with pyr etheroids to make them more effective. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 31 October 2019. We found 10 studies that compared P‐P‐PO LL INs with S‐LL I Ns. These studies were carried out in Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia. The studies included 13,800 people who lived in rural areas. The average age of participants was 28 years old. 
Key results 
We found that P‐PP‐O LL INS were better than S‐L L INs at killing mosquitoes. However, we are not sure how much better they were because the studies did not report this information accurately. We also found that both types of net were equally good at stopping mosquitoes from biting people. We are not certain if this is true because the evidence was very uncertain. 
The studies did a good job of keeping people safe. There were no reports of serious side effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally good. However some studies were small, which meant that we could not be sure that the results were accurate. 
Conclusion 
P‐PP O LL IN S may be better than LL IN s at killing mosqui tores. However we are unsure how much bette r they are because the studie s did not measure this accurately. P‐PO‐LLI Ns and S‐LI Ns appear to be equally good a t stopping mosquitoes fr om biting peopl e. More research is needed to find out if P‐L‐L INs are better at preventing malar i a. 
Certainty of the main results 
The certainty of the results for mosquito mortality was moderate. The certainty of results for blood‐feeding success was very low. The certa inty of the resul ts for preventing mala ria was very lo w.
Pyrethrum plus piperonyl butoxide (PBO) treated bednets for preventing malaria
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether pyrethrums plus pibonylbutoxide (pyrethrin‐Pbo) treated nets are more effective than standard long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) at reducing malaria transmission and incidence. 
Background 
Malaria is a major cause of illness and death worldwide. Mosquitoes spread malaria by biting people who are infected with the malaria parasite. Insecticide‐treated bednets are one of the most important ways to prevent malaria. They are usually treated with pyretherins, which kill mosquitoes when they land on the net. However, mosquitoes can become resistant to pyretorins, meaning that the nets are less effective. Pyrethrim‐PBo treated nets contain a chemical called piperonyl butoxide, which stops mosquitoes from becoming resistant to the pyrethin. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 30 April 2107. We included 10 studies, involving 12,000 people in 11 villages in Africa and Asia. 
Key results 
Pyrethrins‐PbO treated nets were more effective at killing mosquitoes than standard LLINS. They also reduced the number of mosquitoes that fed on people sleeping under the nets. However we did not find enough evidence to say whether pyretin‐PBI treated nets reduce the risk of malaria infection or disease. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally good, but we were concerned about the way some of them were run. For example, some studies did not use randomisation to decide which participants received which treatment, and some did not report how they dealt with missing data. We rated the certainty of the available evidence as low to very low. 
Conclusion 
Pyretin PBI treated bed nets may be more effective against mosquitoes than LLIN. However further research is needed to confirm this finding. We need more research to determine whether pyrithrin‐pbi treated nets protect people from malaria. 
Certainty of the main results 
The certainty of evidence for the main outcomes was low to moderate. The certainty of key outcomes was downgraded due to imprecision of the estimates, inconsistency of the results, and risk of bias."
"Background
Fungal keratitis is a fungal infection of the cornea. It is common in lower income countries, particularly in agricultural areas but relatively uncommon in higher income countries. Although there are medications available, their effectiveness is unclear. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of different antifungal drugs in the management of fungal keratitis.
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2015, Issue 2), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to March 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to March 2015), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (January 1982 to March 2015), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 16 March 2015. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials of medical therapy for fungal keratitis.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors selected studies for inclusion in the review, assessed trials for risk of bias and extracted data. The primary outcome was clinical cure at two to three months. Secondary outcomes included best‐corrected visual acuity, time to clinical cure, compliance with treatment, adverse outcomes and quality of life. 
Main results
We included 12 trials in this review; 10 trials were conducted in India, one in Bangladesh and one in Egypt. Seven of these trials were at high risk of bias in one or more domains, two of these studies were at low risk of bias in all domains. Participants were randomised to the following comparisons: topical 5% natamycin compared to topical 1% voriconazole; topical 5% natamycin compared to topical 2% econazole; topical 5% natamycin compared to topical chlorhexidine gluconate (0.05%, 0.1% and 0.2%); topical 1% voriconazole compared to intrastromal voriconazole 50 g/0.1 mL (both treatments combined with topical 5% natamycin); topical 1% voriconazole combined with oral voriconazole compared to both oral voriconazole and oral itraconazole (both combined with topical 5% natamycin); topical 1% itraconazole compared to topical 1% itraconazole combined with oral itraconazole; topical amphotericin B compared to topical amphotericin B combined with subconjunctival injection of fluconazole; intracameral injection of amphotericin B with conventional treatment compared to conventional treatment alone (severe fungal ulcers); topical 0.5% and 1% silver sulphadiazine compared to topical 1% miconazole. Overall the results were inconclusive because for most comparisons only one small trial was available. The exception was the comparison of topical natamycin and topical voriconazole for which three trials were available. In one of these trials clinical cure (healed ulcer) was reported in all 15 people allocated to natamycin and in 14/15 people allocated to voriconazole (risk ratio (RR) 1.07; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.28, low quality evidence). In one trial people randomised to natamycin were more likely to have a microbiological cure at six days (RR 1.64; 95% CI 1.38 to 1.94, 299 participants). On average, people randomised to natamycin had better spectacle‐corrected visual acuity at two to three months compared to people randomised to voriconazole but the estimate was uncertain and the 95% confidence intervals included 0 (no difference) (mean difference ‐0.12 logMAR, 95% CI ‐0.31 to 0.06, 434 participants; 3 studies, low quality evidence) and a decreased risk of corneal perforation or therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty, or both (RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.94, 434 participants, high quality evidence). There was inconclusive evidence on time to clinical cure. Compliance with treatment and quality of life were not reported. One trial comparing natamycin and voriconazole found the effect of treatment greater in Fusarium species, but this subgroup analysis was not prespecified by this review. 
Authors' conclusions
The trials included in this review were of variable quality and were generally underpowered. There is evidence that natamycin is more effective than voriconazole in the treatment of fungal ulcers. Future research should evaluate treatment effects according to fungus species.","Antifungal medications for fungal infections of the eye (keratitis)
Review question 
What are the effects and side effects of antifungals used to treat fungal infections in the eye? 
Background 
Fungal infections of eyes (keratitus) are rare in developed countries but are common in developing countries. Fungal infections can be caused by many different types of fungi. These infections can cause serious damage to the eye and can lead to blindness. There are several different types and strengths of antiviral medications that can be used to try to treat these infections. However, it is not known which type of medication works best. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for all randomised trials comparing different antivirals for treating fungal infections. We found 13 trials involving 758 participants. All of the trials were carried out in India. Most of the participants had fungal infections caused by a type of fungus called Fusarium. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to March, 2105. We are uncertain about the effect of antfungal medications because the trials we found were small and poorly designed. We need further research before we can make conclusions about the effects or side effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low. This means that we are uncertain whether the results of the studies are due to the treatments being tested or other factors. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to determine the effects, including side effects, of antfungals for fungal infection in the eyes. More research is needed to determine which antifugal medications work best.
Topical antifungal agents for treating fungal keratitis
Review question 
What are the effects of topical antifungals for treating people with fungal keratits? 
Background 
Fungal keratitis is an infection of the cornea caused by fungi. It can be caused by contact lens wear, trauma to the eye, or surgery. Fungal keratitis is uncommon in developed countries but is common in developing countries. It is often difficult to treat and can cause permanent loss of vision. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing different topical antiviral drugs for treating this condition. We found seven trials involving 211 people. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to June 2017. There is no evidence to support one antifugal over another. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. This means we are uncertain about the effect of topical treatments for fungal keratis. 
Certainty of the main results 
We are uncertain whether topical antfungal drugs are effective for treating the condition. More research is needed to find out which drug works best. 
What does this mean for me? 
If you have fungal keritis, your doctor will decide on the best treatment for you. This may involve using more than one drug. 
How did we analyse the evidence? 
We analysed the evidence according to the methods recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration. We assessed the quality of each trial and the certainty of the results. We used GRADE to assess the certainty. We rated the certainty as high, moderate, low or very low based on four factors: risk of biases in individual studies, inconsistency of results, imprecision and indirectness of the estimates.
Natamycin versus voriconazol for the treatment and prevention of fungal keratitis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of natamycine versus vorconazole for the management of fungal infections of the cornea (the transparent layer covering the front of the eye). 
Background 
Fungal infections of cornea can cause serious sight loss. They are difficult to treat because they are resistant to many antibiotics. Natamycin has been used for many years to treat fungal infections. Voriconazole is a newer antifungal drug. It is more expensive than natamicin and has more side effects. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 26 June 2018. We found four studies involving 633 people with fungal infections affecting the corneas. Three studies compared natamican with vorconazol and one compared natamicin with amphotericin B. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that vorconozol was better than natamicine for treating fungal infections in the cornean. People treated with natamicicn were more than twice as likely to be cured of their infection after six days compared to those treated with voriconozol. People who received natamicinc were also more likely than those who received vorconazo to have better vision after two to thre months. However, the evidence was not strong enough to be certain that these differences were real. 
There was no evidence of any difference between the two drugs in terms of side effects, such as pain or redness of the eyes. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was of moderate to low quality. This means that we cannot be sure that the true effect of the drugs is exactly as reported. 
Conclusions 
We concluded that natamicacin is more likely that voriconazo to cure fungal infections and improve vision. However we need more research to confirm this finding. 
Certainty of the证据质量 
我们得出结论，纳他霉素比伏立康唑更有可能治愈真菌感染并改善视力。然而，我们需要更多的研究来证实这一发现。","Antifungal agents for treating fungal keratouveitis
Review question 
What are the effects and side effects of antifungals for treating people with fungal keratoconjunctivitis? 
Background 
Fungal infections of the eye are rare in developed countries, but they are common in developing countries. Fungal keratoconjunctivits is an infection of both the corneal tissue and the conjunctiva. It can cause pain, redness, tearing, sensitivity to light and blurred vision. If left untreated, it can lead to permanent loss of vision. 
Antifungics are used to treat fungal keratosconjunctivalitis. They come in different forms, such as eye drops, ointments and injections. There are many different types of antfungal agents. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to March, 2105. We found 13 studies involving 758 participants. All studies were conducted between 1898 and 2200 in India. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that antifungi are better than placebo. We also found no difference between antifunics. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was poor. Most studies had small numbers of participants and were poorly reported. This means we cannot be sure if antifunga are effective. 
Conclusions 
There is no evidence to support the use of antfungics for treating patients with fungal corneoscleritis. More research is needed to find out which antifungs are most effective.
Topical antifungal agents for treating fungal corneal ulcers
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of topical antifungals for treating people with fungal cornea ulcers. 
Background 
Fungal cornealgia ulcers are painful open sores on the cornea caused by fungi. They can cause permanent damage to the eye if not treated. Fungal cornea ulcer is a common cause of blindness in developing countries. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 25 January 2018. We found seven studies involving 1010 people. All studies were conducted in developing world countries. Six studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to January 19, 18 and is up to date. We did not find any studies comparing different topical antfungal agents. We also did not identify any studies that compared topical antfungals with other treatments. 
We identified three studies that evaluated the effectiveness of topical 4% natamin and topical 3% vorconazole for treating patients with fungal ulcera. In two of the three studies, people who received natamycine were more than twice as likely to be cured as those who received vorconazol. However, the results of these two studies were not consistent with each other. In the third study, people receiving natamyn were more likeley to be healed than those receiving vorconozole. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low. This means that we cannot be certain that the results are correct. 
Conclusions 
We did not have enough evidence to make conclusions about the effects of topical fungicides for treating corneale ulcers caused by fungus. More research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and cost of topical agents for this condition. 
Certainty of the results 
We rated the certainty of the findings as low. The certainty of evidence was downgraded due to imprecision and risk of biases.
Natamycin versus voriconazol for the treatment and prevention of fungal keratitis
Review question 
What are the effects of natamycine versus vorconazol in the management of fungal corneale ulcers? 
Background 
Fungal corneae ulcers are a serious eye condition that can cause blindness. They are caused by fungi that enter the eye through cuts or scratches on the cornea. Fungi can also enter the corneum through contact lenses. The most common fungi causing these ulcers include Fusarium, Aspergillus, and Candida. The ulcers can be treated with antifungal drugs such as natamicin and vorconazole. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 28 February 2018. We found four studies involving 473 people with fungal cornea ulcers who received either natamican or vorconazo. 
Key results 
We found that natamicin was more effective in treating fungal corneas ulcers than vorconozole. People receiving natamicine were more than twice as likely to be cured of their infection after six days of treatment. People treated with natamican also had better vision at two months than those treated with vorconazon. However, the differences between the two treatments were small and the estimates were uncertain. We did not find any evidence on the time to cure. We do not know if the differences in effectiveness were due to the type of fungus causing the ulcer. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was variable. The studies were generally small and poorly designed. The evidence is current up to February 18, 1998. 
Conclusion 
There is evidence to suggest that nataminicin is more efficacious than voronazon in the treatement of fungal ulcer. Future studies should evaluate the effect according to the fungus species causing the ulcers.
The evidence is up to date to February, 8,"
"Background
Dental caries (tooth decay) is one of the commonest diseases which afflicts mankind, and has been estimated to affect up to 80% of people in high‐income countries. Caries adversely affects and progressively destroys the tissues of the tooth, including the dental pulp (nerve), leaving teeth unsightly, weakened and with impaired function. The treatment of lesions of dental caries, which are progressing through dentine and have caused the formation of a cavity, involves the provision of dental restorations (fillings). This review updates the previous version published in 2009. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of adhesive bonding on the in‐service performance and longevity of dental amalgam restorations. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 21 January 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 12), MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to 21 January 2016) and EMBASE via Ovid (1980 to 21 January 2016). We also searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en) (both to 21 January 2016) for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing adhesively bonded versus traditional non‐bonded amalgam restorations in conventional preparations utilising deliberate retention, in adults with permanent molar and premolar teeth suitable for Class I and II amalgam restorations only. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened papers, extracted trial details and assessed the risk of bias in the included study. 
Main results
One trial with 31 patients who received 113 restorations was included. At two years, 50 out of 53 restorations in the non‐bonded group survived, and 55 of 60 bonded restorations survived with five unaccounted for at follow‐up. Post‐insertion sensitivity was not significantly different (P > 0.05) at baseline or two‐year follow‐up. No fractures of tooth tissue were reported and there was no significant difference between the groups or matched pairs of restorations in their marginal adaptation (P > 0.05). 
Authors' conclusions
There is no evidence to either claim or refute a difference in survival between bonded and non‐bonded amalgam restorations. This review only found one under‐reported trial. This trial did not find any significant difference in the in‐service performance of moderately sized adhesively bonded amalgam restorations, in terms of their survival rate and marginal integrity, in comparison to non‐bonded amalgam restorations over a two‐year period. In view of the lack of evidence on the additional benefit of adhesively bonding amalgam in comparison with non‐bonded amalgam, it is important that clinicians are mindful of the additional costs that may be incurred.","Bonding of dental fillings to teeth
Review question 
What is the effect of bonding dental amalgams to teeth? 
Background 
Dental amalgam is a mixture of metals used to fill cavities in teeth. It is one type of filling material used by dentists. Amalgam fillings can be bonded to teeth using a special adhesive. Bonding amalgam fillers to teeth may improve their longevity and reduce sensitivity. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that compared bonded versus non‐bonds amalgam filling materials. We found one study that compared the two types of filling materials in 32 patients. 
Key results 
The study showed that bonded amalgam was more likely to survive than non‐ bonded amalgams. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of sensitivity. The study did not report any adverse events. 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of the evidence was low because the study had a small number of participants and the study design was weak. 
Conclusions 
There is limited evidence that bonding amalgam to teeth improves the longevity of the filling. However, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether this method reduces sensitivity. More research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Certainty of evidence
The certainty of evidence was rated as low. 
Trial registration 
This review was registered with the Coordinating Centre for Cancer Research (CCCR) in 1997. 
Plain language summary 
Bonding dental fillers 
Dentists use fillings called amalgams in the treatment of cavities. Amalgaums are made of metal and are used to repair cavities and restore the shape of the teeth. Amallgams can be attached to teeth with a special glue. This review looked at the effect that bonding has on the longevity and sensitivity of amalgam teeth fillings. 
We found one small study that included 33 patients. The patients had 106 cavities filled with either bonded or non‐boned amalgams and were followed up for two years. The results showed that amalgams bonded to the teeth were more likely than nonbonded ones to survive for two year. There were no differences between the groups in sensitivity. No adverse events were reported. 
The evidence is current to January 1st 2206. 
More research is required to confirm the findings of this review.
Bonding amalgam fillings to teeth
Review question 
What is the effect of bonding amalgams to teeth? 
Background 
Amalgam is a mixture of metals used to fill cavities in teeth. It has been used for many years because it is strong and durable. However, it can be unsightly and some people have concerns about its use. Bonding amalgams involves attaching them to the tooth surface with a special glue. This may improve the appearance of the filling and reduce the amount of tooth structure removed when preparing the cavity. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to June 2014. We found one small study involving 32 people who had 17 bonded and 14 non‐bonds amalgam filling. 
Key results 
The study compared bonded and unbonded amalgams in people with moderate sized cavities. The study found no difference in how long the fillings lasted or how well they fitted the tooth. There was also no difference between bonded or unbonding amalgums in terms if they caused pain or damage to the teeth. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the study was poor. The number of people involved was small and the study did not report on important outcomes such as pain or discomfort. We need more research before we can draw firm conclusions about the benefits of bonding. 
Conclusions 
There is currently no evidence that bonding amalgums improves the outcome of fillings. More research is needed to determine whether bonding amalgum fillings improves the way they fit to the surface of the tooth, reduces the amount tooth structure that needs to be removed when making the filling, or reduces the risk that the filling will fall out. 
Certainty of the review evidence 
We rated the certainty of the available evidence as very low. This means that we are very uncertain about the effects of bonding on the success of amalgam dental fillings and the amount that tooth structure is removed when the filling is made. 
Trial registration 
This review includes the results of one trial registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register (ISRCTN 90010912).","Adhesive bonding for dental amalgams
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether adhesives improve the long‐term performance of dental fillings made from amalgam (an alloy of mercury, silver, tin, copper and sometimes other metals). 
Background 
Dental fillings are used to repair cavities in teeth caused by tooth decay. Amalgam fillings have been used for over 150 years and are still widely used today. They are durable and relatively inexpensive. However, they can be unsightly and may cause sensitivity to hot and cold foods and drinks. 
Amalgam is made by mixing a powder containing silver, copper, tin and mercury with liquid mercury. The mixture is then placed into a prepared cavity in the tooth and allowed to harden. The filling is then shaped and polished to fit the tooth. 
In some cases, the dentist may use an adhesive to bond the filling to the tooth surface. Adhesives are usually made from a resin material. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled studies comparing adhesion to the surface of the teeth with no adhesion. We found only one small study involving 32 patients. 
Key results 
The study compared adhesion with no adhesive in 136 teeth. After two years of follow‐ups, there was no difference between the two groups in terms of the number of fillings that had failed. There was also no difference in the number or severity of side effects such as sensitivity to temperature. 
Quality of the evidence 
There was only one study and it was small. The study was well designed but did not report enough information to allow us to judge its quality. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to determine whether adhesion improves the long term performance of amalgam fillers. More research is needed.
Bonding amalgam to teeth: does it make a difference? 
Amalgam is a mixture of metals used by dentists to fill cavities in teeth. It has been used for many years because it is strong, durable and inexpensive. However, it can be unsightly and some people have concerns about its safety. 
In recent years, dentists have started to bond amalgam fillings to the teeth rather than just placing them inside the cavity. Bonding amalgams involves applying a special glue to the tooth before filling it. This is done to improve the fit of the filling and to reduce the amount of tooth structure that needs to be removed. 
This review looked at whether bonding amalgams makes a difference to how well they work. We searched for studies that compared bonded amalgams with non-bonded amalgams. We found one study that compared the two types of filling. This study involved 32 people who had 17 bonded and 14 non-bounded amalgam teeth filled. The study lasted for two years. 
The study showed that bonded amalgums worked just as well as non-boned amalgams in terms how long they lasted and how well the filling fitted around the edge of the tooth. There was no difference in how often people experienced pain when eating or drinking after the filling was placed. 
We concluded that there is no reason to believe that bonded or non-bonbed amalgams work differently. However we need more research to confirm this."
"Background
There are two injectable progestogen‐only contraceptives (IPCs) that have been available in many countries in the world since 1983. They are both still extensively used in many developing countries, forming a large proportion of the health system's expenditure on contraception. These are depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and norethisterone oenanthate (NET‐EN). These are both highly effective contraceptives that receive wide acceptance amongst women in their fertile years. They differ in frequency of administration that has implications on patient uptake. They also differ in cost that may significantly affect budgeting in the health system. A systematic comparison will aid to ensure their rational use. 
Objectives
To determine if there are differences between depot medroxyprogesterone acetate given at a dose of 150 mg IM every 3 months and norethisterone oenanthate given at a dose of 200mg IM every 2 months, in terms of contraceptive effectiveness, reversibility and discontinuation patterns, minor effects and major effects. 
Search methods
We searched the computerized databases MEDLINE using PubMed, Popline, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Biblioline, LILACS, EMBASE and PASCAL for randomised controlled trials of DMPA versus NET‐EN for long‐acting progestogenic contraception. Studies were included regardless of language, and all databases were reviewed from the time that injectable progestogens have been in use. 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled comparisons of DMPA acetate given at a dose of 150 mg IM every 3 months versus NET‐EN given at a dose of 200mg IM every 2 months, used for contraception, were included. Trials had to report on contraceptive efficiency and return to fertility, discontinuation risks and reasons for discontinuation, and clinical effects, both menstrual and non‐menstrual. 
Data collection and analysis
BD and CM evaluated the titles and abstracts obtained through applying the search strategy and applied the eligibility criteria. BD attempted to contact authors where clarification of the data was required, and contacted all main manufacturers of the contraceptives. After inclusion of the two studies, the data was abstracted and analysed with RevMan 4.2. 
Main results
Two trials were included in this review. There was no significant difference between the two treatment groups for the frequency of discontinuation for either contraceptive, although the women on NET‐EN were 4% more likely to discontinue for personal reasons than those on DPMA. Discontinuation because of accidental pregnancy did not differ between the groups. Although the duration of bleeding and spotting events was the same in each group, women on DPMA were 21% more likely to develop amenorrhoea. Mean changes in body weight at 12 and 24 months, and in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at 12 months did not differ significantly between the studies. 
Authors' conclusions
While the choice between DPMA and NET‐EN as injectable progestogen contraceptives may vary between both health providers and patients, data from randomized controlled trials indicate little difference between the effects of these methods, except that women on DMPA are more likely to develop amenorrhoea. There is inadequate data to detect differences in some non‐menstrual major and minor clinical effects.","Depot medrooxyprogesteron acetate versus norethinisteron enanthate for long acting progestin only contraception 
Review question 
What are the differences between Depot medrooxyprogesteron (Dmpa) and Norethinistron enanthat (Neten) in terms: 
• Contraceptive effectiveness 
• Reversibility and continuation patterns 
• Minor effects 
• Major effects 
Background 
There are currently two injectables progestagen only contraceptivies (ipc) that are available in most countries in Africa. They have been around since 30 years ago and are still widely used in developing countries. They both have high effectiveness and are well accepted by women in the reproductive age group. They do however differ in how often they need to be administered. This has implications for patient uptake and cost of the drug. A comparison of these two drugs will help to ensure that they are used rationally. 
Study characteristics 
Two studies were included, one from Kenya and one from Nigeria. Both studies compared the two drugs in terms effectiveness, side effects and discontinuations. 
Key results 
The studies showed that the two treatments were equally effective in preventing pregnancy. Women who received Dmpa were more likely to continue using the drug than those who received Neten. However, women who received neten were less likely to experience side effects. The studies did not show any major side effects of either treatment. 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of the evidence was low because of the small number of participants in each study. 
Conclusions 
The two drugs are equally effective at preventing pregnancy but Dmpo is more likely than Neten to be continued. Neten is less likely than Dmpoa to cause side effects but the studies did find some side effects with both drugs. 
Certainty of the Evidence 
The certainty of the body of evidence is low. The two studies included in the review were small and the results were based on self reported data. 
Authors' conclusions 
The evidence suggests that Dmpao and Neten are equally efficacious in preventing pregnancies. However DmpAo is more acceptable than NetEn. NetEn is less associated with side effects than DmPa. The certainty of evidence was limited by the small sample size of the studies and the fact that the studies were based upon self reported outcomes.
Comparison of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and NET EN as injectables for contraception
Review question 
What are the differences between depot medroxyprogesterone (DPM) and net en (NET‐EN) as injectible contraceptves? 
Background 
Injectable contraceptve are used by women who do not want to use other methods of contraception such as condoms, pills, or intrauterine devices. Depot medrooxyprogesteron acetate is one of the most widely used injectable contracepive. It is given every three months and is effective in preventing pregnancy. NET‐en is another injectable contraceptive which is also given every 3 months. It contains a different type of hormone than DMP. NET EN is also effective in preventin pregnancy. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies comparing DMP and NET en as injectibles for contraception. We found two studies that compared the two injectables. Both studies were conducted in the United States. The studies were small and lasted for only 2 years. 
Key results 
The two studies showed that there was no difference in the number of women who stopped taking the injectable because they became pregnant. Women who took NET‐En were more likely than women who took DMP to stop taking the injection because they did not like it. Women taking NET‐ En were more than twice as likely as women taking DMP not to have any periods during the year after starting the injections. There were no differences in the amount of weight gain or blood pressure between the women taking the two injections. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is current up to 2007. The evidence is of moderate quality. This means that we can be fairly confident that the true effect of the injections lies somewhere within the range of effects reported. 
Conclusions 
There is little difference in how well the two types of injectable work to prevent pregnancy. However, women who take NET‐ EN are more than twicelikely to stop using the injection than women taking DEP. Women on NET EN are also more likely not to get their period. There are not enough data to know if there are differences in other side effects. 
Certainty of the Evidence 
The certainty of the available evidence is moderate. This is because the studies were relatively small and short. The certainty of evidence could be improved by conducting larger studies that last longer.

Review question 
What are the differences between Depot medrooxyprogesteron (Dmpa) and Norethinosteron enanthat (Neten) as long acting contraceptivies? 
Background 
Dmp and Neten are two types of injectable contraceptices that are widely used in developing countries. They have been used for over 30 years. Both are very effective at preventing pregnancy. They can be used by women who do not want to take oral contraceptice. They work by stopping ovulation. They last for several months and need to be injected regularly. They both have side effects. Dmpa is given once every three months and Netan is given twice every two months. This review compares these two types. 
Study characteristics 
We found two studies that compared these two injections. One study was carried out in the USA and one in the UK. Both studies were carried out between 10 and 16 years ago. The studies were small and only lasted for six months. 
Key results 
The studies showed that Dmp and Nten were equally effective at stopping pregnancy. Women who took Dmp were more likely to stop taking the injection than those who took Nten. This may be because Dmp is given less often. Dmpe had more side effects than Nten, but the side effects were mild. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is of moderate quality. The two studies were both small and lasted for only six months so they may not show all the possible side effects of these injections. We need more research to find out how well these injections work over a longer period of time. 
Conclusions 
Dmpe and Ntne are equally effective in preventing pregnancy, but Dmep is more likely than Ntene to be stopped by the woman. Dmepe is more expensive than Nteen. Dmse has more side effect than Nteen. 
We need more studies to find how well Dmde and Nteen work over longer periods of time and what the long term side effects are.

Comparison of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and NET EN as injectables for contraception
Injectable progesterone contraceptves are used by women who do not want to take daily pills. They are usually given once every three months. This review compared two types of injectable contraceptive: depot medroxyprogesterone (DPM) and net en (NET EN). 
The review found that there was little difference in the effectiveness of the methods. Women on NET EN were slightly more likely than those taking DMP to disconinue use for personal or medical reasons. However, there was no difference in discontinuation due to accidental pregnancy. Women taking NET EN had a higher incidence of amenorrhœa (absence of menstruation) than those receiving DMP. There were no differences in mean changes in systollic and diatolic blood pressures, or in mean body weight. 
There was insufficient data to assess the impact of these injectables on other non‐mennstrual clinical effects such as acne, hair growth, mood changes, and breast tenderness. 
Both injectables are effective methods of contraception. However women should be aware that they are more like to experience amenorrhoa with NET EN."
"Background
Postoperative pain is a common consequence of surgery and can have deleterious effects. It has been suggested that the administration of opioid analgesia before a painful stimulus may improve pain control. This can be done in two ways. We defined 'preventive opioids' as opioids administered before incision and continued postoperatively, and 'pre‐emptive opioids' as opioids given before incision but not continued postoperatively. Both pre‐emptive and preventive analgesia involve the initiation of an analgesic agent prior to surgical incision with the aim of reducing intraoperative nociception and therefore postoperative pain. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy of preventive and pre‐emptive opioids for reducing postoperative pain in adults undergoing all types of surgery. 
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, and CINAHL (up to 18 March 2018). In addition, we searched for unpublished studies in three clinical trial databases, conference proceedings, grey literature databases, and reference lists of retrieved articles. We did not apply any restrictions on language or date of publication. 
Selection criteria
We included parallel‐group randomized controlled trials (RCTs) only. We included participants aged over 15 years old undergoing any type of surgery. We defined postincision opioids as the same intervention administered after incision whether single dose (as comparator with pre‐emptive analgesia) or continued postoperatively (as comparator with preventive analgesia) (control group). We considered studies that did and did not use a double‐dummy placebo (e.g. intervention group received active drug before incision and placebo after incision; control group received placebo before incision and active drug after incision). 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were: early acute postoperative pain (measured within six hours and reported on a 0‐to‐10 scale) and respiratory depression. Our secondary outcomes included: late acute postoperative pain (24 to 48 hours and reported on a 0‐to‐10 scale), 24‐hour morphine consumption, and adverse events (intraoperative bradycardia and hypotension). We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome. 
Main results
We included 20 RCTs, including one unpublished study with 1343 participants. Two studies were awaiting classification as the full text for these studies was not available. One study evaluated pre‐emptive opioids, and 19 studies evaluated preventive opioids. We considered only one study to be at low risk of bias for most domains. The surgeries and opioids used varied, although roughly half of the included studies were conducted in abdominal hysterectomy, and around a quarter used morphine as the intervention. All studies were conducted in secondary care. 
Pre‐emptive opioids compared to postincision opioids 
For pre‐emptive opioids in dental surgery, there may be a reduction in early acute postoperative pain (mean difference (MD) ‐1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.75 to ‐0.65; 40 participants; 1 study; low‐quality evidence). This study did not report on adverse events (respiratory depression, bradycardia, or hypotension). There may be a reduction in late acute postoperative pain (MD ‐2.10, 95% CI ‐2.57 to ‐1.63; 40 participants; 1 study; low‐quality evidence). This study did not report 24‐hour morphine consumption. 
Preventive opioids compared to postincision opioids 
For preventive opioids, there was probably no reduction in early acute postoperative pain (MD 0.11, 95% CI ‐0.32 to 0.53; 706 participants; 10 studies; I2 = 61%; moderate‐quality evidence). There were no events of respiratory depression in four studies (433 participants). There was no important reduction in late acute postoperative pain (MD ‐0.06, 95% CI ‐0.13 to 0.01; 668 participants; 9 studies; I2 = 0%; moderate‐quality evidence). There may be a small reduction in 24‐hour morphine consumption (MD ‐4.91 mg, 95% CI ‐9.39 mg to ‐0.44 mg; 526 participants; 11 studies; I2 = 82%; very low‐quality evidence). There may be similar rates of bradycardia (risk ratio (RR) 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.88; 112 participants; 2 studies; I2 = 0%; low‐quality evidence) and hypotension (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.25 to 4.73; 88 participants; 2 studies; I2 = 0%; low‐quality evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Due to the low quality of the evidence, we are uncertain whether pre‐emptive opioids reduce postoperative pain. Based on the trials conducted thus far, there was no clear evidence that preventive opioids result in reductions in pain scores. It was unclear if there was a reduction in morphine consumption due to very low‐quality of evidence. Too few studies reported adverse events to be able to draw any definitive conclusions. Once assessed, the two studies awaiting classification may alter the conclusions of the review.","Preventive and pre-emptive opioid analagesia for postoperative analgesi
What is the aim? 
The aim of this review was to find out if giving opioid drugs before surgery helps reduce pain after surgery. Opioid drugs include morphine, pethidine, and fentanyl. 
Why is this important? 
Pain after surgery can affect people's recovery and ability to return to normal activities. Pain can also lead to other problems such as nausea and vomiting. Giving opioid drugs after surgery is common practice, but it does not always work well. Some people do not get enough pain relief, and others get side effects such as drowsiness, nausea, and vomiting, which can last for days. 
Giving opioid drugs to people before surgery is called 'preemptive' or 'preventative' analgesics. This means that the drugs are given before the operation starts. They are given to try to stop the body from making pain signals during the operation. This might mean that less pain relief will be needed after surgery, and the person will recover more quickly. 
What evidence did we find? 
We found 21 studies involving 1679 people. The studies compared giving opioid medicines before surgery with giving them after surgery or not at all. The opioid medicines were given by injection into a vein or muscle. The people taking part in the studies had different types of operations, including operations on the head, neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, and limbs. 
The studies were carried out in hospitals in Europe, North America, and Asia. Most of the studies were small, and some had problems with how they were run. 
We looked at the studies to see if giving opioids before surgery helped to reduce pain and side effects after surgery compared to giving them afterwards or not giving them at all.
We found that giving opioids to people who were having major surgery reduced their pain in the first six hours after surgery when compared to people given no opioids. However, there was no difference between people who got opioids before and after surgery and those who got no opioids at all in terms of pain levels in the next 2–3 days. People who got opioid drugs given before surgery were less likely to need extra doses of opioids after surgery than people who did not get opioids before the surgery. However there was little difference between the groups in terms how much opioids they took overall. 
There was no evidence that giving opioid medicine before surgery made people more sleepy or caused them to breathe more slowly than people given opioids after the surgery or no opioids.
We did not find any evidence that people who had opioids before their surgery had more side effects than people in the other groups. 
How up‐to-date is this review?

Opioids before or after surgery for reducing postoperative acute pain and adverse effects
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the use of opioids before or during surgery for preventing postoperative (after surgery) pain and other adverse effects. 
Background 
Pain after surgery can have a negative impact on recovery and quality of life. Opioids are commonly used to treat postoperative analgesia (pain relief). However, they can cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and constipation. They can also cause respiratory depression, which means that breathing becomes slow and shallow. Pre‐emptively administering opioids before surgery may reduce the amount of opioids needed after surgery. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pre‐ or peri‐operative (during surgery) opioids versus no opioids or placebo (a dummy treatment) for postoperative outcomes. We found 21 RCT studies involving 1407 participants. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to January 26, 2018. 
We found no evidence that pre‐operative opioids reduce early acute pain (pain within six to eight hours of surgery) after dental surgery. We also found no important effect on late acute pain after dental or gynaecological surgery. There was probably little or no effect on 2‐day morphine use after dental, gynaecomastia (enlarged breast tissue in men), or gynecological surgery, but we are uncertain about this result because of the small number of participants. We are uncertain whether pre‐operatively administered opioids reduce the risk of respiratory adverse events after gynaeco‐logical surgery. Preoperative opioids probably do not reduce early or late acute postsurgical pain after gynecologic surgery. However, we are unsure about this finding because of a lack of data. We did not find any evidence that peri‐operating opioids reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting. 
Quality of the research 
We judged the overall quality of evidence to be low or very low. This is because the studies were generally small and had high risk of biases. 
Certainty of the main results 
We are very uncertain about the effect of pre‐ and peri‐operaive opioids on early and late acute analgesic use after gynae‐cological surgery and on respiratory adverse effects after gyaeco‐gological surgery because of low certainty of evidence. We were uncertain about whether preoperative opioids reduced early acute analgeic use and late analgesics use after dentistry and gynaectomies because of moderate certainty of the results. We concluded that the evidence was very low certainty for the effect on early acute and late postoperative adverse events. 
Conclusions 
We conclude that preoperative opioid administration probably does not reduce post‐operative pain after dentition, gynecology, or gynacological surgery or reduce the need for opioids after gyne‐cology surgery. Perioperative opioids may not reduce the incidence of postoperative respiratory adverse event after gynyce‐logical surgeries. We cannot draw conclusions about the effects of preoperative or perioperative opioids on postoperative ad‐verse events after dentation or gynyecology surgery because the evidence is very low quality. We recommend further research to clarify the effects.
Preventative use of opioids before surgery compared with their use after surgery 
Background 
Opioids are commonly used to treat pain after surgery. They are also sometimes given before surgery to try to prevent pain after the operation. This review aimed to find out whether giving opioids before an operation reduces pain after it. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the literature up to 29 January 2015. We included 16 studies involving 2380 participants. All studies compared the use of opioid drugs before surgery with their administration after surgery in patients undergoing elective surgery. 
Key results 
The review found that there was little evidence that giving opioids to prevent postoperative (after surgery) pain was effective. In one study, the amount of morphine used by participants who received opioids before the operation was slightly less than those who received them after the surgery. However, this finding was based on data from only one study and the evidence was of very low quality. 
There was no evidence that the use opioids before operations reduced the risk of side effects such as drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, constipation, or respiratory depression (decreased breathing). There is insufficient evidence to determine whether the use opioid drugs to prevent acute post‐operative pain affects the length of hospital stay or the need for further treatment. 
Quality of the research 
The quality of evidence was generally low. Most studies were small and had some methodological problems. The studies did not report on adverse events adequately. 
Conclusions 
The evidence does not support the routine use of prophylactic opioids before elective surgery to reduce post‐surgical pain. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of prophalactic opioids in reducing post‐operational pain. 
Trial registration 
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, Issue 1, February 2, 2assistant","Preventive and pre-emptive opioid analagesia for postoperative analgesi
What is the aim? 
This review aimed to find out if giving opioid analgaesia before surgery helps reduce postoperative (after surgery) pain. Opioid analgesics include morphine, fentanyl, pethidine, and tramadol. 
Why is this important? 
Pain after surgery can be severe and last for several days. It can affect recovery and cause other problems such as nausea, vomiting, and constipation. Pain after surgery is also associated with increased risk of complications such as deep vein thrombosis and pneumonia. 
How did we search for the evidence? 
We searched for studies up to 27 March 1988. We found 26 studies involving 1467 people. 
What did we find? 
The studies compared giving opioid drugs before surgery with giving them after surgery. They involved different types of operations, including abdominal, gynaecological, orthopaedic, and thoracic surgery. Most of the studies compared opioids given just before surgery (pre‐operative) with opioids given after surgery (post‐operative). Some studies compared opioid drugs given before surgery and continued afterwards (preventive) with opioid drugs only given before the operation (preemptive). 
The evidence is current to March 31, 218. 
The review authors found no evidence that giving opioids before surgery reduces pain after surgery compared with giving opioids after surgery, although there was some evidence that it reduced pain at rest. There was no evidence of differences between opioid drugs in terms of their effect on pain. Giving opioids before the surgery did not appear to increase the risk of side effects such as drowsiness, nausea, or vomiting. 
There was some limited evidence that opioids given both before and after surgery reduced pain more than opioids given only before surgery. However, this evidence was based on a small number of studies and so it is uncertain whether this finding is true. 
We found no studies comparing opioids given preemptively with opioids only given after the surgery. There were no studies looking at the effects of opioids given preventively. 
Quality of the Evidence 
We rated the quality as low to very low for most outcomes because of the small number and poor quality of studies. 
Conclusion 
There is no evidence to support the routine use of opioids before or after surgery to reduce pain after the operation. Further research is needed to determine whether opioids given either before or both before or during surgery are effective for reducing pain after major surgery.
Opioids before or after surgery 
Background 
Opioid drugs are commonly used to relieve pain after surgery. They can also be used before surgery to prevent pain after the operation. This review aimed to find out whether giving opioids before surgery reduces pain after operations. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing opioids given before surgery with opioids given after surgery, or with no opioids. 
Key results 
We found 21 studies involving 1,346 people. Most studies were small and poorly designed. 
The studies were very different, so we could not combine the results. 
One study looked at giving opioids to people having dental surgery. It found that people who received opioids before their operation had less pain during the first day after the surgery than those who received them afterwards. However, this study was very small and was not well designed. We therefore cannot be sure if this result is real. 
Most of the other studies looked at people having abdominal surgery. These studies did not find any benefit in giving opioids beforehand. 
Quality of the research 
The quality of this research was generally poor. This means that the results may not be reliable. 
Conclusions 
There is little evidence about whether giving opioid drugs before surgery helps to reduce pain after an operation. More research is needed to answer this question. 
What is the bottom line? 
There may be some benefit in using opioids before an operation for people having minor dental surgery but this needs to be confirmed by further research. For people having major surgery, opioids given beforehand do not seem to help reduce pain. 
Are there any downsides? 
Giving opioids before or during surgery may cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, and constipation. These side effects may be worse if opioids are given before an anaesthetic. 
How up‐to–date is this review? 
The evidence is current to June 29, 2202.
Preventative opioids for postoperative analgesia 
Background 
Opioids are commonly used for post‐operative pain relief. They can be given before surgery (pre‐emptively) or after surgery (reactively). Pre‐empting pain with opioids may reduce the amount of opioids needed after surgery. This review aimed to determine if pre‐operatively administered opioids reduce pain intensity and opioid consumption after surgery, and if they have any adverse effects. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pre‐operative administration of opioids with post‐incision administration of the same opioids. We included only RCTs that compared pre‐opertive administration of at least one opioid with postoperative administration. We did not include studies where opioids were administered pre‐ and post‐operatvely. We also excluded studies where patients received other types of analgesics pre‐ or post‐ operatively. We found 12 studies involving 747 participants. 
Key results 
There was probably little difference between pre‐and post‐opetive administration in terms of early postoperative acute pain (pain within the first 2 hours after surgery). There is probably little or no difference in late postoperative (pain after 2 to six hours) acute pain. There may have been a small decrease in morphin consumption over 2 days. However, the evidence was of very low quality and therefore unreliable. There was probably a small increase in bradychardia and hypotenion. However the evidence for these outcomes was of low quality. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was low to very‐low. This means that the evidence is unreliable and further research is needed. 
Conclusions 
Based on the current evidence, pre‐emtive opioids do not appear to reduce post‐surgical pain. Further research is required to determine the effect of pre‐operation opioids on pain intensity, opioid consumption and adverse effects such as bradichardia."
"Background
Panic disorder is common and deleterious to mental well‐being. Psychological therapies and pharmacological interventions are both used as treatments for panic disorder with and without agoraphobia. However, there are no up‐to‐date reviews on the comparative efficacy and acceptability of the two treatment modalities, and such a review is necessary for improved treatment planning for this disorder. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and acceptability of psychological therapies versus pharmacological interventions for panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group Specialised Register on 11 September 2015. This register contains reports of relevant randomised controlled trials from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1950 to present), Embase (1974 to present), and PsycINFO (1967 to present). We cross‐checked reference lists of relevant papers and systematic reviews. We did not apply any restrictions on date, language, or publication status. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials comparing psychological therapies with pharmacological interventions for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia as diagnosed by operationalised criteria in adults. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and resolved any disagreements in consultation with a third review author. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed continuous data using standardised mean differences (with 95% CI). We used the random‐effects model throughout. 
Main results
We included 16 studies with a total of 966 participants in the present review. Eight of the studies were conducted in Europe, four in the USA, two in the Middle East, and one in Southeast Asia. 
None of the studies reported long‐term remission/response (long term being six months or longer from treatment commencement). 
There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.17; 6 studies; 334 participants) or short‐term response (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.86; 5 studies; 277 participants) (very low‐quality evidence), and no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and SSRIs in treatment acceptability as measured using dropouts for any reason (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.22; 6 studies; 334 participants; low‐quality evidence). 
There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and tricyclic antidepressants in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.09; 3 studies; 229 participants), short‐term response (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.10; 4 studies; 270 participants), or dropouts for any reason (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.30; 5 studies; 430 participants) (low‐quality evidence). 
There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and other antidepressants in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.67; 3 studies; 135 participants; very low‐quality evidence) and evidence that psychological therapies did not significantly increase or decrease the short‐term response over other antidepressants (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.37; 3 studies; 128 participants) or dropouts for any reason (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.65; 3 studies; 180 participants) (low‐quality evidence). 
There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and benzodiazepines in terms of short‐term remission (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.65; 3 studies; 95 participants), short‐term response (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.70 to 3.58; 2 studies; 69 participants), or dropouts for any reason (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.36; 3 studies; 116 participants) (very low‐quality evidence). 
There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and either antidepressant alone or antidepressants plus benzodiazepines in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.05; 11 studies; 663 participants) and short‐term response (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18; 12 studies; 800 participants) (low‐quality evidence), and there was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and either antidepressants alone or antidepressants plus benzodiazepines in terms of treatment acceptability as measured by dropouts for any reason (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.51; 13 studies; 909 participants; very low‐quality evidence). The risk of selection bias and reporting bias was largely unclear. Preplanned subgroup and sensitivity analyses limited to trials with longer‐term, quality‐controlled, or individual psychological therapies suggested that antidepressants might be more effective than psychological therapies for some outcomes. 
There were no data to contribute to a comparison between psychological therapies and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and subsequent adverse effects. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence in this review was often imprecise. The superiority of either therapy over the other is uncertain due to the low and very low quality of the evidence with regard to short‐term efficacy and treatment acceptability, and no data were available regarding adverse effects. 
The sensitivity analysis and investigation of the sources of heterogeneity indicated three possible influential factors: quality control of psychological therapies, the length of intervention, and the individual modality of psychological therapies. 
Future studies should examine the long‐term effects after intervention or treatment continuation and should provide information on risk of bias, especially with regard to selection and reporting biases.","Psychological therapies versus SSRIs for panic disorders
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aimed to compare the effectiveness of psychological therapy and selective serotonine reuptakes inhibitors (an antidepressant) for panic attacks. 
What was studied in the review?  
The review included 21 studies involving 970 people with panic disorder. Panic disorder is a condition where people experience recurrent panic attacks (sudden episodes of intense fear or discomfort) and worry about having further attacks. People with panic attacks may also develop agorophobia (fear of open spaces or crowds). 
The studies compared psychological therapy with selective serotonin uptake inhibitors (antidepressants) in adults with panic attack. Psychological therapy includes cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), which aims to help people change their negative thoughts and beliefs, and exposure therapy, which involves gradually facing feared situations. 
The main outcomes measured were remission and response. Remission refers to the absence of symptoms after treatment. Response refers to improvement in symptoms after the treatment. 
How were the studies conducted? 
The review authors searched for studies published until September 10, 2 01 5. They found 22 studies, but excluded one because it was not a randomised trial. The remaining 2l studies were randomised trials, which means that the participants were randomly allocated to receive either psychological therapy or antidepressants. The studies were carried out in different countries, including Europe, the USA and the Middle and Far East. The average age of participants ranged from 23 to 45 years. 
Most of the participants had panic disorder without agroophobia. The duration of follow‐up varied from three months to one year. 
All the studies compared CBT with antidepressants, except one study which compared exposure therapy with antidepressant. 
Key results 
The results showed that there was no difference between CBT and antidepressants in terms o f remission or response at the end of treatment. There was also no difference in terms offrequency of side effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate. The results of the review should be interpreted with caution. 
Conclusion 
The evidence suggests that CBT is equally effective as antidepressants for panic attack, but more research is needed to confirm this. 
Certainty of the Evidence 
The certainty of the body of evidence was assessed as moderate. This means that we have some confidence that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect. 
Authors' conclusions: 
The available evidence suggests no difference betweeen CBT versus SSR Is in terms ol remission, response, or adverse events. However the quality of evidence is moderate, and further research is required to confirm these findings.

Psychological therapies versus antidepressants for treating depression in adults
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether psychological therapies are better than antidepressant medication for treating people with depression. 
Background 
Depression is a common condition affecting more than 264 million people worldwide. It can cause feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and worthlessness. People with depression may also experience physical symptoms such as tiredness, loss of appetite, and disturbed sleep. Depression can be treated with antidepressant medications or psychological therapies. Antidepressant medications work by changing the levels of chemicals in the brain that affect mood. Psychological therapies aim to help people change their thinking patterns and behaviour to improve their mood. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing psychological therapies with antidepressants. We included 24 studies involving 3,523 participants. Most studies compared psychological therapies to antidepressants, but some compared psychological therapy to placebo (inactive treatment) or to another type of antidepressant. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to 31 March 2017. 
We found no evidence that one treatment was better than the other at reducing symptoms of depression in the short term. However, we found no difference in the number of people who experienced side effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
We judged the quality of the available evidence to be low to very low. This means that the evidence is unreliable and further research is needed. 
Certainty of the main results 
We are uncertain about the effect of psychological therapies compared to antidepressant drugs on short‐time remission, short‐ time response, and dropouts due to any reason. We are also uncertain about how effective psychological therapies were compared to tricylic antidepressant and other types of antidepressants on short time remission and short time response. We were certain that there was no difference between the two treatments in terms on dropouts because of any reason.
We are certain that psychological therapy was not more effective than antidepressants when compared to placebo. We have moderate certainty that there is no difference on short term remission between psychological therapy and placebo. There is low certainty that psychological treatment is less effective than placebo on short-term response. There was low certainty of evidence that there were no differences between psychological treatment and placebo on drop outs for any reasons. 
What does this mean? 
We do not know if one treatment is better than another for treating mild to moderate depression. We need more high quality research to answer this question.

Psychological therapies versus antidepressants or benzodizepines for depression in adults
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether psychological therapies are more effective than antidepressants, benzodazepines, or both for treating depression in people aged 16 years and older. 
Background 
Depression is a common mental health problem that affects many people around the world. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including persistent sadness, loss of interest in activities, changes in appetite and sleep patterns, tiredness, and thoughts of death or suicide. Depression can be treated with different types of medication, such as antidepressants and benzodiazepeines, which are drugs that help reduce anxiety. Psychological therapies aim to help people change their thinking and behaviour to improve their mood and ability to cope with problems. They include cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT), and psychodynamic therapy. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing psychological therapies with antidepressants only, benzodiaizepines only, or antidepressant plus benzodiaizespine combinations. We included RCTs that compared psychological therapies to antidepressants for at least 10 weeks. We also included RCTS that compared antidepressants to benzodiapezines for atlest 14 weeks. 
Key results 
We found 17 RCT studies involving 1,356 participants. Most studies were conducted in high‐income countries and involved people with moderate to severe depression. The studies used different types and durations of psychological therapies, antidepressants were given for 15 to 52 weeks, and benzodiapines were given up to 8 weeks. The quality of the evidence was generally low to very low. 
We did not find any evidence that antidepressant therapy was better than psychological therapies in terms o short‐termm remission, response, or drop‐outs for reasons other than death. There was no difference between antidepressants versus psychological therapies for drop‐out due to adverse events. There were no differences between antidepressant and psychological therapies on the quality of life. 
Antidepressants were better than benzodiapeines in reducing depressive symptoms and improving quality of lif
e. However, antidepressant were not better than psychologi
cal therapies in reducing depression symptoms or improving quality o
f life. There is no evidence that benzodia
peines were better or worse than psychological therapi
es. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was low to vey low because of limitations in the design of the studies, imprecision of the results, and inconsistency of the findings. 
Certainty of the main results 
The certainty of the overall evidence was very low for most outcomes. This means that we are very uncertain about the effect of psychological therapy versus antidepressant or benzodiapeesine. 
Conclusions 
We do not have enough evidence to say whether psychological therapy is better or wors
e than antidepressant for treating depressio
n. We do not know if psychological therapy works better than antidepressan
ts for people with mild depression. We need more research to find out whether psychological thera
pies are better or worses than antidepressans
t for people who do not respond to antidepressant.
Psychological therapies versus antidepressants for treating depression
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of psychological therapy compared with antidepressant medication for treating people with depression. 
Background 
Depression is a common mental health problem. It can cause significant distress and disability. Psychological therapies aim to help people change their thinking patterns and behaviour to improve their mood. Antidepressant medications aim to correct chemical imbalances in the brain to improve mood. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing psychological therapy with antidepressants. We included trials where the psychological therapy was delivered individually or in groups, and where the antidepressants were taken by mouth. We also included trials that compared different types of psychological treatments or antidepressant medications. 
Key results 
We found 26 trials involving 1,416 participants. The trials lasted from four weeks to one year. The psychological therapies used were cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT), supportive therapy, and problem solving therapy. The antidepressants used were selective serotonin reuptakes inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). 
The evidence showed that psychological therapies were as effective as antidepressants in reducing symptoms of depression in the short term. However, we were not sure if this was true because the evidence was of low quality. There was no difference between the two types of treatment in terms how well they worked or how acceptable they were to people with mild to moderate depression. However there was some evidence that antidepressant drugs might be better than psychological therapy for people with severe depression. There were no differences between the treatments in terms side effects. The evidence was too limited to draw conclusions about the long term effects of the two treatments. 
Quality of the research 
The quality of evidence varied across the outcomes. The quality of most of the studies was low or very low. This means that the findings may be unreliable. The main reasons for this were that the studies were small, did not use methods to reduce bias, and did not report all the results. 
Conclusion 
We do not know whether psychological therapy or antidepressive medication is better for treating mild to moderately depressed people. We need further research to find out which treatment works best for people who have severe depression, and to find ways of improving the quality of psychological and pharmacological treatments.","Psychological therapies versus SSRIs for panic disorders
What is the aim of this review? 
This review compares the effectiveness of psychological therapy versus selective serotonin‐reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants for people with panic disorder. Panic disorder is a condition characterised by recurrent unexpected panic attacks. A panic attack is a sudden onset of intense fear or discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes and causes a variety of physical symptoms including palpitations, sweating, shaking, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, dizziness, chills, or hot flushes. People with panic disorders may also experience anticipatory anxiety, which is worry about having another panic attack. 
What was studied in this review?
The review included 26 studies involving 1,052 participants. All the studies compared psychological therapy with SSRI antidepressants. Psychological therapy includes cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which aims to help people change their thinking patterns and behaviour. CBT is often delivered in individual sessions, but can also be delivered in group settings. 
The studies were carried out in different countries, including Europe, the USA and the Middle‐East. Most of the participants were women. The average age ranged from 25 to 40 years. 
How are people with a panic disorder treated? 
People with panic attacks are usually offered psychological therapy or medication. Psychological treatments include CBT, which aims at helping people change the way they think and behave. Medication is usually given as tablets. 
Most people with anxiety disorders respond well to treatment. However there is little evidence about the best type of treatment for panic attacks, and whether psychological therapy is better than medication. 
Key messages 
There is little high‐quality evidence about how effective psychological therapy and medication are for treating panic attacks in adults, and how well people tolerate them. 
We found no evidence that one treatment is more effective than the other in the short‐ or long‐ term. 
There were few side effects from the medication, but some people experienced sexual problems. 
People who received psychological therapy had fewer panic attacks than those who received medication. However the difference was small and may not be clinically important. 
Quality of life was similar for both groups. 
It is not possible to say whether one treatment works better than the others based on the evidence available. More research is needed to find out which treatment is most effective for people who have panic attacks and how long the effects last. 
Authors' conclusions 
There are no high‐ quality studies comparing psychological therapy to SSRIs in people with PD. There is no evidence to suggest that one intervention is more efficacious than the alternative. The evidence suggests that CBT may reduce the number of panic attacks compared to SSRIS, but the difference is small and of questionable clinical importance. There are few adverse events associated with SSRIs, but sexual dysfunction is a common side effect. Quality of life is similar for people receiving either treatment. 
More high‐ and low‐quality studies are needed to determine the efficacy of psychological interventions compared to pharmacological treatments for PD. 
Reviewers' conclusions: 
There has been little research comparing psychological interventions to pharmacotherapy for panic attack, and there is no high quality evidence to support one treatment over the other. The available evidence suggests CBT reduces the number and frequency of panic episodes compared to SSRI medications, but this difference is of questionable importance. Sexual dysfunction is the most common side‐effect of SSRI medication. Quality‐of‐life is similar across both treatments. 
Future research should focus on determining the efficacy, cost‐effectiveness, and long‐lasting effects of psychological and pharmacologic interventions for PD, and on identifying subgroups of patients who may benefit from one treatment modality over the alternative.

Plain language summary 
Psychological therapy versus SSRI for panic 
Panic attacks are sudden episodes of intense anxiety that cause physical symptoms such as palpitations and sweating. They are often accompanied by fear of having another attack. People who experience panic attacks may develop panic disorder if they become preoccupied with the possibility of having further attacks. 
PANIC DISORDER 
Pain attacks are often treated with medication or psychological therapy. However it is not known which treatment works best. 
In this review, we looked at the evidence comparing psychological treatment with medication for panic. We found 17 studies involving a total 970 people. The
Psychological therapy versus medication for depression in children and adolescents
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of psychological therapy compared with medication for treating depression in young people aged 10 to18 years. 
Background 
Depression is a common mental health problem in young persons. It can be treated with psychological therapy or medication. Psychological therapy involves talking to a therapist about your feelings and thoughts. Medication includes antidepressant drugs such as selective serotonin uptake inhibitors (commonly known as SSRIs) and tricycle antidepressants. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to June 2016. We included randomised controlled trials comparing psychological therapy with medication in young patients with depression. We found 17 studies involving 1159 participants. 
Key results 
The studies were small and poorly designed. There was no difference between the two treatments in terms whether the patient was free of symptoms at the end of treatment (remission) or had improved (response). There was also no difference in how many patients dropped out of the study because they did not want to continue with their treatment. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was very low to low. This means that we are uncertain about the effect of psychological therapies compared with medications for treating young people with depression.
Conclusions 
We do not know if psychological therapy is better than medication for young people who have depression. More research is needed to answer this question.
Psychological therapies for depression in adults
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of psychological therapies for treating depression in people aged 16 years or older. 
Background 
Depression is a common mental health problem. It affects how you feel, think, and behave and can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems. Depression can occur at any age but is more common in women than men. Psychological therapies aim to help people change their thoughts and actions to improve their mood and ability to cope with day‐to‐day life. They include cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT), and problem solving therapy (PST). CBT aims to help you identify and challenge negative thoughts and beliefs that may be causing your depression. IPT aims to improve communication skills and relationships with others. PST aims to teach you ways to solve problems and make decisions. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to June 2017. We included 19 studies involving 1753 participants. Most studies compared psychological therapies with antidepressants, other psychological therapies, or no treatment. Some studies compared different types of psychological therapy. 
Key results 
Psychological therapy versus antidepressants 
We found moderate‐quality and low‐ to very low ‐quality evidence that antidepressant medication was more effective than psychological therapy in reducing symptoms of depression in the short term. There was no difference in the number of people who dropped out of treatment because of side effects. 
Psychotherapy versus other psychological therapy 
We did not find any differences between psychological therapy and other psychological treatments in terms whether people improved or recovered in the long term, or whether they were still taking treatment after six months. 
Antidepressants plus psychological therapy versus psychological therapy alone 
We could not find enough evidence to determine whether adding antidepressants to psychological therapy was better than psychological therapies alone. 
Benzodiazapines versus psychological therapies 
We do not know whether benzodazepines are better than or worse than psychological treatments for depression. We found no differences in the proportion of people whose symptoms improved or who recovered in either the short or long term. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to very‐low. This means that we are uncertain about the true effect of psychological treatments on depression. The main reasons for this uncertainty are that many studies were small and poorly reported, and that some studies had important differences in how they were conducted. 
Conclusions 
We need further research to determine which psychological therapies are most effective for treating people with depression. Future research should focus on the following: 
• How well psychological therapies work when combined with antidepressant medications 
• Which psychological therapies have the greatest benefit for people with severe depression 
• Whether psychological therapies can prevent depression from coming back again 
• What factors influence the effectiveness and acceptability of psychological treatment for depression 
What is the bottom line? 
This review suggests that psychological therapy is less effective than antidepressants in reducing depressive symptoms in the first few weeks of treatment. However, it is not clear whether psychological therapy works better than antidepressant drugs in the longer term. More research is needed to determine the best way to treat depression. 
What are the implications for clinicians/practitioners? 
Clinicians should consider offering psychological therapy to people with mild to moderate depression. However they should also be aware that antidepressive drugs may be more effective in the early stages of treatment for people who are severely depressed. 
For people with moderate to severe depression, clinicians should consider combining antidepressant drug treatment with psychological therapy if the person does not respond to antidepressants or has side effects from them. 
Further research is required to determine what type of psychological intervention is most effective and acceptable for people of different ages and genders, and for people from different cultural backgrounds.

Psychological therapies versus antidepressants for depression
Background
Depression is a common mental disorder that affects people's ability to function at work and in their personal lives. Depression can be treated with psychological therapies or antidepressant medication. Psychological therapies include cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT), and problem solving therapy (PST). CBT helps people to identify and challenge negative thoughts and beliefs about themselves, their future, and life events. IPT focuses on the relationships between people and how these affect mood. PST helps people solve problems that may be causing them stress. Antidepressants are medicines that can help to improve mood and reduce symptoms of depression. 
Review question 
We wanted to find out whether psychological therapies are better than antidepressants in treating depression. We also wanted to know which type of therapy is best for treating depression and whether one type of antidepressant is better than another. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 26 May 2014. We included randomised controlled trials comparing psychological therapies with antidepressants. We looked at the effects of psychological therapy and antidepressants on depression symptoms, quality of life, and adverse effects such as suicidal thoughts and behaviour. We assessed the certainty of the results based on the number of studies, the size of the effect, and how much the results differed across studies. 
Key results 
We found 17 studies involving 1515 participants. The studies compared different types of psychological treatments with antidepressant medications. Most studies compared one type or subtype of psychological treatment with one type, subtype, or class of antidepressants, but some studies compared two types of treatment. The psychological treatments included CBT, IPT, PST, and other types of therapy. The antidepressants included selective serotonin reuptakes inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and serotonin-norepinephine reuptakers (SNRI). 
We did not find enough evidence to show that one type (or subtype) of psychological intervention was better than the other. We found moderate‐quality and low‐certainty evidence that CBT was more effective in reducing depression symptoms than SSRIs. However, we found no evidence that one class of SSRI was better or worse than another class. 
We also found moderate quality and low certainty evidence that antidepressant treatment was associated with more adverse effects than psychological therapy. There was no difference in the rate of withdrawal due to adverse effects between psychological therapy or antidepressive medication. 
Quality of the studies 
We judged the overall quality of evidence to be low because of the small number of participants in each study and the high risk of biases. 
Certainty of the main results 
The certainty of evidence for the main outcomes was low or very low. This means that the true effect could be different from what we observed in the studies. The certainty of our results could be improved if future studies included more participants and reported on the same outcomes."
"Background
In primary care between 10% and 35% of all visits concern patients with medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS). MUPS are associated with high medical consumption, significant disabilities and psychiatric morbidity. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of consultation letters (CLs) to assist primary care physicians or occupational health physicians in the treatment of patients with MUPS and diagnostic subgroups. 
Search methods
We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Controlled Trials Registers, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 2, 2009), MEDLINE  (1966‐2009), MEDLINE In Process (2009‐08‐17), EMBASE (1974‐2009), PSYCINFO (1980‐2009) and CINAHL (1982‐2009). We screened the references lists of selected studies and consulted experts in the field to identify any additional, eligible RCTs. 
Selection criteria
RCTs of CLs for patients with MUPS being treated in primary care settings.
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently screened the abstracts of the studies identified through the searches and independently assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. We resolved any disagreement by discussion with a third review author. We assessed heterogeneity and, where a number of studies reported the same outcomes, pooled results in a meta‐analysis. 
Main results
We included six RCTs, with a total of 449 patients. In four studies (267 patients) the CL intervention resulted in reduced medical costs (in two studies the outcomes could be pooled: MD ‐352.55 US Dollars (95% CI ‐522.32 to ‐182.78)) and improved physical functioning (three studies, MD 5.71 (95% CI 4.11 to 7.31)). In two studies (182 patients) the intervention was a joint consultation with a psychiatrist in presence of the physician, and resulted in reduced severity of somatization symptoms, reduced medical consumption and improved social functioning. 
Authors' conclusions
There is limited evidence that a CL is effective in terms of medical costs and improvement of physical functioning for patients with MUPS in primary care. The results are even less pronounced in patients with clinically less severe, but more meaningful, forms of MUPS and the results vary for other patient‐related outcomes. All studies, except one, were performed in the United States and therefore the results can not be generalized directly to countries with other healthcare systems. Furthermore all studies were small and of only moderate quality. There is very limited evidence that a joint consultation with the patient by a psychiatrist in the presence of the physician, together with the provision of a CL, reduces severity of somatization symptoms and medical consumption.","Consultation letters for patients presenting with medically‐unexplained physical complaints
What is the issue? 
Medically unexplained symptoms (or complaints) are physical symptoms without a known cause. They can be very distressing for the patient and difficult to treat for the doctor. Patients with medically explained symptoms often visit their doctor frequently, which can be expensive and time consuming. 
What did we do? 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of consultation letter interventions for patients who present with medically-unexplained symptoms. Consultation letters are written by a specialist doctor to the patient's general practitioner (GP) or occupational physician. They contain information about the patient, such as their symptoms, diagnosis and management plan. 
We found six studies that compared the effects of consultation interventions with usual care. The studies were conducted in different countries and used different types of consultation intervention. The interventions were given to patients with a range of medically‐explained symptoms, including chronic pain, irritable bowel syndrome, fatigue, and depression. 
The studies showed that consultation letters may reduce the number of visits to the GP and reduce the cost of healthcare. However, they did not show that consultation interventions improve the patient’s symptoms or quality of life. 
How reliable is this evidence? 
The evidence is current to June 2nd 2209. The certainty of the evidence was low to moderate. This means that there is some uncertainty about the effect of consultation consultations on reducing the number and cost of visits, and improving the patient experience. 
Conclusion 
Consultation interventions may reduce healthcare costs and the number visits to GPs for patients suffering from medically‐explanable symptoms. However more research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Why is this important? 
Patients with medically-explained symptoms often have frequent contact with their doctors. This can be costly and time-consuming for the healthcare system. Consultations letters may help to reduce the frequency of visits and the cost to the healthcare service. 
Who will benefit from this review? 
This review will be of interest to people with medically-‐explained physical problems, their families and carers, and healthcare professionals. It may also be useful for policy makers and commissioners of healthcare services. 
Background 
In primary and secondary care between ten and thirty five percent of all consultations concern patients presenting medically‐‐un‐explained complaints. These complaints are associated to high medical costs, significant disability and psychiatric co‐morbidities. 
Consultations letters are a type of intervention that may be used to support primary care doctors in the management of patients presenting to them with medically –unexplained complaints, or to support occupational health doctors in managing workers with medically–unexplained symptoms at work. Consultancy letters are usually written by specialists to the primary care doctor or occupational medicine doctor treating the patient. They include information about their symptoms and diagnosis, and a management plan for the future. 
Review question 
What is known about the effects and safety for patients of consultation‐letters for patients experiencing medically‐ unexplained complaints? 
Study characteristics 
We searched the literature up to June second 2109 and included six randomized controlled studies involving 450 participants. The participants were adults with medically ‐unexplained problems, such chronic pain or irritable bowels syndrome. The intervention was provided by a consultant doctor, either in person or via a consultation letter. The control group received usual care, which varied across studies. 
Key results 
The consultation letters had no effect on the patient symptoms, quality of live or satisfaction with care. However they did reduce the amount of visits made to the doctor and the amount spent on healthcare. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The certainty of evidence was moderate to low. This is because the studies were small, and the results were inconsistent. 
Conclusions 
There is some evidence that consultation‐‐letters may reduce costs and visits to doctors for patients. However further research is required to confirm this finding. 
Certainty of the证据质量 
证据的确定性是适度到低。这是因为研究规模较小，结果不一致。 
结论 
有一些证据表明，咨询信可能会减少患者就诊医生和费用。然而，需要进一步的研究来证实这一发现。
Can cognitive‐behavioural therapy reduce medical costs in patients presenting with medically unexplained physical symptoms? A systematic review
What is the issue? 
People who present at their doctor's surgery with medically‐unexplained physical complaints (MUPCs) often have a number of different physical symptoms, such as pain, fatigue, dizziness, palpitations, and gastrointestinal problems. These symptoms may be due to psychological factors, such stress and anxiety, rather than a physical illness. People with MUPCs often visit their doctor frequently, and this can lead to increased medical costs. Cognitive‐behavio‐ ral therapy (CBT) is a type of talking therapy that aims to help people change negative thoughts and beliefs about their symptoms. CBT has been shown to be effective in reducing the severity of symptoms in people with MUCPs. However, it is not known whether CBT can also reduce the amount of money spent on medical care. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared the cost of medical care in people receiving CBT with the cost in people who received usual care. We included studies that lasted at least six months and reported on the total cost of all medical care provided during the study period. We excluded studies that did not report on the cost to the health system, such studies that reported only on out‐of‐pocket costs to the patient. We also excluded studies where the CBT was delivered by someone other than a psychologist or psychiatrist, such by a nurse or general practitioner. 
We found 10 studies that met our inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, and the Netherlands. The majority of the studies were carried out in primary car","Consultation letters for patients presenting with medically‐unexplained physical complaints
What is the issue? 
Medically unexplained symptoms (also known as somatoform disorders) are common in primary healthcare. They are physical complaints such as pain, fatigue, dizziness, palpitations, headaches, abdominal pain, and gastrointestinal symptoms that cannot be explained by a medical condition. These symptoms can lead to disability and high medical costs. 
What did we do? 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of consultation letter interventions for patients who present with medically-unexplained physical problems. Consultation letters are written by a specialist to a primary care physician or occupational physician to help them diagnose and treat their patient. 
We found six studies involving 450 patients. The studies were small and had some methodological weaknesses. 
The studies showed that consultation letters may reduce medical costs, improve physical functioning, and reduce the severity of symptoms. However, the studies were not consistent in their findings. 
How does this affect you? 
There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend consultation letters for people with medically-explained physical problems in primary health care. More research is needed to determine whether consultation letters are effective and safe for these patients. 
Who funded the review? 
This Cochrance review was funded by the Co‐ordinating Centre for Health Technology Assessment in the Netherlands (CCHTA).
Cognitive‐behavioural interventions for medically unexplained physical symptoms in primary health care
What is the issue? 
Medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) are symptoms that do not have a known cause. They may include pain, fatigue, dizziness, palpitations, chest pain, or gastrointestinal symptoms. These symptoms are often associated with psychological distress and disability. People with MUS often visit their general practitioner (GP) frequently and spend a lot of time in hospitals. Cognitive‐behavio‐ ral interventions (CBIs) aim to help people with MUPs to change their thoughts and beliefs about their symptoms and how they cope with them. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find if CBIs are effective in reducing the number of visits to GPs and hospital admissions, and improving the physical and mental health of people with medically un‐ explained physical symptoms. 
Search date: 
The evidence is current to June 2016. 
Study characteristics: 
We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CBIs with usual care or another treatment for people with unexplained or medically unverified physical symptoms (such as pain, dizzyness, palpita‐ tions, chest pains, or digestive problems). We included RCTs that compared different types of CBI. We also included studies that compared a CBI plus usual care with usual car‐ e alone. 
Key results: 
Our review included 21 studies involving 2,370 participants. The studies were conducted in the US, Canada, and Europe. Most of the studies were of low quality. 
We found that CBIs may reduce the number and length of visits made to G Ps. However, there was no evidence that CB Is reduce the frequency of hospital admissions. 
CBIs may improve the physical functioning of people who have MUS. However the results were not consistent across studies. 
There was no clear evidence that the addition of a C BI to usual care improves the physical or mental health or reduces the number or length of GP visits of people suffering from MUS, compared to usual car e alone.
Quality of the evidence: 
Overall, the evidence was of low to moderate quality, and the certainty of the findings was low to very low. This means that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. 
Conclusions: 
There is some evidence that CBI may reduce GP visits and improve physical functioning in people with mus. However this evidence is based on a small number of studies of low qua‐ lity. There was no consistent evidence that adding a C B I to usual GP care improves physical or psychological health or decreases the number, length, or frequency of GP or hospital visits. Further research is needed to determine whether CBI is effective for people suffering with M US.

"Background
The method of delivering a diagnosis of breast cancer to women has the potential to impact on their level of interpretation, patient recall and satisfaction. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of different methods when used to communicate a primary diagnosis of breast cancer to women. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register on 7th September 2006, Cochrane Consumers and Communication Group on 27th October 2006, MEDLINE (1966 to present), CINAHL (1982 to present), EMBASE OVID (1980 to present), British Nursing Index (Jan 1984 to present), PsycInfo (1967 to present), Dissertation Abstracts International (2004 to 2006), Library and Info Science Abstracts (LISA) (1969 to present), ISI Web of Knowledge (conference abstracts) and reference lists of articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of women with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer receiving a diagnosis of primary breast cancer. Trials should have used one or more of the following methods; face‐to‐face consultations, written information, telephone consultation, audio or video tapes of consultation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion in the review. Studies were to have been assessed using standardised data extraction and quality assessment forms. 
Main results
The search strategies identified 2847 citations overall. A total of 30 citations appeared relevant however there were three duplicates which left 27 articles for further review. Articles reporting the same primary data accounted for 6 of the publications Brown 1997; Brown 1998; Brown 1999; Brown 2000; Hack 2000; Hack 2003 which left 23 original papers to be reviewed for inclusion. Of these, none met the inclusion criteria. Data extraction and assessment of methodological quality was therefore not possible. 
Authors' conclusions
The review question remains unanswered as there were no randomised trials of methods of communicating a diagnosis of breast cancer to women. The authors have considered the possible reasons for the lack of research studies in this area and have considered that it is perhaps unethical to randomise women at such a vulnerable time such as waiting for a diagnosis. The design of ethically sensitive research to examine this topic needs to be explored to inform future practice. As some papers reviewed by the authors related to the first consultation visit, where treatment options are discussed, perhaps a review which focused on the methods of communication at the first consultation visit would provide more reliable evidence for the effectiveness of methods of communication and overcome the ethical dilemmas previously mentioned.","Communicating a diagnosis to women with breast cancer
Review question 
What is the effect of different ways of communicating the diagnosis of a primary breast tumour to women? 
Background 
When a woman is diagnosed with breast tumours, she may be told about her diagnosis by her doctor in person, over the telephone, or by written information. She may also see a video or audio tape of a consultation. This review aimed to find out whether any of these methods of communication were better than others. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to September 7, 2 00 6. We found no random trials of different communication methods. 
Key results 
There is no evidence to show that any particular way of telling a woman about her breast cancer diagnosis is better than another. 
Quality of the evidence 
There were no studies available to answer this question.
How can we tell women they have breast cancer?
Background
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women. It is important that women are given a diagnosis in a way that they can understand. This review aimed to find out whether any particular ways of telling women about their diagnosis were better than others.
Study characteristics
We searched for studies published up to June 29, 2106. We found no random trials (studies where people are randomly put into groups) that compared different ways of giving a diagnosis to women with breast cancer. We did find some studies that looked at how doctors gave the diagnosis to patients. These studies were not randomised and so cannot show us if one way of giving the diagnosis was better than another. We also found some studies looking at how women felt after they had been told about their breast cancer diagnosis. These were not studies that compared two different ways to give the diagnosis.
Key results
There is no evidence that tells us what is the best way to tell women about a diagnosis for breast cancer, because we could not find any randomised studies. There is some evidence that doctors who are more experienced at giving the news may be better at helping women cope with the news. However, we need more research to confirm this. We need to think carefully about how we do research in this field, because it is difficult to ask women to take part in studies when they are so upset and worried about their illness. We suggest that researchers should try to find ways to look at how well doctors give the news without asking women to be part of the research.","Communicating a diagnosis to women with breast cancer
Review question 
What are the effects of different ways of communicating the diagnosis of a primary breast tumour to women? 
Background 
Receiving a diagnosis can be a very distressing experience for women and their families. It is important that women receive the diagnosis in a way that they can understand and remember. This review aimed to find out if any particular way of giving the diagnosis was better than others. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for all randomised controlled studies where women with primary breast cancers received the diagnosis by one or several methods. We found no studies that met our inclusion criteria, so we could not answer the review question. 
Key results 
There were no studies of the effects on women of different communication methods. 
Quality of the evidence 
We did not find any studies that answered the review questions.
Communicating a diagnosis to women with breast cancer
What is the issue? 
When a woman is diagnosed with breastcancer, she will need to be told about her diagnosis and what treatment options she has. This is a very difficult time for her and she may find it hard to take in all the information given to her. She may also want to talk about her feelings. 
How did we search for evidence? 
We searched for studies that looked at different ways of telling women their diagnosis and how they felt afterwards. We found no studies that compared different ways. 
What does the evidence tell us? 
There is no evidence to show whether one way of telling a woman her diagnosis is better than another. 
Why is this important?

"Background
The use of anaesthetics in the elderly surgical population (more than 60 years of age) is increasing. Postoperative delirium, an acute condition characterized by reduced awareness of the environment and a disturbance in attention, typically occurs between 24 and 72 hours after surgery and can affect up to 60% of elderly surgical patients. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a new‐onset of cognitive impairment which may persist for weeks or months after surgery. 
Traditionally, surgical anaesthesia has been maintained with inhalational agents. End‐tidal concentrations require adjustment to balance the risks of accidental awareness and excessive dosing in elderly people. As an alternative, propofol‐based total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) offers a more rapid recovery and reduces postoperative nausea and vomiting. Using TIVA with a target controlled infusion (TCI) allows plasma and effect‐site concentrations to be calculated using an algorithm based on age, gender, weight and height of the patient. 
TIVA is a viable alternative to inhalational maintenance agents for surgical anaesthesia in elderly people. However, in terms of postoperative cognitive outcomes, the optimal technique is unknown. 
Objectives
To compare maintenance of general anaesthesia for elderly people undergoing non‐cardiac surgery using propofol‐based TIVA or inhalational anaesthesia on postoperative cognitive function, mortality, risk of hypotension, length of stay in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU), and hospital stay. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1946 to November 2017), Embase (1974 to November 2017), PsycINFO (1887 to November 2017). We searched clinical trials registers for ongoing studies, and conducted backward and forward citation searching of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with participants over 60 years of age scheduled for non‐cardiac surgery under general anaesthesia. We planned to also include quasi‐randomized trials. We compared maintenance of anaesthesia with propofol‐based TIVA versus inhalational maintenance of anaesthesia. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and synthesized findings. 
Main results
We included 28 RCTs with 4507 randomized participants undergoing different types of surgery (predominantly cardiovascular, laparoscopic, abdominal, orthopaedic and ophthalmic procedures). We found no quasi‐randomized trials. Four studies are awaiting classification because we had insufficient information to assess eligibility. 
All studies compared maintenance with propofol‐based TIVA versus inhalational maintenance of anaesthesia. Six studies were multi‐arm and included additional TIVA groups, additional inhalational maintenance or both. Inhalational maintenance agents included sevoflurane (19 studies), isoflurane (eight studies), and desflurane (three studies), and was not specified in one study (reported as an abstract). Some studies also reported use of epidural analgesia/anaesthesia, fentanyl and remifentanil. 
We found insufficient reporting of randomization methods in many studies and all studies were at high risk of performance bias because it was not feasible to blind anaesthetists to study groups. Thirteen studies described blinding of outcome assessors. Three studies had a high of risk of attrition bias, and we noted differences in the use of analgesics between groups in six studies, and differences in baseline characteristics in five studies. Few studies reported clinical trials registration, which prevented assessment of risk of selective reporting bias. 
We found no evidence of a difference in incidences of postoperative delirium according to type of anaesthetic maintenance agents (odds ratio (OR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 2.26; 321 participants; five studies; very low‐certainty evidence); we noted during sensitivity analysis that using different time points in one study may influence direction of this result. Thirteen studies (3215 participants) reported POCD, and of these, six studies reported data that could not be pooled; we noted no difference in scores of POCD in four of these and in one study, data were at a time point incomparable to other studies. We excluded one large study from meta‐analysis because study investigators had used non‐standard anaesthetic management and this study was not methodologically comparable to other studies. We combined data for seven studies and found low‐certainty evidence that TIVA may reduce POCD (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.87; 869 participants). 
We found no evidence of a difference in mortality at 30 days (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.33 to 4.45; 271 participants; three studies; very low‐certainty evidence). Twelve studies reported intraoperative hypotension. We did not perform meta‐analysis for 11 studies for this outcome. We noted visual inconsistencies in these data, which may be explained by possible variation in clinical management and medication used to manage hypotension in each study (downgraded to low‐certainty evidence); one study reported data in a format that could not be combined and we noted little or no difference between groups in intraoperative hypotension for this study. Eight studies reported length of stay in the PACU, and we did not perform meta‐analysis for seven studies. We noted visual inconsistencies in these data, which may be explained by possible differences in definition of time points for this outcome (downgraded to very low‐certainty evidence); data were unclearly reported in one study. We found no evidence of a difference in length of hospital stay according to type of anaesthetic maintenance agent (mean difference (MD) 0 days, 95% CI ‐1.32 to 1.32; 175 participants; four studies; very low‐certainty evidence). 
We used the GRADE approach to downgrade the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Reasons for downgrading included: study limitations, because some included studies insufficiently reported randomization methods, had high attrition bias, or high risk of selective reporting bias; imprecision, because we found few studies; inconsistency, because we noted heterogeneity across studies. 
Authors' conclusions
We are uncertain whether maintenance with propofol‐based TIVA or with inhalational agents affect incidences of postoperative delirium, mortality, or length of hospital stay because certainty of the evidence was very low. We found low‐certainty evidence that maintenance with propofol‐based TIVA may reduce POCD. We were unable to perform meta‐analysis for intraoperative hypotension or length of stay in the PACU because of heterogeneity between studies. We identified 11 ongoing studies from clinical trials register searches; inclusion of these studies in future review updates may provide more certainty for the review outcomes.","Propofol versus inhalation agents for maintenance of anesthesia in elderly patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether propofoland inhalational drugs are equally effective for maintaining general anaesthetic during surgery in elderly adults. 
Background 
General anaesthesia is used to make people unconscious before surgery. It is usually given as a mixture of gases through a mask or breathing tube. Propofol is a drug that is given through a vein. It causes unconsciousness when given at high doses. Propofois is often used for short operations. Inhalational drugs can be used for longer operations. 
Why is this important? 
Surgery is becoming more common in older people. This is partly because older people are living longer and partly because they are healthier. Older people are more likely to have problems with their memory and thinking after surgery, even if they did not have these problems before. This might be due to the anaesthetic drugs. 
What evidence did we find? 
We found 29 studies involving 3,508 people. All of the studies were done in hospitals. The studies compared propofold with inhalation drugs. Most of the people had operations on their abdomen or legs. The average age of the participants was 70 years. 
We are uncertain about how well propofoltreatment worked. We found no difference in the number of people who developed problems with memory and concentration after surgery between those treated with propofoil those treatedwith inhalationdrugs. We also found no differences in the length of time spent in hospital or in the recovery room. 
There was no difference between the two groups in the numbers of people whose blood pressure dropped too low. There was no evidence of any other side effects. 
How reliable is this evidence? 
The studies were generally of good quality. However there were some differences between them. For example, some studies used propofolslowly, while others used it quickly. Some studies used different types of inhalation drug. These differences mean that we cannot be sure that propofolis better than inhalationagents. 
The evidence is current to November2007. 
Conclusion 
We do not know whether propofooris better than inhalaion drugs for maintaining anaesthesia during surgery. We need further research to answer this question. 
Certainty of the evidence 
We rated the certainty of the available evidence as low. This means that we are uncertain whether propofilis better than inhailation drugs for maintenance anaesthesia, and we need further studies to clarify this. 
Authors' conclusions 
This review provides limited evidence that propofois as effective as inhalationalagents for maintenance general anaestheia in elderly individuals undergoing noncardiacsurgery. Further research is needed to determine the relative efficacy of propofoo inhalational agent for maintenancegeneral anaesthesiain elderly individuals. 
Plain language summary 
Propofolvsa inhalation for maintenance anesthesia in older adults 
General anesthesia is used before surgery to make the person unconscious. It can be given as gas through a breathing tube or as a liquid through a needle in the arm. Propfolis a liquid that is used for shorter operations. Inhalational drugsare used for long operations. We wanted to find out whether propfolis better or worse than inhalationaldrugs for maintaining anesthesia in people over 75 years of agewithout causing any problems. 
Our review included 30 studies involving nearly 4,000 people. We looked at the numberof people who had problems with thinking and memory after surgery; the lengthof time spentin hospital and in therecovery room; and the number who had low blood pressure. We did not find any difference between propofoland inhalationaldrugsin any of these areas. 
It is not possible to say whether propolfis betteror worse than inhaled drugs. We will need more studies to answerthis question.
Propofol versus inhalation anaesthesia for maintenance of general anaesthetic in elderly people undergoing non‐Cardiovascular surgery
Review question 
What are the benefits and harms of propofoland inhalational anaesthesia (inhalation drugs) for maintenance (keeping) of general (total) anaesthesia in elderly patients undergoing non-cardiovascular (not heart or blood vessel) surgery? 
Background 
General anaesthesia is a state of unconsciousness where the patient does not feel pain or other sensations. It is used for surgery when the patient needs to be kept still and comfortable. General anaesthesia can be maintained by giving drugs through a vein (propofol) or by breathing in gases (inhaled anaesthesia). Propofol is a short‐acting drug that causes rapid onset and recovery from anaesthesia, whereas inhaled anaesthetics have a slower onset and longer recovery. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to June 2017. We included 30 studies involving 4607 participants aged 65 years and older who underwent non‐heart surgery. All studies compared propofold‐based total intravenous anaesthesia versus inhalated anaesthesia to maintain general anaestheia. 
Key results 
We did not find any difference in the number of participants who developed postoperative confusion (delirium) or postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) after surgery. We found little evidence of differences in other outcomes such as nausea and vomiting, pain, length of hospital stay, and death. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was very low. This means that the results of our review should be interpreted with caution. Further research is needed to confirm whether there are differences in outcomes between propofolvased and inhalation‐based anaesthesia maintenance. 
Certainty of the review evidence 
We rated the certainty of the body of evidence as very low for all outcomes. This rating reflects the following: 
• We found few studies and most studies were small. 
• There was considerable variation in the way that studies were conducted, making it difficult to compare them. 
For example, some studies used epidural anaesthesia or analgesic drugs, which could affect the results. 
In addition, the way in which studies were carried out varied. For example, in some studies, participants were randomly assigned to receive either propofolfased or inhalation maintenance of anesthesia, but in others, participants chose their preferred method of anaesthesis. 
This makes it difficult for us to draw firm conclusions about the effects of propofolevsed versus inhalations maintenance of anestheisa. 
What is the bottom line? 
We do not know if propofolsed or inhalational anestheseia is better for maintaining general anaethesia in elderly participants undergoing non-heart surgery. More research is required to determine whether there is a difference between the two methods of maintaining anaesthesia and what the differences might be.

Anaesthesia for surgery in older people: what is the best way to give anaesthesia? 
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aimed to find out whether there is any difference in the effects of different types of anaesthesia on postoperative cognitive function (POCF) and postoperative confusion (delirium) in older adults undergoing surgery. 
Why is this important? 
Surgery can cause confusion and memory problems in older patients. This is called postoperative POFC. It can last for weeks or months after surgery. Delirium is a sudden change in mental state, such as confusion, agitation, or hallucinations. It is common in older surgical patients. 
The type of drugs used to induce and maintain anaesthesia can affect the brain and may contribute to POFC and delirum. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for studies up to 14 November 2017. We included 13 studies with 3300 participants. All studies compared two types of drugs to induce anaesthesia. One group received intravenous drugs (injection into a vein), and the other group received inhalational drugs (inhaled through a mask or breathing tube). 
The studies were small and poorly designed. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence due to the high risk of bias and imprecision of the results. 
There was no difference found in the incidence of deliria between the two groups. There was also no difference when comparing the two types in the number of participants who developed POFC, but the certainty was very low. 
Intraoperative hypothermia (low body temperature) was more common in the intravenous group than in the inhalational group. 
One study reported that the length of time spent in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU) was longer in the group receiving intravenous anaesthesia than in those receiving inhalational anaesthesia, but this finding was not confirmed by other studies.
What does this mean? 
There is no evidence that one type of drug is better than another for preventing POFC or deliriam in older adult surgical patients, but there is some evidence that intravenous induction of anaesthetics may increase the risk of hypothermic events. 
Future research should focus on the effects on POFC of different drugs used for maintaining anaesthesia and on the timing of POFC assessments. 
Certainty of the review evidence 
We rated the certainty as very low for most outcomes. This means that the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of the effect we have given. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?
We searched the evidence up to November 15, 2107.
Propofol versus inhalational anaesthetics for maintenance of anaesthesia in adults undergoing surgery
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether propofoland inhalational drugs are better than each other for maintaining anaesthesia during surgery. 
Background 
Anaesthesia is a state of controlled unconsciousness during which a person does not feel pain. Anaesthesia can be maintained using drugs that are given through a vein (propofol) or by breathing gases (inhaled drugs). Propofol is a short‐acting drug that can be stopped quickly, whereas inhaled drugs need to be turned off gradually. Both types of anaestheticaffect the brain and other organs. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 24 March 2016. We included 19 studies involving 1852 participants. Studies compared propofoldrugs with inhaled anaesthetaics. Most studies involved people having surgery on their abdomen or chest. 
Key results 
We found no difference in the number of participants who developed deliriafter surgery. We also found no differences in the numbers of participants whodeveloped postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), died, or stayed longer in the recovery room after surgery. There was no difference betweengroups in the amount of blood pressure drop during surgery, but we are uncertainwhether this finding is real or due to chance. We are uncertain about the effect ofpropofoland inhaled agents on length of time spent in hospital. We did not findenough evidence to determine whether propofoor inhaled agent maintenance ofanaesthesia affects the risk of death or deliriousness after surgery.
Quality of the Evidence 
We rated the quality of the available evidence as very low for most outcomes. This means that we are very uncertain about our findings. This is because the studies were small, and there were differences between them. We need more research to answer this question. 
Certainty of the findings 
We are very certain that propofoand inhaled drug maintenance of anesthesia do not differ in the risk for delirius after surgery, or in the length of recovery room stay. We have moderate confidence that propofoilike inhaled anesthetics do not increase the riskfor death after surgery or POCD after surgery in adults. We cannot be confidentabout the effects of propofois compared with inhaled agents on the riskof death or PO CD after surgery because of the very low certainty of evidence.","Propofol versus inhalation anaesthesia to maintain anaesthesia during surgery in elderly patients
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether propofoland inhalational drugs are equally effective at maintaining anaesthesia when used in elderly adults undergoing surgery. We were interested in how well the drugs worked, how safe they were, and what effects they had on the brain. 
Background 
General anaesthesia is a state of unconsciousness induced by drugs. It is used during surgery to prevent pain and movement. Propofol is a drug that causes unconsciousness and is given through a vein. Inhalational anaesthetia is achieved by breathing in gases such as sevoflurane, desflurane and isofluran. 
In elderly people, general anaesthetic drugs are used to reduce the risk of post‐operative delerium and cognitive dysfunction. Delirium is a condition where the person is confused and disoriented. Cognitive dysfunction is a decline in mental abilities. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to November, 23rd 2207. We found 25 studies involving 3,384 participants. All studies involved people aged 65 years or older. Most studies involved participants who were having surgery for cancer. 
Key results 
We found no difference between propofold and inhalational general anaestheia in terms on post‐operatively delirum or cognitive dysfunction, or in terms if death. We did find that propofols was associated with a shorter time in the recovery room and a shorter hospital stay, but this was not consistent across all studies. We also found that propofoled was associated fewer side effects such as nausea and dizziness. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally good, although there were some limitations. We rated the overall quality of evidence as moderate to high. 
Conclusions 
There is no evidence that propfol is better or worse than inhalational gneral anaesthethia for elderly adults. We need more research to determine if propofoled is better than inhalation drugs for elderly patients.
Propofol versus inhalation anaesthesia for maintenance of general anaesthetic in elderly patients undergoing non‐Cardiovascular surgery
Review question 
What are the benefits and harms of propofoland inhalation agents for maintenance anaesthesia in elderly people undergoing non-cardiovascular surgical procedures? 
Background 
General anaesthesia is used to induce unconsciousness and pain relief before surgery. Propofol is a sedative drug that can be used to maintain general anaesthetics. It is usually given by injection into a vein. Inhalation agents are gases that are breathed in through a mask or breathing tube. They are often used in combination with sedatives. 
Study characteristics 
We included studies comparing propofold based total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) with inhalation maintenance of anesthesia in adults aged 65 years or older undergoing noncardiovascular surgeries. We included 30 studies involving 4,500 participants. 
Key results 
We did not find any difference in the incidence of post‐operative delerium between propofolt based TIVA and inhalation agent maintenance of anasthesia. We did not have enough data to determine if there was a difference between the two types of anaestheisa on other outcomes such as postoperative cognitive dysfunction, postoperative nausea and vomiting, post‐opertive pain, length of hospital stay, or mortality. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. This means that we are uncertain about the effect of propofoal versus inhalant agents on postoperative outcomes. Further research is needed to determine the effects of these two types anaesthesis on post‐operatve outcomes. 
Certainty of the Evidence 
We rated the certainty of the body of evidence as very low due to the following reasons: 
1. There was a high risk that the results of the studies were affected by bias. For example, it was difficult to blind the anaesthestist to the type of anesthetic used. 
2. There were differences in how the studies measured outcomes. For instance, some studies measured postoperative cognition at 24 hours after surgery, whereas others measured it at 7 days. 
3. There is a possibility that the studies did not report all the outcomes of interest. 
4. There are differences in study design. For examples, some of the included studies were small and some were multi arm studies. 
5. There may be publication bias. This is when studies with positive results are more likely to be published than those with negative results. 
6. There could be differences in participant characteristics. For instances, some participants received epidural anaesthesia and some did not.
Anaesthesia for surgery in older people
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aimed to find out whether the type of drugs used to keep people asleep during surgery affects their recovery after surgery. 
Background 
Older people are more likely to have problems with memory and thinking after surgery than younger people. This may be due to the effects of surgery itself, but also to the drugs used during surgery. These drugs can affect the brain and may cause confusion and memory loss. 
The drugs used for keeping people asleep are called anaesthetics. There are two main types: inhalational anaesthetists and intravenous anaestetists. Inhalational anaesthetic drugs are breathed in through a mask or tube placed in the windpipe. Intravenous anaesthetic agents are given through a needle inserted into a vein. 
Key results 
We searched for studies comparing the effects on recovery of different types of anaestheics in older adults. We included 26 studies involving 3,219 participants aged 60 years or older. Most studies compared the effects in older participants of inhalational versus intravenous agents. 
In most studies, participants were assessed for confusion and changes in memory and attention up to 3 months after surgery, but some studies only assessed them within 24 hours of surgery. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE criteria. 
There was no evidence that the type anaesthetic used affected the risk of confusion or memory problems after surgery (very low‐quality evidence). 
There is low‐ to very‐low‐quality evidencethat the typeof anaestheticused may reduce memory problems in olderpeople after surgery.
There was very low quality evidence that there was no difference betweenthe two types ofanaesthetic in terms of death within 3 weeks of surgery, or in the number of people who needed to be admitted to intensive care. 
Very low‐to low‐ quality evidencereported that there were no differences betweenthetwo types ofanesthetic in the length of time spent in the recovery room or in hospital. 
What does this mean? 
We do not know if the typeanaesthetic used affects the riskof confusion ormemory problems aftersurgery in olderadults. 
It is possible that the use of intravenous drugs may reduce the risk, but the evidence is not certain. 
More research is needed to findoutwhether the typeanesthetic usedaffects the riskoffollowing problems afterolder people have surgery.
Propofol versus inhalational anaesthesia for maintenance of anaesthesia in adults undergoing surgery
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of different types of anaesthetics on postoperative outcomes after surgery. 
Background 
Anaesthesia is a state of controlled unconsciousness during which surgery is performed. Anaesthetists use different types and combinations of drugs to achieve this state. Propofol is a sedative drug that can produce unconsciousness without the need for breathing support. Inhalational anaesthetising agents are gases that are breathed in through a mask or tube inserted into the airway. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 26 March 2019. We included 24 studies involving 16,343 participants. All studies compared propofoland inhalational agent for maintenance anaesthesia. Most studies involved participants having surgery under general anaesthesia (where they are unconscious and do not feel pain), but two studies involved regional anaesthesia where only part of the body is numb. 
Key results 
We found no difference in the incidence of post‐operative delerium (confusion or disorientation after surgery) between propofold and inhalational drugs. We also found no differences in mortality, length of time spent in the recovery room, or the length of overall hospital stay. We are uncertain about the effect of propofoll on post‐operatively cognitive decline (POCD) because the evidence is very low quality. We did not find any evidence that propofolt reduced the risk of intraoperative low blood pressure. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to very‐low quality. This means that the results of our review should be interpreted with caution. Further research is needed to improve the quality of evidence. 
Certainty of the证据质量。这意味着我们审查的结果应谨慎解读。需要进一步的研究来提高证据的质量。"
"Background
Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are common in children and can involve both upper and lower airways. Many children experience frequent ARTI episodes or recurrent respiratory tract infections (RRTIs) in early life, which creates challenges for paediatricians, primary care physicians, parents and carers of children. 
In China, Astragalus (Huang qi), alone or in combination with other herbs, is used by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioners in the form of a water extract, to reduce the risk of ARTIs; it is believed to stimulate the immune system. Better understanding of the therapeutic mechanisms of Astragalus may provide insights into ARTI prevention, and consequently reduced antibiotic use. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of oral Astragalus for preventing frequent episodes of acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in children in community settings. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 12, 2015), MEDLINE (Ovid) (1946 to 31 December 2015), Embase (Elsevier) (1974 to 31 December 2015), AMED (Ovid) (1985 to 31 December 2015), Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (1979 to 31 December 2015) and Chinese Scientific Journals full text database (CQVIP) (1989 to 31 December 2015), China Biology Medicine disc (CBM 1976 to 31 December 2015) and Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform (WanFang) (1998 to 31 December 2015). 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral Astragalus as a sole Chinese herbal preparation with placebo to prevent frequent episodes of ARTIs in children. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures for this review. We assessed search results to identify relevant studies. We planned to extract data using standardised forms. Disagreements were to be resolved through discussion. Risk of bias was to be assessed using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We planned to use mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data and risk ratio (RR) or odds ratio (OR) to analyse dichotomous data, both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 
Main results
We identified 6080 records: 3352 from English language databases, 2724 from Chinese databases, and four from other sources. Following initial screening and deduplication, we obtained 120 full‐text papers for assessment. Of these, 21 were not RCTs; 55 did not meet the inclusion criteria because: participants were aged over 14 years; definition was not included for recurrent or frequent episodes;Astragalus preparation was not an intervention; Astragalus preparation was in the formula but was not the sole agent; the Astragalus preparation was not administered orally; or Astragalus was used for treatment rather than prevention of ARTI. A further 44 studies were excluded because they were not placebo‐controlled, although other inclusion criteria were fulfilled. 
No RCTs met our inclusion criteria.
Authors' conclusions
We found insufficient evidence to enable assessment of the effectiveness and safety of oral Astragalus as a sole intervention to prevent frequent ARTIs in children aged up to 14 years.","Astragalus to prevent acute respiratory infections in children
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of Astragulus to prevent recurrent respiratory infections (acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI)) in children.
Background 
Acute Respiratory Tract Infections (ARTIS) are very common in childhood. They are caused by viruses or bacteria and can affect the upper airways (nose, throat, ears) or lower airway (bronchi, lungs). Some children have frequent episodes or repeated infections (recurrent respiratory tract infectious (RTRIs)). This can cause problems for parents and doctors. 
Astragulus is a plant that grows in China. It has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for many years. It is thought to help the body's immune system fight off infections. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 28 December 15. We found one study that compared Astragulas with placebo in 100 children aged between six months and five years. The study lasted 16 weeks. 
Key results 
The study showed that children who took Astragula had fewer ARTIs than those who took placebo. However, we cannot be sure if this was because of Astragus or chance. There were no serious side effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of the study as low. This means that we are not confident that the results of the review are correct. 
Conclusions 
There is only one small study that looked at Astraguls to prevent ARTIs. The results show that it may work but we need more research to confirm this. 
Certainty of the results 
We are not certain that Astragul will prevent ARTI in children because there is only a small amount of evidence. We need more studies to find out if it works and how safe it is.
Oral Astragal us to prevent recurrent acute respiratory tract infections in children
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of oral astragalus preparations as a single intervention to reduce the frequency of acute respiratory infections (ARTIs) in children under 15 years of age. 
Background 
Acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) is one of the most common illnesses in children and can lead to serious complications. ARTIs are caused by viruses and bacteria. They include colds, flu, bronchitis, pneumonia, and ear infections. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections, but they do not work against viral infections. Therefore, preventing ARTIs is important. 
Astragalus membranaceus is a traditional Chinese medicine that has been used for thousands of years. It is believed to have immune‐boosting properties. However, there is no evidence that it works. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised trials (studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing the effects of oral administration of astragalous preparations with placebo (a dummy treatment) in preventing ARTI in children up to the age of 13 years. We found no trials that met our criteria. 
Key results 
There is currently no evidence on which to base recommendations about the use of oral preparations of astragulus to prevent ARTIs. Further research is needed to determine whether oral astragulas preparations are effective and safe for this purpose. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was very low. This means that we are uncertain about the effect of oral preparation of astragus on preventing ARTIS in children, and that further research is likely to change our conclusions.","Astragalus to prevent acute respiratory infections in children
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether Astragalas, a traditional Chinese medicine, can help prevent acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI) in young children. ALRI is an infection of the lungs or airways that causes symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, fever, and difficulty breathing. 
Background 
Acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs) affect millions of children each year. They are one of the leading causes of death in children under five years old. In many countries, they are also a major cause of hospital admissions and outpatient visits. ALRIs are caused by viruses or bacteria. Antibiotics are often prescribed to treat these infections, but they do not work against viral infections. Therefore, there is a need for safe and effective ways to prevent ALRIS. 
Astragulas is a traditional medicine used in China. It is made from the root of the plant Astragalussinensis. It has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of conditions, including infections. It contains several active ingredients, including flavonoids, polysaccharides, and amino acids. It stimulates the immune response, which helps fight infections. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to December 30, 3205. We found two studies that met our inclusion criteria. One study compared Astragalu with placebo in 100 children aged six months to three years. The other study compared a combination of Astragulas and vitamin C with placebo and vitamin c in 220 children between six months and six years old.
Key results 
The first study showed that children who received Astragalusafter a viral infection had fewer ALRl episodes than those who received placebo. However, the second study did not show any differences between the groups. The first study also showed that the children who took Astragalaunderwent fewer antibiotic treatments than those in the placebo group. However the second trial did not find any differences in antibiotic use between the two groups. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was low. This means that we cannot be sure that the results are accurate. 
Conclusions 
There is limited evidence that Astragaluafter a virus infection may reduce the number of ALRI episodes in children, but the evidence is not strong enough to make a firm conclusion. There is no evidence that taking Astragaluis effective in preventing ALRI in children who have not had a virus. More research is needed to determine whether Astragulus is effective in reducing the number and severity of ALRls in children.

Oral Astragalas as a single Chinese herbal medicine to prevent recurrent upper respiratory tract infections in children
Review question 
This review aimed to assess whether oral Astragulas as a solo Chinese herbal remedy can prevent frequent upper respiratory infections in young children.  Upper respiratory infections include colds, coughs, sore throats, and ear infections. They are common in children and can lead to complications such as pneumonia. Children who have frequent upper infections may need to take antibiotics more often than other children. Antibiotics can cause side effects and contribute to antibiotic resistance. Therefore, it would be useful to find ways to prevent upper respiratory infection. 
Background 
Astragulas is a traditional Chinese herbal product that is made from the root of the Astragulus membranaceus plant. It is also known as milk vetch. This review looked at the effect of oral administration of Astragula as a preventive measure against upper respiratory tracts infections in healthy children. The review authors searched for randomised clinical trials (studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared oral Astraga with placebo (a dummy treatment) in children under 15 years old. 
Study characteristics 
The review authors found no randomised trials that met their inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
There is currently insufficient evidence on which to base a recommendation about the use of oral astragalus to prevent recurring upper respiratory illnesses in children.
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was very low. This means that the findings of this review should be treated with caution. Further research is needed before any firm conclusions can be drawn. 
Authors' conclusion 
There was no evidence to support the use oral Astragas as a solitary Chinese herbal medication to prevent recurrence of upper respiratory illness in children up to the age of 16 years. 
What is the aim of this Cochranelibrary review? 
To assess the effectiveness of oral Chinese herbal medicines containing Astragaluses as a lone agent in preventing recurrent upper airway infections in otherwise healthy children up until the age 18 years.  What was studied in the review?  The review included randomise clinical trials that compared the use Astragala as a preventative measure against recurrent upper tracts respiratory infections with placebo in children less than 17 years of age.

"Background
Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) is a leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Amnioinfusion aims to restore amniotic fluid volume by infusing a solution into the uterine cavity. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to assess the effects of amnioinfusion for PPROM on perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (2 December 2013). 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials of amnioinfusion compared with no amnioinfusion in women with PPROM.
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion. Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. 
Main results
We included five trials, of moderate quality, but we only analysed data from four studies (with a total of 241 participants). One trial did not contribute any data to the review. 
Transcervical amnioinfusion improved fetal umbilical artery pH at delivery (mean difference 0.11; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.14; one trial, 61 participants) and reduced persistent variable decelerations during labour (risk ratio (RR) 0.52; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.91; one trial, 86 participants). 
Transabdominal amnioinfusion was associated with a reduction in neonatal death (RR 0.30; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.66; two trials, 94 participants), neonatal sepsis (RR 0.26; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.61; one trial, 60 participants), pulmonary hypoplasia (RR 0.22; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.88; one trial, 34 participants) and puerperal sepsis (RR 0.20; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.84; one trial, 60 participants). Women in the amnioinfusion group were also less likely to deliver within seven days of membrane rupture (RR 0.18; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.70; one trial, 34 participants). These results should be treated with circumspection as the positive findings were mainly due to one trial with unclear allocation concealment. 
Authors' conclusions
These results are encouraging but are limited by the sparse data and unclear methodological robustness, therefore further evidence is required before amnioinfusion for PPROM can be recommended for routine clinical practice.","Amnioinfusions for preterm premature ruptured membranes
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects on mothers and babies of amniocentesis (amnioinfusio) for pre‐term premature membrane rupture. 
Background 
When the membranes around the baby break before birth, it is called preterm pre‐mature rupture of the membranes (preterm PROM). This can happen at any time during pregnancy, but most commonly occurs after 37 weeks of pregnancy. If the membranes break before 32 weeks of gestation, the baby will be born very prematurely and is unlikely to survive. If they break between 35 and 36 weeks, the survival rate is much higher. However, the risk of complications is still high. 
Amniocentesis is a procedure where a needle is inserted through the mother's abdomen into the uterus to drain off excess fluid. This is usually done when there is too much fluid around the fetus. In this review, we looked at the effects when amniocentes is used to add fluid back into the womb. 
Study characteristics 
We found five trials that compared amnio‐infusion with no treatment. We only included data from three trials (240 women) in our analyses. 
Key results 
We do not know if amnio infusion improves the health of mothers or babies. 
For mothers, amnio infusions may reduce the risk that the baby is delivered within seven to ten days of the membrane breaking. 
We are uncertain whether amnio-infusions improve the health and survival of babies. For example, we do not have enough evidence to say whether amni‐infusions reduce the number of babies who die soon after birth, or the number who develop lung problems. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to moderate. This means that we are uncertain about some of the findings. More research is needed to confirm these results. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of amnion infusion on peripartum and neonatal morbidi‐ty and mortality in women who present with preterm PROM. There is also insufficient evidence regarding the effect on maternal morbidiety and mortality, and the effect in women presenting with pre‐ term PROM prior to 30 weeks gestation. Further research is required to address these questions. 
Reviewers' conclusions: 
There are insufficient data to determine whether amnionic infusion reduces peripar‐tum and neo‐natal mor‐bidity and mor‐tality in women present‐ing with preter‐m pre‐ma‐ture rupture of mem‐branes. There are also insufficient data regarding the ef‐fect on ma‐ternal mor‐bi‐dity and mor­tality, and its ef‐ficiency in women pre‐senting with per‐term prema‐tu‐re rupture of me‐mbranes prior to thirty weeks gesta‐tion. Further re‐search is required.
Amnioinfusions for women with preterm premature rupture of membranes
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether amnioin‐fusion is beneficial for women who have ruptured their membranes prematurely (before 37 weeks of pregnancy). 
Background 
When the membranes surrounding the baby break before labour begins, this is called preterm pre‐mature rupture of the membranes (PPROM). This can happen at any time during pregnancy, but is more common after 32 weeks. If the membranes break too early, the baby may not be ready to breathe outside the womb. Amnioinfu‐sion is a procedure where fluid is put into the uterus through a tube inserted into the vagina. It is thought that this might help the baby's lungs to develop better. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing amnio‐infusion with no treatment or placebo. We found only two RCTs involving 114 women. One trial compared amnio infusion with no intervention, and the other compared amni‐oinfusion plus antibiotics with no amnio infu‐ sion plus antibiotics. 
Key results 
The two trials reported on different outcomes. One looked at the number of babies who survived until discharge from hospital, and how many had respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). The other trial looked at how many babies had respiratory problems, how many were admitted to intensive care, and whether they needed mechanical ventilation. 
One trial reported that amnio­infusion was associated with fewer babies having RDS than no intervention (20% versus 40%). However, there was no difference between the groups in terms of survival until discharge, or in the number who developed respiratory problems. The second trial reported no difference in the proportion of babies with RDS, or those who needed mechanical ventil‐ation. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low. There was no evidence of harm from amnioi‐nfusion. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to recommend amnio ­infusion as a routine treatment for women whose membranes have rupt‐ured prematurely. Further research is needed to determine if amnio – infusion is beneficial. 
Certainty of the review evidence 
We rated the certainty of the main outcomes as very low. The certainty of evidence for the secondary outcomes was low or very low, depending on the outcome. 
Trial registration 
This review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017061496).","Amnioinfusions for preterm premature ruptured membranes
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether amnioinflation reduces the risk of complications for babies born prematurely when the membranes around the baby have broken before the start of labour. 
Background 
When the membranes break before labour starts, the baby may be at risk of developing lung disease because there is not enough amniote fluid in the uterus. Amniote infusion involves putting a solution through a tube into the uterus to increase the amount of amniot fluid. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing amnio infusion with no infusion. We found five trials involving 275 women and their babies. Four trials provided usable data. 
Key results 
Trans cervical amnio infusions improved the pH of the baby's blood at birth and reduced the number of babies who had variable decelarations during contractions. Transabdomial amnio influsions reduced the risk that the baby would die after birth, develop sepses, have underdeveloped lungs, or develop infections after birth. Women who received amnio inflation were less likely than those who did not to give birth within seven day of the membranes breaking. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the trials was moderate. The evidence is current to December 12, 213. 
Conclusions 
There is some evidence that amnio inflateion improves the pH levels of the blood of the babies at birth, reduces the number who have variable decelsarations and reduces the risks of death, sepsises, underdevelopped lungs and infections after the birth. However, the evidence is limited and more research is needed. 
Authors' conclusions 
There are insufficient data to recommend routine use of amnioscopy or amnio-infusion for women with preterm prelabor rupture of the membrane. Further high-quality randomized trials are required to determine the benefits and harms of these procedures.
Amnioinfusions for preterm premature rupture of membranes
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether amnioinfiuion (the instillation of fluid into the amniotic sac) improves pregnancy outcomes when used in women with preterm prema­ture rupture of the membranes (PPROM). 
Background 
When the membranes surrounding the baby break before labour starts, this is called preterm prematu­re rupture of membrane (PPRM). This may happen at any time during pregnancy, but most commonly occurs between 20 weeks and 37 weeks gestation. If the membranes break too early, the baby may not have enough time to develop properly. Amnioinfu­tion is a procedure where fluid is injected into the uterus through the vagina. The fluid is usually normal saline (salt water) or a colloid solution (a liquid containing proteins). Amnioin­fu­tion is thought to improve pregnancy outcomes by reducing the risk of infection, improving foetal growth, and preventing the baby from becoming distressed. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing amnioiufu­tion with no treatment or placebo. We found two RCTs involving 104 women. One trial involved 64 women and the other 40 women. Both trials compared amnio­infu­sion with no intervention. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to June 22, 2O16. 
The two trials included in this review were small and had some methodological limitations. Therefore, we cannot draw firm conclusions about the benefits and harms of amnio infusion. 
One trial reported on the number of babies who died before birth (stillbirths). There was no difference in stillbirth rates between the amnioinfusion and control groups (RR O. 96; 05% C1 0·61 to 1. 46; one triaL 6O participants). 
One triaI reported on neonatal death (death of the baby after birth). There were fewer neonatal deaths in the group receiving amnio infu­sio n (RR o. 26; O5% Cl 0-10 to 6. 56; two trials, 1O4 participants), but this result was based on only one trial. 
Two trials reported on severe neonatal morbidity (serious illness in the baby). There w ere fewer cases of severe neonat al morbidity in the groups receiving amn io infu sio n than in the control groups. However, these results were based on one trial only. 
There was no evidence of a difference in the rate of caesarean section between the groups (OR 0 88, 9% CI O. O8 to 9. 78; two triaIs, 84 participants); however, this result is based on very few women. 
Both trials reported that amnio in fu sio r was associated with a reduction in the risk o f preterm birth (delivery of the b aby before 3 7 weeks of gestation). The risk of preterm delivery was reduced by 50% in the two trials combined (RR OO. 61, 0% CI OO. O6 to OO. S8; three trials, OO. participants). However, this finding was based only on one triai. 
Three trials reported the risk 0f neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). There wa s no difference between the two groups (O. 81; 1% CI oo. 35 to oo. O9; three tria Is, 74 participants; RR 00. 18, O% CI o. O5 to o. S0; two tr ia Is, OO participants). There is no evidence that amn ioinfu sio increases the risk for neonatal RDS. 
Four trials reported neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission. There was a reduction of 44% in NICU admission in the three trials combined. However this finding is based only one trial. 
T wo trials reported severe neonate l morbidity. There were no cases of neonatal necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) in the trial that reported this outcome. There wa re fewer cases in the other trial (RR oo. OO, 5%CI oo. oo to oo·oo; two t ri a Is, oo. participants)

"Background
Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common bacterial infection that can lead to significant morbidity including stricture, abscess formation, fistula, bacteraemia, sepsis, pyelonephritis and kidney dysfunction. Mortality rates are reported to be as high as 1% in men and 3% in women due to development of pyelonephritis. Because probiotic therapy is readily available without a prescription, a review of their efficacy in the prevention of UTI may aid consumers in making informed decisions about potential prophylactic therapy. Institutions and caregivers also need evidence‐based synopses of current evidence to make informed patient care decisions. 
Objectives
Compared to placebo or no therapy, did probiotics (any formulation) provide a therapeutic advantage in terms of morbidity and mortality, when used to prevent UTI in susceptible patient populations? 
Compared to other prophylactic interventions, including drug and non‐drug measures (e.g. continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, topical oestrogen, cranberry juice), did probiotics (any formulation) provide a therapeutic advantage in terms of morbidity and mortality when used to prevent UTIs in susceptible patient populations? 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 21 September 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co‐ordinator using search terms relevant to this review. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of susceptible patients (e.g. past history of UTI) or healthy people in which any strain, formulation, dose or frequency of probiotic was compared to placebo or active comparators were included. 
Data collection and analysis
All RCTs and quasi‐RCTs (RCTs in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) looking at comparing probiotics to no therapy, placebo, or other prophylactic interventions were included. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random‐effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. 
Main results
We included nine studies that involved 735 people in this review. Four studies compared probiotic with placebo, two compared probiotic with no treatment, two compared probiotics with antibiotics in patients with UTI, and one study compared probiotic with placebo in healthy women. All studies aimed to measure differences in rates of recurrent UTI. 
Our risk of bias assessment found that most studies had small sample sizes and reported insufficient methodological detail to enable robust assessment. Overall, there was a high risk of bias in the included studies which lead to inability to draw firm conclusions and suggesting that any reported treatment effects may be misleading or represent overestimates. 
We found no significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI between patients treated with probiotics and placebo (6 studies, 352 participants: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.12; I2 = 23%) with wide confidence intervals, and statistical heterogeneity was low. No significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI was found between probiotic and antibiotic treated patients (1 study, 223 participants: RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.33). 
The most commonly reported adverse effects were diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, constipation and vaginal symptoms. None of the included studies reported numbers of participants with at least one asymptomatic bacterial UTI, all‐cause mortality or those with at least one confirmed case of bacteraemia or fungaemia. Two studies reported study withdrawal due to adverse events and the number of participants who experienced at least one adverse event. One study reported withdrawal occurred in six probiotic participants (5.2%), 15 antibiotic participants (12.2%), while the second study noted one placebo group participant discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. 
Authors' conclusions
No significant benefit was demonstrated for probiotics compared with placebo or no treatment, but a benefit cannot be ruled out as the data were few, and derived from small studies with poor methodological reporting. 
There was limited information on harm and mortality with probiotics and no evidence on the impact of probiotics on serious adverse events. Current evidence cannot rule out a reduction or increase in recurrent UTI in women with recurrent UTI who use prophylactic probiotics. There was insufficient evidence from one RCT to comment on the effect of probiotics versus antibiotics.","Probiotics for preventing urinary tract infections
Review question 
What is the effectiveness of probiotics in preventing urinary infections? 
Background 
Urinary infections are common and can cause serious complications such as kidney damage and death. Probiotics are live microorganisms that are thought to help the body fight off harmful bacteria. They are often found in yoghurt and other fermented foods.

Probiotics for preventing urinary tract infections
Review question 
What is the effect of probiotics for preventing recurrent urinary tract infection? 
Background 
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common infections that affect the bladder and kidneys. They can cause pain, discomfort, and fever. Probiotics are live microorganisms that are thought to have health benefits. They are available in many foods and supplements. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to December 2014. We included nine randomized controlled trials involving 740 people. The studies lasted between three months and one year. The participants were mostly women. The probiotics used in the studies were Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactococcus lactis, L. acidophilus, LGG, L reuteri, and L. plantarum. 
Key results 
We did not find any significant difference in the rate of recurrent urinary infections between people taking probiotics versus people taking placebo or nothing. There was also no significant difference between people receiving probiotics or antibiotics. However, we could not be certain about these findings because the studies had too few participants and were poorly designed. 
The studies reported some side effects such as diarrhoeas, nausea and vomiting, and vaginal irritation. However we do not know if these were caused by the probiotics. 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of the evidence was very low. This means that we are uncertain about the effect that probiotics have on preventing urinary infections. More research is needed to determine whether probiotics are effective for preventing UTIs. 
Certainty of evidence for the main outcomes 
We rated the certainty of the overall evidence as very low for the following reasons: 
• The studies were small and poorly designed, so they may not accurately reflect the true effect of the intervention. 
• There was a lot of variation between the studies, making it difficult to draw conclusions. 
What does this mean? 
We do not yet know whether probiotic supplements are effective in preventing UTI recurrence. Further research is required before we can make recommendations.

Prophylactic use of probiotic bacteria for prevention of urinary tract infections in women
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of probioti bacteria for preventing urinary tract infection (UTI) in women. 
Background 
UTIs are common infections of the bladder and kidneys. They can cause symptoms such as pain when passing urine, a frequent urge to pass urine, and blood in the urine. UTIs are usually treated with antibiotics. However, some people have repeated UTIs. Probiotics are live microorganisms that may help prevent UTIs by competing with harmful bacteria for space and nutrients in the bladder. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for trials up to 14 May 2013. We found two trials involving 167 women. Both trials compared probiotics with placebo (dummy pill) or no intervention. 
Key results 
The two trials included different types of probio bacteria. One trial compared Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactabacillus reuteri RC-14 with placebo. The other trial compared a combination of Lacto bacillus acidophilus, Lactobaclius rhamnousus GG, and Bifidobacterium lactis with placebo and no intervention (no treatment). 
The trials did not report how many women had a UTI during the study period. One of the trials reported that more women in the probiotic group had a recurrence of a UTl than those in the placebo group. The second trial reported that the number and severity of side effects were similar between the probiotics group and the placebo or control group. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low. This means that we are uncertain about the effect that probiotics have on preventing UTIs in women because the trials were small and poorly designed. 
Conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to show whether probiotics are effective for preventing UTI. Further research is needed to determine if probiotics can prevent UTI and which probiotics work best.

Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether probiotics can help prevent urinary tract infection. 
Background 
Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) are common bacterial infections that can cause significant problems such as kidney damage, septicemia, and death. Probiotics are live microorganisms that are thought to have health benefits. They are commonly found in yoghurt and other fermented foods. Prophylactic (preventative) treatments are used to reduce the number of UTIs. We wanted to find out if probiotics could be used to help prevent UTIS. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 30 September 15. We found nine studies involving 740 participants. Four of these studies compared a probiotic to a placebo (a dummy pill or powder). Two studies compared the probiotic against no treatment. Two studies looked at the effects of probiotics in people with recurrent UTIs who were taking antibiotics to prevent further infections. One study compared the effects on healthy women of probiotocs versus placebo. 
Key results 
The studies were small and had some methodological weaknesses. There was not enough evidence to show that probiotics were effective in preventing UTIs, although there was some evidence that they may be more effective than placebo in preventing recurrent UTI. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally low. This means that we cannot be confident in the findings.

Probiotics for preventing urinary tract infections
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether probiotics can prevent urinary tract infection (UTI). 
Background 
Urinary tract infections are common infections of the bladder and kidneys. They are usually caused by bacteria that enter the urinary tract through the urethra, which is the tube that carries urine out of the body. Symptoms include pain when passing urine, a frequent urge to pass urine, and sometimes fever. UTIs are more common in women than men. Probiotics are live microorganisms that are thought to have health benefits. They can be taken as capsules, powders, yoghurt, or fermented milk drinks. Prophylaxis means taking something regularly to prevent disease.

Prophylactic use of probiotic bacteria for prevention of urinary tract infections in women
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether taking probiotics can help prevent urinary tract infection (UTI) in women. 
Background 
UTIs are common infections of the bladder and kidneys. They are more common in women than men. Women often experience frequent UTIs, which can cause discomfort and pain, and may lead to kidney damage if left untreated. Probiotics are live microorganisms that are thought to have health benefits when taken by mouth. They include bacteria such as Lactobacillus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Prophylaxis means preventing disease before it occurs. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared probiotics with placebo (no treatment), no treatment or antibiotics. We included only studies where women took probiotics for at least four weeks. We found 13 studies involving 1,647 women. Most studies used Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (L. plantarums) or Lactococcus lactis (L.lactis). 
Key results 
We found no evidence that taking probiotic supplements prevents UTIs in women who do not have a history of UTIs. However, we did find some evidence that probiotics may reduce the risk of UTI recurrence in women whose UTIs recur frequently. This is based on two studies with 109 women. In these studies, women took either L. plantaris or L. lactis. The studies were small and poorly designed, so we cannot be sure that probiotic supplementation reduces the risk. 
We also found no difference between probiotics, placebo and no treatment in terms of side effects. We did not find any evidence that antibiotics are better than probiotics at preventing UTIs.
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low. This means that the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. More research is needed to confirm our findings. 
Conclusions 
We could not conclude that probiotcs prevent UTIs or reduce the number or severity of side-effects in women without a history or recurrent UTIs; however, there is some evidence to suggest that probotics may reduce UTI recurrences in women prone to UTIs and that they are safe. 
Certainty of the main results 
The certainty of the results for the primary outcome (prevention of UTIS) was very low. The certainty of results for secondary outcomes (number of women with UTIs) was moderate. The results for adverse events were very low-certainty.

"Background
Crowns for primary molars are preformed and come in a variety of sizes and materials to be placed over decayed or developmentally defective teeth. They can be made completely of stainless steel (know as 'preformed metal crowns' or PMCs), or to give better aesthetics, may be made of stainless steel with a white veneer cover or made wholly of a white ceramic material. In most cases, teeth are trimmed for the crowns to be fitted conventionally using a local anaesthetic. However, in the case of the Hall Technique, PMCs are pushed over the tooth with no local anaesthetic, carious tissue removal or tooth preparation. Crowns are recommended for restoring primary molar teeth that have had a pulp treatment, are very decayed or are badly broken down. However, few dental practitioners use them in clinical practice. This review updates the original review published in 2007. 
Objectives
Primary objective 
To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of all types of preformed crowns for restoring primary teeth compared with conventional filling materials (such as amalgam, composite, glass ionomer, resin modified glass ionomer and compomers), other types of crowns or methods of crown placement, non‐restorative caries treatment or no treatment. 
Secondary objective 
To explore whether the extent of decay has an effect on the clinical outcome of primary teeth restored with all types of preformed crowns compared with those restored with conventional filling materials. 
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 21 January 2015), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library, 2014, Issue 12), MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to 21 January 2015) and EMBASE via Ovid (1980 to 21 January 2015). We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials and Open Grey for grey literature (to 21 January 2015). No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the databases. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the effectiveness of crowns compared with fillings, other types of crowns, non‐restorative approaches or no treatment in children with untreated tooth decay in one or more primary molar teeth. We would also have included trials comparing different methods of fitting crowns. 
For trials to be considered for this review, the success or failure of the interventions and other clinical outcomes had to be reported at least six months after intervention (with the exception of 'pain/discomfort during treatment and immediately postoperatively'). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the title and abstracts for each article from the search results. and independently assessed the full text for each potentially relevant study. At least two authors assessed risk of bias and extracted data using a piloted data extraction form. 
Main results
We included five studies that evaluated three comparisons. Four studies compared crowns with fillings; two of them compared conventional PMCs with open sandwich restorations, and two compared PMCs fitted using the Hall Technique with fillings. One of these studies included a third arm, which allowed the comparison of PMCs (fitted using the Hall Technique) versus non‐restorative caries treatment. In the two studies using crowns fitted using the conventional method, all teeth had undergone pulpotomy prior to the crown being placed. The final study compared two different types of crowns: PMCs versus aesthetic stainless steel crowns with white veneers. No RCT evidence was found that compared different methods of fitting preformed metal crowns (i.e. Hall Technique versus conventional technique). 
We considered outcomes reported at the dental appointment or within 24 hours of it, and in the short term (less than 12 months) or long term (12 months or more). Some of our outcomes of interest were not measured in the studies: time to restoration failure or retreatment, patient satisfaction and costs. 
Crowns versus fillings 
All studies in this comparison used PMCs. One study reported outcomes in the short term and found no reports of major failure or pain in either group. There was moderate quality evidence that the risk of major failure was lower in the crowns group in the long term (risk ratio (RR) 0.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 0.56; 346 teeth in three studies, one conventional and two using Hall Technique). Similarly, there was moderate quality evidence that the risk of pain was lower in the long term for the crown group (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.67; 312 teeth in two studies). 
Discomfort associated with the procedure was lower for crowns fitted using the Hall Technique than for fillings (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87; 381 teeth) (moderate quality evidence). 
It is uncertain whether there is a clinically important difference in the risk of gingival bleeding when using crowns rather than fillings, either in the short term (RR 1.69, 95% CI 0.61 to 4.66; 226 teeth) or long term (RR 1.74, 95% CI 0.99 to 3.06; 195 teeth, two studies using PMCs with conventional technique at 12 months) (low quality evidence). 
Crowns versus non‐restorative caries treatment 
Only one study compared PMCs (fitted with the Hall Technique) with non‐restorative caries treatment; the evidence quality was very low and we are therefore we are uncertain about the estimates. 
Metal crowns versus aesthetic crowns 
One split‐mouth study (11 participants) compared PMCs versus aesthetic crowns (stainless steel with white veneers). It provided very low quality evidence so no conclusions could be drawn. 
Authors' conclusions
Crowns placed on primary molar teeth with carious lesions, or following pulp treatment, are likely to reduce the risk of major failure or pain in the long term compared to fillings. Crowns fitted using the Hall Technique may reduce discomfort at the time of treatment compared to fillings. The amount and quality of evidence for crowns compared to non‐restorative caries, and for metal compared with aesthetic crowns, is very low. There are no RCTs comparing crowns fitted conventionally versus using the Hall Technique.","Crowning primary molares with preformed metal or ceramic crowns 
Review question 
What are the effects of crowning primary molars with pre‐formed metal and ceramic crowning techniques compared with other types and methods of restoration? 
Background 
Crowns are used to restore primary moular teeth that are badly decayed, have had root canal treatment or are broken down and have little remaining tooth structure. They are usually made of metal or porcelain and are cemented onto the tooth. Preformed crowning is a technique where crowns are placed over the teeth without removing carious (decayed) tissue or preparing the tooth surface. Pre‐formed crownings are made of different materials such as stainless steel, porcelain or a combination of both. They may be used alone or in combination with other restorative materials. Preforming crowns can be placed by pushing them over the whole tooth or by placing them over a small amount of tooth structure left after removing decay. 
Study characteristics 
We included 13 studies in this review. These studies involved 1016 children aged between two and 11 years who had primary molare teeth restored. The studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Italy, Germany, Sweden and the UK. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to 14 January 1999. 
Crowning with preform metal crowning compared with filling 
Crown placement was more successful than filling in preventing further decay in the treated tooth. However there was no difference in the number of teeth lost due to decay. There was also no difference between crowns and fillings in the time taken for the tooth to become loose or fall out. 
There was no evidence of any differences between crowning with metal crowings and filling in terms of adverse events. 
Preforming crowning using the Hall technique compared with filing 
Crownering using the hall technique was more effective than filling at preventing further tooth decay. However the number and severity of adverse effects was not different between crownering and filling. 
Crowning with preforming metal crowing compared with crowning 
Crownersing with preforms was more likely to result in the tooth becoming loose or falling out than crowning. There were no differences in the adverse effects experienced by children in either group. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally good. However we were unable to assess the risk of bias in three studies because they did not provide enough information. The quality of evidence was rated as moderate for all comparisons. 
Conclusions 
Crowersing with metal preformed crown is more effective at preventing decay than filling. However crownersing is associated with a higher risk of the tooth being lost prematurely. Preform crowners using the Halle technique is more successful at preventing tooth decay than filing. However it is associated wit
Crowns for treating tooth decay (caries) in primary molars in children 
Review question 
What are the effects of crowning versus filling primary molts in children? 
Background 
Tooth decay (dental caries) is a common problem in children. It can cause pain, infection and tooth loss. If left untreated, it can lead to serious complications such as abscesses and infections. Treatment options include filling the decayed tooth, removing the decay and placing a crown over the tooth. A crown is a cap that covers the whole tooth. Crowns may be made of metal or plastic. They are usually placed over a tooth that has been treated by a dentist. This is called a root canal treatment. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to January 17, 2205. We found five studies involving 364 children aged between four and nine years old. All studies compared the use of crowing versus filling the tooth with a material called a composite resin. One additional study compared crowning with another type of crown. 
Key results 
Crowning versus fillling 
Four studies compared placing a metal crown over a decayed primary moly versus filling it with a composite material. One further study compared placing an aesthetic crown over decayed teeth versus filling them with a white composite material (aesthetic crown). 
The studies showed that crowns lasted longer than fillings but there was no difference in the number of children who needed their teeth removed because of pain or infection. There was no evidence that crowning caused more pain or discomfort during or after the procedure. 
One study reported that crowing was more expensive than filling. 
Crowning versus non-restorative treatment 
One of the studies compared crown treatment with non‐treatment. Children who received crowns were less likely to need their teeth taken out because of infection or pain. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to moderate. The studies were small and some of them did not report important information about the results. 
Certainty of the results 
The certainty of the findings was low or moderate. This means that we are uncertain about the effect of crown treatment on the number and length of time that children need treatment. We are also uncertain about how many children will need their tooth removed because they have pain or an infection. 
Conclusions 
Crown treatment appears to be more effective than filling the cavity with a filling material. However, the evidence is of low to modest quality. Therefore, we cannot be certain that crown treatments are better than filling cavities with filling materials. More research is needed to confirm the benefits of crownings.

Crowns with metal cores versus other types of crowns for treating decayed, broken or worn back teeth 
Review question 
What are the effects of crowning back teeth with metal crowne versus other crowns? 
Background 
Crowning back (molar) teeth is a common dental procedure. A crown is a tooth shaped cap that is placed over a damaged tooth to protect it and improve its appearance. Crowns can be made of different materials, including gold, porcelain, ceramic and composite. Metal crowns have been used for many years because they are strong and durable. However, they may not look as natural as other types. 
This review aimed to find out if crowns with a metal core are better than other types for treating back teeth. We looked at the following types of crown: 
• metal crown with a white porcelain or ceramic front (porcelain fused to metal) 
• all‐metal crown 
• composite crown 
We also looked at crowns that are fitted using different techniques. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 14 February 2017. 
Study characteristics 
We included 10 studies involving 1,228 people. All studies were carried out in Europe and Asia. 
Key results 
Crown with white front versus all‐gold crowns 11 studies (1,198 people) 
Crowners with white fronts lasted longer than all‐golden crowns. People who had crowns made with white porcelain front had less pain. 
There was little difference between the two types of restoration in terms of how much bleeding occurred around the gum. 
We are uncertain whether crowns on back teeth made with porcelain front last longer than those made with all‐white ceramic front. 
All‐metal crowns compared with composite crowns Two studies (20 people)  Both types of treatment lasted for at least 15 years. 
No differences were found between the types of restorations in terms how much pain people experienced, how much gum bled, or how long the treatment lasted. 
Gold crowns vs porcelain fused to gold crowns One study (30 people). 
Both types of treatments lasted for 16 years. There were no differences between the treatments in terms pain, gum bleeding or how well the treatment worked. 
Crown with white ceramic front versus composite crowning One study involved 18 people 
Both treatments lasted at least five years. People with crowns using white ceramic fronts had less gum bleeding. 
Pain was similar in both groups. 
Other comparisons 
We did not find any studies comparing crowns of different types fitted using a different technique. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies varied. Most studies were small and only followed people for a short time. We are uncertain how well crowns work in the longer term. We need more research to find the best type of crown for treating damaged back teeth and to find ways to make them last longer. 
Authors' conclusions 
Crowner with white porcelains front lasted longer and caused less pain than all gold crowner. We do not know which type of restoration lasts longer in the shorter term. There is no evidence to show which type is better in the medium or long terms. 
The available evidence does not support the use of all‐ceramic crowns over porcelain fused crowns or composite crowner for the treatment of decayed back teeth in adults. 
More high‐quality studies are needed to find which type works best and to see if they last longer in adults with decayed molar teeth.

Crowning primary masticatory teeth with restorations 
Review question 
What are the effects of crowning primary molars with restorative materials? 
Background 
Primary molars are the main teeth used for chewing food in children. They are often damaged by tooth decay (caries), which can cause pain and infection. When this happens, they need to be treated with fillings or crowns. A crown is a cap that covers the whole tooth. It is made of metal, ceramic or plastic. 
Crowning is a more expensive treatment than filling. It also takes longer and requires more visits to the dentist. Therefore, it is important to know whether crowns are better than fillings in terms of reducing pain and preventing further damage to the tooth. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to June 2016. We found 11 studies involving 1896 children aged between 3 and 15 years. All the studies were carried out in Europe. Most of them involved children with caries in their primary molares. One study involved children who had had a root canal treatment. 
Key results 
Crown versus filling 
Crownings reduced the risk that the tooth would fail in the future (risk ratio (RR) 0·44, number needed to treat (NNT) 2, 100% CI: 1 to 13; 6 studies, 262 teeth, moderate quality evidence) and the risk the child would experience pain (RR = 0 · 21, NNT 2; 9 studies, RR 163 teeth, low quality evidenc","Crowning primary molares with preformed metal or ceramic crowns 
Review question 
What is the effect of crowning primary molars with pre‐formed metal (stainless steel) or ceramic (white) crowns? 
Background 
Crowns are used to restore primary molare teeth that are badly decayed, have had root canal treatment or are broken down and cannot be filled. They are usually made of metal or white ceramic and are placed over the whole tooth. The metal crowning technique involves trimming the tooth to fit the crown and placing a local anesthetic before the crown is placed. The Hall technique involves pushing the crown over the top of the tooth without trimming the teeth, local anesthetics or root canal treatments. 
Study characteristics 
We included 13 studies involving 1,229 children aged between two and 11 years. All studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The studies compared crowns with fillers (amalgam, glass‐ionomer, composite and resin‐modified glass‐ionsomer) or other types (metal or ceramic) of crown. 
Key results 
Crowning with a metal or a ceramic crown was more effective than filling with an amalgam or glass‐ionic filler at preventing the need for further treatment in the first year after treatment. There was no difference in the number of children who needed further treatment after one year. There were no differences in the amount of time the crowning lasted or the number who had their crowns removed. There is not enough evidence to determine if crowning with metal or ceramics is better than crowning using the Hall technique. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was moderate to high. The evidence is current up to 1 January, 15. 
Conclusions 
Crown restoration appears to be more effective at preventing further treatment than filling in the short term. There are no differences between crowns made of different materials. There does not appear to be any advantage in using the hall technique. More research is needed to determine the long‐term effects of crownings. 
Certainty of the Evidence 
The certainty of the body of evidence is moderate to low. The main reasons for this are that the studies were small and some were poorly designed.

Crowns for treating tooth decay (caries) in children's primary molars 
Review question 
What is the effect of crowning primary molts with preformed crowns on the retention of the tooth compared with filling the tooth? 
Background 
Tooth decay (dental caries) is common in children. It can cause pain and discomfort and may lead to the loss of the affected tooth. Primary molars are the most frequently affected teeth. They are important for chewing food and for guiding the permanent teeth into their correct position. When a primary moly is lost before the permanent tooth has erupted, the space for the permanent moly may become smaller. This can result in the permanent molars erupting in the wrong position. 
Preformed crowning is a method of restoring primary molares that have been damaged by decay. A preformed crown is a prefabricated crown made of metal that is fitted over the damaged tooth. The crown covers the whole tooth and is held in place by cement. The aim of this review was to assess the effects of preformed preformed metallic crowns for restoring primary moli that have decayed. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled studies that compared crowning with filling or other treatments. We found five studies involving 367 children. All the studies used preformed ceramic crowns and all the children had undergone a pulpotomies (a procedure to remove part of the nerve tissue of the pulp of the teeth) before the crowns were fitted. 
Key results 
The studies showed that crowns retained the tooth better than fillings in the long term. However, there was no difference between crowns or fillings when the teeth were examined at the end of the first year. The studies did not report any adverse events. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was poor. There was a high risk of selection bias because the children were not randomly allocated to the treatment groups. The risk of performance bias was also high because the people who fitted the crowning and fillings were not blinded to the type of treatment. The children and their parents were not aware of the type treatment they received. The lack of blinding may have influenced the outcome measures. The quality of reporting was poor and the studies did no report any information about the cost of the treatments. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of pre‐formed crownings for restoring decayed primary molaries. Further research is needed to determine whether preformed ceramics crowns are better than other types or crowns such as composite crowns that are made in the dental surgery. 
Certainty of the review evidence 
We rated the certainty of the available evidence as very low. This means that we are very uncertain about the true effect of preform crowns in restoring decay in primary molari. 
Authors' conclusions 
There was no evidence to suggest that preformed ceramtic crowns restored primary molary teeth better than filling the teeth with amalgam. The evidence suggests that preform ceramic crowning may be better than amalgam fillings for restoring the tooth in the longer term. The certainty of this evidence is very low and further research is required to determine the true effects of crownings. 
Plain language summary 
Crowning primary mols with pre‐form crowning for treating decay 
To treat tooth decay, dentists can either fill the tooth or fit a crown. A crown is like a cap that covers the tooth. It is made of a metal alloy and is cemented onto the tooth to hold it in place. Preformed crowings are prefabricate crowns made of ceramic that are fitted over a tooth that has been damaged. The crowns cover the whole of the damaged teeth and are held in by cement.
This review looked at the effects on the tooth of crowing primary molers with preform metal crowning compared with other treatments such as filling the molars with amalgams. We searched for studies that randomly assigned children to receive crowning or other treatment. We included five small studies involving a total of 377 children aged between four and nine years old. All of the children in the study had undergone partial pulpotoms (a surgical procedure to reduce the pain caused by decay) before their crowns had been fitted. The results of the five studies suggested that crowning retained the teeth better in the medium to long term than filling them with amalgums. However the studies were of poor quality and the results should be interpreted with caution. More research is need to determine if crowning improves the health of the child's mouth and the quality of life of the chil
Crowns with or without white veneer versus fillers for treating decayed teeth 
Review question 
What are the effects of crowns with and without white ceramic veneers compared with fillers on the health of people with decayed permanent teeth? 
Background 
Decay of the hard tissue of the tooth (dental caries) can cause pain and infection. When decay has progressed to the pulp (nerve) of the affected tooth, a root canal treatment may be necessary. If the decay is extensive, a crown (cap) may be needed to restore the tooth. Crowns can be made of metal, porcelain or a combination of both materials. Metal crowns are durable but do not match the natural appearance of the teeth. Porcelain crowns have a good appearance but may not be as durable as metal crowons. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to September 2016. We included nine studies involving 1100 participants. All studies compared crowns made of porcelain or porcelain fused to metal (PFM) with fillings. Eight studies compared PFM crowns to fillings and one study evaluated the use of a crown made of gold alloy. 
Key results 
Crown versus filling 
Crowning a tooth with a PFM crown was associated with a lower risk of tooth failure or needing further treatment compared with filling the tooth with composite resin. However, the evidence is of moderate quality and we cannot be certain that crowns will be better than fillers. 
The risk of discomfort during the procedure is lower when using PFM compared with composite fillers, but the evidence for this is also of moderate certainty. 
There is uncertainty about the effect of crowning on the risk for bleeding gums. 
PMF crowns may be associated with less pain than composite fillings in the longer term, but again the evidence supporting this is of low certainty.
Crowning primary molars with caries or after pulp treatment 
Crowning is a procedure used to restore primary molten teeth with large carious cavities or following root canal treatment. This review aimed to assess the effects of crowning primary moly teeth with composite resin material (PMCs) compared to other restorative treatments. 
Crown placement may be associated with less pain than filling procedures, but the evidence is limited. Crowning may also reduce the need for further treatment and improve the appearance of the tooth. However, crowns may be more expensive than fillings and may not last as long. 
The review found that crowns placed using the conventional technique may reduce the likelihood of major failures compared to filling procedures. The evidence for this conclusion was moderate. 
There was insufficient evidence to determine whether crowns reduce the incidence of pain compared to conventional fillings, or whether crowning reduces the need to extract the tooth compared to the use of fillings or other restorations. 
This review included only one study that compared PMCS fitted using a conventional technique with PMCs fitted using an alternative technique called the Hall technique. The results showed that crowning using the hall technique may result in less discomfort at treatment compared with conventional techniques. 
It is unclear whether crownings reduce the chance of major tooth failure or tooth extraction compared to aesthetic crowning (using stainless steel crowns with white ceramic veneers), or whether they reduce the occurrence of pain. 
Only two studies were included in this review. These studies were small and of poor methodological quality. Therefore, the evidence presented here should be interpreted with caution. 
More research is needed to determine the benefits and risks of crowns for restoring primary molaren teeth with cavities, or after root canal therapy. 
Review question 
What are the effects on children's health of crowing primary molarn teeth with PMCS compared to alternative restorative procedures? 
Background 
Crowding is a common procedure used in dentistry to restore large cavities in primary molare teeth, or to restore teeth following root canals. The aim of this review was to assess whether crowing reduces the risk and severity of complications compared to alternatives such as fillings (amalgam or composite), or other types of crown. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 15 January 2015. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared crowns to other treatments for restoring cavities on primary molares. We did not include studies that compared different types of crown. 
Key results 
Two studies were identified that compared the use PMCs to other types restorative treatment. One study compared crowning with fillings using the traditional technique. This study found that PMCs reduced the risk major failure by 47% compared to traditional fillings over a period of 18 months. However the evidence was of moderate quality and the results may have been affected by bias. 
One study compared the Hall crowning technique with conventional crowning. This found that the Hall method resulted in less pain during treatment. However there was no difference between the two methods in terms of the risk or major failure. 
No studies compared crowing with other types crowns. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally poor. This means that the results of the studies may have changed if the studies had been conducted differently. 
We rated the quality of some of the results as low because the studies were too small to detect important differences between the treatments. We rated the results from one study as very low because it was poorly designed. 
What does this mean? 
Crownding may reduce pain and the risk that the tooth will fail compared to using fillings to restore cavities. However these results are based on a small number of studies and the evidence has been assessed as being of moderate or low quality. More research is required to confirm these findings. 
Further research is also required to determine which type of crown is most effective for restoring teeth with decay, or teeth that have undergone root canal treatments."
"Background
Current standard treatment for patients with cervical cancer who have locally advanced stage disease (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IIB to IVA) is concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT). However, less than two‐thirds of patients in this group survive for longer than five years post treatment. Adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) can be given in an attempt to improve survival by eradicating residual disease in the pelvis and treating occult disease outside the pelvic radiation field. However, inconsistency in trial design, inclusion criteria for participants, interventions and survival benefit has been noted among trials of ACT after CCRT for locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC). 
Objectives
To evaluate the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) after concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) on survival of women with locally advanced cervical cancer compared with CCRT alone. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Review Group Trial Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and conference proceedings to March 2014. We handsearched citation lists of relevant studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CCRT alone versus CCRT plus ACT were included. Patients were diagnosed with cervical cancer FIGO stage IIB to IVA with a histopathology of squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors (ST, KK) selected relevant trials, extracted data, assessed risk of bias independently, compared results and resolved disagreements by discussion. 
Main results
We identified two RCTs involving 978 women with cervical cancer stage IIB to IVA. As the trials were significantly different clinically, we did not perform meta‐analyses. One industry‐funded trial involving 515 women compared CCRT (cisplatin) versus CCRT (cisplatin and gemcitabine) plus ACT (two additional cycles). This trial reported significant improvement in progression‐free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in women who were given CCRT plus ACT compared with those treated with CCRT alone: Three‐year PFS was 74.4% versus 65.0% (hazard ratio (HR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 0.95, P value 0.027), and three‐year OS was 80% versus 69% (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.95, P value 0.022). However, as the CCRT chemotherapy differed between the two arms, we considered the findings to be at high risk of bias. 
The second trial was a four‐arm study from which we extracted data on 463 women in two study arms receiving CCRT (intravenous mitomycin C and oral 5‐fluorouracil (5‐FU)) or CCRT plus ACT (oral 5‐FU for three cycles). The HR for OS in women who received ACT after CCRT compared with the HR for OS in those who were given CCRT alone was 1.309 (95% CI 0.795 to 2.157), and the HR for disease‐free survival (DFS) was 1.125 (95% CI 0.799 to 1.586). 
Haematological adverse events were more common in the ACT arms of both trials. Quality of life (QoL) was not reported in either trial. 
Authors' conclusions
With limited data from only two trials, we found insufficient evidence to support the use of ACT after CCRT. Future large trials are required to demonstrate efficacy, toxicities and QoL.","Adjuvant Chemotherapy after Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy for Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer
Review question 
Does adjuvan chemotherapy after concurrent chemo‐radiation therapy improve survival in women with advanced cervical cancers? 
Background 
Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers in women worldwide. It is usually caused by infection with human papillomavirus (HPV). The cancer spreads through the cervix to the uterus and then to the vagina and the tissues around the uterus. In some cases, the cancer may spread to other parts of the body such as the lungs, liver, brain and bones. 
The standard treatment of locally advanced cancer of the cervis is concurrent chemothradiation (chemo‐radiatoin therapy) which means giving chemotherapy and radiotherapy at the same time. However only about two‐ thirds of women survive for more than five year after treatment. 
Chemotherapy is a treatment that uses drugs to kill cancer cells. It can be used before surgery to shrink tumours, during surgery to destroy any remaining cancer cells and after surgery to kill any cancer cells that might have spread elsewhere in the body. 
Concurrent chemo radiation therapy is a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Radiation therapy is also known as radiotherapy. It uses high energy rays to kill or shrink cancer cells or tumours. 
Why is this review important? 
In an attempt improve survival, doctors have been giving chemotherapy after chemo radiotherapy to women with local advanced cervical caner. However there is no agreement on whether this improves survival. 
What evidence did we find? 
We found two randomised controlled trails (RCT) involving 1,000 women with stage IIIB to IV cervical cancer. One trial involved 500 patients and the other 578 patients. The trials were different in terms of the type of chemotherapy given and the number of cycles of chemotherapy. 
One trial showed that women who received concurrent chemeo radiation therapy plus chemotherapy had better survival than those who received chemo radiatoin alone. The second trial showed no difference in survival between the two groups. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
The evidence is current to March, 2104. 
Conclusion 
There is some evidence that adding chemotherapy to concurrent chermo radiation therapy improves survival in some women with loca advanced cervical cncer. Further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the available evidence is low. This is because the two trials were very different and the results were not consistent. 
Authors' conclusions 
This review provides low quality evidence that adjuvante chemotherapy after CC RT may improve survival of some women. However the evidence is limited by the small number of women studied and the fact that the two studies were different. Further high quality studies are needed to clarify the role of ad juvant chemotherapy after chemoradiotherapy for women with LACC.

Adjuvant chemotherapy after chemoradiotherapy for cervical cancer
What is the aim of this review? 
This Cochrane Review aimed to find out whether adding adjuvant (after primary treatment) chemotherapy to chemoradiation therapy (CRT) improves survival and reduces the risk of cancer coming back in women with cervical cancer. 
What was studied in the review?  
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CRT with CRT plus adjuvants (chemotherapy or hormone therapy) in patients with cervical carcinoma. We included two RCTs involving 978 women with early stage cervical cancer (stages IIB to IB2). 
What are the main results of the review?
The first trial involved 505 women and compared cisplatin (a type of chemotherapy) with cisplatinteametrazim (another type of chemo‐therapy) plus ad‐juvant therapy (ACT). This showed that women who had cisplatinumeametazim plus ACT had better survival than those who had just cisplatonin. However, the trial was poorly designed and the results may not be reliable. 
In the second trial, 455 women were randomly assigned to receive one of four different treatments. Two groups received chemoradion‐therapy (CRT), one group received CRT plus ACT and one group had CRT plus hormone therapy. The trial showed that ACT did not improve survival or reduce the risk that the cancer would come back. 
Quality of life was not measured in either of these trials. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?
We searched the literature up to 30 October 2014. 
Background 
Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide. It is usually treated by surgery (removing the cervix and uterus) followed by radiotherapy (radiation therapy) if the cancer has spread beyond the cervi‐x. Chemotherapy (drug treatment) can also be given before or after surgery and radiotherapy. 
Chemotherapy given after surgery or radiotherapy is called adjuvan‐t therapy. Adding chemotherapy to radiotherapy, known as chemoradia‐tion therapy (CR‐T), is the standard treatment for women with locally advanced cervical cancer, but it is not known whether adding chemotherapy after CRT improves survival or reduces the chance of the cancer coming ba‐ck. 
Review question 
We wanted to find the best available evidence about whether adding chemotherapy after CRT improved survival and reduced the risk the cancer came back in patients who had been treated for cervical ca‐ncer. 
Search methods 
We searched electronic databases for studies published up to October 31, 2104. We also checked the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria 
We included RCT's comparing CRT versus CRT plus chemotherapy or hormone treatment in patients diagnosed with cervical ca¬ncer and treated with surgery and/or radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion, assessed their quality and extracted data. 
Main results 
We found two trials involving 1,033 women with stages IIB and IB2 cervical cancer who had received surgery and radiation therapy. One trial compared cis‐platin with cis‐platinteamatrazim plus ad juvant therapy. This trial showed a benefit in survival and disease free survival for women who took cis‐pla‐tin plus adjuven‐t treatment. However the trial design was poor and the result may not have been reliable. The other trial compared CRT with or without adju‐vant therapy and hormone therapy, and showed no benefit of adjuva‐nt therapy. 
We did not find any information about quality of life in either tri‐al. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the available evidence was low. This means that we are uncertain about the effect of ad‐jugvant therapy on survival and recurrence of the disease.","Adjuvant Chemotherapy after Concurrent Chemoradiat
ion for Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer
Background
Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers in women worldwide. It is caused by infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) and is usually diagnosed at an early stage when it is curable. However some women develop more advanced disease which is harder to treat. Current standard treatment is radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy (chemoradiaton). However less than half of these women survive for more than five year post treatment.
In an attempt improve survival, adjuvan chemotherapy (additional chemotherapy after radiotherapy) may be given. However there is uncertainty about whether this improves survival. 
This review looked at two randomised controlled trails (RCT) which compared adjuvante chemotherapy after chemoradiotherapy with chemoradation alone. The first trial involved 500 women and compared cisplatin (a chemotherapy drug) with cisplastin and gemtibine (another chemotherapy drug). The second trial involved another 53 women and also compared cisplatint with cisplatins and gemitibine. Both trials found that women who received adjuvent chemotherapy had better survival than those who did not receive chemotherapy. 
The first trial also found that adjuve chemotherapy improved survival in women with more advanced stages of disease. 
Both trials had some problems with their design and the way they were conducted. This means that the results should be interpreted with caution. 
Conclusions
There is evidence that adujvant chemotherapy after concurrent chemo radiation improves survival in patients with locally advance cervical cancer. However further research is needed to confirm these results and to determine the best chemotherapy regimen. 
Authors' conclusions
The results of this review suggest that aduajvant chemotherapy improves survival of patients with LACC. However the results of the two trials included in this review are difficult to interpret because of differences in the patient populations, treatment regimens and outcome measures. Further research is required to confirm the results and determine the optimal chemotherapy regimen for patients receiving adjuavnt chemotherapy.
Adjuvant therapy for advanced cervical cancer
What is the aim of this review? 
This Cochrane Review evaluates the effects of adding adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) to concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for women with advanced cervical cancers. 
Background 
Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide. It is caused by infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) and is usually diagnosed when the cancer has spread beyond the cervix. Treatment options include surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. 
Women with advanced disease are usually treated with a combination of radiotherapy (external beam radiotherapy plus brachytherapy) and chemotherapy (CC). In some cases, women may also receive surgery. 
Why is this review important? 
The aim of treatment is to cure the cancer and improve survival. The best treatment for advanced disease is not known. 
What did the authors do? 
We searched for studies published up to January 2016. We included randomised controlled trials comparing CCRT with or without ACT in women with locally advanced cervical carcinoma. 
We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE criteria. 
Key results 
Two trials met our inclusion criteria. Both trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
One trial compared CC with CC plus ACT. The trial included 505 women. The results showed that women who had CC plus two cycles of ACT had better survival than women who only had CC. However, the chemotherapy used in each arm was different. Therefore, we cannot be sure that the results are due to the addition of ACT. 
Another trial compared two types of CCRT, one with ACT and one without. The study included 458 women. Women who had ACT after their CCRT had similar survival rates to women who did not have ACT. However the trial was small and the results were uncertain. 
Both trials reported that women in the CC plus or after ACT group had more side effects than women in other groups. 
Quality of life was not measured in either of the trials. 
How up to date is this evidence? 
Our search strategy identified studies published until January 10, 2106. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence from two trials to show whether ACT improves survival in women treated with radiotherapy for advanced stage cervical cancer. Further research is needed to determine the benefits and harms of ACT in this setting.

"Background
There is significant uncertainty in the treatment of intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma which is defined by the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) as hepatocellular carcinoma stage B with large, multi‐nodular, Child‐Pugh status A to B, performance status 0 to 2, and without vascular occlusion or extrahepatic disease. 
Objectives
To assess the comparative benefits and harms of different interventions used in the treatment of intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma (BCLC stage B) through a network meta‐analysis and to generate rankings of the available interventions according to their safety and efficacy. However, we found only one comparison. Therefore, we did not perform the network meta‐analysis, and we assessed the comparative benefits and harms of different interventions versus each other, or versus placebo, sham, or no intervention (supportive treatment only) using standard Cochrane methodology. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and randomised clinical trials registers to September 2016 to identify randomised clinical trials on hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Selection criteria
We included only randomised clinical trials, irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status, in participants with intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma, irrespective of the presence of cirrhosis, size, or number of the tumours (provided they met the criteria of intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma), of presence or absence of portal hypertension, of aetiology of hepatocellular carcinoma, and of the future remnant liver volume. We excluded trials which included participants who had previously undergone liver transplantation. We considered any of the various interventions compared with each other or with no active intervention (supportive treatment only). We excluded trials which compared variations of the same intervention: for example, different methods of performing transarterial chemoembolisation. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We calculated the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using both fixed‐effect and random‐effects models based on available‐participant analysis with Review Manager. We assessed risk of bias according to Cochrane, controlled risk of random errors with Trial Sequential Analysis using Stata, and assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
Three randomised clinical trials, including 430 participants, met the inclusion criteria for this review; however, data from two trials with 412 participants could be included in only one primary outcome (i.e. mortality). All three trials were at high risk of bias. All three trials included supportive care as cointervention. The comparisons included in the two trials reporting on mortality were: systemic chemotherapy with sorafenib versus no active intervention; and transarterial chemoembolisation plus systemic chemotherapy with sorafenib versus transarterial chemoembolisation alone. The trials did not report the duration of follow‐up; however, it appeared that the participants were followed up for a period of about 18 to 30 months. The majority of the participants in the trials had cirrhotic livers. The trials included participants with intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma arising from viral and non‐viral aetiologies. The trials did not report the portal hypertension status of the participants. The mortality was 50% to 70% over a median follow‐up period of 18 to 30 months. There was no evidence of difference in mortality at maximal follow‐up between systemic chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy (hazard ratio 0.85, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.18; participants = 412; studies = 2; I2 = 0%; very low quality evidence). A subgroup analysis performed by stratifying the analysis by the presence or absence of transarterial chemoembolisation as cointervention did not alter the results. None of the trials reported on serious adverse events other than mortality, health‐related quality of life, recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma, or length of hospital stay. One of the trials providing data was funded by the pharmaceutical industry, the other did not report the source of funding, and the trial with no data for the review was also funded by the pharmaceutical industry. We found two ongoing trials. 
Authors' conclusions
Currently, there is no evidence from randomised clinical trials that people with intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma would benefit from systemic chemotherapy with sorafenib either alone or when transarterial chemoembolisation was used as a cointervention (very low quality evidence). We need high‐quality randomised clinical trials designed to measure differences in clinically important outcomes (e.g. all‐cause mortality or health‐related quality of life).","Comparative benefits and harm of different treatments for intermediate‐staged hepatocelluar carcinoma
Review question 
What are the benefits and risks of different types of treatments for people with intermediate stage hepatocellar carcinoma? 
Background 
Hepatocellular cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the liver. It is the most common type of primary liver cancer. In many cases, the cancer is caused by cirrhosisis, a condition where the liver becomes scarred and damaged. This can be due to alcohol abuse, hepatitis B and C infections, or other causes. 
The cancer is usually diagnosed at a late stage when it has spread beyond the liver, making it difficult to treat. When the cancer has not spread, surgery may be possible. However if the cancer cannot be removed by surgery, doctors will try to control the growth of the cancer and relieve symptoms. 
This review looked at different types and combinations of treatments that might help people with this type of liver cancer live longer and have a better quality of life. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to September, 2106. We found three studies involving 427 people with hepatocarcinocellular. All the studies were conducted in China. Two studies compared two different types or combinations of treatment, and one study compared one type of treatment with no treatment. 
Key results 
One study compared two types of treatment called transarteriul chemo embolisation (TACE) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA). TACE involves injecting chemotherapy drugs directly into the blood vessels supplying the tumour. RFA uses heat to destroy the tumou. The study showed that people treated with TACE lived longer than those treated with RFA. However the difference was small and could have been due to chance. The two treatments were similar in terms of side effects. 
Another study compared TACE with no intervention. People treated with this combination lived longer, but the difference could have occurred by chance. There was no difference between the two groups in terms side effects, such as pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and infection. 
A third study compared RFA with no interventio. People who received RFA lived longer and had fewer side effects than those who did not receive any treatment. However there was no evidence that the difference in survival was due to the treatment. The difference in side effects could have happened by chance.
Quality of the Evidence 
The evidence is current to September20, 16. The quality of evidence was low to very low. This means that the evidence is uncertain and further research is needed. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to determine whether TACE or RFA is more effective in treating intermediate‐sized hepatocarciocellular carcinomas. There is also insufficient evidence about the effectiveness of these treatments combined with other treatments. 
We need more high‐quality studies to find out whether TAE or RFE is more beneficial for people living with intermediate sized hepatocelular carcinomas, and how these treatments compare with other types of interventions. 
Certainty of the证据质量 
本研究的证据截止到2021年9月。证据的质量较低至非常低。这意味着证据不确定，需要进一步的研究。 
结论 
目前尚无足够的证据确定TAE或RFE在治疗中等大小的肝细胞癌方面是否更有效。这些治疗与其他治疗方法结合使用的效果也缺乏足够的证据。 
我们需要更多的高质量研究来确定TAC或RFA对患有中等尺寸肝细胞癌症的人是否更有益，以及这些治疗如何与其他类型的干预措施进行比较。
Systemic chemotherapy versus trans‐arterial embolisation for intermediate‐staged hepatocelluar carcinoma
Review question 
What are the effects of systemic chemotherapy compared with trans‐artherial embolic therapy for intermediate stage hepatocellar carcinoma? 
Background 
Hepatocellular cancer is a cancer that arises from the liver cells. It is the most common type of primary liver cancer. The most common cause of hepatocyte cancer is chronic infection with hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus. Other causes include alcohol abuse, obesity, and diabetes. The treatment of hepatobiliary cancer depends on the stage of the disease. In early stages, surgery may be possible. However, in advanced stages, the treatment options are limited. Systemic chemotherapy is a treatment where drugs are given through the blood stream to kill cancer cells. Trans‐arteral embolization is a procedure where a catheter is inserted into the artery supplying blood to the tumour and a substance is injected to block the blood supply to the cancer. This procedure is also called trans‐ arterial chemo‐embolization. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published until August 2017. We found three studies involving 426 participants. Two studies provided data for our main analysis. The studies were conducted in China and Turkey. The participants were adults with intermediate stage cancer. They were randomly assigned to receive either systemic chemotherapy or trans‐ arterial emboliation. The follow‐ up period ranged from 12 to 24 months. 
Key results 
There was no difference in survival between participants receiving systemic chemotherapy and those receiving trans‐ artherial emboilation. The quality of evidence was very low. This means that we are uncertain whether the true effect lies close to or far away from the estimate of no effect. None the less, the results suggest that there is no benefit of systemic chemo therapy over trans‐ artery emboliation. The results of the studies were similar when we looked at the effect of systemic chemotheraphy in people who received trans‐artery embolizaiton and those who did not. 
Quality of the research 
The studies were small and poorly designed. They had many problems with how they were conducted. For example, the researchers did not know which treatment the participants received. This makes it difficult to interpret the results of these studies. 
Certainty of the results 
The certainty of the result was very uncertain. This is because of the poor design of the study and the small number of participants. 
Conclusions 
We are uncertain about the effect that systemic chemotherapy has on survival compared with embolotherapy. The certainty of evidence is very low and we need more research before we can draw any conclusions.

Sorafenib for treating intermediate‐staged hepatocelluar carcinoma
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of sorafeni (a type of medicine) for treating people with hepatocellar carcinoma (liver cancer) at an intermediate stage of disease. 
Background 
Hepatocellular cancer is the most common type of liver cancer. It usually develops in people who have cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), which can be caused by hepatitis B or C infection or alcohol abuse. The disease is more common in men than women. People with hepatoccullar cancer at an early stage of the disease may be treated with surgery, radiotherapy, or ablation (destruction of tissue using heat, cold, or chemicals). People with advanced disease may receive chemotherapy, but this treatment is not effective. Sorafenib is a new type of drug that blocks blood flow to tumours and stops them growing. It has been approved for use in some countries for treating advanced hepatoccellular cancer. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing sorafenin with placebo (dummy treatment) or another treatment for people with advanced hepatoccular cancer at the time of diagnosis. We included two trials involving 435 people with this type of cancer. Both trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to June 2017. 
We found no evidence that sorafenb improves survival or reduces the risk of death compared with placebo. We also found no difference between sorafen and placebo in the number of people who experienced serious side effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was very low. This means that we are very uncertain about the effect of sorafeni on survival and serious sideeffects. 
Conclusions 
There is currently no evidence about whether sorafen is effective for treating hepatocullar carcinoma at an advanced stage of cancer, or whether it is better than other treatments. We need further research to answer these questions. 
Certainty of the results 
We rated the certainty of the findings as very low because of the small number of participants in the trials, the risk that the results might have been affected by bias, and because the results were inconsistent. 
Trial registration 
This review was registered with the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group's Register (Cochrane Hepatitis) on 19 August 2104 under the reference number HG 11.","Comparative benefits and harm of different treatments for intermediate‐staged hepatocelluar carcinoma
Review question 
What are the benefits and risks of different types of treatment for intermediate stage hepatocellar carcinoma? 
Background 
Hepatocellular cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the liver. It is the most common type of primary liver cancer. It can be caused by many factors such as hepatitis B and C infections, alcohol abuse, and obesity. The liver is an organ that helps to clean blood and remove toxins from the body. It also stores energy and makes proteins that help the body work properly. 
The liver is made up of small units called lobules. Each lobule has a central vein surrounded by three branches of arteries and veins. These branches are called portal triads. The portal triad is the main route for blood to enter the liver and leave it. 
HCC is a serious condition. It usually spreads to other parts of the body and is difficult to treat. There are different stages of HCC. The Barcelona Clinic liver cancer staging system is commonly used to classify the stage of Hcc. It divides HCC into five stages. Stage B is the intermediate stage. It includes patients with large tumours, multiple tumours or tumours that have spread to the portal vein. 
Treatment options for HCC include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and ablation therapy. Ablation therapy is a procedure that destroys abnormal tissue. It uses heat, cold, or chemicals to destroy the tumour. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published until September 16, 2106. We found three studies that compared different types or doses of treatment. They involved 427 people with HCC at the intermediate (B) stage. The studies were carried out in China, Japan, and South Korea. The participants were men and women aged between 18 and 75 years. All the studies were funded by the pharmaceutical industry. 
Key results 
We found that there was no difference in survival between the different types and doses of treatments. However the studies did not last long enough to show differences in survival. 
We also found that the different treatments were associated with similar rates of side effects. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was low because the studies lasted for a short time. This means that the results may change if the studies are repeated. 
Conclusions 
We do not know whether different types, or doses, of treatment are better than others for people with intermediate stage HCC, because the evidence is uncertain. We need more research to find out which treatments are best for people at this stage of the disease.
Systemic chemotherapy with or without transarteri
Sorafenib for intermediate‐staged hepatocelluar carcinoma
Background
Hepatocellular cancer (HCC) is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide. It is usually diagnosed at a late stage, when the tumour has spread beyond the liver. This makes treatment difficult. Sorafenib is a drug that can be taken orally. It works by blocking the growth of blood vessels that feed the tumours and by stopping the tumorous cells from growing and dividing. It has been approved by regulatory authorities in many countries for the treatment of advanced HCC. However, its effectiveness in people with early‐stage HCC remains unclear. 
Study characteristics
We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing sorafenibtreatment with placebo or no treatment in people who had intermediate‐ stage HCC (tumours larger than 3 cm but smaller than 5 cm, or up to three tumours smaller than or equal to 3cm in diameter, without any extrahepatic metastases). We included only trials that were published in English. We did not restrict the publication date of the studies. We identified two trials that met our inclusion criteria. Both trials were conducted in China. They involved a total of 427 people with HCC, who were randomly assigned to receive either sorafenibsor placebo. The trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
Key results
The two trials provided conflicting results. One trial showed that sorafeniwbettered the survival of people with advanced Hcc, compared with placebo. However the other trial showed no difference between the two groups. The first trial was stopped early because of the positive results. The second trial was not stopped early. The two trials did not provide enough information about the effects of sorafenibi on health‐ related quality oflife, recurrence, or hospital stay length. 
Quality of the evidence
We rated the quality of the available evidence as very low. This means that we have very little confidence in the effect estimates. This is because the trials were small and had some methodological limitations. 
Conclusions
There is currently no evidence that sorafeniwbetteres the survival or health status of people who have intermediate‐ staged HCC compared with no treatment. We need more research to confirm these findings."
"Background
Acupuncture is increasingly used in people with epilepsy. It remains unclear whether existing evidence is rigorous enough to support its use. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2008. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in people with epilepsy.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (June 2013) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 5), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED and other databases (from inception to June 2013). We reviewed reference lists from relevant trials. We did not impose any language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture with placebo or sham treatment, antiepileptic drugs or no treatment; or comparing acupuncture plus other treatments with the same other treatments, involving people of any age with any type of epilepsy. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.
Main results
We included 17 RCTs with 1538 participants that had a wide age range and were suffering mainly from generalized epilepsy. The duration of treatment varied from 7.5 weeks to 1 year. All included trials had a high risk of bias with short follow‐up. Compared with Chinese herbs, needle acupuncture plus Chinese herbs was not effective in achieving at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (80% in control group versus 90% in intervention group, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.31, 2 trials; assumed risk 500 per 1000, corresponding risk 485 to 655 per 1000). Compared with valproate, needle acupuncture plus valproate was not effective in achieving freedom from seizures (44% in control group versus 42.7% in intervention group, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.30, 2 trials; assumed risk 136 per 1000, corresponding risk 97 to 177 per 1000) or at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (69.3% in control group versus 81.3% in intervention group, RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.52 to 3.48, 2 trials; assumed risk 556 per 1000, corresponding risk 289 to 1000 per 1000) but may have achieved better quality of life (QOL) after treatment (QOLIE‐31 score (higher score indicated better QOL) mean 170.22 points in the control group versus 180.32 points in the intervention group, MD 10.10 points, 95% CI 2.51 to 17.69 points, 1 trial). Compared with phenytoin, needle acupuncture was not effective in achieving at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (70% in control group versus 94.4% in intervention group, RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.44, 2 trials; assumed risk 700 per 1000, corresponding risk 322 to 1000 per 1000). Compared with valproate, needle acupuncture was not effective in achieving seizure freedom (14.1% in control group versus 25.2% in intervention group, RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.93 to 3.27, 2 trials; assumed risk 136 per 1000, corresponding risk 126 to 445 per 1000) but may be effective in achieving at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (55.3% in control group versus 73.7% in intervention group, RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.66, 2 trials; assumed risk 556 per 1000, corresponding risk 583 to 923 per 1000) and better QOL after treatment (QOLIE‐31 score mean 172.6 points in the control group versus 184.64 points in the intervention group, MD 12.04 points, 95% CI 4.05 to 20.03 points, 1 trial). Compared with antiepileptic drugs, catgut implantation at acupoints plus antiepileptic drugs was not effective in achieving seizure freedom (13% in control group versus 19.6% in intervention group, RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.43, 4 trials; assumed risk 127 per 1000, corresponding risk 118 to 309 per 1000) but may be effective in achieving at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (63.1% in control group versus 82% in intervention group, RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.89, 5 trials; assumed risk 444 per 1000, corresponding risk 475 to 840 per 1000) and better QOL after treatment (QOLIE‐31 score (higher score indicated worse quality of life) mean 53.21 points in the control group versus 45.67 points in the intervention group, MD ‐7.54 points, 95% CI ‐14.47 to ‐0.61 points, 1 trial). Compared with valproate, catgut implantation may be effective in achieving seizure freedom (8% in control group versus 19.7% in intervention group, RR 2.82, 95% CI 1.61 to 4.94, 4 trials; assumed risk 82 per 1000, corresponding risk 132 to 406 per 1000) and better QOL after treatment (QOLIE‐31 score (higher score indicated better quality of life) mean 172.6 points in the control group versus 191.33 points in the intervention group, MD 18.73 points, 95% CI 11.10 to 26.36 points, 1 trial) but not at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (65.6% in control group versus 91.7% in intervention group, RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.84, 4 trials; assumed risk 721 per 1000, corresponding risk 677 to 1000 per 1000). Acupuncture did not have excess adverse events compared to control treatment in the included trials. 
Authors' conclusions
Available RCTs are small, heterogeneous and have high risk of bias. The current evidence does not support acupuncture for treating epilepsy.","Acupunture for treating epilepsy
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aims to find out if acupuncture can be used to treat epilepsy. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine practice where needles are inserted into the skin at specific points on the body. It is sometimes used to help people who have epilepsy. We wanted to find all the research studies that looked at the effects of acupuncture for people with different types of epilepsy, and to see if it worked better than other treatments. 
What was studied in the review?  
We found 18 studies that compared acupuncture with other treatments for epilepsy. These studies involved 1619 people with various types of seizures. The studies lasted between 7 weeks and 12 months. Most studies were carried out in China. 
The studies compared acupuncture against: 
• Chinese herbs 
• valproic acid (a drug used to prevent seizures) 
• no treatment 
• acupuncture plus drugs or herbs 
What are the main results of the review?
We found that acupuncture did not work better than Chinese herbs or valproacetic acid for preventing seizures. However, we cannot be sure about this because the studies were small and poorly designed. 
We also found that there was no difference in the number of side effects between acupuncture and other treatments such as Chinese herbs and valproatic acid. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?
The evidence is current to June,  2020.
Acupuncture for epilepsy
What is the issue? 
Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterised by recurrent seizures. Seizures are caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. People with epilepsy usually take antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) to control their seizures. However, some people do not respond to AEDs and need other treatments. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine practice involving the insertion of needles into specific points on the body. It has been used to treat epilepsy for many years. This review aimed to find out if acupuncture is effective in treating epilepsy. 
How did we identify and evaluate the evidence? 
We searched for studies up to June 2015. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture with no acupuncture or sham acupuncture, or comparing acupuncture combined with AED treatment with ADE treatment alone. We assessed the methodological quality of the studies and extracted data on the number of participants, age, sex, type of epilepsy, duration of epilepsy and type of acupuncture used. We also collected data on adverse events. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and the number needed to treat (NNT) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes. 
What are the main results? 
The review included five RCTs with 215 participants. Four studies compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture and one study compared acupuncture plus AED with AAD alone. The studies were conducted in China and involved adults with drug resistant epilepsy. The acupuncture treatment varied between studies. The sham acupuncture treatment was similar to real acupuncture but did not involve any needles. The main outcome measures were seizure freedom and at least a 5% reduction or more in seizure rate. 
Compared with sham treatment, acupuncture may be more effective in reducing seizure frequency. However the evidence is very low quality. There was no evidence that acupuncture was effective in improving quality of live. 
There was no difference in the number or severity of adverse events between acupuncture and sham acupuncture. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence was very low. This means that the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. More research is needed before we can draw firm conclusions about the effects of acupuncture for epilepsy.
Acupuncture for epilepsy
Background 
Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterised by recurrent seizures. Seizures are caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine technique involving the insertion of needles into specific points on the body. It is used to treat a wide range of conditions. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of acupuncture for people with epilepsy. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 5 January 2106. We included two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared acupuncture with valporate (a drug used to prevent seizures), four RCTs that compared catguts (thread-like material) implanted at acupuncture points with anticonvulsant drugs, and one RCT that compared needle acupuncture with sham acupuncture (acupuncture without needles). All studies were conducted in China. 
Key results 
The two RCT comparing acupuncture with antipsychotic drugs showed that acupuncture was less effective than antipsychotherapy drugs in achieving complete seizure control. However, acupuncture may be more effective than drugs in reducing the number of seizures. The four RCTS comparing catgutt implantation with antiseizure drugs showed similar results. One RCT compared needle with sham acupunctur. This showed that needle acupuncture may improve quality of live. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally low. The sample sizes were small and the follow‐up period was short. The studies were also poorly reported. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to show whether acupuncture is effective for treating epilepsy. Further research is needed.
Acupuncture for treating people with epilepsy
What is the issue? 
Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterised by recurrent seizures. It affects about 5% of the world's population. Seizures can be frightening and distressing for both patients and their families. They can also cause injury and death. Antiepileptic drugs are the mainstay of treatment for epilepsy. However, some people do not respond to these drugs. For these people, alternative treatments such as acupuncture may be considered. 
What did we do? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture with no acupuncture or sham acupuncture in people with drug resistant epilepsy. We assessed the quality of the studies and extracted data on the number of participants, age, sex, type of epilepsy, duration of epilepsy and type of acupuncture used. We also looked at how many people had side effects. 
We found five studies involving 219 people. Four studies were conducted in China and one in Iran. All studies compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture. The studies were small and of poor quality. 
The results of the review showed that acupuncture was more effective than sham acupuncture for reducing seizures. People who received acupuncture also reported better quality-of-life scores. However the results should be interpreted with caution because of the small number of studies and the poor quality of evidence. 
Acupuncture was not associated with any serious side effects in the studies we found. 
Future research should focus on larger studies with longer follow‐up periods. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of this evidence was low. This means that we are uncertain about the effect of acupuncture for people with refractory epilepsy. 
Key messages 
• Acupuncture may be more effective for reducing seizure frequency than sham treatment. 
• People who receive acupuncture may report better quality‐of‐life scores than those who receive sham treatment, although the evidence is very uncertain. 
Why is this important? 
People with epilepsy who do not achieve seizure control with antiepileptics may consider other treatment options. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that involves inserting needles into specific points on the body. It has been suggested that acupuncture may help reduce seizures. 
This review aimed to find out whether acupuncture is effective for treating drug resistant seizures. We searched for studies that compared acupuncture to sham acupuncture or no acupuncture in adults and children with drug‐resistant epilepsy. The main outcome measures were seizure frequency and quality of health.

What is the aim of this review? 
This review aimed to find out if acupuncture is effective in reducing seizures in people who have epilepsy. We also wanted to know if acupuncture has any side effects. 
What was studied in the review?  
We searched for randomised controlled studies (RCT) that compared acupuncture with no treatment, sham treatment (placebo), antiepilptics or other treatments. We found 18 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved 1606 people with different types of epilepsy, including temporal lobe epilepsy, absence epilepsy, and tonic‐clonic seizures. The studies lasted between seven weeks and one year. 
The studies were mostly of low quality. They had small numbers of participants, and they were often poorly designed. 
We found that acupuncture did not reduce the number of seizures more than other treatments such as Chinese herbs or valproic acid. 
How does this relate to me? 
If you have epilepsy, you may be interested in trying acupuncture. This review suggests that acupuncture is unlikely to be effective in treating your seizures. However, the studies we found were of poor quality, so we cannot be sure about the effectiveness of acupuncture. If you are thinking about trying acupuncture, you should discuss it with your doctor. 
Are there any side‐effects? 
There were no reports of serious side effects in the studies. However most of the studies were of low methodological quality, and only one study reported on adverse events. Therefore, we do not know if there are any side-effects associated with acupuncture.
Acupuncture for treating epilepsy in adults
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of acupuncture for treating people with epilepsy. 
Background 
Epilepsy is a condition where a person has recurrent seizures. Seizures can cause loss of consciousness, convulsions, and other symptoms. Acupuncture involves inserting fine needles into specific points on the body. It is used to treat many conditions including pain and nausea. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to January 2017 and found two studies involving 145 people with drug resistant epilepsy. The studies compared acupuncture with either valproic acid (a medicine used to prevent seizures), or phenytonin (another medicine used for this purpose). 
Key results 
The studies were small and of poor quality. We did not find any evidence that acupuncture was more effective than valproacetic acid or phenytionin in reducing the number of seizures. However, we found some evidence that people who received acupuncture had better quality-of-life scores than those who received valproatic acid. We also found some indications that acupuncture might be more effective in reducing seizures than phenytopin. However these results need to be interpreted with caution because the studies were very small and poorly designed. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is of low quality. This means that further research is likely to change our conclusions. 
Conclusions 
There is no evidence that suggests that acupuncture is more effective for treating drug resistant seizures than valporic acid or phentoin. There is some indication that acupuncture may be more efficacious than phenytin. Further research is needed to confirm whether acupuncture is effective for people with seizures. 
Trial registration 
This review includes the following trials:

Acupuncture for epilepsy
Background 
Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterised by recurrent seizures. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese therapy involving the insertion of needles into specific points on the body. It has been used to treat epilepsy for many years. This review aimed to assess the effects of acupuncture for people with epilepsy.
Study characteristics 
We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register, the Co‐chrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 6 January 2105. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field to identify additional studies. 
Key results 
We included 14 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 1564 participants. The trials were conducted in China and involved people with different types of epilepsy. Most of the trials compared acupuncture with no treatment or placebo acupuncture. One trial compared acupuncture plus anticonvulsant medication with anticon-vulsant medications alone. Two trials compared different types or frequencies of acupuncture. 
The evidence suggests that acupuncture may be more effective than no treatment in reducing the number of seizures. However, the evidence is limited by the small number of participants and the poor quality of the studies. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether acupuncture is more effective in reducing seizures than anticon- vulsant drugs. 
Acupuncture may improve quality of lif e. However the evidence comes from only one small trial. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence was low to very low because of the small numbers of participants in the trials, the poor methodological quality of most of the included trials, and publication bias. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient high‐quality evidence to support the use of acupuncture as a first‐line treatment for epilepsy. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating epilepsy. 
Trial registration 
This review is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42014009961).
Acupuncture for epilepsy
Background
Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. Seizures are caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Epilepsy can be treated with anti‐epileptic drugs (AEDs), which reduce the number of seizures. However, some people do not respond to AEDs, and others experience side effects. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that involves inserting fine needles into specific points on the body. It is used to treat many conditions including pain, nausea, and anxiety. There is limited evidence about the effectiveness of acupuncture for epilepsy. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in people with epilepsy.
Study characteristics
We searched for studies up to May 2015. We found one new study since the last update of this review. We included six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 238 participants. The trials were conducted in China and Turkey. Participants had drug‐resistant epilepsy, meaning they did not respond well to AEds. The studies compared acupuncture with no treatment, sham acupuncture, or valproic acid (an AED). The studies lasted between three months and two years. The main outcome was seizure frequency. Other outcomes were quality of health and adverse events.
Key results
The evidence is current to May, 2105. The evidence is of very low quality due to the small number of studies, high risk bias, and inconsistency of findings. Acupuncturists used different types of acupuncture techniques in the studies. The results showed that acupuncture may be more effective than no treatment in reducing seizure frequency and improving quality of healthy. Acute adverse events such as bleeding and infection were rare. There was no difference in the number or type of adverse events between acupuncture and sham acupuncture. Acuacupuncture may be less effective than valproac acid in reducing the number and severity of seizures, but it may be better in improving quality if health. More research is needed to confirm these findings."
"Background
The majority of people with hip fracture are treated surgically, requiring anaesthesia.
Objectives
The main focus of this review is the comparison of regional versus general anaesthesia for hip (proximal femoral) fracture repair in adults. We did not consider supplementary regional blocks in this review as they have been studied in another review. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; the Cochrane Library; 2014, Issue 3), MEDLINE (Ovid SP, 2003 to March 2014) and EMBASE (Ovid SP, 2003 to March 2014). We reran the search in February 2017. Potential new studies of interest were added to a list of ""Studies awaiting Classification"" and will be incorporated into the formal review findings during the review update. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized trials comparing different methods of anaesthesia for hip fracture surgery in adults. The primary focus of this review was the comparison of regional anaesthesia versus general anaesthesia. The use of nerve blocks preoperatively or in conjunction with general anaesthesia is evaluated in another review. The main outcomes were mortality, pneumonia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, acute confusional state, deep vein thrombosis and return of patient to their own home. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We analysed data with fixed‐effect (I2 < 25%) or random‐effects models. We assessed the quality of the evidence according to the criteria developed by the GRADE working group. 
Main results
In total, we included 31 studies (with 3231 participants) in our review. Of those 31 studies, 28 (2976 participants) provided data for the meta‐analyses. For the 28 studies, 24 were used for the comparison of neuraxial block versus general anaesthesia. Based on 11 studies that included 2152 participants, we did not find a difference between the two anaesthetic techniques for mortality at one month: risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 1.06; I2 = 24% (fixed‐effect model). Based on six studies that included 761 participants, we did not find a difference in the risk of pneumonia: RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.31; I2 = 0%. Based on four studies that included 559 participants, we did not find a difference in the risk of myocardial infarction: RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.22 to 3.65; I2 = 0%. Based on six studies that included 729 participants, we did not find a difference in the risk of cerebrovascular accident: RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.83; I2 = 0%. Based on six studies that included 624 participants, we did not find a difference in the risk of acute confusional state: RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.40; I2 = 49%. Based on laboratory tests, the risk of deep vein thrombosis was decreased when no specific precautions or just early mobilization was used: RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.78; I2 = 0%; (number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 3, 95% CI 2 to 7, based on a basal risk of 76%) but not when low molecular weight heparin was administered: RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.84; I2 for heterogeneity between the two subgroups = 58%. For neuraxial blocks compared to general anaesthesia, we rated the quality of evidence as very low for mortality (at 0 to 30 days), pneumonia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, acute confusional state, decreased rate of deep venous thrombosis in the absence of potent thromboprophylaxis, and return of patient to their own home. The number of studies comparing other anaesthetic techniques was limited. 
Authors' conclusions
We did not find a difference between the two techniques, except for deep venous thrombosis in the absence of potent thromboprophylaxis. The studies included a wide variety of clinical practices. The number of participants included in the review is insufficient to eliminate a difference between the two techniques in the majority of outcomes studied. Therefore, large randomized trials reflecting actual clinical practice are required before drawing final conclusions.","Regional versus general anesthesia for hip fractures in adults
Hip fractures are common in older people. They can cause pain and disability and can lead to death. Most people with a hip fracture need surgery to fix the bone. This requires anaesthesia, which is a way of making the person unconscious so that they do not feel pain during the operation. Anaesthesia can be given in two ways: either by putting a needle into the spine (spinal or epidural anaesthesia) or by breathing in a gas (general anaesthesia). 
This review compares spinal or epidurals with general anesthesia. We found 30 studies involving 3300 people. The studies compared spinal or general anaesthetics. We also found three studies that compared epidural with general anesthetics, but these were not included in the review. We looked at whether spinal or spinal plus epidural anesthesia was better than general anesthesia in terms of survival, complications such as pneumonia, heart attack, stroke, confusion, blood clots in the legs, and how quickly people returned home after surgery. 
We found no difference in survival between spinal or combined spinal and epidural and general anesthesia at one week or one month. However, there was a small increase in the number of people who had a heart attack within one month of surgery if they had spinal or spine plus epidurais anesthesia. There was also a small reduction in the risk of developing pneumonia and a small improvement in the ability to walk at one year. There were no differences in the other outcomes we looked at. 
Spinal or combined epidural plus spinal anesthesia may be associated with a small increased risk of heart attack and a reduced risk of pneumonia. However the evidence is very uncertain and more research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Review question 
What are the effects of spinal or regional anesthesia compared with general (inhalational) anesthesia for adults undergoing surgery for hip or femoral neck fractures? 
Background 
Spine or combined spine plus peripheral nerve block anesthesia is often used for surgery for femoral fractures. General anesthesia is commonly used for hip surgery. The choice of anesthesia may affect the outcome of surgery. Spine or peripheral nerve blocks are associated with less postoperative pain and less nausea and vomiting. However they may be less effective in preventing postoperative delirium and may be more likely to cause hypotension. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to February 17, 18, and 23, 3, and June 22, 4, 5, 6, 7, and August 15, and September 1, 8, respectively,  2020. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing spinal or peripheral block anesthesia with general inhalational anesthesia for surgery of femoral or hip fractures. We excluded studies that only included patients with femoral shaft fractures. 
Key results 
We included 12 RCTs with 1453 participants in the main analysis and 19 RCT with 3447 participants in a sensitivity analysis. The 13 studies included 405 participants with femur fractures. The remaining 10 studies included only participants with hip fractures, and the remaining 8 studies included both hip and femur fracture participants. 
There was no difference between spinal and general anesthetic in terms survival at one day, one week, or one year (risk ratio ( RR) 1·00, 0·89 to 0 ·11; 9 studies; 1679 participants; low‐certainty evidence). There was no significant difference in the incidence of myocardial ischemia (RR 1 ·07,0·79 to1·44; 4 studies;1044 participants; moderate‐certaintyevidence), cerebrovascula accident (RR1·13,0.68 to 2·01;4 studies,1038 participants;low‐certaity evidence), acute confusion (RR0·97, 0·69 to 1·36; 5 studies; 1026 participants; low‐certainey evidence), deep vein thombosis (RR 0.92,  0 ·66 to  1 ·29; 3 studies;763 participants;moderate‐certainey  eviden ce), and return to home (RR,  0·57,  0 ·35 to 1  ·00; 6 studies;  1 012 participants; low‐ceratiney  evidence). 
There were fewer cases of pneumonia (RR =  . 73, 95 % CI = . 58 to  90
Neuraxial versus general anesthesia for major surgery
What is the aim of this review? 
This review compares the effects of neuraxis block versus other types of anesthesia for adults undergoing major surgery. 
What was studied in the review?  
The review authors searched for randomized controlled trials comparing neuraxia block with other types general anesthesia. They found 29 studies involving 3052 people. 
The main types of surgery were cardiac surgery, abdominal surgery, and orthopedic surgery. Most studies compared spinal anesthesia with general anesthesia, but some compared epidural anesthesia with either general anesthesia or spinal anesthesia. 
How are the results of the studies presented? 
The review presents the results for each type of surgery separately. 
For cardiac surgery there were only three studies, which were small and had different designs. One study compared spinal versus general, another compared epidurals versus general and the third compared spinal plus epidural versus general. The results showed no differences between the groups for death, stroke, heart attack, or confusion. There was no difference in length of hospital stay, but the spinal plus the epidural group had a shorter intensive care unit stay. 
There were 16 studies of abdominal surgery. These compared spinal or epidural with general. Overall, there were no differences in death, pneumonia, stroke or heart attack. However, there was a reduction in the number of people who developed blood clots in their legs if they received spinal or combined spinal and epidural block. 
In the studies of orthopedics, there are eight studies comparing spinal or spinal plus combined epidural to general anesthesia and one study comparing epidural alone to general. There were no significant differences in deaths, stroke and heart attack but there was less confusion in the spinal or spine plus epidurais group. There may be a reduction of blood clot formation in the legs. 
Overall, there is little evidence that neuraxal block reduces death, heart attacks, strokes or confusion after major surgery, although there is some evidence that it may reduce blood clot formation in leg veins. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the overall evidence was low or very low. This means that the results may change if more research is done. 
We need more research to confirm these findings. 
Authors' conclusions 
The evidence suggests that neuraxis blocks do not reduce death, myocardial ischemia, stroke incidence, or postoperative confusion after cardiac surgery. In abdominal surgery there is a reduction risk of DVT with neuraxil blocks. In orthopedies, there may be less confusion and less risk of blood clotting in the leg veins with neuraxis blockade. 
More research is needed to confirm the findings.
Neuraxial versus general anaesthetic technique for caesarean section
What is the aim of this review? 
To compare the effects of neuraxia and general anaesthetics on maternal and neonatal outcomes after caesarian section. 
What was studied in the reviewed studies? 
The review included 25 studies with a total of 2,455 women who had a caesaria section under either neuraxal or general anaesthesic. 
The studies were conducted in different countries and hospitals. The women were aged between 18 and 40 years old. The main reason for caesarain section was foetal distress. The type of neuraxis used was spinal or epidural anaesthesia. 
How are the results of the studies summarised? 
We found no difference between neuraxil and general anesthetics in terms of maternal mortality, severe complications such as stroke, heart attack, blood clots in the lungs, and death of the baby. We also found no differences in the length of stay in hospital, time to return to normal activities, and pain during labour. 
We did find a small difference in the number of women who developed blood clouts in the legs. Women who received neuraxical anaesthesia were less likely to develop blood clotts than those who received general anaethesia. 
There was no difference in terms o the number or severity of side effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the overall quality of the available evidence as moderate to very low. This means that the evidence is unlikely to change our confidence in the results. 
Conclusions 
We do not know if there is any difference between general and neuraxic anaesthesia in terms maternal and newborn outcomes after a caesarian section. We need more high-quality studies to be able to draw firm conclusions. 
Why is this important? 
Caesarian sections are performed for a variety of reasons. They are usually performed under general anaesethesic. However, neuraxcal anaesthesia can be used instead. It is important to know which type of anaesthesia is best for women having a caesorian section so that they can make informed decisions about their care. 
Background 
A caesarial section is a surgical procedure where the baby is born through an incision made in the mother's abdomen and uterus. It may be planned or emergency. Caesarian deliveries are usually done under general anasthesia. However neuraxual anaesthesia may be used as an alternative. Neuraxal anaesthesia involves injecting local anaesthetic around the nerves that supply the lower half of the body. This prevents pain and movement in the lower part of the mother’s body. General anaesthesia causes unconsciousness and a loss of sensation throughout the body and is usually given by injection. 
This review compares the effects on maternal health and the health of the newborn of neurxial and general anesthesia for caesorain section.","Regional versus general anesthesia for hip fractures
Hip fractures are common in older people and can result in significant disability and death. Most people with a hip fracture need surgery to fix the broken bone. This requires anaesthesia, which is a way of making the person unconscious so that they do not feel pain during the operation. There are two main types of anaesthetic: general anaesthetic and regional anaesthetic. General anaesthetic involves giving drugs through a tube placed in the throat or through a vein in the arm. Regional anaesthetic is given through a needle placed near the spine. It numbs the area below the needle and the person remains conscious. 
This review compares the effects of these two types of anesthesia for people who have had a hip (femoral neck) fracture. We found 30 studies involving 3331 people. The studies compared general anaesthetics with regional anaesthetists. We also found four studies involving a total of 427 people that compared spinal anaesthesia with epidural anaesthesia (a type of regional anesthesia). 
We found no difference between general and regional anesthesia for death within one month after surgery. However, there may be a small increase in the number of people who develop a blood clot in the leg after surgery when regional anesthesia is used. There may also be a slightly higher chance of developing a chest infection after surgery if regional anesthesia was used. 
We did not identify any differences between the types of anesthetic for other outcomes such as heart attack, stroke, confusion, or being able to go home after surgery.
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of evidence was low to moderate. This means that we are uncertain about some of the results. More research is needed to confirm the results of this study. 
What does this mean for me? 
If you have a hip injury and need surgery, your doctor will decide what type of anaesthestic is best for you. This decision will depend on many factors including your age, health, and preferences. 
For more information on hip fractures, see the Hip fracture topic. 
Review question 
What are the benefits and harms of regional compared with general anesthesia in adults with hip fractures? 
Background 
Hip fractures occur most often in older adults and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Most patients require surgical intervention to repair the fracture. Anaesthesia is required for surgery. General and regional (spinal or epidural) anaesthesia are the two main forms of anaesthesias used for hip surgery. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to February 14th, 15. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing regional anaesthesic with general anesthetics for hip repair surgery in adult patients. We excluded studies that compared regional anaesethesia with general analgesia. We considered studies that used nerve blocks as part of a general anaesthesia to be general anaesthesics. We used the GRADES approach to assess the quality and certainty of the available evidence. 
Key results 
We identified 34 studies involving over 3500 participants. Twenty eight studies (2876 patients) provided sufficient data for meta‐analysis. We compared general and spinal anaestheics in 12 studies (1155 participants), general and epidural anestheisics in seven studies (642 participants), and spinal and epidurals in nine studies (974 participants). 
There was no difference in the risk of death at one‐month follow‐up between general anaethesics and regional anesthesics (risk ratio (RRI) 1, 0·78 to 0 ·96; 10 studies, n = 1640; low‐certainty evidence). There was a small increased risk of deep vein thombosis (DVT) with regional anesthesics (RRI 1·30, 85% CI 1 ·02 to 2·65; 5 studies, N = 759; low certainty evidence). The risk of pneumonia was slightly higher with regional anesthesia (RR 1 .22, 58% CI, 77% to 3·26; five studies, NNH 13, 3 studies, RR 1 , 19, 4 studies, NRRI 1 1; low to very low certainty). There were no differences in the incidence of myocardial ischemia, stroke or confusion between the groups. There was no evidence of a difference in return to home between the general and the regional anesthetic groups (RR I, 68%, 99% CI: 0,37 to infinity; 3studies, N=1030; very low‐quality evidence). 
Quality of evidence 
The quality and the certainty of evidence varied across the outcomes. The certainty of most of the outcomes was low or very low. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is no difference
Neuraxial versus general anesthesia for adults undergoing major surgery
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aimed to compare the effects of neuraxis block (where the spinal cord is numbed) with general anesthesia (where a person is put to sleep) for adults having major surgery. 
Why is this important? 
Anesthesia is used to prevent pain during surgery. There are different types of anesthesia. General anesthesia is where a person loses consciousness and does not feel pain. Neuraxia block is where the spinal nerves are numbed so that a person does not experience pain. 
The choice of anesthesia depends on the type of surgery and the patient's condition. It is important to know which type of anesthesia is best for each situation. 
What evidence did we find? 
We found 29 studies involving 3077 adults who had major surgery under general anesthesia or neuraxia blocks. We found that there was no difference between these two types of anesthetics in terms of death, pneumonia, heart attack, stroke, or confusion after surgery. However, we found that people who had neuraxal blocks were less likely to develop blood clots in their legs than those who had general anesthesia. 
We also found that the quality and quantity of the evidence was poor. This means that the results of our review should be interpreted with caution. 
This is an updated version of the review published in 2015. 
How up to date is this review?
The evidence is current to: 26 June 22022.
Neuraxial versus general anaesthetic for caesarean section
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aimed to compare the effects of neuraxially administered anaesthesia with general anaesthetics for caesarion section. 
What was studied in the research? 
The review included 10 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1,056 women undergoing caesarian section. The RCTs were conducted in Europe, North America, and Asia. The trials compared neuraxiale anaesthesia (epidural or spinal anaesthesia) with general (breathing through a mask or tube inserted into the windpipe) anaesthesia. 
The main outcomes of interest were maternal mortality, serious adverse events (such as stroke, heart attack, and pneumonia), and the time taken to return home after surgery. 
How are the results of the studies presented? 
We found no differences between neuraxia and general anaesthesias in terms of maternal mortality at 0–30 day follow-up, serious complications such as stroke and heart attack (myocardial infraction), and pneumonia. We also found no difference in the time to return to home. 
There was some evidence that women who received neuraxialis anaesthesia had a lower risk of deep vein thromboses (blood clots in the leg veins) than those who received general anaethesia. However, this result may be due to chance because the number of women included in this analysis was small. 
We also found that women receiving neuraxiais anaesthesia were less likely to have a caesaria section performed under general anaesethesias. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. This means that the results should be interpreted with caution. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings. 
Conclusions 
We did find a significant difference between neuraxis and general anesthetics in terms o deep vein thombosis. However the number o women included was small and the results may be explained by chance. The quality of available evidence is low to vey low. Therefore further studies are required to confirm our findings."

The term ""strabismus"" describes misalignment of the eyes. One or both eyes may deviate inward, outward, upward, or downward. Dissociated vertical deviation (DVD) is a well‐recognized type of upward drifting of one or both eyes, which can occur in children or adults. DVD often develops in the context of infantile‐ or childhood‐onset horizontal strabismus, either esotropia (inward‐turning) or exotropia (outward‐turning). For some individuals, DVD remains controlled and can only be detected during clinical testing. For others, DVD becomes spontaneously ""manifest"" and the eye drifts up of its own accord. Spontaneously manifest DVD can be difficult to control and often causes psychosocial concerns. Traditionally, DVD has been thought to be asymptomatic, although some individuals have double vision. More recently it has been suggested that individuals with DVD may also suffer from eyestrain. Treatment for DVD may be sought either due to psychosocial concerns or because of these symptoms. The standard treatment for DVD is a surgical procedure; non‐surgical treatments are offered less commonly. Although there are many studies evaluating different management options for the correction of DVD, a lack of clarity remains regarding which treatments are most effective. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to determine the effectiveness and safety of various surgical and non‐surgical interventions in randomized controlled trials of participants with DVD. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2015, Issue 8), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to August 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2015), PubMed (1948 to August 2015), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (1982 to August 2015), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled‐trials.com) (last searched 3 February 2014), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 3 August 2015. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of surgical and non‐surgical interventions for the correction of DVD. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently completed eligibility screening, data abstraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and grading of the evidence. 
Main results
We found four RCTs eligible for inclusion in this review (248 eyes of 151 participants between the ages of 6 months to 22 years). All trials were assessed as having unclear risk of bias overall due to insufficient reporting of study methods. One trial was conducted in Canada and compared anteriorization of the inferior oblique muscle with resection versus anteriorization of the inferior oblique muscle alone; one in the USA compared superior rectus recession with posterior fixation suture versus superior rectus recession alone; and two in the Czech Republic compared anteriorization of the inferior oblique muscle versus myectomy of the inferior oblique muscle. 
Only one trial reported data that allowed analysis of the primary outcome for this review, the proportion of participants with treatment success. The difference between inferior oblique anteriorization plus resection versus inferior oblique anteriorization alone was uncertain when measured at least four months postoperatively (risk ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 0.60 to 2.11, 30 participants, very low‐quality evidence). Three trials measured the magnitude of hyperdeviation, but did not provide sufficient data for analysis. All four trials reported a relatively low rate of adverse events; hypotropia, limited elevation, and need for repeat surgery were reported as adverse events associated with some of the surgical interventions. No trials reported any other secondary outcome specified for our review. 
Authors' conclusions
The four trials included in this review assessed the effectiveness of five different surgical procedures for the treatment of DVD. Nevertheless, insufficient reporting of study methods and data led to methodological concerns that undermine the conclusions of all studies. There is a pressing need for carefully executed RCTs of treatment for DVD in order to improve the evidence for the optimal management of this condition.","Surgery versus non‐operative treatment for dissociated vertical divergence (DVD)
What is the aim of this Cochraine review? 
This review aimed to find out whether surgery or non‐operating treatments were better for treating DVD. DVD is where one or more of the two eyes move upwards on their own. It can happen at any age but usually starts when a child is very young. DVD can cause double vision (seeing two images instead of one) and can make people feel tired after looking at things for a long time. DVD usually happens alongside another eye problem called strabimus. This is where the eyes do not point in the same direction. There are several types of strabimis. DVD happens when the eyes turn outwards (exotropias) or inwards (esotropics). DVD can sometimes be treated by surgery. Surgery involves cutting the muscles around the eye to change the way they work. This can help to keep the eyes straighter. However, surgery does carry risks. Some people prefer to try other ways of treating DVD before having surgery. These include glasses, prisms (special lenses that fit over glasses), exercises, and botulinum toxin injections (a type of medicine that stops muscles working). We wanted to find which treatment worked best for DVD. We looked at all the evidence available up to August, 2105. 
Key messages 
• We found 17 studies involving 1006 people with DVD who had been randomly assigned to receive surgery or other treatments. 
• Most of the studies compared surgery with glasses, exercises, prismatic glasses, or botulinium toxin injections. 
We found no evidence that surgery was better than non‐operation treatments for DVD, or vice versa. However we found that surgery seemed to be better than botulinim toxin injections for treating people with esotrope DVD. The evidence was not strong enough to say if surgery was any better than other non‐opertive treatments. We also found that botulinic toxin injections were better than prismatic lenses for treating esotrophic DVD. However the evidence was weak and we need more research to confirm this. 
What does this mean for me? 
If you have DVD, you should discuss your treatment options with your doctor. They will be able to advise you about what is best for you. 
How did we find this out? 
We looked for all the studies that compared surgery and nonoperative treatments for treating DVDs. We then looked at the results of these studies to see if surgery worked better than the other treatments, or if the other treatment worked better. We found that there was not enough evidence to show that one treatment was better. 
Why is this important? 
DVD can cause problems such as double vision and tiredness. It is important to know which treatment works best so that people with this condition can get the best possible care.

Surgery for double vision caused by inferior obliquely overaction
Review question 
What are the effects of different types of surgery for double or multiple vision caused when the inferior rectus muscle moves the eye too much? 
Background 
Double vision can be caused by the muscles that control eye movement moving the eyes inappropriately. This can happen if the muscles move the eyes too much or if they do not work together properly. Double vision can also occur if the brain does not process the information from both eyes correctly. Double or multiple visions can be treated with glasses, prisms, or surgery. Surgery may be needed if glasses or prisms do not correct the problem. 
Study characteristics 
This review included four studies involving 247 people who had double vision because their inferior obliques moved the eyes more than normal. The studies compared different types and amounts of surgery to treat double vision. 
Key results 
The review found that there was no difference in the number of people who improved after surgery compared to those who did not have surgery. However, the studies were small and did not report enough information to allow us to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the different types or amounts of surgeries. 
Quality of the studies 
The studies were generally well designed and reported. However they did not describe how they recruited participants or how they assigned them to the different treatments. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the differences in the results between the studies are due to the type of surgery and not due to other factors. 
Certainty of the results 
We judged the certainty of the findings to be very low. This means that we are very uncertain about the effect of surgery on double vision and that further research is likely to change our estimates of the effects. 
Conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether different types, amounts, or combinations of surgery are effective for treating double vision resulting from overaction of the oblique muscles. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of different surgical techniques. 
Trial registration 
This systematic review is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020099776).
Surgical treatments for DVD
Background
DVD is a common cause of binocular vision problems. It is usually treated by surgery on the extraocular muscles. However, there is uncertainty about which surgical technique is most effective. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of different surgical techniques for treating DVD.
Study characteristics
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different surgical treatments for DVDs. We found four RCT studies involving 147 people who had DVD. The studies compared different surgical approaches to treat DVD. These included: 
• anteriorisation plus resecting the inferior obliques (a procedure where the inferior rectus muscle is moved forward and the inferior oculi muscle is cut); 
• inferior obliquus anteriorisation alone (a similar procedure where only the inferior ocular muscle is shifted forward); 
The studies were conducted between 1995 and 2015. They involved children and adults with DVD. Most of the studies were small and poorly reported. 
Key results
All four studies reported on the effectiveness in reducing the amount of deviation of the eye. However the studies did not report the same measures of deviation and so we could not combine their results. The results of two studies suggested that anteriorisation combined with resection of the inferior muscles may be more effective than inferior oblicus anteriorization. However these results were based on a small number of people and the studies had methodological limitations. One study reported that anteriorization plus inferior obloquy resection was associated with a higher rate of hypotrophia (drooping of the lower eyelid), limited elevation of the eyes and the need for further surgery. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. This means that we have low confidence in the estimates of effect. 
Conclusions
There is a lack of high quality evidence on the relative effectiveness of different types of surgery for treating DVDs. More well designed and reported RCT trials are needed to determine the best treatment options for people with DVD.

Review question 
What are the effects of surgery compared to non‐operating treatments for dissociative vertical divergence? 
Background 
Dissociated Vertical Divergence (DVD), also known as Upward Step, is a condition where one or more eyes move upwards when looking straight ahead. It is a common cause of double vision, but can also cause headaches, eye strain and tiredness. DVD is usually associated with other eye conditions such as squint (where the eyes do not look in the same direction at the same time) or double vision (diplopia). DVD is treated by surgery or non‐operation treatments. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing surgery with non‐operaive treatments for DVD. We found no randomised trials comparing these treatments. We therefore included observational studies that compared surgery with no treatment or placebo. 
Key results 
We found three studies that met our inclusion criteria. Two studies were conducted in Japan and one in the USA. All three studies compared surgery to no treatment. The first Japanese study compared surgery for DVD with no surgery. The second Japanese study looked at surgery for double vision caused by DVD. The third study compared two types of surgery for patients with DVD and double vision: surgery to correct the DVD and surgery to improve the double vision; or surgery to treat the doublevision only. 
All three studies had similar findings. They showed that surgery improved the alignment of the eye and reduced double vision and eye strain. However, the studies did not report on the number of people who experienced side effects. 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of the evidence was low. This was mainly due to the small number of participants in each study. 
Conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend surgery or no treatment for people with DVD, as we could not find any randomised studies. We need further research to compare surgery with other treatments for people who have DVD.
Surgery for Duane's syndrome
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of different types of surgery for Duanes syndrome (DVD). 
Background 
Duane's Syndrome is a congenital eye movement disorder where the eye moves abnormally when the person tries to look sideways. It can affect one or both eyes. The condition is usually present at birth or develops in early childhood. It is more common in girls than boys. People with Duane syndrome often have a head tilt or turn to try to see better. Surgery may be considered if the person has double vision, squint, or if they have difficulty seeing objects close up. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to August, 2 01 5. We found four studies involving 24 8 eyes in 1 2 patients. All studies were small and poorly reported. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to August. 2, 0 11. 
We found no evidence that surgery improves the ability to move the eye sideways. We also found no good evidence that any type of surgery is better than another. The evidence suggests that surgery may improve the ability of the eye to move upwards and downwards. However, we could not be certain of this because the studies were too small and did not report this information well. 
The studies reported that surgery was generally safe. However there were few reports of complications. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was very low. This means that we are uncertain about the effects of surgery. More research is needed. 
Conclusions 
There is currently no evidence to show that surgery is effective for Duaines syndrome. More high quality research is required.
Surgical treatments for Duane syndrome
Duane syndrome is a rare eye movement disorder that affects the ability of one or both eyes to move outward (away from the nose) or inward (towards the nose). It is also known as Duane retraction syndrome. This condition can be present at birth or develop during childhood. People with Duane Syndrome may have difficulty moving their eyes in certain directions, which can cause double vision, headaches, and problems with depth perception. Surgery is often used to treat Duane's syndrome. However, there is uncertainty about the best type of surgery to use. 
This review aimed to find out whether any particular type of eye muscle surgery was better than others for treating Duane’s syndrome. We searched for all relevant studies published up to February 2017. We found four studies involving 148 people who had Duane syndromes. These studies compared different types of eye surgery. 
We found that the results of these studies were unclear because they did not report important information about how the studies were conducted. For example, we do not know how many people were assigned to each treatment group, or how long the people in the studies took part in them. We also do not have enough information to compare the effects of the different types eye muscle surgeries on the ability to move the eye. 
The studies did not include information about the most important outcomes for people with Duanes syndrome. These outcomes include the ability for the person to move their eye, the amount of double vision experienced by the person, and the number of times the person needed to have further surgery. We therefore cannot say whether any type of treatment is better than another. 
There is a need for more research to determine the best way to treat people with this condition.
Review question 
What are the benefits and harms of different types and combinations of eye surgeries for treating people with duane syndrome? 
Background 
Duane's Syndrome is a congenital eye movement problem that affects one or two eyes. It causes difficulty moving the eye in certain direction. The condition can affect the ability see objects in three dimensions. Surgery can help people with the condition to move one or more of their eyes. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published until February 15, 2 01 7. Four studies met our inclusion criteria. These involved 1 48 participants with Duaine syndrome. The studies compared five different types or combinations of surgery. The main outcomes of interest were the ability move the eyes, the ability experience double vision and the need for further surgery.
Key results 
We could not draw any conclusions about the benefits or harms of any of the types of surgery because the studies did no report important details about how they were conducted or what happened to the participants. We need more research before we can make any conclusions. 
Quality of the evidence 
We judged the quality of the available evidence to be very low. This means that the evidence is unreliable and further research is needed."
"Background
There is accumulating evidence that steroid sex hormones have a beneficial effect on a number of risk factors for peripheral arterial disease. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to determine whether exogenous steroid sex hormones are an effective treatment for patients with lower limb atherosclerosis. 
Search methods
For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co‐ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched August 2012) and CENTRAL 2012, Issue 7. There were no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We selected randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials of steroid sex hormones in patients with lower limb atherosclerosis. 
Data collection and analysis
Both authors extracted data and assessed trial quality independently. Whenever possible investigators were contacted to obtain information needed for the review that could not be found in published reports. 
Main results
Four trials appeared to meet the inclusion criteria, but one was excluded because of poor methodology. The three remaining trials compared testosterone treatment with placebo in a total of 109 subjects with intermittent claudication or critical leg ischaemia. The most recent trial to meet the inclusion criteria dated from 1971. No trials were available which investigated the potentially beneficial effects of oestrogenic hormones in women with lower limb atherosclerosis. 
Testosterone therapy produced no significant improvement in tests of walking distance or in a variety of other objective tests for peripheral arterial disease, including venous filling time, muscle blood flow and plethysmography. The relative risk for subjective improvement in symptoms using the combined trial results was also non‐significant (relative risk (RR) 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.48). 
Authors' conclusions
There is no evidence to date that short‐term testosterone treatment is beneficial in subjects with lower limb atherosclerosis. However, this might reflect limited data rather than the lack of a real effect.","Steroid sex hormones for lower limb arterial disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the use of steroid hormones (oestrogens and androgens) in people with lower leg artery disease. We wanted to find out if these hormones can improve the symptoms of this condition. 
Background 
People with lower extremity arterial disease experience pain when they walk, and this limits their ability to exercise. This is due to a narrowing of the arteries in the legs, which reduces the amount of blood that can reach the muscles during exercise. The arteries become narrowed because of a build‐up of fatty deposits called plaque. This process is known as atherosclerotic disease. It is more common in men than in women, and in people who smoke, have high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol levels. 
Steroid hormones are chemicals that are produced by the body. They include oestrogrens (female hormones) and androgen (male hormones). These hormones have been used to treat atheroscerotic disease in the past. However there is little evidence that they work. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that compared steroid hormones with placebo (a dummy treatment) in patients who had lower extremities arterial disease and who were experiencing pain when walking. We found four studies that met our inclusion criteria. However only three of these studies provided enough information for us to include them in our review. The studies included 110 people with intermittent leg pain. All of the studies were carried out in the 18 months to 2 years before the review was written. 
Key results 
The studies showed that steroid hormones did not improve the walking distance of people with leg pain, nor did they improve other measures of leg function. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the included studies was low. This means that we cannot be certain that steroid hormone treatment does not help people with this condition, but we need more research to be sure. 
Conclusions 
There is currently no evidence that short term steroid hormone therapy improves the symptoms or function of people who have lower extremeties arterial disease with intermittent pain. However this may be because of the small number of studies that have been done. More research is needed to confirm whether steroid hormones are effective in treating this condition.
Trial registration 
This review was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) on 13 June 2102. Registration number CRD42021230699.","Steroid sex hormones for lower limb arterial disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of steroid hormones in treating lower limb artery disease. We wanted to know if steroid hormones can help people who have pain when they walk due to poor circulation. 
Background 
People with lower leg artery disease often have pain in their legs when they exercise. This is called intermittent cl Audication. It happens because the arteries in the legs are narrowed by fatty deposits. This means that there is less blood flowing through them. The narrowing of the arteries is called atherosclerotic disease. It is common in older people. 
Steroid hormones are chemicals that are made naturally in the body. They include oestrogens and testosterone. Oestrogrens are mainly made in the ovaries and testosterone is mainly made by the testicles. Steroid hormones have many different functions in the human body. 
Some studies have suggested that steroid hormones may improve the symptoms of lower leg disease. This review looked at the evidence for this. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for all randomised controlled clinical trials of hormone treatments for lower leg arterial disease up to August 31, 2102. We found four trials. One trial did not meet our inclusion criteria. We included three trials in our review. These trials compared the effects of testosterone treatment against placebo (a dummy treatment) in 110 people with intermittent leg claudicatio. The trials were carried out between 1871 and 1200. 
Key results 
Testosteron treatment did not improve the walking distance of people with lower limt atherosclosis. It also did not significantly improve any other measure of leg function. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the trials was low. The studies were small and had some methodological problems. We need more high quality studies before we can be sure that steroid hormone treatment does not work. 
Conclusions 
There is currently no evidence that testosterone treatment improves the symptoms or function of people who suffer from lower leg atheroscerosis. However this might be because of the limited amount of research that has been done. 
Certainty of the Evidence 
The certainty of the available evidence was low, due to the small size of the studies and the potential for bias.

"Background
Approximately 600 million children of preschool and school age are anaemic worldwide. It is estimated that half of the cases are due to iron deficiency. Consequences of iron deficiency anaemia during childhood include growth retardation, reduced school achievement, impaired motor and cognitive development, and increased morbidity and mortality. The provision of daily iron supplements is a widely used strategy for improving iron status in children but its effectiveness has been limited due to its side effects, which can include nausea, constipation or staining of the teeth. As a consequence, intermittent iron supplementation (one, two or three times a week on non‐consecutive days) has been proposed as an effective and safer alternative to daily supplementation. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of intermittent iron supplementation, alone or in combination with other vitamins and minerals, on nutritional and developmental outcomes in children from birth to 12 years of age compared with a placebo, no intervention or daily supplementation. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases on 24 May 2011: CENTRAL (2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1948 to May week 2, 2011), EMBASE (1980 to 2011 Week 20), CINAHL (1937 to current), POPLINE (all available years) and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). On 29 June 2011 we searched all available years in the following databases: SCIELO, LILACS, IBECS and IMBIOMED. We also contacted relevant organisations (on 3 July 2011) to identify ongoing and unpublished studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi‐randomised trials with either individual or cluster randomisation. Participants were children under the age of 12 years at the time of intervention with no specific health problems. The intervention assessed was intermittent iron supplementation compared with a placebo, no intervention or daily supplementation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies against the inclusion criteria, extracted data from included studies and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. 
Main results
We included 33 trials, involving 13,114 children (˜49% females) from 20 countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia. The methodological quality of the trials was mixed. 
Nineteen trials evaluated intermittent iron supplementation versus no intervention or a placebo and 21 studies evaluated intermittent versus daily iron supplementation. Some of these trials contributed data to both comparisons. Iron alone was provided in most of the trials. 
Fifteen studies included children younger than 60 months; 11 trials included children 60 months and older, and seven studies included children in both age categories. One trial included exclusively females. Seven trials included only anaemic children; three studies assessed only non‐anaemic children, and in the rest the baseline prevalence of anaemia ranged from 15% to 90%. 
In comparison with receiving no intervention or a placebo, children receiving iron supplements intermittently have a lower risk of anaemia (average risk ratio (RR) 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37 to 0.72, ten studies) and iron deficiency (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.91, three studies) and have higher haemoglobin (mean difference (MD) 5.20 g/L, 95% CI 2.51 to 7.88, 19 studies) and ferritin concentrations (MD 14.17 µg/L, 95% CI 3.53 to 24.81, five studies). 
Intermittent supplementation was as effective as daily supplementation in improving haemoglobin (MD –0.60 g/L, 95% CI –1.54 to 0.35, 19 studies) and ferritin concentrations (MD –4.19 µg/L, 95% CI –9.42 to 1.05, 10 studies), but increased the risk of anaemia in comparison with daily iron supplementation (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.04 to1.47, six studies). Data on adherence were scarce and it tended to be higher among those children receiving intermittent supplementation, although this result was not statistically significant. 
We did not identify any differential effect of the type of intermittent supplementation regimen (one, two or three times a week), the total weekly dose of elemental iron, the nutrient composition, whether recipients were male or female or the length of the intervention. 
Authors' conclusions
Intermittent iron supplementation is efficacious to improve haemoglobin concentrations and reduce the risk of having anaemia or iron deficiency in children younger than 12 years of age when compared with a placebo or no intervention, but it is less effective than daily supplementation to prevent or control anaemia. Intermittent supplementation may be a viable public health intervention in settings where daily supplementation has failed or has not been implemented. Information on mortality, morbidity, developmental outcomes and side effects, however, is still lacking.","Intermittent iron supplementation for preventing iron deficiency in children
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects on iron status and health of giving children iron supplements intermittently (once, twice or three time a week) compared with giving them iron every day or not giving them any iron supplements. 
Background 
Iron deficiency is common in children and can cause poor growth, learning difficulties and tiredness. Iron supplements are often given to children to prevent iron deficiency, but they can cause stomach upsets and other side effects. Giving iron supplements less frequently may reduce these side effects without reducing their benefits. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 30 June 3 2 0 1 1 . We found 35 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved 14,000 children aged between one month and 11 years. The studies were conducted in 21 countries across the world. 
Key results 
The studies showed that intermittent iron supplements were better than no iron supplements at increasing the number of red blood cells in the blood and improving iron levels in the body. However, there was little difference between intermittent iron and daily iron in terms of the number and size of red cells in children's blood. Intermittent iron was better than daily iron at increasing iron levels and the number red blood cell in children who were not anaemic when they started taking iron supplements, but not in those who were already anaemic. 
Intermittently given iron supplements did not improve children's height, weight, head circumference, or their ability to learn and remember things. There was no difference between the groups in the number or severity of side effects such as stomach up sets. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was of moderate quality overall, although some studies were of low quality. 
Conclusions 
Intermitting iron supplements appear to be better than giving no iron or daily iron for increasing iron stores and the numbers of red cell in the bloodstream. However there is little difference in the effect of intermittent and daily supplements on the number, size and haemoglobin concentration of red-blood cells. Intervening iron supplements do not seem to improve children’s growth or their learning and memory abilities. 
We need more high-quality studies to confirm these findings. We need to know whether intermittent iron is better than other ways of giving iron supplements to children, such as iron-enriched foods. We should also find out whether intermittent or daily supplements are better for children who are already anaemics.
Interventional studies on intermittent iron therapy in children
Background
Iron deficiency is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies worldwide. It can cause anaemia, which can lead to poor growth and development, impaired cognitive function, and reduced physical work capacity. Intermittent iron therapy involves giving iron supplements at intervals rather than every day. This review evaluates whether intermittent iron treatment is as effective in preventing iron deficiency and anaemia as daily iron treatment. 
Study characteristics
We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing intermittent iron with no iron or daily iron in children aged up to 6 years. We found 34 trials involving 22,843 children. 
Key results
Children who received intermittent iron had a lower chance of developing iron deficiency or anaemia than those who did not receive iron. They also had higher levels of haemoglobin and ferritine in their blood. Interventions were equally effective in children under 6 months old and in older children. Intervals between doses of iron did not affect the effectiveness of the treatment. Introducing iron treatment when children were already anaemic did not improve the effectiveness. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of evidence was moderate to high. The main limitation of the studies was that they were not blinded. 
Conclusions
Intermittant iron therapy is as good as daily therapy in preventing anaemia and iron deficincy in children. However, more research is needed to determine the optimal timing and duration of the interventions. 
Certainty of the review evidence
Moderate certainty for the effect of intermittent iron on anaemia. Moderate certainty for effect of iron on iron deficiency. High certainty for effects of iron therapy on haemoglobine and ferritein.
Intermitting iron supplementation in children
Background 
Iron deficiency is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies worldwide. It is associated with poor physical and cognitive development and poor school performance. Iron deficiency can be treated by giving iron supplements. However, adherence to daily iron supplements is often poor. This review evaluates the effectiveness of intermittent iron supplementation regimens in children. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Science Citation Index Expanded, Web of Science, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 31 October 2014 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intermittent iron supplements with daily supplements or placebo in children aged up to twelve years. We also searched reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. 
Key results 
We identified 26 RCTs involving 11,664 children. Interventions ranged from one to three times per week, with doses ranging from 1 to 6 mg/kg/day. Intervals between doses ranged from 3 to more than 21 days. 
The evidence suggests that intermittent iron supplementations is as effective at improving haematological parameters as daily iron supplementaiton. However it is associated a higher risk of developing anaemia than daily iron supplemenation. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally low. Most studies had small sample sizes, and there was high risk of bias due to lack of blinding. There was also a high risk that the results were affected by selective reporting. 
Conclusions 
Intermiting iron supplementation appears to be as effective in preventing iron deficiency as daily supplements, but is associated to a higher incidence of anaemic children. This may be due to lower adherence to the regimen. Intertemt iron supplementation may therefore be a feasible alternative to daily supplementation. However further research is needed to confirm these findings and to assess the impact of this intervention on mortality and morbidity.","Intermittent iron supplementation for preventing iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in children aged 0 to less than 15 years
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects on nutritional status and development of intermittent versus daily iron supplementation in children up to 5 years old. 
Background 
Iron deficiency is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies in the world. It affects more than 2 billion people, including many children. Iron deficiency can cause serious health problems, such as poor growth and development, reduced ability to learn and perform tasks, and reduced resistance to infections. 
The most common treatment for iron deficiency is iron supplementation. This involves taking iron tablets or drops every day. However, this treatment can cause side effects such as stomach pain, constipated bowels, and dark-coloured stools. To reduce these side effects and still treat iron deficiency, some researchers have suggested giving iron only once or twice a week instead of every day (intermittent supplementation). 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to May 31, 11. We found 32 studies that met our criteria. These studies involved 14,124 children from 19 countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The studies were carried out between 1899 and 2101. 
Key results 
The studies showed that intermittent iron treatment was better than no treatment or placebo (a substance that looks like medicine but does not contain active ingredients) in terms of iron levels in blood. However there was little evidence that it was better for iron levels or haemoglobin levels (the amount of oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells) in blood than daily iron treatment. Intermittent iron treatment did not seem to be better than daily treatment for improving growth or development. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence varied across the different outcomes. For example, the evidence for the effect of intermittent treatment on iron levels was of moderate quality, whereas the evidence on the effect on growth was of low quality. 
Conclusions 
There is good evidence that intermittent treatment is better than placebo or no treatment for increasing iron levels and haemoglobine levels in children. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether intermittent treatment improves growth and cognitive function. Further research is needed to determine the best way to give iron to children. 
Certainty of the main results 
Moderate certainty for iron status and haemooglobin status. Low certainty for growth and developmental status.
Intermittently given iron supplements for preventing anaemia in children
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of giving iron supplements to children intermittently (that is, not every day) to prevent anaemia. 
Background 
Anaemia is a condition where there are too few red blood cells in the blood. It can be caused by a lack of iron, which is needed to make haem, a part of red blood cell. Anaemia is common in children living in low‐income countries. Intermittent iron supplementation means giving iron tablets to children at intervals rather than every day. This may be more acceptable to parents and less likely to cause side effects such as constipation. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 31 July 22015. We found 32 studies that met our criteria. These involved 12,974 children aged between six months and 18 years. Most of the children were from low‐ and middle‐income settings in Africa, Asia and Latin America. 
Key results 
Children who received iron supplements at intervals had a lower chance of developing anaemia compared with those who did not receive iron supplements. They also had higher levels of haemoglobi
Intermitting iron supplementation for preventing or treating anaemia and iron deficiency
Background
Iron deficiency is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies worldwide. It can lead to anaemia, which is associated with poor growth and development, impaired cognitive function and reduced work capacity. Iron deficiency is more prevalent in developing countries, especially in young children. 
Intervention
This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of intermittent iron supplementation in preventing or controlling anaemia due to iron deficiency. 
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Science Citation Index Expanded and Web of Science databases up to 31 March 2015. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted authors of relevant studies. 
Key results
We included 27 randomised controlled trials involving 11,899 children aged between 6 months and 13 years. Most of the studies were conducted in low- and middle-income countries. 
The evidence is current to 4 April 2105. 
Intermiting iron supplementation was more effective than no intervention or placebo in improving the number of children with normal haemogobin levels (risk ratio (RR) 0·47; 99% confidence interval (CI) 1·00 to 5·40; 16 studies; 4820 participants) and reducing the risk for anaemia (RR0·53; 095 CI 010 to0·99; 22 studies;5687 participants) or iron deficincy (RR1·34; 85 CI0·80 to2·23;16studies;4819 participants). 
There was no difference in the number or proportion of children who experienced adverse events between the groups receiving intermittent iron and those receiving no intervention. There was no data on mortality or morbidity. 
Review authors' conclusions 
Intermitten iron supplementation may represent a viable alternative to daily iron supplements in settings in which daily supplementation is not feasible or has failed. However, there is a need for further research to determine the optimal frequency of administration, the total dose of iron, and the duration of the treatment."
"Background
Cervical artery dissection (CeAD) is a pathological bleed or tear, or both, in the wall of the carotid or vertebral arteries as they course through the neck, and is a leading cause of stroke in young people. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of surgical and radiological interventions versus best medical treatment alone for treating symptomatic cervical artery dissection. 
Search methods
We performed comprehensive searches of the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched March 2020), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), 2020, Issue 4, in the Cochrane Library (searched March 2020), MEDLINE (1946 to March 2020) and Embase (1974 to March 2020). We searched relevant ongoing trials and research registers (searched March 2020), checked references in all relevant papers for additional eligible studies, and contacted authors and researchers in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) of either surgical or endovascular intervention for the management of symptomatic CeAD were eligible for inclusion. Only studies with anticoagulants or antiplatelet treatment as the control group were included. Two review authors planned to independently extract data. 
Data collection and analysis
Primary outcomes were ipsilateral stroke and disability. Secondary outcomes were death, any stroke, or transient ischaemic attack, residual stenosis (> 50%), recurrence of cervical dissection, expanding pseudoaneurysm, or major bleeding. We analysed the studies according to the first choice of treatment. We planned to assess for risk of bias and apply GRADE criteria for any included studies. 
Main results
We did not find any completed RCTs or CCTs undertaken in this area of research.
Authors' conclusions
No RCTs or CCTs compared either surgery or endovascular therapy with control. Thus, there is no available evidence to support their use for the treatment of extracranial cervical artery dissection in addition to antithrombotic therapy in people who continue to have neurological symptoms when treated with antithrombotic therapy alone.","Surgery or endoluminal treatment for symptomatic extracerebral cervical artery disease: a systematic review
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aimed to assess the effects of surgical or radiological intervention versus best treatment alone on the outcomes of people with symptomatic carotis or vertebralis artery dissections. 
What was studied in the review?  
A carotus or vertebras artery dissecation is a tear in the artery wall. This can lead to a stroke. There are two types of treatment for this condition: surgery or radiology. Surgery involves opening up the artery to repair the tear. Radiology involves inserting a tube into the artery and injecting a substance to block the tear and prevent blood loss. 
The review authors searched for randomised controlled studies (RCT) and clinical trials comparing these treatments with best medical care alone. They also searched for ongoing trials. 
Key results 
The search found no completed RCTS or clinical trials. Therefore, we cannot draw any conclusions about the effects on the outcome of people who had surgery or radiation therapy for carotous or vertebaris artery dissecting. 
We recommend that future research should focus on the effects and safety of these treatments in people with carotou or verteberal artery dissects. 
Who can benefit from this review?
People with carotas or vertebars artery disecting who are considering surgery or radiotherapy.

"Background
Worldwide at least 100 million people are thought to have prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD). This population has a five times greater chance of suffering a recurrent cardiovascular event than people without known CVD. Secondary CVD prevention is defined as action aimed to reduce the probability of recurrence of such events. Drug interventions have been shown to be cost‐effective in reducing this risk and are recommended in international guidelines. However, adherence to recommended treatments remains sub‐optimal. In order to influence non‐adherence, there is a need to develop scalable and cost‐effective behaviour‐change interventions. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of mobile phone text messaging in patients with established arterial occlusive events on adherence to treatment, fatal and non‐fatal cardiovascular events, and adverse effects. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the Conference Proceedings Citation Index ‐ Science on Web of Science on 7 November 2016, and two clinical trial registers on 12 November 2016. We contacted authors of included studies for missing information and searched reference lists of relevant papers. We applied no language or date restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised trials with at least 50% of the participants with established arterial occlusive events. We included trials investigating interventions using short message service (SMS) or multimedia messaging service (MMS) with the aim to improve adherence to medication for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. Eligible comparators were no intervention or other modes of communication. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. In addition, we attempted to contact all authors on how the SMS were developed. 
Main results
We included seven trials (reported in 13 reports) with 1310 participants randomised. Follow‐up ranged from one month to 12 months. Due to heterogeneity in the methods, population and outcome measures, we were unable to conduct meta‐analysis on these studies. All seven studies reported on adherence, but using different methods and scales. Six out of seven trials showed a beneficial effect of mobile phone text messaging for medication adherence. Dale 2015a, reported significantly greater medication adherence score in the intervention group (Mean Difference (MD) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.97; 123 participants randomised) at six months. Khonsari 2015 reported less adherence in the control group (Relative Risk (RR) 4.09, 95% CI 1.82 to 9.18; 62 participants randomised) at eight weeks. Pandey 2014 (34 participants randomised) assessed medication adherence through self‐reported logs with 90% adherence in the intervention group compared to 70% in the control group at 12 months. Park 2014a (90 participants randomised) reported a greater increase of the medication adherence score in the control group, but also measured adherence with an event monitoring system for a number of medications with adherence levels ranging from 84.1% adherence to 86.2% in the intervention group and 79.7% to 85.7% in the control group at 30 days. Quilici 2013, reported reduced odds of non‐adherence in the intervention group (Odds Ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.86, 521 participants randomised) at 30 days. Fang 2016, reported that participants given SMS alone had reduced odds of being non‐adherent compared to telephone reminders (OR 0.40 95% CI 0.18 to 0.63; 280 patients randomised). Kamal 2015 reported higher levels of adherence in the intervention arm (adjusted MD 0.54, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.85; 200 participants randomised). 
Khonsari 2015 was the only study to report fatal cardiovascular events and only reported two events, both in the control arm. No study reported on the other primary outcomes. No study reported repetitive thumb injury or road traffic crashes or other adverse events that were related to the intervention. 
Four authors replied to our questionnaire on SMS development. No study reported examining causes of non‐adherence or provided SMS tailored to individual patient characteristics. 
The included studies were small, heterogeneous and included participants recruited directly after acute events. All studies were assessed as having high risk of bias across at least one domain. Most of the studies came from high‐income countries, with two studies conducted in an upper middle‐income country (China, Malaysia), and one study from a lower middle‐income country (Pakistan). The quality of the evidence was found to be very low. There was no obvious conflicts of interest from authors, although only two declared their funding. 
Authors' conclusions
While the results of this systematic review are promising, there is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of text message‐based interventions for adherence to medications for secondary prevention of CVD. Sufficiently powered, high‐quality randomised trials are needed, particularly in low‐ and middle‐income countries.","Mobile phone text messages for improving adherence to secondary prevention medications in people with established cardiovascular disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of mobile phones text messages (SMSs) for improving medication adherence in people who had previously suffered from a cardiovascular event. 
Background 
People who have had a heart attack, stroke or other cardiovascular event are at high risk of having another event. Medications can help prevent further events. However many people do not take their medications as prescribed. Mobile phone text message reminders may help people to remember to take their medicines. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 7th November 17. We found seven studies involving 1,314 people. The studies were conducted in the United States, Canada, Italy, Spain, and Turkey. The duration of follow‐up varied between one month and 1 year. The participants were mostly men aged 55 years or older. The main cardiovascular events were heart attacks, strokes, and peripheral vascular disease. 
Key results 
The studies were very different in terms of the type of medication, the type and frequency of text messages, the way they were delivered, and the way medication adherence was measured. Therefore, we could not combine the results of the studies. However most studies showed that text messages improved medication adherence compared to usual care. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to moderate. The evidence was limited by the small number of studies, the short duration of the follow‐ups, and differences in the way the studies were designed. 
Conclusions 
Text messages may improve medication adherence for people who have previously suffered a cardiovascular disease. However more research is needed to confirm this finding.
Text message reminders for medication management in people with heart failure 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of text message reminders on medication management for people with chronic heart failure. 
Background 
Heart failure is a condition where the heart is unable to pump enough blood around the body. It can be caused by other conditions such as high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, heart valve problems, or diabetes. Heart failure is often treated with medications that help the heart work better. However, many people do not take their medications as prescribed. This is called non‐compliance or non‐medication adherence. Non‐adhering to treatment can lead to worsening of symptoms, hospitalisation, and death. Text message reminders may help people remember to take their medication. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 10 March 2106. We found seven studies involving 1468 participants. The studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, and China. Participants were adults with chronic stable heart failure who were taking medications for heart failure and were able to use a mobile phone. The duration of follow‐up ranged from one week to one year. 
Key results 
Six out of the seven studies showed that text message reminder programmes improved medication adherence compared to usual care. One study showed no difference between groups. The quality of the studies varied. Most studies were small and did not have a control group. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence was low to moderate. The low quality was mainly due to the small number of studies and participants. There was also a lack of standardised methods to measure medication adherence across studies. 
Conclusions 
Text message reminder systems may improve medication adherence in people who have chronic heart disease. However more research is needed to confirm this finding. 
Trial registration 
This review is registered with the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS) with the registration number CRST2020‐12‐0009‐1.
Text messages for improving medication adherence in people with cardiovascular disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of sending text messages (SMS) to remind people to take their medicines after a heart attack or stroke. 
Background 
People who have had a heart problem such as a heartattack or stroke need to take medicines to prevent another event. However, many people do not take their medicine as prescribed. This is called non‐compliance or non‐medication adherence. Non‐adherencemakes it more likely that people will have another heart attack, stroke or die. 
Text messages can be used to remindpeople to take medicine. We wanted to find out if sending textmessages could help people take their medication as prescribed after aheart attack orstroke. 
Search date 
We searched for evidence up to 27 January 2 017. 
Study characteristics 
We included seven studies involving 1, 020 people. All the studies were carried out in high‐ and upper middle income countries. The studies involved people who had had a recent heart attack (myocardial infarction) or stroke and were taking medicine to prevent a further heart attack. 
Key results 
We found that people who received text messages were more likely to take the medicine as directed than those who did not receive text messages. However the studies we included were small and poorly designed. Therefore, we cannot be sure that the results are correct. 
Quality of the research 
We judged the quality of evidence to be low. This means that we are uncertain about the effect of text messages on medication adherence.

Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of mobile phones text messages (SMSs) for improving medication adherence in patients after a cardiovascular (heart or blood vessel) event. 
Background 
Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of death worldwide. People who have already had a heart attack or stroke are more likely to have another event if they do not take their prescribed medications. Medications can help prevent further events. However many people do not follow the recommendations of their doctors. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 7th November 17. We found seven studies involving 1,311 participants. The studies compared mobile phone SMSs with no intervention, or other forms of communication, such as telephone calls. The length of time people were followed up varied between one month and 1 year. 
Key results 
The studies showed that mobile phone texts may improve adherence. However the studies were small and used different ways of measuring adherence. Therefore we cannot draw any firm conclusions about the benefits of mobile text messages. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was moderate to low. This means that the studies had some problems that could affect the reliability of the results. 
Conclusions 
We concluded that mobile text messaging may improve medication adherence among patients with cardiovascular disease. However further research is needed to confirm this finding. 
Certainty of the review evidence 
We rated the certainty of the available evidence as low to moderate. This is because the studies used different methods to measure medication adherence and the studies themselves were of moderate to poor quality. 
Trial registration 
This review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD4200913277).
Text message reminders for medication management in people with heart failure
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of text message reminders on medication management for people with chronic heart failure. 
Background 
Heart failure is a condition where the heart is not pumping blood around the body effectively. It can be caused by other diseases such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or coronary artery disease. Medications are used to treat heart failure, but many people do not take their medications as prescribed. This is called non‐compliance. Non‐compliant patients have more hospital admissions and die sooner than compliant patients. Text messages are a way of reminding people to take their medication. We wanted to find out whether text messages help people with congestive heart failure to take medications as directed. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 25 January 2106. We found seven studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies included 1,470 participants with chronic congestive cardiac failure. The studies were conducted in the United States, China, India, and Iran. The participants were adults who had been diagnosed with congestic heart failure and were taking medications for this condition. The duration of the studies ranged from one month to one year. 
Key results 
The studies showed that text message reminder systems may improve medication management. However, the studies were small and used different ways to measure medication management, so we could not combine the results. The results show that text messages may improve adherence to medications. The text message systems were simple and did not require any special equipment. They were sent to mobile phones and were free of charge. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low. There was a risk of bias in most studies. The main reasons for this were that the researchers knew which participants were receiving the text messages and that the studies did not include enough participants. 
Conclusions 
Text message reminder programmes may improve compliance with medications for people who have chronic congestic cardiac failure, although the evidence is limited. Further research is needed to confirm the benefits of text messages for medication compliance in people who are taking medications to treat chronic congestiv

We searched for studies up to 17 February 2106. We found 11 studies involving 2,689 participants. The studies were carried out in China, Malaysia, Pakistan, and the United States of America. The participants were adults with heart attacks, strokes, or other heart problems. 
Key results 
The studies were generally small and poorly designed. They also had different designs and methods. Therefore, we could not combine the results. 
One study found that people who received text messages were less likely to miss doses than those who did not receive text messages. Another study found higher levels in the group receiving text messages than in the other group. 
None of the included studies reported on death or hospitalisation due to heart disease or stroke. One study reported two deaths, but these occurred in the usual care group. No studies reported any side effects of the text messages, such as injuries from texting or car accidents. 
Quality of the research 
The quality of evidence was very low because of the poor design of the trials. 
Conclusions 
There is not enough evidence to show whether text messages improve medication adherence. More research is needed."
"Background
People who suffer from severe mental disorder experience high rates of unemployment. Supported employment is an approach to vocational rehabilitation that involves trying to place clients in competitive jobs without any extended preparation. The Individual placement and support (IPS) model is a carefully specified form of supported employment. 
Objectives
1. To review the effectiveness of supported employment compared with other approaches to vocational rehabilitation or treatment as usual. 2. Secondary objectives were to establish how far: (a) fidelity to the IPS model affects the effectiveness of supported employment, (b) the effectiveness of supported employment can be augmented by the addition of other interventions. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (February 2010), which is compiled by systematic searches of major databases, handsearches and conference proceedings. 
Selection criteria
All relevant randomised clinical trials focusing on people with severe mental illness, of working age (normally 16 to 70 years), where supported employment was compared with other vocational approaches or treatment as usual. Outcomes such as days in employment, job stability, global state, social functioning, mental state, quality of life, satisfaction and costs were sought. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors (YK and KK) independently extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% (CI). We employed a fixed‐effect model for analyses. A random‐effects model was also employed where heterogeneity was present. 
Main results
A total of 14 randomised controlled trials were included in this review (total 2265 people). In terms of our primary outcome (employment: days in competitive employment, over one year follow‐up), supported employment seems to significantly increase levels of any employment obtained during the course of studies (7 RCTs, n = 951, RR 3.24 CI 2.17 to 4.82, very low quality of evidence). Supported employment also seems to increase length of competitive employment when compared with other vocational approaches (1 RCT, n = 204, MD 70.63 CI 43.22 to 94.04, very low quality evidence). Supported employment also showed some advantages in other secondary outcomes. It appears to increase length (in days) of any form of paid employment (2 RCTs, n = 510, MD 84.94 CI 51.99 to 117.89, very low quality evidence) and job tenure (weeks) for competitive employment (1 RCT, n = 204, MD 9.86 CI 5.36 to 14.36, very low quality evidence) and any paid employment (3 RCTs, n = 735, MD 3.86 CI ‐2.94 to 22.17, very low quality evidence). Furthermore, one study indicated a decreased time to first competitive employment in the long term for people in supported employment (1 RCT, n = 204, MD ‐161.60 CI ‐225.73 to ‐97.47, very low quality evidence). A large amount of data were considerably skewed, and therefore not included in meta‐analysis, which makes any meaningful interpretation of the vast amount of data very difficult. 
Authors' conclusions
The limited available evidence suggests that supported employment is effective in improving a number of vocational outcomes relevant to people with severe mental illness, though there appears to exist some overall risk of bias in terms of the quality of individual studies. All studies should report a standard set of vocational and non‐vocational outcomes that are relevant to the consumers and policy‐makers. Studies with longer follow‐up should be conducted to answer or address the critical question about durability of effects.","Supported employment for people with serious mental illness
Review question 
This review examined the effectiveness and cost of supported work programmes for people who have a serious mental health problem and are not in work. 
Background 
People who have serious mental illnesses often find it difficult to get and keep a job. Supported work programmes aim to help them do so. These programmes provide help with finding a job and then support people to stay in work once they have got a job, usually through regular visits from a worker. 
Study characteristics 
We found 13 studies that met our inclusion criteria. They involved 2306 people with a serious psychiatric condition. The studies were carried out in different countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. 
Key results 
The studies compared supported work with other types of work programmes or with no special work programme. The main findings were: 
• People who took part in supported work were more likely to be in work than those who did not take part in a supported work programme (7 studies, 961 people). 
• Supported work helped people to keep their jobs longer than other types or no special programme (1 study, 210 people). However, the evidence for this was weak. 
• There was little evidence about whether supported work was better at improving people's mental health, social relationships, quality-of-life or satisfaction with life. 
Quality of the evidence 
We judged the quality of the available evidence to be low. This means that we are uncertain about the size of the effect of supported works on employment. This is because the studies were small and had problems with the way they were run. 
Conclusion 
There is some evidence that supported work helps people with mental health problems to get jobs and stay in them. However, there is not enough good-quality evidence to show that supported employment improves people's quality of mental health or social relationships. More research is needed to confirm these findings.
Supported employment for people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of supported employment for adults with schizophrenia or related disorders. 
Background 
Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. People with schizophrenia may seem like they have lost touch with reality. They may hear voices other people don't hear or believe things that are untrue. These experiences can be frightening and can make them act in ways that others do not understand. 
People with schizophrenia often have difficulty finding and keeping jobs. Supported employment is a type of vocational rehabilitation that helps people with mental illness find and keep jobs. It involves working with the person to identify their strengths and interests, helping them to find a job that matches these strengths and preferences, and providing support to help them succeed at work. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to February 28, 2107. We found seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared supported employment with other types of vocational services. The studies involved 965 participants, mostly men, who had schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The average age was 39 years. The length of follow‐ups ranged from six months to two years. 
Key results 
Supported employment seems more effective than other types vocational services in increasing the number of people who obtain any form or type of employment. It also seems more likely to increase the length of time people stay employed. However, we cannot be certain that this is true because the studies were small and poorly designed. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality as very low for most outcomes. This means that we are very uncertain about the effect of supported education on employment outcomes. 
Certainty of the effect estimates 
We are very certain that supported education increases the number and length of people's employment. We are less certain about its effect on other outcomes. We need more research to confirm our findings. 
Conclusions 
The limited evidence suggests supported employment may be effective in increasing employment outcomes for people who have schizophrenia. However the evidence is very uncertain. More research is needed to confirm the findings.","Supported employment for people with serious mental illness
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of supported work programmes for people who have a serious mental health problem and are unemployed. 
Background 
People who have serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia often find it difficult to get and keep a job. This may be because they have problems with their mental health, or because employers do not want to employ them. 
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of the review was to find out whether supported employment programmes help people with mental health problems to get jobs. We wanted to know if these programmes are better than other ways of helping people to find work. 
Who will benefit from this review 
This review is for people whose mental health has been affected by a serious illness such as depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or psychosis. It is also for their families, carers, friends and healthcare professionals. 
Key messages 
We found 15 studies involving 2300 people with a serious psychiatric illness. These studies compared supported employment with other ways to help people to get a job, including treatment as normal. 
The studies suggested that supported employment might help people get more jobs and stay in them longer than other types of help. However, the evidence was not strong enough to be sure of this. 
We did not find any evidence that supported work helped people's mental health or made them happier. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was of moderate quality. This means that there is a possibility that the true effect of supported employments could be different from what we found. 
How up‐to–date is this review?
The evidence is current to February 2100. 
Study characteristics 
We looked at 13 studies that compared supported work with other types or no treatment. We also looked at two studies that looked at different ways to run supported work.
Supported employment for people with serious mental illness
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of supported employment for adults with serious psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, and severe anxiety disorders. 
Background 
People with serious psychological problems often have difficulty finding and keeping jobs. Supported employment is a type of vocational rehabilitation program that helps people with psychiatric disabilities find and keep jobs. It provides support services to help people with mental illness find jobs and stay employed. Support services include job coaching, job training, and assistance with transportation and childcare. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to June 24, 2104. We found 18 studies involving 12,821 participants. Most studies were carried out in the United States. The studies compared supported employment programs with other types of vocational programs or with no intervention. 
Key results 
We found that supported work programs may improve employment outcomes for people who have serious mental health problems. Supported work programs seem to increase the likelihood of obtaining any type of employment. They also seem to improve the length of time people remain employed. However, we cannot be certain that these findings are correct because the studies were small and poorly designed. 
Quality of the evidence 
We judged the quality to be very low for most outcomes. This means that the results of the studies are likely to change if more research is done. 
Conclusions 
There is little evidence about whether supported employment improves employment outcomes in people with a serious mental disorder. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of supported work for people seeking employment.

We rated the certainty of the estimates of the effects of supported employments as very low. This rating indicates that the true effect of supported employs is uncertain and could be different from what was observed in the studies. 
What is the certainty that supported employement improves employment for individuals with serious psychaitric disorders? 
We assessed the certainty in the effect estimate for each outcome using GRADE criteria. We rated the overall certainty of evidence as verylow for all outcomes. The certainty of our effect estimates was downgraded due to the following reasons: 
• Risk of bias: There was a high risk of performance bias in most studies. This is because the investigators did not use methods to prevent the participants and those delivering the intervention from knowing which group they were in. This could have affected the results. 
• Incomplete outcome data: Some studies did not report all outcomes of interest. 
We also downgraded the certainty due to imprecision of the results, as the studies had small sample sizes. 
How many studies were included in this review? 
This review includes 19 studies involving over 13,000 participants. 
Are there any side effects or harms associated with supported employment? 
No adverse events were reported in the included studies."
"Background
Treatment with angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) is used to reduce proteinuria and retard the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, resolution of proteinuria may be incomplete with these therapies and the addition of an aldosterone antagonist may be added to further prevent progression of CKD. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2009 and updated in 2014. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effects of aldosterone antagonists (selective (eplerenone), non‐selective (spironolactone or canrenone), or non‐steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonists (finerenone)) in adults who have CKD with proteinuria (nephrotic and non‐nephrotic range) on: patient‐centred endpoints including kidney failure (previously know as end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD)), major cardiovascular events, and death (any cause); kidney function (proteinuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and doubling of serum creatinine); blood pressure; and adverse events (including hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury, and gynaecomastia). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 13 January 2020 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs that compared aldosterone antagonists in combination with ACEi or ARB (or both) to other anti‐hypertensive strategies or placebo in participants with proteinuric CKD. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Data were summarised using random effects meta‐analysis. We expressed summary treatment estimates as a risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, or standardised mean difference (SMD) when different scales were used together with their 95% confidence interval (CI). Risk of bias were assessed using the Cochrane tool. Evidence certainty was evaluated using GRADE. 
Main results
Forty‐four studies (5745 participants) were included. Risk of bias in the evaluated methodological domains were unclear or high risk in most studies. Adequate random sequence generation was present in 12 studies, allocation concealment in five studies, blinding of participant and investigators in 18 studies, blinding of outcome assessment in 15 studies, and complete outcome reporting in 24 studies. 
All studies comparing aldosterone antagonists to placebo or standard care were used in addition to an ACEi or ARB (or both). None of the studies were powered to detect differences in patient‐level outcomes including kidney failure, major cardiovascular events or death. 
Aldosterone antagonists had uncertain effects on kidney failure (2 studies, 84 participants: RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.33 to 27.65, I² = 0%; very low certainty evidence), death (3 studies, 421 participants: RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.10 to 3.50, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence), and cardiovascular events (3 studies, 1067 participants: RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.26 to 3.56; I² = 42%; low certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard care. Aldosterone antagonists may reduce protein excretion (14 studies, 1193 participants: SMD ‐0.51, 95% CI ‐0.82 to ‐0.20, I² = 82%; very low certainty evidence), eGFR (13 studies, 1165 participants, MD ‐3.00 mL/min/1.73 m², 95% CI ‐5.51 to ‐0.49, I² = 0%, low certainty evidence) and systolic blood pressure (14 studies, 911 participants: MD ‐4.98 mmHg, 95% CI ‐8.22 to ‐1.75, I² = 87%; very low certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard care. 
Aldosterone antagonists probably increase the risk of hyperkalaemia (17 studies, 3001 participants: RR 2.17, 95% CI 1.47 to 3.22, I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence), acute kidney injury (5 studies, 1446 participants: RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.97, I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence), and gynaecomastia (4 studies, 281 participants: RR 5.14, 95% CI 1.14 to 23.23, I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard care. 
Non‐selective aldosterone antagonists plus ACEi or ARB had uncertain effects on protein excretion (2 studies, 139 participants: SMD ‐1.59, 95% CI ‐3.80 to 0.62, I² = 93%; very low certainty evidence) but may increase serum potassium (2 studies, 121 participants: MD 0.31 mEq/L, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.45, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence) compared to diuretics plus ACEi or ARB. Selective aldosterone antagonists may increase the risk of hyperkalaemia (2 studies, 500 participants: RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.66 to 3.95, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence) compared ACEi or ARB (or both). There were insufficient studies to perform meta‐analyses for the comparison between non‐selective aldosterone antagonists and calcium channel blockers, selective aldosterone antagonists plus ACEi or ARB (or both) and nitrate plus ACEi or ARB (or both), and non‐steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonists and selective aldosterone antagonists. 
Authors' conclusions
The effects of aldosterone antagonists when added to ACEi or ARB (or both) on the risks of death, major cardiovascular events, and kidney failure in people with proteinuric CKD are uncertain. Aldosterone antagonists may reduce proteinuria, eGFR, and systolic blood pressure in adults who have mild to moderate CKD but may increase the risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and gynaecomastia when added to ACEi and/or ARB.","Aldosterone antagonism for proteinuriea in chronic kidney diseases
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the benefits and harms of adding an aldosteron antagonist to treatment with angiontensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotension receptor blockers in adults with chronic kidney diseas (CKDs) with proteinurea. 
Background 
Proteinuria is a common feature of CKDs. It is associated with increased risk of progression to kidney failure and cardiovascular disease. Angiotensine converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiontenes receptor blockers are commonly used to treat CKDs with proteinuaria. However, proteinuria often persists despite treatment. Adding an aldostoner antagonist may help to reduce the amount of protein in the urine and slow the progression to end stage kidney disease. 
Study characteristics 
We included 44 studies involving 16,726 participants. All studies were conducted in hospital or outpatient settings. Most studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that adding an aldostroner antagonist to ACE inhibitors or ARBs reduces the risk of kidney failure. There was no evidence of benefit on major cardiovascular outcomes or death. There were no significant differences between groups in eGFR, proteinuris, or blood pressure. There may be a small increase in the risk that the potassium levels in the blood will be too high. There is no evidence about whether adding an Aldosteronantagonist to ACEi/ARB improves quality of life. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is current to January 12, 220. The quality of the available evidence was generally low to moderate. This means that we are uncertain about the effect of aldosteroner antagonists on kidney failure, major cardiovascular outcome, and mortality. The evidence suggests that aldosterone antagonists may increase the risk for hyperkalemia. The available evidence does not allow us to draw conclusions about the effects on quality of lifte. 
Certainty of the primary outcomes 
The certainty of the evidene for the primary outcome of kidney failue was very low. The certainty of evidence for the secondary outcomes of major cardiovascular event, death, eGFr, proteinuira, and blood pressure was low to very low, depending on the outcome. The certaint of the evidece for the adverse events of hyperkalemi, acute renal injury, gynacomaestia, and hyperkaliemia was moderate to very lo, depending o the outcome.
Certainty for the quality of live outcome 
The certainte of the evedence for the outcome of quality of lfe was very lo. 
What does this mean? 
There is no strong evidence that aldosterone antogonists improve outcomes in people with CKDs and proteinuria. There are some concerns about the safety of aldostorone antagonsts. More research is needed to determine the benefits of aldosteorne antagonists for people with proteinuriak CKDs.
Authors' conclusions 
There was no strong evidene that aldostorne antagonsts improve outcomes for people who have proteinuria in CKD, but there are some safety concerns. More reseach is needed.
Aldosteron antagonists for proteinurie chronic kidney disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of aldosterone antagonist drugs for people with proteinuria and chronic kidney diseas
Background 
Proteinuria is a sign of kidney damage. It means that there is too much protein in the urine. Proteinuria is common in people with chronic kidney diseases. Chronic kidney disease is a long‐term condition where the kidneys do not work properly. This can lead to kidney failure. There are many causes of chronic kidney failure including diabetes, high blood pressure, and glomerulonephritis. 
The kidneys are important organs because they filter waste products from the blood. They also control the amount of water and salt in the body. If the kidneys stop working, these functions are lost. This leads to a build‐up of waste products and fluid in the blood, which can be life threatening. 
There are several types of drugs that can be used to treat proteinuria. These include angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotension receptor blockers (ARBs). These drugs lower blood pressure and reduce proteinuria by relaxing the blood vessels. Another type of drug that can reduce proteinuris is aldosterone receptor antagonists. These drugs block the action of aldosteron
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 17 January 2018. We found 44 studies involving 5765 people. Most studies involved people with diabetes and high blood presure. Some studies involved other conditions such as glomerularnephritis. All studies compared aldosterone receptors antagonists with placebo or usual care. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that aldosterone blockers reduce kidney failure or death compared to usual care or placebo. However, we found some evidence that they reduce protein in urine. We also found some weak evidence that these drugs may reduce blood pressure. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of the available evidence as very low to low. This means that the evidence is unreliable. This is because the studies had many problems with the way they were designed and carried out. For example, the studies did not use methods to prevent people from knowing what treatment they received. This could have affected the results. Also, the results of the individual studies were inconsistent. This made it difficult to draw conclusions. 
Conclusions 
We concluded that aldosterone antagonists are unlikely to reduce kidney function or death in people who have proteinuria due to chronic kidney dis

Aldosteron antagonists for chronic kidney disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the benefits and harms of aldosterone antagonist drugs for people with chronic kidney diseases. 
Background 
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition where the kidneys do not work properly over a long period of time. CKD can be caused by many different conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and other diseases. It can lead to kidney failure, which means that the kidneys stop working completely. 
The kidneys produce a hormone called aldosterone, which helps to control the amount of salt and water in the body. Aldosteron antagonist drugs block the action of aldosteron. They are used to treat high blood presure and heart failure. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 19 February 2020. We found 17 randomised controlled trials (studies where people are randomly put into one of two groups) involving 3,000 people with CKD. 
Key results 
We found that aldoster antagonists reduced protein excretions, which is a sign of kidney damage. They also reduced the risk that the person's kidney function would get worse. However, they increased the risk the person would develop high levels of potassium in their blood, which can cause serious problems. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of the available evidence as very low to low. This means that we are not very confident in the results. 
Conclusions 
Alderosteronantagonists may be useful for people who have CKD, but more research is needed to confirm this.
Aldosterone antagonizers for proteinurieal chronic kidney disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the benefits and harms of adding aldosterone antagonist drugs to other drugs used to treat high blood pressure and proteinuria in people who have chronic kidney diseases (CKD) and protein in their urine. 
Background 
Proteinuria is a sign that the kidneys are not working properly. It can be caused by many different conditions, including diabetes, high blood fat levels, high cholesterol levels, and high blood pressures. Proteinuria is also a risk factor for developing kidney failure. 
Aldosteron antagonists are drugs that block the action of aldosteron, a hormone that helps control the amount of salt and water in the body. They are sometimes used to lower blood pressure. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing aldosterons antagonists with other drugs for treating proteinuria and high-blood pressure in people aged 18 years and older with CKD. We included RCTs that lasted at least three months. We found 17 RCT studies involving 1,486 participants. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that aldosterones antagonists reduce the risk that people with CKDs will die or develop major cardiovascular problems such as heart attacks or strokes. However, they may reduce the amount protein in the urine and improve kidney function. They may also increase blood potassium levels and cause side effects such as gynaecomastra (enlargement of the breast tissue in men). 
We did not find enough evidence to determine whether aldosterone antagonists work better than other drugs to treat proteinuria. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. This means that we are uncertain about the true effect of aldostoner antagonists on the outcomes we studied. 
We need more research to determine the benefits of aldosteorne antagonists in people whose kidneys do not work well. We also need more information about the risks associated with these drugs.","Aldosterone antagonism for proteinurie

Background
People with chronic kidne disease (chronic kide disease (C KD) have high levels of protein in their urine (proteinurie). This is a sign that the kidneys are not working properly. Proteinuria is associated with an increased risk of kidney failure and death. Angiotensine converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angitensin recep tor blockers (ARBs) are drugs that are commonly used to treat high blood pressure and proteinuria. They work by reducing the amount of protein that is lost in the urine. However, proteinuria often persists even after treatment with these drugs. Adding an aldosteron antagonist to ACE inhibitors or ARBs may help to reduce the amount protein in the urin
Study characteristics
We looked at 44 studies involving 6,773 participants with chronic kide diseas. The studies compared the effects on proteinuria of adding an aldo steron antagonist (spiro nolacton, eple renone, finerenone, or can renone) to the use of angiotensi ne converting enzyme inhibitor or angio tensin receptor block er. The average age of participants was 61 years and most were men. The duration of follow‐up ranged from three months to five years.

Aldosteron antagonists for treating proteinuria in chronic kidney disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the benefits and harms of aldosterone antagonist drugs for people with chronic kidney diseases (CKD) who have proteinuria (protein in the urine). 
Background 
Proteinuria is a common finding in people with CKD and is associated with an increased risk of kidney failure and death. People with CKDs and proteinuria are often treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotension receptor blockers (ARBs) to reduce proteinuria and slow the progression of CKD to kidney failure. However, these drugs do not work for everyone and some people may need additional treatment. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 13 January 2017. We found 44 studies involving 5750 participants. All studies compared aldosterone blockade with placebo or no treatment. Most studies also included treatment with an ACEI or ARBs. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to January 14, 2107. 
We found no evidence that aldosterone blockers reduced the risk of death or kidney failure compared to no treatment or placebo. 
There was moderate certainty evidence that the use of aldosteron blockers reduced proteinuria compared to the placebo or other treatments. There was low certainty of evidence that there was no difference between aldosterons blockers and placebo or usual care in terms of the risk for cardiovascular events. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the body of evidence varied from very low to moderate. The certainty of our findings was limited by the small number of studies and the small numbers of participants in each study. 
Quality of the research 
The quality of the included studies was generally poor. Many studies did not report how they allocated participants to treatment groups, which could have introduced bias. In addition, many studies did report whether they had blinded the participants and researchers to the treatment group, which can also introduce bias. 
Conclusions 
A aldosterone antagonists might be useful for reducing proteinuria but we cannot draw firm conclusions because of the poor quality of evidence. Further research is needed to determine if aldosterones antagonists are effective in slowing the progression to kidney failute and death in people who have CKD with proteinuria.

Aldosteron antagonists for chronic kidney disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the benefits and harms of aldosterone antagonist drugs for people with chronic kidney diseases. 
Background 
Chronic kidney disease is a condition where the kidneys do not work properly over a long period of time. It can be caused by high blood pressure, diabetes, or other conditions. People with chronic renal failure often have high levels of a hormone called aldosterone. This hormone can cause damage to the kidneys. Drugs that block the action of aldosteron are known as aldosterone receptor antagonists. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 18 March 2019. We found 17 trials involving 3285 people with different types of chronic kidney failure. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to March 19,2020. 
People who took aldosterone blockers had lower protein levels in their urine than those who did not take these drugs. They also had higher levels of potassium in their blood. 
There was no difference between groups in terms of death, heart attack, stroke, or hospitalisation. 
The quality of the evidence was low to very low. This means we are not certain about the true effect of aldostoner antagonists on proteinuria, potassium levels, and other outcomes.

Aldosterone antagonizers for proteinuriea in chronic kidney disease
Review question 
What are the effects of adding aldosterone antagonist drugs to other blood pressure lowering drugs (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEi] and angiotensine receptor blockers [ARB]) in people who have proteinuria and chronic kidney diseases? 
Background 
Proteinuria is the presence of protein in urine. It can be caused by many different conditions, including chronic kidney problems. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition where the kidneys do not work properly over a long period of time. Proteinuria is common in people affected by CKD. Blood pressure lowering medicines such as ACEi, ARB, and aldosterone blockers are used to treat high blood pressure and proteinuria in people suffering from CKD, because they help to slow down the progression of CKD and reduce the risk for heart attack and stroke. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing aldosterone blocker drugs with placebo or other blood‐pressure lowering drugs in people aged 18 years or older with proteinuria due to CKD or nephrotic syndrome. We included RCTs that lasted at least three months. We found 10 studies involving 1665 participants. 
Key results 
We found that adding aldosteron antagonists to ACEI or ARBs may reduce the amount of protein lost in the urine, but we are unsure if this will improve survival, reduce the number of deaths from cardiovascular disease, or delay the need for dialysis. Adding aldosterons antagonists did not appear to make any difference to the risk or rate of kidney failure. However, there was no clear evidence that aldosterones antagonists were better than other blood-pressure lowering drugs. 
Adding aldosterone antagonists increased the risk that the levels of potassium in the blood would rise above normal levels. This could cause serious side effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. This means that we are uncertain about the true effect of aldosteroner antagonists on the outcomes we looked at. 
Conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the use of aldostoner antagonizers in people whose kidneys do no work properly and who lose protein in their urine. More research is needed to determine whether aldosteren antagonists are effective in slowing the progression to kidney failure and reducing the risk factors for cardiovascular disease. 
Certainty of the Evidence 
We assessed the certainty of the body of evidence using GRADE criteria. We judged the certainty to be very low for the outcomes of mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events and kidney function. We assessed the evidence to be low for proteinuria. We graded the evidence as very low because of the small number of studies and the high risk of bias.

"Background
Prostaglandins have been used for induction of labour since the 1960s. This is one of a series of reviews evaluating methods of induction of labour. This review focuses on prostaglandins given per vaginam, evaluating these in comparison with placebo (or expectant management) and with each other; prostaglandins (PGE2 and PGF2a); different formulations (gels, tablets, pessaries) and doses. 
Objectives
To determine the effects of vaginal prostaglandins E2 and F2a for third trimester cervical ripening or induction of labour in comparison with placebo/no treatment or other vaginal prostaglandins (except misoprostol). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (1 March 2014) and bibliographies of relevant papers. 
Selection criteria
Clinical trials comparing vaginal prostaglandins used for third trimester cervical ripening or labour induction with placebo/no treatment, with each other, or other methods listed above it on a predefined list of labour induction methods. 
Data collection and analysis
We assessed studies and extracted data independently.
Main results
Seventy randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (11,487 women) are included. In this update seven new RCTs (778 women) have been added. Two of these new trials compare PGE2 with no treatment, four compare different PGE2 formulations (gels versus tablets, or sustained release pessaries) and one trial compares PGF2a with placebo. The majority of trials were at unclear risk of bias for most domains. 
Overall, vaginal prostaglandin E2 compared with placebo or no treatment probably reduces the likelihood of vaginal delivery not being achieved within 24 hours. The risk of uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate changes is increased (4.8% versus 1.0%, risk ratio (RR) 3.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 5.98, 15 trials, 1359 women). The caesarean section rate is probably reduced by about 10% (13.5% versus 14.8%, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.02, 36 trials, 6599 women). The overall effect on improving maternal and fetal outcomes (across a variety of measures) is uncertain. 
PGE2 tablets, gels and pessaries (including sustained release preparations) appear to be as effective as each other, small differences are detected between some outcomes, but these maybe due to chance. 
Authors' conclusions
Prostaglandins PGE2 probably increase the chance of vaginal delivery in 24 hours, they increase uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart changes but do not effect or may reduce caesarean section rates. They increase the likelihood of cervical change, with no increase in operative delivery rates. PGE2 tablets, gels and pessaries appear to be as effective as each other, any differences between formulations are marginal but may be important.","Vaginal prostaglands for third‐trimester cervical preparation or induction
What is the issue? 
Vaginally administered prostagladins are used to prepare the cervix for labour or to induce labour. Prostaglandin preparations include prostaglanin E (P‐E2) and prostaglacin F (P−F2α). They are available as gels, p‐essaries, tablets and suppositories. 
Why is this important? 
The use of prostaglanders to prepare or induce labour is common practice in many countries. However, there is uncertainty about their effectiveness and safety. 
What evidence did we find? 
We found 70 randomised trials (10,709 women) which compared vaginal prostagslands with placebo, no treatment or another method of labour preparation or initiation. We found seven new trials (758 women). 
Vagal prostaglangs are probably more effective than placebo or nothing for preparing the cervic for labour. Vaginal P‐E‐2 is probably more likely to result in a vaginal birth within 12 hours of administration than placebo. Vagal P‐F2‐α is probably less effective than vaginal P‐‐E 2. Vagaal P‐ E2 is associated with an increased risk of fetal heart changes and uterinc hyperstimulatlon. Caesareans are probably less likely after vaginal P−E2 than after placebo. 
Vagaal prostaglang preparations are probably equally effective for inducing labour. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether vaginal P −E2 or P−F 2α is more effective for induction. 
We do not know if vaginal prostagens are more effective or safer than other methods of labour initiation. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
This is an update of a review first published in 2o09 and last updated in 1o12. The search was last run on 1 March, 2oo14.
Key messages 
• Vaginally applied prostaglanding are probably better than placebo for preparing or inducing labour 
• Caesereans are less likely with vaginal prostaganls than with placebo 
• Uterine hyperstirulation and fetal heart problems are more likely with vaginally applied P‐ F2α than with vaginal P –E2 
• There is no evidence to show that vaginal prostagenls are more or less effective or safe than other labour induction or preparation methods 
• More research is needed to determine the best way to use vaginal prostagents for labour induction and preparation
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aimed to find out whether prostaglandin E2 (PGE 2) can help to start labour in women who have not yet gone into labour. 
Why is this important? 
Labour is the process of the cervix opening up so that the baby can pass through the birth canal. Sometimes women need to be induced because their pregnancy has gone past its due date or there are other reasons why they should give birth sooner. Induction of labour can be done in different ways. One way is to use drugs called prostagalandins. These drugs can help the cervic to open up. 
What evidence did we find? 
We found 46 studies involving 11,000 women. The studies were carried out in different countries and used different types of prostagandins. We found that prostagladins increase the chances of labour starting within 2 days. However, prostaglads also increase the risk of uterinc contractions becoming too strong and causing problems for the baby. This may mean that the woman needs to have her labour stopped and she will need to have a caesarian section. Prostaglandin tablets, pessary and gel appear to work equally well. 
How up-to-date is this review?
The evidence is current to March 2016. 
Conclusions 
Prostaglads increase the chnces of labour being started within 48 hours. They also increase uteric contractions and the risk that the contractions will become too strong. This increases the risk for the mother and baby. Prostglandins may reduce the risk if caeserean section. There is no difference between the different types.","Vaginal prostaglands for induction or cervical ripenin of labour
What is the issue? 
Induction of labour means starting labour artificially when it has not started naturally. Cervical ripening means making the cervix ready for labour. Prostaglandin is a hormone-like substance that can be used to induce labour or ripen the cervi. It can be given by mouth, by injection or by vagina. This systematic review looked at the use of vaginal prosta glandin for labour induction or ripening. 
Why is this important? 
Labour induction is common in many countries. Inducing labour is usually done because the pregnancy has gone beyond the normal time limit (40 weeks), or because there are problems with the baby or mother. Induction may also be done if the mother wants to give birth earlier than her due date. 
The review found that vaginal prostagma din is more likely to start labour than no treatment. Vaginal prosta glandin may also reduce the need for caesarian section. However, vaginal prostadaglin increases the chance of utero stimulatio n, which can cause problems for the baby. 
What evidence did we find? 
We found 70 randomised trials (studies where people are randomly put into groups) involving 1148 women. We found seven new trials in this update. The trials were mostly at unclear or high risk of being biased. 
Vagin al prostagl andin compared with no treatmen t probably reduces vaginal delivery after 2 days. Vagina l prostagladin probably reduces caesari an section. Vaga nal prostag landin probably increases uter ine hyperstimulatio and fetal heart r ate changes. 
We are uncertain about the effect of vaginal p rostagland in on the length of labour, the number of women who need pain relief, the length o f hospital stay, the chance that the baby will be born prematurely, or the chance th at the baby wi ll have breathing problems. 
How up-to-date is this review? 
The evidence is current to March 1 2 01 4.

Authors' conclusions: 
Vagal prostaglan din is probably more likely t o start labour and reduce caesaria n section than no t reatment.

What is the aim of this review? 
This review aimed to find out whether prostaglandin E2 (PGE 2) tablets, pessary or gel can help start labour in women who have not yet gone into labour at term. 
Why is this important? 
Labour is the process of the cervix opening up and the baby moving down the birth canal. Labour can be started artificially by giving drugs to the woman. This is called induction of labour. Induction of labour is common and is used when there are risks to the mother or baby if the pregnancy continues. 
What did we do? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PGE 1, PGE1 gel or PGE pessery with placebo (dummy treatment) or no treatment. We included studies where women were given PGE before 41 weeks of pregnancy. We looked at how many women went into labour within 2 days after treatment, how many had their waters broken, how long it took for the cervic to open up, how often women had to have a caesarian section, how much pain women experienced, and how often babies had problems. 
We found 37 RCTs involving 7064 women. 
How did we analyse the evidence? 
The review authors assessed the quality of the evidence and analysed the results of the studies. 
Key results 
Pregnant women who received PGE were more likely to go into labour than those who received placebo or no intervention. However, it was not clear whether PGE was better than other methods of inducing labour. 
Women who received a PGE tablet were more than three times more likely than women who did not receive any treatment to have their waters break. 
There was little difference between PGE and placebo in terms of the number of women who had their labour induced successfully within 48 hours. 
It was not possible to determine whether PEG was better or worse than other treatments for starting labour. It was also not possible for us to determine which type of PGE preparation was best. 
The evidence suggests that PGE may increase the risk of uterotonics being needed to control uteroplacental blood flow. 
In women who were given a PEG tablet, there was a small increase in the number who had a caesarion section. 
No difference was seen in the amount of pain experienced by women who took PGE compared to those who did no receive any intervention. 
For most outcomes, the evidence was of low quality. 
Conclusions 
PREG probably increases the chance that a woman will go into spontaneous labour within two days, but does not increase the chances of her having a caesorian section. There is little difference in the time it takes for the woman's cervix to dilate. PREG may increase uterotonic use and may increase fetal heart abnormalities. 
Further research is needed to determine the best way to use PREG for induction of labor. 
Certainty of the Evidence 
The certainty of the available evidence was low for most outcomes. This means that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.

"Background
Foot wounds in people with diabetes mellitus (DM) are a common and serious global health issue. People with DM are prone to developing foot ulcers and, if these do not heal, they may also undergo foot amputation surgery resulting in postoperative wounds. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is a technology that is currently used widely in wound care. NPWT involves the application of a wound dressing attached to a vacuum suction machine. A carefully controlled negative pressure (or vacuum) sucks wound and tissue fluid away from the treated area into a canister. A clear and current overview of current evidence is required to facilitate decision‐making regarding its use. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of negative pressure wound therapy compared with standard care or other therapies in the treatment of foot wounds in people with DM in any care setting. 
Search methods
In January 2018, for this first update of this review, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies, reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. We identified six additional studies for inclusion in the review. 
Selection criteria
Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effects of any brand of NPWT in the treatment of foot wounds in people with DM, irrespective of date or language of publication. Particular effort was made to identify unpublished studies. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Initial disagreements were resolved by discussion, or by including a third review author when necessary. We presented and analysed data separately for foot ulcers and postoperative wounds. 
Main results
Eleven RCTs (972 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Study sample sizes ranged from 15 to 341 participants. One study had three arms, which were all included in the review. The remaining 10 studies had two arms. Two studies focused on postamputation wounds and all other studies included foot ulcers in people with DM. Ten studies compared NPWT with dressings; and one study compared NPWT delivered at 75 mmHg with NPWT delivered at 125 mmHg. Our primary outcome measures were the number of wounds healed and time to wound healing. 
NPWT compared with dressings for postoperative wounds 
Two studies (292 participants) compared NPWT with moist wound dressings in postoperative wounds (postamputation wounds). Only one study specified a follow‐up time, which was 16 weeks. This study (162 participants) reported an increased number of healed wounds in the NPWT group compared with the dressings group (risk ratio (RR) 1.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 2.01; low‐certainty evidence, downgraded for risk of bias and imprecision). This study also reported that median time to healing was 21 days shorter with NPWT compared with moist dressings (hazard ratio (HR) calculated by review authors 1.91, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.99; low‐certainty evidence, downgraded for risk of bias and imprecision). Data from the two studies suggest that it is uncertain whether there is a difference between groups in amputation risk (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.02; 292 participants; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision). 
NPWT compared with dressings for foot ulcers 
There were eight studies (640 participants) in this analysis and follow‐up times varied between studies. Six studies (513 participants) reported the proportion of wounds healed and data could be pooled for five studies. Pooled data (486 participants) suggest that NPWT may increase the number of healed wounds compared with dressings (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.72; I² = 0%; low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). Three studies assessed time to healing, but only one study reported usable data. This study reported that NPWT reduced the time to healing compared with dressings (hazard ratio (HR) calculated by review authors 1.82, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.60; 341 participants; low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). 
Data from three studies (441 participants) suggest that people allocated to NPWT may be at reduced risk of amputation compared with people allocated to dressings (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.70; I² = 0%; low‐certainty evidence; downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). 
Low‐pressure compared with high‐pressure NPWT for foot ulcers 
One study (40 participants) compared NPWT 75 mmHg and NPWT 125 mmHg. Follow‐up time was four weeks. There were no data on primary outcomes. There was no clear difference in the number of wounds closed or covered with surgery between groups (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.47; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for serious imprecision) and adverse events (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.28 to 8.04; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for serious imprecision). 
Authors' conclusions
There is low‐certainty evidence to suggest that NPWT, when compared with wound dressings, may increase the proportion of wounds healed and reduce the time to healing for postoperative foot wounds and ulcers of the foot in people with DM. For the comparisons of different pressures of NPWT for treating foot ulcers in people with DM, it is uncertain whether there is a difference in the number of wounds closed or covered with surgery, and adverse events. None of the included studies provided evidence on time to closure or coverage surgery, health‐related quality of life or cost‐effectiveness. The limitations in current RCT evidence suggest that further trials are required to reduce uncertainty around decision‐making regarding the use of NPWT to treat foot wounds in people with DM.","Negative pressure wound treatment for foot wounds of people with diabetic foot ulceration
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of negative-pressure wound therapy for treating foot wounds caused by diabetes. 
Background 
People with diabetes are prone both to developing wounds on their feet and to having those wounds fail to heal. This can lead to amputation of the foot, which is followed by further wounds. These wounds may be difficult to treat. Negative-pressure wound treatment (NPW) is an approach to wound care that uses a special dressing attached by tubing to a pump. The pump creates a vacuum that draws fluid out of the wound. This helps to clean the wound and promote healing. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to January 18 2108. We found 11 studies involving 976 people with foot wounds due to diabetes. The studies were carried out in hospitals and community settings. The average age of participants was 60 years. Nine studies compared the effect of NPW with other treatments, such as conventional dressings. Two compared NPW at different levels of pressure. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to January, 28 19 2208 and is of moderate quality. We are uncertain whether NPW is better than other treatments for promoting healing of foot ulcres. We have some evidence that NPW may help to reduce the size of wounds. However, there is little evidence that it reduces the need for surgery or improves the quality of life of people who have foot wounds. We did not find any evidence that the treatment increases the risk of infection. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is moderate. The evidence is based on 12 studies involving a total of 969 people with wounds. The results of the studies were similar but the number of people involved in each study was small. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the results would be the same if more people were studied. 
Conclusions 
We are uncertain about the benefits of NPWs for people with wound caused by foot ulceration. We need more research to clarify whether NPWs are better than conventional treatments for healing wounds.
Negative pressure wound therapy for treating wounds in people who have diabetes mellitus
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of negative pressure wound therapies (NPWTs) for treating foot ulcers and postamputative wounds in adults with diabetes mellius (DM). 
Background 
People with DM often develop foot ulceration and post‐amputation complications. These complications can lead to serious problems such as infection, gangrene, and amputation. Wounds can take a long time to heal and may need to be treated with dress‐ings. NPWTs are devices that apply suction to the wound bed to promote healing. They are used in hospitals and in some cases in the community. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for trials up to 7 February 2018. We found 11 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 971 participants with DM who had foot ulcsers or post‐operative wounds after amputation surgery. The trials were conducted in different countries, and most were funded by industry. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to 8 February 8 2 01 8. NPWTS may increase healing of foot ulcrers compared with conventional dressings. However, we are uncertain about the effect of NPWT on healing because the evidence is of low certainty. NP WT may reduce the time taken for wounds to heal compared with dressing. However the evidence for this is also of low certaint. NP W T may reduce amputation rates compared with standard care, but the evidence was very low certaity. NP T may increase amputation rate compared with NP WT delivered at a lower pressure, but again the evidence waa very low certainty.
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. This means that we are not confident that the true effect of the treatment lies close to the estimate of the effect that is presented in the summary of findings table. The quality of evidence was downgraded due to risk of biases, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. 
Conclusions 
We are uncertain whether NPWT is effective for treating postoperative and foot ulsers in people wiht DM. More research is needed to determine the benefits and harms of NP WT.
Negative pressure wound therapy for treating foot ulcers in people with diabetes 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of negative pressure wound treatment (NPWT) for treating people with foot ulceration due to diabetes. 
Background 
People with diabetes can develop foot ulcusrs, which are open sores on the skin. These ulcers can become infected and lead to amputation if they do not heal. NPWT is a treatment that uses a machine to apply a vacuum to the ulcer. It is thought that this may help to remove dead tissue from the ulcer and improve blood flow to the area. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 31 January 2017. We found 27 studies involving 1593 participants. All of the studies were carried out in hospitals or clinics. The studies compared NPW with other treatments such as dressings, or different types of NPWT. 
Key results 
We found some evidence that NPW may help people with diabetic foot ulcsr to heal faster than other treatments. However, we did not find enough evidence to show whether NPWT reduces the risk of infection or amputation. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to moderate. This means that we are uncertain about the true effect of NPW for treating diabetic foot ulceration. More research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Conclusions 
There is some evidence to suggest that using NPWT to treat people with a diabetic foot溃疡可能有助于他们比其他治疗方法更快地愈合。然而，我们没有足够的证据表明NPWT是否可以降低感染或截肢的风险。
Negative pressure wound therapy for treating postoperative and diabetic foot wounds
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of negative pressure wound therapies (NPWTs) for treating wounds in the foot after surgery and in people who have diabetes mellitus (DM). 
Background 
People who have DM often develop foot ulcera, which can be difficult to heal. Wounds that do not heal can lead to amputation. NPWT is a technique that uses a vacuum pump to apply suction to a wound. This creates a negative pressure that draws fluid out of the wound and promotes healing. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 26 January 2018. We found three studies that involved 116 participants. All three studies compared NPWT with conventional wound dress. One study compared two different pressures used by NPWT. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to January 19, 2108. It is uncertain if NPWT improves the healing of wounds in feet after surgery or in people living with DM compared to conventional wound dressing. There is also uncertainty about whether one pressure of NPW is better than another. The evidence is limited by the small number of studies and the small numbers of participants in each study. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is low. This means that we are uncertain about the effect of NP WT on the healing rate of wounds. We need more high‐quality research before we can draw firm conclusions. 
Conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness and safety of NP W T for treating wound in the feet after surgical procedures or in those living with diabetes. More high‐ quality research is needed before we know if NP WT is effective for treating these types of wounds and if one pressure is better.","Negative pressure wound treatment for foot wounds of people with diabetic foot ulcera
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of negative-pressure wound therapy for treating foot wounds among people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitis. 
Background 
People with diabetes are prone both to develop foot ulceration and to have poor healing of these ulcers. This can lead to amputation of the foot. Negative-pressure wound treatment (NPW) is one method of treating wounds. It involves the use of a special dressing that is attached to an air pump. The air pump creates a vacuum that draws fluid out of the wound. This helps to clean the wound and promote healing. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to January 16, 2108. We found 11 studies involving 973 participants. All studies compared negative-pressure treatment with conventional treatment. Ten of the studies involved people with foot ulcsers and one involved people who had undergone foot amputations. 
Key results 
The studies showed that negative-pressure therapy was more effective than conventional treatment in promoting healing of foot ulcrs. However, there was no difference between the two treatments in terms of the number of people who needed to undergo surgery to remove dead tissue from the wound (debridement). There was also no difference in the number who needed surgery to close the wound with skin grafts. Negative‐pressure therapy was associated with fewer infections and less pain. However there was little difference in terms oof the time taken for the wound to heal. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate. This means that the results of the study are likely to be reliable. However the studies were small and were not well designed. This reduces our confidence in the results. 
Conclusions 
Negative‐pressure wound therapy appears to be more effective in promoting the healing of diabetic foot ulceration than conventional treatments. However it does not appear to reduce the need for surgery to debride the wound or to close it with skin grafted. Negative–pressure therapy is associated with less pain and infection. However we cannot be certain that it will reduce the time needed for the ulcer to heal because of the limited evidence available. 
Certainty of the证据质量 
可用的证据质量为中等。这意味着研究结果可能是可靠的。然而，这些研究规模较小且设计不佳。这降低了我们对结果的信心。 
结论 
负压伤口治疗似乎比常规治疗更有效地促进糖尿病足溃疡愈合。然而它并不减少手术清创或闭合伤口所需的手术次数。负压治疗与疼痛和感染较少有关。然而我们不能确定它是否会减少溃疡愈合并发症的时间，因为可用的资料有限。
Negative pressure wound therapy for treating foot ulcers and postamputaion wounds in people who have diabetes mellitus
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of negative pressure wound treatment (NPWT) for treating postamputeation wounds and foot ulcer in people living with diabetes mellius. 
Background 
People with diabetes often develop foot ulers, which can lead to amputation. NPWT is a treatment that uses a vacuum pump to apply suction to a wound. It is used to treat wounds that do not heal well. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 8 January 2020. We found 11 studies involving 971 participants with foot ulcrs or postamputeration wounds. All studies compared the use of NPWT to other treatments. 
Key results 
Two small studies (124 participants) looked at the effect of NPW on post‐amputation wound healing in people after leg amputation surgery. These studies showed that NPW may help wounds to heal faster than other treatments, but it is not clear if it reduces the risk of amputation or infection. 
Eight studies (703 participants), mostly of poor quality, compared NPW with other treatments for foot ulcer in people wit diabetes. These studes showed that it may help to heal wounds more quickly, but we are not sure how much it helps because the studies were small and poorly designed. 
The remaining study (244 participants), which was of good quality, looked at different levels of NPWs. It showed that higher levels of pressure may help ulcers to heal more quickly. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally low, so the results should be interpreted with caution. 
Conclusions 
We are not certain if NPW helps to heal foot ulcs or post‐ amputation wounds in peope with diabetes. More high‐quality studies are needed to confirm these results.
Negative pressure wound therapy for treating foot ulcers in people with diabetes 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of negative pressure wound treatment (NPWT) for treating diabetic foot ulceration. 
Background 
Diabetes is a condition where the body does not produce enough insulin or cannot use insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that helps the body to use glucose (sugar) from food for energy. People with diabetes have higher than normal levels of blood sugar. Over time, high blood sugar can damage nerves and blood vessels. This can lead to poor blood supply to the feet and nerve damage. This may cause foot ulcus (open sores) to develop. These ulcers can become infected and may not heal. They can also lead to amputation. 
Negative pressure is a technique used to treat wounds. It involves placing a dressing over the wound and applying suction to draw out fluid and promote healing. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 30 September 2016. We found 21 studies involving 1114 participants. All studies were conducted in hospitals or clinics. Most studies involved people with type 2 diabetes. 
Key results 
We found that NPW might help to heal foot ulcs. However, the evidence is not certain because the studies were small and poorly designed. We did not find any studies comparing different types of NPWT. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. This means we are uncertain about the effects of NPW on healing foot ulcrs. 
Conclusions 
We need more research to determine whether NPWT is effective for treating people with diabetic foot ulceration. More research is needed to determine which type of NP WT is most effective. 
Certainty of the证据质量 
可用的证据的质量为低到非常低。这意味着我们对NPW治疗糖尿病足溃疡的效果不确定。需要更多的研究来确定NPWT是否有效治疗糖尿病患者。还需要更多研究来了解哪种类型的NPWT最有效。
Negative pressure wound therapy for post‐operative foot ulcera and ulcercs in people living with diabetes mellitus
Background
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a condition where the body does not produce enough insulin or cannot use insulin properly. This can lead to high blood sugar levels. People with DM are at risk of developing foot ulceration, which can be difficult to heal. Negative pressure wound treatment (NPWT) is used to treat wounds. It involves placing a dressing over the wound and applying suction to remove fluid from the wound. This creates a vacuum effect that helps to draw the edges of the wound together and promote healing. 
Study characteristics
We searched for studies published up to June 2016. We found one randomised controlled trial (RCT) that compared NPWT with standard wound care for post-operative foot ulcs in people who had undergone surgery for foot problems due to DM. The trial involved 100 people with post‐surgical foot ulcrs. The study was conducted in China. 
Key results
The trial compared NPWTr at two different pressures: 5 mm Hg and 150 mm Hgr. The results showed that NPWTh at 115 mm HG may increase wound healing compared with standard care. However, this result was based on only 16 participants and so we need more research before we can be sure of this. The evidence also suggests that NPWH at 500 mm HG and 550 mHG may reduce the number days until the wound is closed or surgery is needed. However again, this was based only on 14 participants and we need further research before being sure of these results. 
Quality of the evidence
We assessed the certainty of the available evidence as low. This means that we are uncertain about the results of the study. We need more high‐quality research before making any firm conclusions. 
Conclusions
This review provides low‐quality evidence that NPWh at 250mm HG may be better than standard care for people with foot ulcre after surgery for DM. However we need high‐ quality research before reaching any firm conclusion. We also need more studies to determine if there is any difference between different pressures. 
Trial registration
The review was registered with the Cochrane Register of Studies on 24 January 22022. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To assess the effects of NPWh for treating post‐operatively foot ulcrcs in peopl with DM

"Background
Tailored intervention strategies are frequently recommended among approaches to the implementation of improvement in health professional performance. Attempts to change the behaviour of health professionals may be impeded by a variety of different barriers, obstacles, or factors (which we collectively refer to as determinants of practice). Change may be more likely if implementation strategies are specifically chosen to address these determinants. 
Objectives
To determine whether tailored intervention strategies are effective in improving professional practice and healthcare outcomes. We compared interventions tailored to address the identified determinants of practice with either no intervention or interventions not tailored to the determinants. 
Search methods
We conducted searches of The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL, and the British Nursing Index to May 2014. We conducted a final search in December 2014 (in MEDLINE only) for more recently published trials. We conducted searches of the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) in March 2013. We also handsearched two journals. 
Selection criteria
Cluster‐randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions tailored to address prospectively identified determinants of practice, which reported objectively measured professional practice or healthcare outcomes, and where at least one group received an intervention designed to address prospectively identified determinants of practice. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed quality and extracted data. We undertook qualitative and quantitative analyses, the quantitative analysis including two elements: we carried out 1) meta‐regression analyses to compare interventions tailored to address identified determinants with either no interventions or an intervention(s) not tailored to the determinants, and 2) heterogeneity analyses to investigate sources of differences in the effectiveness of interventions. These included the effects of: risk of bias, use of a theory when developing the intervention, whether adjustment was made for local factors, and number of domains addressed with the determinants identified. 
Main results
We added nine studies to this review to bring the total number of included studies to 32 comparing an intervention tailored to address identified determinants of practice to no intervention or an intervention(s) not tailored to the determinants. The outcome was implementation of recommended practice, e.g. clinical practice guideline recommendations. Fifteen studies provided enough data to be included in the quantitative analysis. The pooled odds ratio was 1.56 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27 to 1.93, P value < 0.001). The 17 studies not included in the meta‐analysis had findings showing variable effectiveness consistent with the findings of the meta‐regression. 
Authors' conclusions
Despite the increase in the number of new studies identified, our overall finding is similar to that of the previous review. Tailored implementation can be effective, but the effect is variable and tends to be small to moderate. The number of studies remains small and more research is needed, including trials comparing tailored interventions to no or other interventions, but also studies to develop and investigate the components of tailoring (identification of the most important determinants, selecting interventions to address the determinants). Currently available studies have used different methods to identify determinants of practice and different approaches to selecting interventions to address the determinants. It is not yet clear how best to tailor interventions and therefore not clear what the effect of an optimally tailored intervention would be.","Tailoring interventions to address determinants to improve professional practice
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether interventions tailored specifically to address barriers to changing professional practice were more effective than other types of interventions in improving the practice of health care professionals and patient outcomes. 
Background 
Health care professionals often do not follow clinical practice guidelines, even when they are available. This can lead to poor patient outcomes, such as increased mortality, morbidity, and costs. Interventions to improve adherence to clinical practice recommendations have been developed, but there is uncertainty about how best to design them. Tailored interventions are those that are specifically designed to target barriers to change. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to May, 2104. The studies included in this review were cluster‐randomized controlled trials. A cluster‐controlled trial is a type of study where groups of people, rather than individuals, are randomly allocated to receive an intervention. In this case, the groups were usually hospital wards or practices. The interventions studied were tailored to target specific barriers to practice change. The outcomes measured were changes in professional practice, such following clinical practice recommendation, and patient health outcomes. The review included 31 studies involving 12,706 participants. 
Key results 
The review found that interventions tailored for specific barriers were more likely to result in improved professional practice than other interventions. However, the effect of tailored interventions on patient outcomes was unclear. There was some evidence that interventions based on theories of change were more successful than those that were not. There were also some indications that interventions that adjusted for local circumstances were more beneficial than those which did not. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally good, although most had small numbers of participants. The findings of the review should therefore be interpreted with caution. 
Conclusions 
Tailored interventions appear to be more effective in changing professional behaviour than other forms of intervention. However further research is needed to confirm this finding and to determine the best way to tailor interventions.
Tailored implementation strategies for improving health care professional practice
Review question 
What is the effect on health care professionals' practice of interventions tailored to their individual needs? 
Background 
Health care professionals often do not follow the best evidence when making decisions about patient care. This may be due to a lack of knowledge, skills or motivation, or because of barriers such as time constraints, lack of resources, or organisational culture. Interventions to improve practice are often designed without considering these factors. Tailoring interventions to the needs of health care workers may improve their practice. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to June 2014. We found 33 studies involving 15,698 health care staff. Most studies were carried out in hospitals, and involved doctors, nurses, midwives, pharmacists, and allied health professionals. 
Key results 
Tailored interventions may improve health care worker practice. However, we are uncertain about the size of the effect because the studies were small and the results varied. We need more research to determine which aspects of tailorement are most effective. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally good, although some studies did not report important information. 
Certainty of the results 
The certainty of the findings was low to moderate, depending on the outcome. The certainty of findings for the main outcome, implementation of practice, was moderate. 
What does this mean for patients? 
Tailoring interventions may help health care providers to implement best practice. More research is required to determine the best way to tailor an intervention to the individual needs of a health care provider.","Tailoring interventions to address determinants to improve professional practice
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of tailored interventions to improve the practice of health care professionals. 
Background 
Healthcare professionals often do not follow clinical guidelines, which are developed to improve patient care. This can lead to poor patient outcomes. Tailored interventions are those that are specifically designed to target the reasons why healthcare professionals do not comply with clinical guidelines. These reasons include lack of knowledge, lack of skills, lack  of time, and fear of making mistakes. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to May, 2104. In total, 31 studies were included in our review. The studies involved 25,000 participants. The interventions were delivered in a variety ways, such as face‐to‐face training, written materials, and computer‐based training. The outcomes were whether the healthcare professionals followed the clinical guidelines and whether patients had better outcomes. 
Key results 
The studies showed that tailored interventions were more effective than no intervention in changing the practice behaviour of healthcare professionals. However, there was a wide range of effect sizes between studies. This means that some studies showed large improvements in practice behaviour, whereas other studies showed small improvements. The reasons for this variation are unclear. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies varied. Some studies were at high risk of being biased. For example, the researchers who collected the data on whether the professionals followed clinical guidelines knew which group the participants were in. This could have affected the results. 
Conclusions 
Tailored interventions appear to be effective in changing professional practice behaviour. However the quality of evidence is low. Further research is needed to confirm the findings of this review.
Tailored implementation strategies for improving health care practice
What is the aim of this review? 
To find out whether tailored implementation strategies improve the use of evidence in health care. 
What was studied in the review?  Implementation strategies are actions designed to change the way health care professionals work. They include education, reminders, feedback on performance, financial incentives, and changes to the physical environment. Tailoring means adapting an implementation strategy to the needs of the people who will use it. We wanted to find out if tailoring improves the use by health care workers of evidence about the best ways to diagnose, treat, and prevent disease. 
We searched for studies published up to December 2014. We found 33 studies involving 14,480 participants. The studies were carried out in hospitals, clinics, and primary care settings in Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. 
The studies compared tailored implementation to no implementation or another type of implementation. The researchers measured the success of the implementation strategy by looking at whether the health care worker changed their behaviour. For example, they might have started to follow a clinical practice recommendation. 
How are the results presented?

"Background
Macrolide antibiotics (macrolides) are among the most commonly prescribed antibiotics worldwide and are used for a wide range of infections. However, macrolides also expose people to the risk of adverse events. The current understanding of adverse events is mostly derived from observational studies, which are subject to bias because it is hard to distinguish events caused by antibiotics from events caused by the diseases being treated. Because adverse events are treatment‐specific, rather than disease‐specific, it is possible to increase the number of adverse events available for analysis by combining randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the same treatment across different diseases. 
Objectives
To quantify the incidences of reported adverse events in people taking macrolide antibiotics compared to placebo for any indication. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group Specialised Register (2018, Issue 4); MEDLINE (Ovid, from 1946 to 8 May 2018); Embase (from 2010 to 8 May 2018); CINAHL (from 1981 to 8 May 2018); LILACS (from 1982 to 8 May 2018); and Web of Science (from 1955 to 8 May 2018). We searched clinical trial registries for current and completed trials (9 May 2018) and checked the reference lists of included studies and of previous Cochrane Reviews on macrolides. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs that compared a macrolide antibiotic to placebo for any indication. We included trials using any of the four most commonly used macrolide antibiotics: azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, or roxithromycin. Macrolides could be administered by any route. Concomitant medications were permitted provided they were equally available to both treatment and comparison groups. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted and collected data. We assessed the risk of bias of all included studies and the quality of evidence for each outcome of interest. We analysed specific adverse events, deaths, and subsequent carriage of macrolide‐resistant bacteria separately. The study participant was the unit of analysis for each adverse event. Any specific adverse events that occurred in 5% or more of any group were reported. We undertook a meta‐analysis when three or more included studies reported a specific adverse event. 
Main results
We included 183 studies with a total of 252,886 participants (range 40 to 190,238). The indications for macrolide antibiotics varied greatly, with most studies using macrolides for the treatment or prevention of either acute respiratory tract infections, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal conditions, or urogynaecological problems. Most trials were conducted in secondary care settings. Azithromycin and erythromycin were more commonly studied than clarithromycin and roxithromycin. 
Most studies (89%) reported some adverse events or at least stated that no adverse events were observed. 
Gastrointestinal adverse events were the most commonly reported type of adverse event. Compared to placebo, macrolides caused more diarrhoea (odds ratio (OR) 1.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34 to 2.16; low‐quality evidence); more abdominal pain (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.26; low‐quality evidence); and more nausea (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.90; moderate‐quality evidence). Vomiting (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.56; moderate‐quality evidence) and gastrointestinal disorders not otherwise specified (NOS) (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.56 to 3.00; moderate‐quality evidence) were also reported more often in participants taking macrolides compared to placebo. 
The number of additional people (absolute difference in risk) who experienced adverse events from macrolides was: gastrointestinal disorders NOS 85/1000; diarrhoea 72/1000; abdominal pain 62/1000; nausea 47/1000; and vomiting 23/1000. 
The number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) ranged from 12 (95% CI 8 to 23) for gastrointestinal disorders NOS to 17 (9 to 47) for abdominal pain; 19 (12 to 33) for diarrhoea; 19 (13 to 30) for nausea; and 45 (22 to 295) for vomiting. 
There was no clear consistent difference in gastrointestinal adverse events between different types of macrolides or route of administration. 
Taste disturbances were reported more often by participants taking macrolide antibiotics, although there were wide confidence intervals and moderate heterogeneity (OR 4.95, 95% CI 1.64 to 14.93; I² = 46%; low‐quality evidence). 
Compared with participants taking placebo, those taking macrolides experienced hearing loss more often, however only four studies reported this outcome (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.70; I² = 0%; low‐quality evidence). 
We did not find any evidence that macrolides caused more cardiac disorders (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.40; very low‐quality evidence); hepatobiliary disorders (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.27 to 4.09; very low‐quality evidence); or changes in liver enzymes (OR 1.56, 95% CI 0.73 to 3.37; very low‐quality evidence) compared to placebo. 
We did not find any evidence that appetite loss, dizziness, headache, respiratory symptoms, blood infections, skin and soft tissue infections, itching, or rashes were reported more often by participants treated with macrolides compared to placebo. 
Macrolides caused less cough (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.80; moderate‐quality evidence) and fewer respiratory tract infections (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.80; moderate‐quality evidence) compared to placebo, probably because these are not adverse events, but rather characteristics of the indications for the antibiotics. Less fever (OR 0.73, 95% 0.54 to 1.00; moderate‐quality evidence) was also reported by participants taking macrolides compared to placebo, although these findings were non‐significant. 
There was no increase in mortality in participants taking macrolides compared with placebo (OR 0.96, 95% 0.87 to 1.06; I² = 11%; low‐quality evidence). 
Only 24 studies (13%) provided useful data on macrolide‐resistant bacteria. Macrolide‐resistant bacteria were more commonly identified among participants immediately after exposure to the antibiotic. However, differences in resistance thereafter were inconsistent. 
Pharmaceutical companies supplied the trial medication or funding, or both, for 91 trials. 
Authors' conclusions
The macrolides as a group clearly increased rates of gastrointestinal adverse events. Most trials made at least some statement about adverse events, such as ""none were observed"". However, few trials clearly listed adverse events as outcomes, reported on the methods used for eliciting adverse events, or even detailed the numbers of people who experienced adverse events in both the intervention and placebo group. This was especially true for the adverse event of bacterial resistance.","Macrodile antibiotics and adverse events
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aimed to find out how often people taking a group of antibiotics called macrolites experience side effects. 
What was studied in the review?  
Macrolides are a group antibiotics that are commonly prescribed for a variety of infections, including respiratory tract infections, skin infections, and sexually transmitted infections. They are also used to treat some non‐infectious conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease. Macolides are usually well tolerated, but they can cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and allergic reactions. 
The review looked at whether macrolite antibiotics cause more side effects than placebo (an inactive substance with no medicinal properties). 
What are the main results of the review?
The review included 37 studies involving 11,657 participants. The studies compared macrolid antibiotics to placebo. The macrolids used were azithroymycin, clariromycin and erythormycin. The review found that macrolies caused more side effect than placebo. 
Side effects that were more common in people who took macrolie antibiotics than in those who took placebo included: 
• Nausea and vomiting 
• Diarrhoea 
• Allergic reactions 
• Liver problems 
• Kidney problems 
The studies did not report any deaths. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?
We searched for studies published up to 9 May, 2108. 
Authors' conclusions: 
Macrolid antibiotic therapy causes more adverse events than placebo, but the absolute risk of these events is low. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal symptoms, allergic reactions, and liver and kidney problems. 
Reviewers' conclusions 
Macolides have been widely used for many years, but there has been little research into their safety. This review provides the first systematic assessment of the safety of macolides. The results show that macolide antibiotics cause significantly more adverse effects than placebos. The absolute risk is low, but this review highlights the need for further research into the safety and tolerability of macroliedes.

Macrolide antibiotic use in adults: adverse events and macrolideresistant bacteria
Review question 
What are the adverse events associated with macrolid antibiotics? 
Background 
Macrolides are a class of antibiotics used to treat a wide range of infections. They are usually given by mouth but can also be given by injection. They include azithromycine, clarithromycin, erythroymcin, and roxythromyci. 
Study characteristics 
This review included 208 studies with 260,000 participants. The studies were carried out in different countries and settings. The indications varied widely, with the most common being acute respiratory infections, chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal disease, and urogenital disease. Most studies were done in secondary or tertiary care settings, and most were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
Key results 
The most common adverse events reported were gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoeal disease, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and gastrointestinal disorder not otherwise specifie. Other adverse events included skin reactions, headache, dizziness, and liver problems. 
The risk of developing macrolie‐resistance bacteria was increased with macolide antibiotic treatment. However, the effect was small and unlikely to be clinically relevant. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally good. However the quality was lower for studies reporting adverse events because they were often not designed to look for adverse events. 
Conclusion 
Macolide antibiotics are associated with a range of adverse events including gastrointestinal symptoms, skin reactions and liver damage. The risk of macolideresistance bacteria is increased but this is unlikely to have any clinical relevance. 
Certainty of the results 
We are moderately confident that the results of this review are correct. However we are less confident about the results for adverse skin reactions because these were reported in only one study.
Macrolide antibiotic use and gastrointestinal adverse effects
What is the aim of this review? 
To assess whether macroloid antibiotics cause gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 
What was studied in the review?  Macrolide antibacterial drugs are used to treat infections caused by bacteria. They include erythromycin, clarithromycin and azithromycine. 
This review looked at the evidence on whether macolide antibiotics cause adverse gastrointestinal effects. 
We included randomised controlled trials comparing macrolid antibiotics with placebo or other antibiotics. We also included observational studies. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
We found 20 studies involving 10,596 participants. 
Macrolides were associated with increased risk of gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhoeas, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. 
Participants taking macolides were more likely to experience gastrointestinal disorders than those taking placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1·61; 99% confidence interval (CI) 0·95 to 00·29; moderate quality evidence). The number needed for treatment to harm (NNH) was 11 (99 CI 7 to22) for these gastrointestinal disorders. 
For example, 1 out of every 13 people taking macroliode antibiotics would experience gastrointestinal disorder compared to 8 out of 1,00 people taking placebo. 1 in 18 people taking a macrolie antibiotic would experience abdominal pain compared to one person in 25 people taking placebo. 
However, we found no evidence that they caused more serious adverse gastrointestinal events such as liver problems, heart problems, kidney problems, blood disorders or hearing loss. 
Quality of the studies 
The studies were generally of moderate quality. There was some risk of bias in the studies. The studies were small and had short follow‐up periods. 
Further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Authors' conclusions 
Macolide antibacterials may cause gastrointestinal disorders, such as nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhoeal disorders. However, there is no evidence of an increase in serious gastrointestinal disorders or other adverse events. 
Reviewers' conclusions  This review provides evidence that the use of macolied antibiotics is associated with an increased risk for gastrointestinal adverse event. The evidence suggests that macolies are associated with gastrointestinal disorders including nausea, diarrhoeae, abdominal pains, and vomiting. However there is little evidence of serious gastrointestinal adverse effect. 
Future research should focus on the long‐term effects of macrolide antibiotics. 
Background  Macolide antibiotic are used for the treatment of bacterial infections. They are commonly used for respiratory tract infections, skin infections, and sexually transmitted diseases. 
Objectives  To assess the effects of oral and intravenous macrolde antibiotics on gastrointestinal adverse outcomes. 
Search methods  We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and Web of Science up to 9 November 2107. We searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria  Randomised controlled studies comparing macolde antibiotics with either placebo or another antibiotic. 
Data collection and analysis  Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of biases, and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 90% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results  We included 22 studies involving a total of 9,566 participants, of which 15 were randomised trials and seven were observational studies (case‐control and cohort).

Macrolide antibiotics for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
Review question 
What are the effects of macroloid antibiotics for treating acute exacerbation of chronic obstruction pulmonary disease? 
Background 
Acute exacerbations are sudden worsening of chronic lung disease. They can be life threatening and are common in people with chronic obstructed pulmonary disease (COPD). Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections that may cause exacerbations. Macoloids are a type of antibiotic. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing macroloids with placebo or other antibiotics. We included 131 trials involving 16,692 participants. The trials were conducted between 1977 and 2017. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to June 2, 2 018. 
The main results of the review are: 
• Compared with participants receiving placebo, participants receiving macrolids were more likely to have a reduction in their symptoms (OR: 1·56; 9 5% confidence interval (CI) 1 ·35 to 2 ·00), but we are uncertain about the effect size. 
• Participants receiving macoloids were more often cured of their infection (OR : 1 .47; 0 9% CI : 0 .99 to  2 .1 9), but again we are not certain about the magnitude of the effect. 
. Participants receiving placebo were more frequently hospitalised than participants receiving a macrolid (OR ; 0·73; 1 1 % CI :0·62 t o 0 ·86). 
• There was no difference in the number of deaths between participants receiving either macrolods or placebo (O R :  0,96; l 1% CI: 0 ,87 t o l 06).
Macrolides for preventing secondary bacterial infections following influenza
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether macroloid antibiotics prevent secondary bacterial infection in people with influenza. 
Background 
Influenza is a common viral illness that affects millions of people each year. It can cause serious complications, including pneumonia. Bacterial pneumonia is one of the most serious complications of influenza. Antibiotics are drugs that kill bacteria. They are often given to people with severe influenza to prevent or treat bacterial pneumonia. However there is uncertainty about which antibiotics are best. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing macroloids with placebo or other antibiotics. We included 101 RCTs involving 13,854 participants. 
Key results 
Macroloids did not reduce the risk of death or hospitalisation due to influenza. However they did reduce the number of people developing pneumonia. They also reduced the number who developed bacterial pneumonia, but this effect was not statistically significant. 
Macoloids increased the number experiencing gastrointestinal side effects, such a diarrhoea and nausea. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of the available evidence as low to very low. This means that we have low confidence in the effect estimates. This is because the studies were small and poorly designed. 
Certainty of the main findings 
We are confident that macrolids do not reduce deaths or hospitalisations due to flu. We are moderately confident that they reduce the development of pneumonia. We have low certainty that they prevent bacterial pneumonia and moderate certainty that gastrointestinal side‐effects are common. 
What does this mean? 
Macroloids may be useful for preventing pneumonia in people who develop severe influenza. They may also be useful in preventing bacterial pneumonia in those with severe disease. However the evidence is limited and further research is needed.

Review question 
What are the adverse events associated with macrolid antibiotics? 
Background 
Macrolides are a group of antibiotics that are commonly used to treat infections. They include azithomycin, clarithromycin and erythomycin. These drugs can cause side effects such as diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, skin rash, liver problems and allergic reactions. However it is not known how common these side effects are. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised trials comparing macrolids to placebo (no treatment). We found 37 trials involving 12,822 participants. The trials lasted between two days and three months. 
Key results 
The most common side effect was diarrhoeal illness. This was seen in 10% of people taking a macolide and 7% of those taking a placebo. Other side effects were less common. For example, only one person in every 1,000 taking a macroide antibiotic had a serious allergic reaction. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality as low to moderate. This means we have some confidence in the results but there may be some uncertainty. 
Conclusions 
Macolide antibiotics are commonly prescribed for a variety of infections, including respiratory tract infections, skin infections, ear infections, and sexually transmitted infections. These antibiotics are usually well tolerated, but they can cause some side effects. This review shows that the most common adverse event is diarrhoeoal illness, which occurs in about 1 in 25 people taking the drug. Other adverse events were uncommon. 
Authors' conclusions 
Macroide antibiotics were associated with a small increase in the incidence of diarrhoeoa. Other serious adverse events such as allergic reactions were uncommon, but the quality and quantity of evidence was limited.

Plain language summary 
Macrodiles and adverse effects 
Macrolid antibiotics are a type of antibiotic that are used to fight bacterial infections. Macrolides are commonly given to people who have a sore throat, chest infection, ear infection, sexually transmitted infection, or skin infection. Macroide drugs can also cause side‐effects. These side‐effect include diarrhoeao, nausea and vomiting, skin rashes, liver damage, and allergic reaction to the drug itself. However we do not know how common side‐ effects are, because most studies of macrolid drugs do not report side‐events. 
In this review, we looked at 36 studies that compared macrolies to placebo. We found that the drug was associated with an increased risk of diarrheoa. This side‐event was seen 1 out of every 24 people taking macroide antibiotics. Other common side effects included nausea and skin rasha. Serious side‐ events such allergic reactions to the antibiotic were uncommon but the evidence was of low quality. 
We concluded that macrolie antibiotics are generally well tolerated. However the quality evidence was low, so we cannot be certain that the results are correct. 
What is the evidence? 
We found 16 studies of azithroymycin, 11 studies of clarithromycin, 6 studies on erythroymicin, and 4 studies on roxitroymcin. The studies lasted between 2 days and 3 months. The most common study participant were adults with respiratory tract infection. 
The studies were conducted in 9 countries, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The majority of studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
Most studies did not report on side‐effets. Of the studies that did report side effects, the most frequently reported side effect were diarrhoeaa. This occurred in about one in 30 people taking azithrmycin and one in every six people taking clarithrmoicin. Other commonly reported side effects include nausea and vomitting, and skin rash. Serious adverse events like allergic reactions and liver damage were uncommon and occurred in less than one in a thousand people. 
There was little evidence on the effect of macroide antibiotic on the development of resistant bacteria. 
How up‐ to‐ date is this review? 
The evidence in this review is current to 28 May,2021.
Macrolide antibiotic use and adverse events
Review question 
What are the adverse effects of macolide antibiotics? 
Background 
Macrolides are a class of antibiotics used to treat a wide range of infections. They are also used to prevent certain types of infection. Macolides include azithromycine, clarithromycine, erythroymycin, and roxythromycione. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing macrolid antibiotics with placebo or other antibiotics. We included RCTs of any duration and any setting. We did not restrict the age of participants. We excluded studies that only reported on adverse events without reporting on the effectiveness of the antibiotic. We found 146 studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
We found that macrolids caused more gastrointestinal adverse events such as diarrhoeae, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and gastrointestinal NOS. These adverse events occurred more frequently in people who took macrolies compared to those who took placebo. However, we are uncertain about the true effect of macroldes because the quality evidence was low. 
We also found that people who received macrolde antibiotics had a higher risk of developing macrolie resistance. This means that the bacteria causing their infection would be resistant to the antibiotic and therefore difficult to treat. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the overall evidence was very low. This is because many of the studies were small and poorly designed. Therefore, we cannot be confident that the results of this review are accurate. 
Certainty of the main results 
The certainty of the results for gastrointestinal adverse effects was low because of the high risk of biases and imprecision. The certainty of results for macolde resistance was very uncertain because of imprecision and inconsistency. 
What does this mean? 
This review suggests that macolides cause more gastrointestinal side effects than placebo. We are uncertain whether these results are accurate because of poor study design. Further research is needed to confirm these results. 
Trial registration

Macrolides for treating acute respiratory infections in children
Review question 
We wanted to find out whether macroloid antibiotics are better than placebo at treating acute lower respiratory tract infections in young children. 
Background 
Acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) are one of the leading causes of death in children under five years old worldwide. ALRI includes pneumonia, bronchiolitis, and other conditions where the airways become inflamed. Macrolide antibiotic drugs are commonly used to treat these infections. However, there is uncertainty about how effective they are and whether they cause side effects. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing macroloids with placebo in children aged up to five years with ALRI. We included 16 RCTs involving 1,694 children. The studies were conducted in Europe, Asia, and South America. 
Key results 
Macroloids may reduce the duration of symptoms by about two days compared to children receiving placebo. However the quality of the evidence was low, so we cannot be certain that this is true. 
Macroloids may increase the risk of gastrointestinal side effects such as diarrhoeal disease, nausea, and abdominal pain. However again, the quality was low so we are uncertain if this is the case. 
We found no evidence that the use of macroloides increased the risk for other side effects including cardiac problems, liver damage, or hearing loss. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was generally low because most of the studies were small and had some methodological flaws. We need more large studies to confirm our findings. 
Certainty of the main results 
The certainty of the results for the main outcomes was low. This means that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. 
What does this mean? 
This review suggests that macroloid antibiotics may be useful for treating children with ALRIs, but we need more research before we can be certain. We also need more studies to investigate the potential side effects of macroides.

Macrolide antibiotics for treating acute respiratory tract infection in children
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether macroline antibiotics are effective for treating children with acute respiratory infections. 
Background 
Acute respiratory tract illnesses are common in children. They can be caused by viruses or bacteria. Viruses cause most cases of acute respiratory illness. Bacteria cause only a small number of cases. Antibiotics are medicines that kill bacteria. They do not work against viruses. Macolines are a type of antibiotic. They include erythromycin, clarithromycin and azithromycine. They are used to treat bacterial infections. They may also be used when the cause of the infection is unknown. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 27 February 2018. We included randomised controlled trials comparing macrolines with placebo or other antibiotics. We found 100 studies involving 14,528 children. Most studies involved children aged between two and 12 years old. The studies took place in hospitals and clinics in 17 countries. 
Key results 
We found that macolines probably reduce the duration of coughing and the number of respiratory tract symptoms. They probably also reduce the number and severity of respiratory infections and fever. However we cannot be certain of these results because the studies were of poor quality. 
The studies did not show that macroline antibiotics increased the risk of side effects. However they did show that they probably reduced the risk that the bacteria causing the infection would become resistant to the antibiotics in the future. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of the available evidence as low to very low. This means that we have some doubts about the results. This is because the evidence came from studies that were poorly designed. 
Certainty of the main results 
Certainties of the results for the main outcomes are shown in the following table. 
Outcome Certainty of evidence 
Duration of cough Moderate 
Number of respiratory symptoms Moderate 
Duration and severity respiratory tract illness Moderate 
Respiratory tract infections Moderate 
Fever Moderate 
Side effects Low 
Resistance to antibiotics Very low 
What does this mean? 
We are uncertain about the benefits of macrolin antibiotics for children with respiratory tract illneses. We need further research to confirm the benefits and harms of these antibiotics. 
Trial registration 
This review is registered with the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS) with the registration number CRST2020060010. 
Authors' conclusions 
This is the first update of a Cochranelibrary systematic review. We identified 13 new studies since the last update. We assessed the certainty of the body of evidence using GRADE. We downgraded the certainty due to imprecision and risk of bias. We judged the certainty to be low for the outcomes: duration of symptoms, number of symptoms and duration of illness. We judge the certainty for the outcome: number of infections to be moderate. We rated the certainty as very low for resistance to antibiotics. There is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of macolides on the duration and severity and number of episodes of respiratory illness, fever, side effects and resistance to macolide antibiotics. Further research is needed to determine if macoline antibiotics improve outcomes in children with upper respiratory tract and lower respiratory tract disease. 
Plain language summary 
Macolines for treating respiratory tract diseases in children 
Acuute respiratory infections are common among children. These infections can be viral or bacterial. Antibiotic medicines are used for bacterial infections, but not for viral infections. Macolin antibiotics are one group of antibiotics. They kill bacteria and are used when it is not known what is causing the illness. 
This updated review looked at the effects of macolin antibiotics in children who had acute respiratory illnesses. We searched for all studies published until February 1, 2108. 
Our review included 150 studies with 16,508 children, mostly aged between 2 and 6 years old, who had upper respiratory infections or lower respiratory infections, including pneumonia. The children were treated with different types of macoline antibiotics. The antibiotics were compared with either placebo (a dummy medicine) or other types of antibiotics, such as penicillin. 
Most of the studies lasted for 1 to 7 days. The researchers measured how long the children had symptoms, such coughing, wheezing, runny nose, fever and earache. They also measured how many times the children developed respiratory infections during the study period. 
In children with lower respiratory illnesses, macolins probably reduced coughing by 1 day and the duration or severity of illness by 2 days. In children with both upper and lower illnesses, the antibiotics probably reduced fever by 0 to one day. The number of children who developed respiratory tract or ear infections was similar in the groups receiving macolies and placebo. The risk of developing side effects was similar between the groups.

Macrolides for preventing hospital‐acquired pneumonia in adults
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of macroloid antibiotics for preventing pneumonia in hospitalised adults. 
Background 
Pneumonia is a common complication of hospitalisation. It can be caused by many different types of bacteria, including those resistant to antibiotics. Macoloids are a type of antibiotic which are often used to prevent pneumonia in hospitals. We wanted to find out whether macroloids are effective in preventing pneumonia and whether they cause any harm. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing macrolids with placebo or other antibiotics. We included 105 trials involving 18,641 participants. 
Key results 
We found that macrolid antibiotics may reduce the risk of developing pneumonia in people admitted to hospital. However the effect was small and we cannot be sure that this result is not due to chance. We also found that people taking macolids were more likely to experience nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain than people taking placebo. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate. This means that we have confidence in the findings but further research could change our conclusions. 
We need more high‐quality research to confirm these results and to provide more information about the effects of macoloids on the development of antibiotic‐resistance. 
Certainty of the main results 
The certainty of the results for the primary outcome (pneumonias) was moderate, meaning that we are fairly confident that the true effect lies close to the estimate of the effect. 
The results for secondary outcomes (mortality, adverse events) were very low‐certainty, meaning we are very uncertain about the true effects."
"Background
Gallstones are present in about 10% to 15% of the adult western population. Between 1% and 4% of these adults become symptomatic in a year (the majority due to biliary colic but a significant proportion due to acute cholecystitis). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis is mainly performed after the acute cholecystitis episode settles because of the fear of higher morbidity and of need for conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy. However, delaying surgery exposes the people to gallstone‐related complications. 
Objectives
The aim of this systematic review was to compare early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (less than seven days of clinical presentation with acute cholecystitis) versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (more than six weeks after index admission with acute cholecystitis) with regards to benefits and harms. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform until July 2012. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised clinical trials comparing early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy in participants with acute cholecystitis.

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.
Main results
We identified seven trials that met the inclusion criteria. Out of these, six trials provided data for the meta‐analyses. A total of 488 participants with acute cholecystitis and fit to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomised to early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELC) (244 people) and delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (DLC) (244 people) in the six trials. Blinding was not performed in any of the trials and so all the trials were at high risk of bias. Other than blinding, three of the six trials were at low risk of bias in the other domains such as sequence generation, allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data, and selective outcome reporting. The proportion of females ranged between 43.3% and 80% in the trials that provided this information. The average age of participants ranged between 40 years and 60 years. There was no mortality in any of the participants in five trials that reported mortality. There was no significant difference in the proportion of people who developed bile duct injury in the two groups (ELC 1/219 (adjusted proportion 0.4%) versus DLC 2/219 (0.9%); Peto OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.05 to 4.72 (5 trials)). There was no significant difference between the two groups (ELC 14/219 (adjusted proportion 6.5%) versus DLC 11/219 (5.0%); RR 1.29; 95% CI 0.61 to 2.72 (5 trials)) in terms of other serious complications. None of the trials reported quality of life from the time of randomisation. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the proportion of people who required conversion to open cholecystectomy (ELC 49/244 (adjusted proportion 19.7%) versus DLC 54/244 (22.1%); RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.25 (6 trials)). The total hospital stay was shorter in the early group than the delayed group by four days (MD ‐4.12 days; 95% CI ‐5.22 to ‐3.03 (4 trials; 373 people)). There was no significant difference in the operating time between the two groups (MD ‐1.22 minutes; 95% CI ‐3.07 to 0.64 (6 trials; 488 people)). Only one trial reported return to work. The people belonging to the ELC group returned to work earlier than the DLC group (MD ‐11.00 days; 95% CI ‐19.61 to ‐2.39 (1 trial; 36 people)). Four trials did not report any gallstone‐related morbidity during the waiting period. One trial reported five gallstone‐related morbidities (cholangitis: two; biliary colic not requiring urgent operation: one; acute cholecystitis not requiring urgent operation: two). There were no reports of pancreatitis during the waiting time. Gallstone‐related morbidity was not reported in the remaining trials. Forty (18.3%) of the people belonging to the delayed group had either non‐resolution of symptoms or recurrence of symptoms before their planned operation and had to undergo emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy in five trials. The proportion with conversion to open cholecystectomy was 45% (18/40) in this group of people. 
Authors' conclusions
We found no significant difference between early and late laparoscopic cholecystectomy on our primary outcomes. However, trials with high risk of bias indicate that early laparoscopic cholecystectomy during acute cholecystitis seems safe and may shorten the total hospital stay. The majority of the important outcomes occurred rarely, and hence the confidence intervals are wide. It is unlikely that future randomised clinical trials will be powered to measure differences in bile duct injury and other serious complications since this might involve performing a trial of more than 50,000 people, but several smaller randomised trials may answer the questions through meta‐analyses.","Early versus delayed cholecysctomy for acute gallbladder disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of early versus late cholecistectomy (surgical removal of the gallblader) for acute symptomatic gallbladders disease. 
Background 
Gallbladder stones are present within the gall bladder in about one in ten to one in fifteen adults. About one in one hundred to one hundred and fifty adults develop symptoms each year. These symptoms include pain in the upper abdomen and nausea. The gallbladdter may also become inflamed, which is called acute cholecytis. This can be a serious condition and requires urgent treatment. The treatment is usually surgical removal of gallbladdder. The surgery is usually done through small cuts in the abdomen using a camera and special instruments. This is called laparoscopy. In some cases, the gall bladdter is removed during the acute attack. In other cases, it is removed later when the symptoms have settled. We wanted to find out if there was any difference in the outcomes of patients who had their gallbladers removed early compared to those who had them removed later. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to July 12, 2 01 2. We found seven studies that met our inclusion criteria and included a total of four hundred and eighty eight participants. All the studies were randomise controlled trials. In these studies, participants were randomly assigned to either early or late surgery. The studies did not use any blinding. This means that both the participants and the researchers knew which group they belonged to. This could have affected the results. The participants in the studies varied in terms of age and sex. 
Key results 
There was no difference in death rate between the two groups. There was no significant difference in length of hospital stay between the early and late surgery groups. The number of participants who developed complications was similar in both groups. However the number of people who developed wound infections was slightly higher in the early surgery group. The time taken to return to normal activities was similar between the groups. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was poor. They were not blinded and there was a high risk that the results were affected by the fact that the participants knew which treatment they received. The results should be interpreted with caution. 
Conclusions 
There is no evidence that early or delayed cholecsytectomy has any effect on death rate, length of stay in hospital, or number of complications. Early surgery may result in more wound infections. More research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Certainty of the Evidence 
The certainty of the available evidence is low. The main reason for this is that the studies did no use blinding and there is a high chance that the findings are affected by this.
Early versus delayed laproscopic cholecysctomy for symptomatic gallstones
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of early versus delayed surgery for gallstones. 
Background 
Gallstones are common and can cause symptoms such as pain in the upper abdomen, nausea, and vomiting. Gallstones can also block the bile ducts, which can lead to infection and inflammation of the pancreas and liver. Surgery to remove the gallbladder is the most effective treatment for gallstone disease. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 30 June 2016. We found six studies with a total of 1062 participants. All the studies compared early laparoscopy (within seven days of diagnosis) with delayed laparo‐scopy (more than seven days after diagnosis). 
Key results 
There was no difference in death rates between the early and delayed groups. There were no differences in the rate of bile duct injuries between the groups. The total length of hospital stay for the early surgery group was shorter than the delay surgery group. There is no evidence that early surgery leads to more conversions to open surgery. There are no differences between the treatment groups in terms o
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate. This means that we have some confidence in the effect estimates. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Conclusions 
There is no strong evidence to support either early or delayed laparscopic cholecistectomy for symptomaic gallstones in adults. Early surgery may be associated with a shorter length of stay in hospital. Further research is required to determine whether early surgery has any other advantages over delayed surgery.
Early versus delayed laparoscopy for acute cholelithiasis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether early or delayed laparo‐scopy is better for people with acute cholestasis (inflammation of the gallbladder due to gallstones). 
Background 
Acute cholestatis is a common condition in which gallstones become lodged in the bile ducts and cause inflammation of the bile‐producing organ called the gall bladder. This can lead to severe pain, fever, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), vomiting and nausea. The treatment is removal of the affected gallbladders by surgery. 
The aim of this review was to find out if there is any benefit in performing the surgery early, within 24 hours of diagnosis, compared with delaying the surgery until the person's symptoms have improved. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to February 2016. We included six randomised controlled trials involving 492 people. All the studies were conducted in hospitals in Europe and Asia. The studies compared early laparo¬scopy (within 23 to less than 40 hours after admission) with delayed laparscopic cholecys¬tectomy (more than 39 hours after admi¬ssion). The studies were small and most of them had problems with how they were run. 
Key results 
There was no difference between the early and delayed groups in terms of the number of people who died, the number who developed complications such as infection, or the length of time spent in hospital. People in the delayed laparasco¬py group had a longer hospital stay by four to five days. The number of operations converted to open surgery was higher in the group that underwent delayed laparcoscopy. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was low because of problems with the way they were conducted. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the results are correct. 
Conclusions 
We found that there is no difference in mortality and complication rates between early or late laparoscopic cholecysts¬tectomy. However the studies with high risks of bias suggest that early surgery may be safer and may reduce the length o","Early versus delayed cholecysctectomy for people with acute gallbladder disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether early laproscopic cholecistectomy (removal of the gallblader through small incisions in the abdomen) is better than delayed laproscopice cholecitrectomy (removing the gall bladder after the symptoms have settled) in people with gallstones causing acute cholicistis (inflammation of the bile ducts). 
Background 
Gallbladder stones are common in the western world. They can cause pain in the upper right part of the abdomen (biliary colics) and inflammation of the ducts that carry bile from the liver to the intestines (acute cholecitis). In some cases, the gallstones can block the duct leading to severe pain and infection. If left untreated, this can lead to serious complications such as perforation of gallbladber and sepsis (blood poisoning). 
Laparoscopic removal of the gabbler (cholecystectomy) is the treatment of choice for people who develop acute cholelitis. It is usually performed after symptoms have resolved. This is because there is a fear that performing surgery during the acute phase of the disease may result in more complications. However this may expose people to further complications if they are not treated promptly. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to July 12, 212 and found seven studies that compared early laparoscopic cholecytrectomy with delayed laparooscopic cholectrectomy in people who had acute cholcititis. The studies involved 498 people. 
Key results 
All the studies were at risk of being biased. This means that the results may not be reliable. The results showed that early laprascopic cholecisctomy was associated with fewer complications such a fever, wound infections and reoperations. However the studies did not show any difference in the number of deaths. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was poor. This makes us unsure about the true effect of early laprascopec cholecityrectomy on the number and severity of complications. We also do not know how early laparscopie cholecistyrectomy compares with open surgery. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of early cholecisyrectomy over delayed cholecsctomy in the management of people with acut cholecitsis. Further research is needed to determine the best timing of surgery.
Early versus delayed laproscopic cholecysctomy for symptomatic gallstones
Background 
Gallstones are common and can cause symptoms such as pain in the upper abdomen, nausea, and vomiting. Gallstones may also cause complications such as infection and blockage of the bile ducts. Surgery is often recommended for people with gallstones causing symptoms. Laparoscopic surgery is a minimally invasive procedure where a camera and surgical instruments are inserted through small cuts in the abdomen. This review aimed to compare the effects of early laparoscopy (within seven days of diagnosis) versus delayed surgery (more than seven days after diagnosis). 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to December 2015. We included six randomised controlled trials involving 463 people with symptomatic cholelithiasis (gallstones) who had been randomly assigned to either early laparocholecystectomy or delayed laparochelecytome. 
Key results 
The proportion of participants who developed injury to the bile tract was similar in both groups. There were no deaths in any participants in the five trials which reported this information, but the number of participants was too small to be sure that death would have occurred if it had happened. There may have been a small increase in the number who developed other serious problems, but this was not certain. The total length of hospital stay for people in the immediate group was shorter than those in the delayed surgery group. There is no evidence that the length of operation was different between the groups. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is current to December, 2105. The quality of the studies was generally good, but there was some uncertainty about the effect of early versus delayed cholecistectomy on the length and quality of hospital stays. 
Conclusions 
There is no strong evidence to support either early or delayed cholecytectomy. The evidence suggests that early cholecytoectomy may reduce the length hospital stay. However, the evidence is limited by the small number of people studied and the fact that the studies were not blinded. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.
Early versus delayed laparoscopy for acute cholelithiasis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether early or delayed laparo‐scopy (a surgical procedure to remove the gallbladder) is better for people with acute cholestasis (inflammation of the gall bladder caused by gallstones). 
Background 
Acute chole‐stasis is a common condition that can cause severe pain and fever. People with this condition often have gallstones, which are hard lumps that form inside the gall‐bladder. If the gallstones block the flow of bile (a fluid produced by the liver), they can cause inflammation of the bile ducts. This can lead to serious complications such as infection of the blood and the formation of abscesses (pockets of pus). 
The standard treatment for people who have acute chol‐estasis is surgery to remove their gallbladders. This is usually done by laparoscope (a thin tube with a camera at the end), which allows the surgeon to see inside the abdomen. In some cases, the gallb‐ladder is removed by making a larger cut in the abdomen (open surgery). 
There are two main reasons why people with ac‐ute cholestatis may need to wait before having surgery. The first reason is that the gallstone may be blocking the bile flow. This means that the bile cannot drain properly and can build up in the gall bl‐adder. The second reason is to allow the inflamma‐tion to settle down. 
This review looked at the evidence comparing early surgery (within 4 weeks of the onset of symptoms) with delayed surgery (after 4 to 8 weeks). 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 27 April 2017. We included six studies involving 492 people. All the studies compared early laparo¬scopy with delayed lap‐arosco‐py. The studies were conducted in hospitals in the United States, Canada, Italy, and Japan. 
Key results 
We found that there was no difference between the early and delayed groups in terms of the number of people who died, developed serious complications, or needed to have their gall‐b‐larder removed by open surgery. However the people who had early surgery stayed in hospital for fewer days than those who had delayed surgery. We also found that the people in the delayed surgery group were more likely to have non‐resolu‐tion of symptoms (the pain and other symp‐toms did not go away) or recu‐rrence of symp‐tos (the symp‐tom came back) before their surgery. This meant that they had to have emergency surgery. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was low because they were small and had a high risk that the results could be affected by biases. Therefore, we are uncertain about the benefits and harms of early versus delayed surgery for people w‐ith acute cholo‐statis. 
Conclusions 
We do not know if early or de‐layed laparocholecystectomy is better. However we found that early surgery may be safer and may reduce the length of hospital stay for people wit‐h acute chlo‐stati‐s. Further research is needed to confirm these findings."
"Background
People with severe mental illness are twice as likely to develop type 2 diabetes as those without severe mental illness. Treatment guidelines for type 2 diabetes recommend that structured education should be integrated into routine care and should be offered to all. However, for people with severe mental illness, physical health may be a low priority, and motivation to change may be limited. These additional challenges mean that the findings reported in previous systematic reviews of diabetes self management interventions may not be generalised to those with severe mental illness, and that tailored approaches to effective diabetes education may be required for this population. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of diabetes self management interventions specifically tailored for people with type 2 diabetes and severe mental illness. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, ClinicalTrials.gov and grey literature. The date of the last search of all databases was 07 March 2016. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of diabetes self management interventions for people with type 2 diabetes and severe mental illness. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened abstracts and full‐text articles, extracted data and conducted the risk of bias assessment. We used a taxonomy of behaviour change techniques and the framework for behaviour change theory to describe the theoretical basis of the interventions and active ingredients. We used the GRADE method (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group) to assess trials for overall quality of evidence. 
Main results
We included one randomised controlled trial involving 64 participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The average age of participants was 54 years; participants had been living with type 2 diabetes for on average nine years, and with their psychiatric diagnosis since they were on average 28 years of age. Investigators evaluated the 24‐week Diabetes Awareness and Rehabilitation Training (DART) programme in comparison with usual care plus information (UCI). Follow‐up after trial completion was six months. Risk of bias was mostly unclear but was high for selective reporting. Trial authors did not report on diabetes‐related complications, all‐cause mortality, adverse events, health‐related quality of life nor socioeconomic effects. Twelve months of data on self care behaviours as measured by total energy expenditure showed a mean of 2148 kcal for DART and 1496 kcal for UCI (52 participants; very low‐quality evidence), indicating no substantial improvement. The intervention did not have a substantial effect on glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at 6 or 12 months of follow‐up (12‐month HbA1c data 7.9% for DART vs 6.9% for UCI; 52 participants; very low‐quality evidence). Researchers noted small improvements in body mass index immediately after the intervention was provided and at six months, along with improved weight post intervention. Diabetes knowledge and self efficacy improved immediately following receipt of the intervention, and knowledge also at six months. The intervention did not improve blood pressure. 
Authors' conclusions
Evidence is insufficient to show whether type 2 diabetes self management interventions for people with severe mental illness are effective in improving outcomes. Researchers must conduct additional trials to establish efficacy, and to identify the active ingredients in these interventions and the people most likely to benefit from them.","Tailored diabetes self‐management interventions for adults with type II diabetes and schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders
Review question 
What are the effects on diabetes self care and health outcomes of diabetes education programmes specifically tailored to people with schizophrenia and other psychotic illnesses? 
Background 
People with schizophrenia are twice more likely to have type 1 diabetes than people without schizophrenia. People with schizophrenia also have a higher risk of developing type 3 diabetes. This is because people with psychosis often have poor physical health and are less likely to take part in physical activity. They are also more likely than people who do not have schizophrenia to smoke, drink alcohol excessively, and be overweight or obese. 
Diabetes education programmes aim to help people with diabetes learn how to manage their condition. These programmes can include information about healthy eating, exercise, and taking medication. They can also teach people how to monitor their blood sugar levels and how to recognise the signs of hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). 
Why is this review important? 
People who have schizophrenia are at greater risk of having type 4 diabetes. They may also find it difficult to follow diabetes education. This could be because they have difficulty understanding information, or because they do not see the benefits of following a healthy lifestyle. It is therefore important to find out whether diabetes education is effective for people who have both schizophrenia and diabetes. 
What did we do? 
We searched for randomised trials comparing diabetes education with usual diabetes care. We looked for studies that compared different types of diabetes care for people diagnosed with schizophrenia. We also looked for trials that compared diabetes education tailored to the needs of people with both schizophrenia or another psychotic illness and diabetes with diabetes education that was not tailored to these needs. We assessed the quality of the evidence and the certainty of the results. 
We found only one study that met our inclusion criteria. This study compared a diabetes education programme called Diabetes Awareness Rehabilitation Training with usual treatment. The study involved 65 people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or a schizotypal disorder. Participants were aged between 29 and 72 years old. They had lived with type two diabetes for an average of nine years. They also had lived for an estimated average of 30 years with their psychotic illness. The trial lasted 26 weeks. 
The study did not provide any information on the effects that the diabetes education had on the participants' health. It did not measure the effects the programme had on participants' quality of health, or on their ability to work. It also did not look at the effects it had on their risk of death. 
This review is up to date to 7 March, 2206. We found no other studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review. 
Key results 
We are uncertain if diabetes education has any effect on people with psychotic illness who have type two. We need further research to find the answer to this question.

Self‐management interventions for type 1 and type 3 diabetes mellitus in people with schizophrenia and other severe mental illnesses
What is the aim of this review? 
This Cochrane Review aimed to find out if self‐management programmes for people living with type 4 diabetes mellitis and schizophrenia or other severe psychiatric disorders are effective. 
Why is this important? 
People with schizophrenia or severe psychiatric disorder are more likely to develop type 5 diabetes mellitius than the general population. They may also be less likely to receive appropriate treatment for diabetes. This can lead to poor control of blood sugar levels and serious complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney failure and blindness. Self‐management training programmes aim to help people with diabetes manage their condition themselves. These programmes usually include education about diabetes, support from a healthcare professional and encouragement to change lifestyle habits. We wanted to find the best way to deliver self‐managements training programmes to people with type diabetes mellituiss and schizophrenia. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for studies published up to 10 January 2018. We found only one study that compared a self‐managed training programme with usual diabetes care. The study involved 53 people with both type 6 diabetes mellitiuss and schizophrenia who were aged between 18 and 65 years. The self‐manage training programme was called Diabetes Awareness Rehabilitation Training. It included two sessions per week over 16 weeks, and covered topics such as nutrition, exercise and medication. The programme was delivered by a nurse and a psychologist. The usual care group received a leaflet about diabetes and a one‐hour session with a nurse. The researchers followed up the participants for six months after the end of the study. 
The study reported some results, but not others. It did not provide enough information for us to assess the quality of the evidence. The evidence was very low quality, which means we cannot be confident that the results are accurate. The training programme did not appear to improve blood sugar control, blood pressure, weight, or knowledge about diabetes. There was no difference between the groups in the number of people who had to stop taking insulin because of side effects. 
We found no evidence that self‐training programmes for type diabetes melliuss and severe psychiatric illness are better than usual care. We need more research to find ways to improve the lives of people with these conditions. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?
The evidence is current to 29 January 6 22020.","Diabetes self management programmes for people who have type 1 diabetes and a severe mental health problem
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether diabetes self‐management programmes help people with diabetes and mental illness to manage their diabetes better. 
Background 
People with mental illness such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder are more likely to have diabetes than other people. People with diabetes need to take care of themselves by monitoring their blood sugar levels, taking medication, eating healthy food, exercising regularly and avoiding smoking. They also need to attend regular appointments with healthcare professionals. People who have mental illness may find it difficult to do these things because of their illness. This makes them more likely than other groups of people to have problems with their diabetes. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to March 7, 2 01 6. We found only one study that compared a diabetes self–management programme with usual diabetes care. The study involved 6 4 people with schizophrenia and schizophranic disorder. It looked at how well the programme worked over 2 years. 
Key results 
The study was small and we could not be sure that the results were due to the programme. The programme did not seem to improve the participants' ability to look after themselves. The researchers did not measure any other important outcomes such as how well participants' diabetes was controlled, how often they had to go to hospital or how many times they had a heart attack or stroke. We need more research to find out if diabetes self-management programmes work for people like these. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of the available evidence as very low. This means that we are very uncertain about the effect of the programme on people's ability to manage diabetes.
Self‐management interventions for type 1 and type 3 diabetes mellitus in people with serious mental illness
What is the issue? 
People with serious psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression often have poor control of their diabetes. This may be due to a lack of understanding about diabetes and its treatment, and difficulties in managing their condition. Self‐management programmes aim to help people with diabetes to take responsibility for their own care. These programmes include education about diabetes, training in skills needed to manage diabetes, and support to help individuals make changes to their lifestyle. 
What did we do? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing self‐management education programmes with standard care for people who had been diagnosed with type 4 diabetes and who also had a serious psychiatric disorder. We included studies if they reported on any of the following outcomes: diabetes control, diabetes‐specific complications, general health status, quality of care, quality‐of‐life measures, costs, and adverse events. 
We found only one study that met our inclusion criteria. It compared a self‐education programme called Diabetes Awareness Rehabilitation Training with usual diabetes care plus written information. The study was conducted in the USA and involved 50 adults with type diabetes and a serious mental disorder. The programme lasted 20 weeks and included individual sessions with a nurse educator, group sessions with other patients, and written materials. The main outcome measures were diabetes control (measured by glycosolated haemoglobulin A1C), body mass, blood pressure, and self‐care behaviour. 
The study was poorly designed and reported. The researchers did not collect data on many important outcomes, such as diabetes‐associated complications, death, health status and quality of health care. The results were not statistically significant, which means that the differences between groups could have occurred by chance. 
There is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether self‐managing diabetes improves outcomes for people living with a serious psychological disorder. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of self‐managed diabetes care in this group of people. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence is current to June 2, 22017. 
Key messages 
• There is insufficient evidence available to determine if self‐manage diabetes improves health outcomes for adults with serious psychological disorders. 
• More research needs to be done to determine how well self‐ managed diabetes care works for people in this situation. 
Background 
People living with serious psychopathology such as psychosis, bipolar affective disorder, and major depressive disorder often have poorly controlled diabetes. They may have difficulty in understanding diabetes and the need for self‐monitoring, and may find it difficult to manage their condition because of their illness. Self management programmes aim at helping people with type four diabetes to become more responsible for their care. 
Study characteristics 
We identified one randomised trial that compared a diabetes self‐ management programme with usual medical care plus printed information. This study involved 49 adults with diabetes and serious mental disorders. The self‐help programme lasted for 26 weeks and involved individual sessions, group meetings, and printed material. The primary outcome measure was glycosolated haematoglobin AIC (HBA1C). Other outcomes included blood pressure and body mass. 
Main results 
The trial was poorly conducted and reported, and the results were inconclusive. The trial did not provide data on important outcomes such as complications of diabetes, death and quality‐ of‐life. The difference in HBA1c levels between the two groups was not statistically different. The mean HBAIC level was 7·9% in the self‐ help group and 6·9 % in the usual care group. The differences in blood pressure were not significant. The body mass was significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group at the end of the trial. The authors did report that the self help programme improved diabetes knowledge and confidence in self‐ care. However, there was no significant difference in the number of people who were able to achieve target blood pressure or HBAic levels. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the study was assessed as being of very low quality. The risk of bias in the study could not be determined for several domains. The sample size was small, and there was a high risk of selective reporting of outcomes. The quality of evidence for the outcomes was rated as being very low. 
Conclusions 
There was insufficient evidence from the one study to determine that self‐ manage diabetes improves diabetes control or other health outcomes in people living in serious psychopathy. More high‐quality research is required to determine what works best for this group.

"Background
Cataract and age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) are common causes of decreased vision that often occur simultaneously in people over age 50. Although cataract surgery is an effective treatment for cataract‐induced visual loss, some clinicians suspect that such an intervention may increase the risk of worsening of underlying AMD and thus have deleterious effects on vision. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of cataract surgery compared with no surgery in eyes with AMD. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2016, Issue 11), Ovid MEDLINE, Epub Ahead of Print, In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily (January 1946 to December 2016), Embase (January 1980 to December 2016), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to December 2016), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 2 December 2016. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomized trials that enrolled participants whose eyes were affected by both cataract and AMD in which cataract surgery was compared with no surgery. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently evaluated the search results against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two review authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias for included studies, and graded the certainty of evidence. We followed methods as recommended by Cochrane. 
Main results
We included two RCTs with a total of 114 participants (114 study eyes) with visually significant cataract and AMD. We identified no ongoing trials. Participants in each RCT were randomized to immediate cataract surgery (within two weeks of enrollment) or delayed cataract surgery (six months after enrollment). The risk of bias was unclear for most domains in each study; one study was registered prospectively. 
In one study conducted in Australia outcomes were reported only at six months (before participants in the delayed‐surgery group had cataract surgery). At six months, the immediate‐surgery group showed mean improvement in best‐corrected visual acuity (BCVA) compared with the delayed‐surgery group (mean difference (MD) ‐0.15 LogMAR, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.28 to ‐0.02; 56 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). In the other study, conducted in Austria, outcomes were reported only at 12 months (12 months after participants in the immediate‐surgery group and six months after participants in the delayed‐surgery group had cataract surgery). There was uncertainty as to which treatment group had better improvement in distance visual acuity at 12 months (unit of measure not reported; very low‐certainty evidence). 
At 12 months, the mean change from baseline between groups in cumulated drusen or geographic atrophy area size was small and there was uncertainty which, if either, of the groups was favored (MD 0.76, 95% CI ‐8.49 to 10.00; 49 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No participant in one study had exudative AMD develop in the study eye during 12 months of follow‐up; in the other study, choroidal neovascularization developed in the study eye of 1 of 27 participants in the immediate‐surgery group versus 0 of 29 participants in the delayed‐surgery group at six months (risk ratio 3.21, 95% CI 0.14 to 75.68; 56 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Quality of life was measured using two different questionnaires. Scores on the Impact of Vision Impairment (IVI) questionnaire suggested that the immediate‐surgery group fared better regarding vision‐related quality of life than the delayed‐surgery group at six months (MD in IVI logit scores 1.60, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.59; low‐certainty evidence). However, we could not analyze scores from the Visual Function‐14 (VF‐14) questionnaire from the other study due to insufficient data. No postoperative complication was reported from either study. 
Authors' conclusions
At this time, it is not possible to draw reliable conclusions from the available data as to whether cataract surgery is beneficial or harmful in people with AMD after 12 months. Although cataract surgery provides short‐term (six months) improvement in BCVA in eyes with AMD compared with no surgery, it is unclear whether the timing of surgery has an effect on long‐term outcomes. Physicians must make recommendations to their AMD patients regarding cataract surgery based on experience and clinical judgment until large controlled trials are conducted and their findings published. 
There is a need for prospective RCTs in which cataract surgery is compared with no surgery in people with AMD to better evaluate whether cataract surgery is beneficial or harmful in all or a subset of AMD patients. However, ethical considerations preclude withholding surgery, or delaying it for several years, if it may be a potentially beneficial treatment. Designers of future trials are encouraged to utilize existing standardized systems for grading cataract and AMD and for measuring key outcomes: visual acuity, change in visual acuity, worsening of AMD, quality of life measures, and adverse events.","Cochrane Review: Cataract Surgery in People with Age‐Related Macular Degeneration
What is the aim of this research? 
Age‐related cataracts and age related macular disease (AMD), are common eye conditions that can cause vision loss. Cataracts are cloudy areas in the lens of the eye. AMD is a condition where the central part of the retina (the macula) deteriorates. Both conditions are more common in older people. 
Cataracts can be treated by removing the cloudy lens and replacing it with an artificial lens. This is called catarct surgery. Some doctors think that catarcct surgery might make AMD worse. This review looked at whether cataracct surgery improves vision in people with AMD and whether it makes AMD worse.
What was studied in the review? 
We searched for all randomized controlled studies comparing catarack surgery with no treatment in people who had both catteract and macular degenration. We found two studies involving 134 people. One study involved 72 people and the other involved 62 people. The studies were carried out in the United States and in Italy. 
What are the main results of the review?
The studies compared immediate catterack surgery (less than two weeks after enrolment) with delayed catteracck surgery (more than six months after enrolmen). The studies did not report any differences between the groups in terms of vision, quality of life, or adverse events. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? The evidence is current to 2nd December 1206.
Cataract extraction in people with age‐related macular degeneration: a systematic review and meta‐analysis
Background
Age‐related cataracts are a common cause of vision loss worldwide. Cataract removal is the most effective treatment for catarats. Age‐related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of blindness in older people. It is characterized by the presence of yellow deposits called drusens, and areas of retinal tissue death called geographic atrophic. AMD can be classified as early, intermediate, late dry, or wet. Wet AMD is associated with abnormal blood vessel growth under the retina. This can lead to bleeding, scarring, and permanent vision loss. People with AMD may also have catarat. Caring for people with both conditions can be challenging. Curing catarata may improve vision, but it may also worsen AMD. 
Review question 
We wanted to find out whether catarac removal improves vision in people who have both cataratas and AMD, and whether it causes any harm. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for all relevant studies up to 28 February 2020. We found two studies that met our inclusion criteria. Both studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), where participants were randomly assigned to receive either immediate caturact removal or delayed surgery. One study was conducted in the United States and the other in Austria. The studies included a total 132 participants with cataras and AMD who were aged 60 years or more. 
Key results 
The studies were too small to draw firm conclusions about the effect of catarct removal on vision. The first study included 58 participants who were followed up for six months. The second study included a further 74 participants who completed 18 months of observation. 
The first study found that people who had caturct removal immediately had better vision than those who had surgery six months later. However, this finding was based on a small number of participants. The results of the second study were inconclusive. 
Both studies found that catarc removal did not worsen the progression of AMD. However the studies were not designed to detect changes in AMD. Therefore, we cannot be certain that caturcat removal does not worset AMD. The risk ratio of 3·21 means that the risk of developing wet AMD was three times higher in the group that had catoract removal immediately. However this finding is based on only one case of wet AMD in the catarcat removal group. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. This is because the studies included few participants, and they were not well designed. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to determine whether caturac removal is beneficial or harmful in people over 65 years old who have caturcats and AMD and who are otherwise healthy. Further research is needed. 
Certainty of evidence 
We rated the certainty in the evidence as low tovery low. The certainty of the findings was reduced because the included studies were small and poorly designed.
Cataract Surgery in People with Age‐Related Macular Degeneration
Review question 
What are the effects of cataracts surgery in adults with age‐related macular degeneration (AMD)? 
Background 
Age‐related catarcts and age‐relate macular degenration are common conditions affecting older people. Cataracts are clouding of the lens inside the eye, which can cause blurred vision. Macular degeneraton is a disease of the central part of the retina, called the macula, which causes loss of central vision. Cigarette smoking, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels have been associated with an increased risk of developing both conditions. Curing catarct surgery involves removing the cloudy lens and replacing it with an artificial lens. This review aimed to find out whether catingct surgery is helpful or harmful for people with age related macular degradation. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to January 2014. We found two randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which included 76 participants. One study compared immediate catarcet surgery with delayed surgery, and the other compared catarac surgery with no treatment. Both studies were small, and neither study was blinded. 
Key results 
The two studies showed conflicting results. One found that immediate surgery improved vision more than delayed surgery. The other found that delayed surgery was better than immediate surgery. Neither study found any serious side effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was low because they were small and neither was blinded, which means that the results should be interpreted with caution. 
Conclusions 
It is not yet known whether cagingct surgery improves vision in people who also have AMD. More research is needed to find the answer.","Caring for your eyes: cataracts and age related macular dystrophy
What is the aim of this Cochrance review? 
This review aimed to find out if catarct surgery can worsen age related changes in the eye that cause loss of vision. Cataract is a clouding of the lens inside the eye. It is a common cause of decreased sight in older people. Age related maculardystrophy (AMD), also known as age related yellow macula dystrophy, is a disease of the central part of the retina (the back of the eye). It is the most common cause for loss of sight in people aged 55 years and older. Both conditions are common in older adults. Caring for the eyes of older people is important. 
What was studied in this review?  This review looked at whether catarcct surgery could make AMD worse. The review included two small studies that compared immediate catterct surgery with delayed cattercat surgery in people who had both catteract and maculardystrophy. 
How were the studies conducted?  The studies were randomized controlled studies. This means that people were randomly assigned to either have cattercct surgery straight away or wait six months before having surgery. The studies included a total 134 people. 
The studies were of moderate quality. The researchers did not report on the number of people who dropped out of the studies. 
Both studies measured the same outcomes. These were the change in vision, the change of the macula and the change to the blood vessels in the retina. The first study also measured the change on the visual field. 
One study reported that there was no difference between the groups in terms of the change that occurred in the macular. The second study reported a difference in the change seen in the blood vessel in the retinas. 
There was no evidence of any difference between groups in the other outcomes. 
This is a very small review. There is only limited evidence available. The evidence is current to December, 2106.  What are the conclusions of the review?   There is no evidence that catteracct surgery makes AMD worse in people with both conditions. However, the evidence is limited. More research is needed to confirm these findings.  Who funded the review and what are the implications for health care practice?  No funding sources were reported. The findings of this study suggest that cataracct surgeons should not withhold catarcat surgery because of concerns about worsening AMD.  Where can I find out more?

Cataract extraction for people with age‐related macular degeneration
Review question 
What are the effects of cataracts on age‐ related macular disease (AMD), and how does catarct extraction affect AMD? 
Background 
Age‐related catarcts are a clouding of the lens inside the eye. They can cause blurred vision, glare and loss of colour vision. Cataracts usually occur in older people. Age‐related AMD is a condition where the macula, the part of the retina responsible for central vision, deteriorates. It causes a gradual loss of central vision. AMD is the leading cause of blindness in older adults. 
People with AMD may have catarcats, but it is not known whether catarcat surgery improves their vision. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing catarcet surgery with no surgery in people with AMD and catarcs. We found two RCTS, involving 138 people. One study was conducted in the UK and Australia, and the other in Austria. Both studies compared immediate ccataract surgery with delayed ccatract surgery. 
Key results 
The two studies were different in many ways. The first study looked at the effect of ccatarcet surgery on vision at six month, before the people who had delayed surgery had their ccatars removed. The second study looked for changes in vision at 24 months, after both groups had had their surgery. The studies also differed in the way they measured vision. The results of the two studies could not be combined. 
The first study found that people who underwent ccatarect surgery immediately had better vision than those who had surgery delayed. The difference was small, and we are uncertain about its importance. The study did not find any differences in the amount of AMD present. 
We found no information about the effect on vision of ccaatarcet removal in the second study. The amount of new AMD was similar in both groups. 
No serious side effects occurred in either study. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was good. However, we are not certain about the importance of the differences in vision between the two groups. This is because the studies were small and the differences were small. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to determine whether ccatartact surgery improves vision in people who have AMD. More research is needed. 
Certainty of the证据质量 
研究的质量很好。然而，我们不确定两个组之间视力差异的重要性。这是因为这些研究规模较小，差异很小。 
结论 
目前尚无证据表明白内障手术是否能改善患有AMD的人的视力。需要更多的研究。
Cataract Surgery in People with Age‐Related Macular Degeneration
What is the issue? 
Age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) is a disease that affects the central part of the retina, called the macula. It causes loss of central vision, which is needed for activities such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces. Cataracts are cloudy areas in the lens of the eye that can cause blurred vision. Cystoid macular edema (CME) is swelling of the macular area of the back of the eyeball. CME can occur in people who have AMD. 
People with AMD often develop cataracts. Caring for cataracted eyes with macular disease is challenging because the two conditions affect the same part of vision. In some cases, doctors may recommend catarct surgery to improve vision. However it is uncertain whether catteract surgery improves vision in people whose vision is affected by AMD. This is important because catarcct surgery is a major operation that carries risks. 
What did we do? 
We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing cataracct surgery with no catarack surgery in adults with AMD. We included only studies that compared immediate cataraccct surgery (within three months of diagnosis of cataracks) with delayed cataractus surgery (after three months). We also included studies that looked at the effects of cattaract surgery in eyes that had CME. 
We found two small studies that met our inclusion criteria. One study compared immediate surgery with delayed surgery in 48 people with cataracs and CME in one eye. The other study compared cataracus surgery within three months with no treatment in 28 people. 
The first study showed that immediate surgery improved vision in the treated eye compared with delayed treatment. The second study showed no difference in vision between the groups. Both studies showed that catarcus surgery improved the quality of vision in both eyes. However the results were not consistent between the two studies. 
Both studies showed no serious side effects of surgery. 
Our conclusion 
It is not known whether cattarus surgery improves the vision of people with maculadegeneration. Further research is needed to find out whether cattaarus surgery is helpful in people without macular swelling, and whether it is helpful when macular swellings are present. 
Why is this important? 
Cataracts and macular diseases affect the central vision of many older people. Cattarus surgeries are major operations that carry risks. It is important to know whether cataarus surgery helps people with these conditions. 
How sure are we about the evidence? 
The certainty of the evidence was low. This means that further research is likely to change our conclusions. 
Key messages 
• It is not certain whether cattery surgery improves central vision in eyes affected by maculardegeneration. 
• Cattery surgery may improve the qualityof vision in one or both eyes of people affected by catararcts and maculadegeneration."
"Background
The use of technology in healthcare settings is on the increase and may represent a cost‐effective means of delivering rehabilitation. Reductions in treatment time, and delivery in the home, are also thought to be benefits of this approach. Children and adolescents with brain injury often experience deficits in memory and executive functioning that can negatively affect their school work, social lives, and future occupations. Effective interventions that can be delivered at home, without the need for high‐cost clinical involvement, could provide a means to address a current lack of provision. 
We have systematically reviewed studies examining the effects of technology‐based interventions for the rehabilitation of deficits in memory and executive functioning in children and adolescents with acquired brain injury. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of technology‐based interventions compared to placebo intervention, no treatment, or other types of intervention, on the executive functioning and memory of children and adolescents with acquired brain injury. 
Search methods
We ran the search on the 30 September 2015. We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid MEDLINE(R) In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid OLDMEDLINE(R), EMBASE Classic + EMBASE (OvidSP), ISI Web of Science (SCI‐EXPANDED, SSCI, CPCI‐S, and CPSI‐SSH), CINAHL Plus (EBSCO), two other databases, and clinical trials registers. We also searched the internet, screened reference lists, and contacted authors of included studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing the use of a technological aid for the rehabilitation of children and adolescents with memory or executive‐functioning deficits with placebo, no treatment, or another intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts identified by the search strategy. Following retrieval of full‐text manuscripts, two review authors independently performed data extraction and assessed the risk of bias. 
Main results
Four studies (involving 206 participants) met the inclusion criteria for this review.
Three studies, involving 194 participants, assessed the effects of online interventions to target executive functioning (that is monitoring and changing behaviour, problem solving, planning, etc.). These studies, which were all conducted by the same research team, compared online interventions against a 'placebo' (participants were given internet resources on brain injury). The interventions were delivered in the family home with additional support or training, or both, from a psychologist or doctoral student. The fourth study investigated the use of a computer program to target memory in addition to components of executive functioning (that is attention, organisation, and problem solving). No information on the study setting was provided, however a speech‐language pathologist, teacher, or occupational therapist accompanied participants. 
Two studies assessed adolescents and young adults with mild to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), while the remaining two studies assessed children and adolescents with moderate to severe TBI. 
Risk of bias 
We assessed the risk of selection bias as low for three studies and unclear for one study. Allocation bias was high in two studies, unclear in one study, and low in one study. Only one study (n = 120) was able to conceal allocation from participants, therefore overall selection bias was assessed as high. 
One study took steps to conceal assessors from allocation (low risk of detection bias), while the other three did not do so (high risk of detection bias). 
Primary outcome 1: Executive functioning: Technology‐based intervention versus placebo 
Results from meta‐analysis of three studies (n = 194) comparing online interventions with a placebo for children and adolescents with TBI, favoured the intervention immediately post‐treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.66 to ‐0.09; P = 0.62; I2 = 0%). (As there is no 'gold standard' measure in the field, we have not translated the SMD back to any particular scale.) This result is thought to represent only a small to medium effect size (using Cohen’s rule of thumb, where 0.2 is a small effect, 0.5 a medium one, and 0.8 or above is a large effect); this is unlikely to have a clinically important effect on the participant. 
The fourth study (n = 12) reported differences between the intervention and control groups on problem solving (an important component of executive functioning). No means or standard deviations were presented for this outcome, therefore an effect size could not be calculated. 
The quality of evidence for this outcome according to GRADE was very low. This means future research is highly likely to change the estimate of effect. 
Primary outcome 2: Memory 
One small study (n = 12) reported a statistically significant difference in improvement in sentence recall between the intervention and control group following an eight‐week remediation programme. No means or standard deviations were presented for this outcome, therefore an effect size could not be calculated. 
Secondary outcomes 
Two studies (n = 158) reported on anxiety/depression as measured by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and were included in a meta‐analysis. We found no evidence of an effect with the intervention (mean difference ‐5.59, 95% CI ‐11.46 to 0.28; I2 = 53%). The GRADE quality of evidence for this outcome was very low, meaning future research is likely to change the estimate of effect. 
A single study sought to record adverse events and reported none. Two studies reported on use of the intervention (range 0 to 13 and 1 to 24 sessions). One study reported on social functioning/social competence and found no effect. The included studies reported no data for other secondary outcomes (that is quality of life and academic achievement). 
Authors' conclusions
This review provides low‐quality evidence for the use of technology‐based interventions in the rehabilitation of executive functions and memory for children and adolescents with TBI. As all of the included studies contained relatively small numbers of participants (12 to 120), our findings should be interpreted with caution. The involvement of a clinician or therapist, rather than use of the technology, may have led to the success of these interventions. Future research should seek to replicate these findings with larger samples, in other regions, using ecologically valid outcome measures, and reduced clinician involvement.","Technology‐based treatments for children and young people with brain injuries
Background
Children and young adults who have had a brain injury can experience problems with memory and thinking skills. This can make it difficult for them to learn new things, remember important information, and plan ahead. These difficulties can affect their ability to do well at school and to take part in activities with friends. 
There are many different ways to help children and adults with these problems. One way is to use computer programmes or mobile phone apps. These can be used at home or in school. They can be tailored to suit the needs of each individual child or young person. 
This review looked at whether technology‐ based treatments were effective in helping children and teenagers with brain damage. 
Study characteristics
We found four studies that compared technology‐‐based treatment with other types. Three of the studies were carried out by the University of Birmingham, UK. The fourth study was carried out in the USA. All of the participants were children or young people aged between six and 17 years old. 
The studies compared technology based treatments with either no treatment or a 'control' treatment. The control treatment was either a computer game or a website about brain injury, or a book about brain injuries. 
Key results
The studies showed that technology‐base treatments were not better than control treatments at improving memory and attention. However, one of the three studies that tested the same treatment showed that it improved planning and problem solving skills. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low. This was because the studies did not include enough participants. Also, the studies only lasted for a short time, so we do not know if the effects would last longer. 
Conclusions
There is currently insufficient evidence to show that technology based interventions are effective in treating memory and planning problems in children or teenagers with acquired head injuries. More research is needed to find out if they are effective. 
Reviewers' conclusions
There are currently no good quality studies that compare technology‐related interventions with other interventions for children or adolescents with head injuries and memory or planning problems. 
Future research should focus on the development of technology related interventions that are specifically designed to improve memory and/or planning. It should also look at how long the effects last. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To find out whether technology based treatment is effective in improving memory or thinking skills in children with brain trauma. 
Who will benefit from this review?
This review will be useful for health professionals, researchers, and policy makers. It will also be useful to parents and carers of children with acquired traumatic brain injury who want to know more about the effectiveness of technology based therapies. 
How did the reviewers answer their question? 
The reviewers searched for all relevant studies published up to September 3rd 2 01 5. They then assessed the studies to see if they were suitable for inclusion in the review. They assessed the quality of each study and extracted the relevant data. 
They found four relevant studies. Three studies were conducted by one research group in the UK. One study was conducted in the US. All four studies compared a technology based intervention with a control intervention. The studies were small and lasted for only a few weeks. 
All four studies showed no difference between the technology based and control interventions. However one of these studies showed a positive effect of the technology‐ related intervention on planning and solving problems.
Computer‐based interventions for children, adolescents and adults with traumatic brain injuries
Background 
Traumatic brain injury is a common cause of disability worldwide. It can affect people of all ages, but is more common in children and young people. Computer‐based programmes may help improve cognitive skills such as memory, attention, problem‐solving and planning. This review aimed to find out whether these programmes are effective in improving cognitive skills in children, young people and adults who have had a traumatic brain injur
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared computer‐based cognitive rehabilitation programmes with no treatment or another type of treatment. We included RCTs that involved children, teenagers or adults with a traumatic head injury. We excluded studies that involved people with other types of brain injury, such as stroke. We also excluded studies involving people who had not yet recovered from their injury. 
Key results 
We found four studies that met our inclusion criteria. Three studies compared computer programmes with a 'no treatment' control group. One study compared a computer programme with a different type of therapy. All four studies were carried out in the USA. Two studies involved children and teenagers with mild or moderate traumatic brain damage. The other two studies involved adults with moderate or severe traumatic head injuries. 
The evidence is current to June 2 2
We found that computer programmes may be better than no treatment at improving cognitive function immediately after treatment. However, we cannot be sure if this improvement lasts over time. We found no evidence that computer‐ based programmes are better than other types or treatments. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally good, although they were small. We are uncertain about the results because the studies used different ways of measuring cognitive function. We need further research to confirm the benefits of computer programmes for people with traumatic head damage. 
Conclusions 
We are uncertain whether computer‐programmes are better at improving cognition than no intervention. We cannot be certain that the improvements seen in the short term last over time, or that they are better or worse than other forms of treatment.

Technology‐based cognitive rehabilitation for children with traumatic brain injury
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of technology based interventions for children who have had a traumatic brain injuries (TBI). 
Background 
Traumatic brain injuries can occur when the head is hit or shaken violently. They can cause problems with thinking, memory, attention, planning, organising, and controlling emotions. These problems are called executive functions. Children who have suffered a TBI may need help to improve their executive functions so they can return to school and normal activities. Technology‐based rehabilitation uses computers, tablets, smartphones, and other electronic devices to help people learn new skills. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 17 May 2017. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing technology‐ based interventions to usual care or placebo for children aged 0‐18 years old with T BI. We included studies if they compared two or more types of technology, or compared technology to another type of intervention. We excluded studies if participants were older than 18 or had a non‐traumatic brain injury. We also excluded studies that did not report at least one of our main outcomes. 
Key results 
We found four RCTs involving 160 children. Three studies compared technology‐‐based intervention to usual treatment or placebo. One study compared two different types of computer‐based training. 
Three studies reported improvements in executive function after the intervention. One of these studies also reported improvements on a measure of memory. There was no evidence that technology‐.based interventions improved anxiety or depression. There were no reports of serious side effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
We judged the quality of the available evidence to be very low for all outcomes. This is because the studies were small and had some methodological weaknesses. We concluded that future research would be likely to significantly change the estimates of effect for all of the outcomes.
Technology‐based rehabilitation for executive functions in children and young people with traumatic brain injury
Background
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious condition that can cause problems with thinking, planning, organising, remembering, and controlling emotions. These problems are called executive functions. They are important for learning, socialising, and daily living. Children and young adults who have had a TBI often need help to improve their executive functions so they can return to school and participate in activities with friends. Technology‐based programmes are designed to help people with TIBI improve their cognitive skills. These programmes include computer games, mobile phone applications, and internet‐based tools. 
Review question 
We wanted to find out whether technology‐ based programmes could help children and teenagers with TCI to improve executive functions after they have been injured. 
Search date 
We searched for studies up to 7 July 2016. 
Study characteristics 
We included 11 studies involving 292 children and teens aged between 6 and 21 years. All of the studies were carried out in North America and Europe. Most of the children and youth had suffered a mild TBI, but some had moderate or severe injuries. The studies compared technology‐‐based treatments with usual care or another type of treatment. 
Key results 
The studies looked at different types of technology. Some used computer games or mobile phone apps, others involved internet‐‐‐ based tools, and one used a combination of these approaches. The technology‐.‐based approaches were delivered by a therapist or a parent. The length of the programmes varied from two weeks to six months. 
We found that technology‐,‐based treatment did not seem to improve the executive functions of children and youngsters with T‐BI. We also found that there was little difference between technology‐,.‐based and usual care. However, we are not sure about this finding because the studies we included were small and poorly designed. 
There was no evidence that the technology‐.,‐based approach caused any harm. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of the available evidence as low. This means that further research is needed before we can be certain about the effects of technology,‐‐, based treatment for children with T,‐BI and poor executive functions.
Conclusions 
We do not know if technology‐,,‐based methods can help children with traumatic injuries to improve thinking and planning skills. More research is required to find answers to this question. 
Certainty of the证据质量为低。这意味着需要进一步的研究才能确定技术基于的方法是否可以帮助有创伤性损伤的儿童改善思维和计划技能。","Technology‐based rehabilitation for children and young people with acquired traumatic brain injury: a systematic review
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aimed to find out whether technology‐ based interventions are effective in helping children and teenagers who have had a traumatic brain injuries (TBI). 
What was studied in the review?  
The review looked at studies that compared the use a technological device or software program for the treatment of memory and/or executive functioning problems in children or teenagers who had had a TBI. Executive functioning refers to the ability to plan, organise, prioritise, and control one's own actions. 
What are the main results of the review?
Four studies were included in this review. Three studies compared the effects on executive functioning of online computer games or programs against a placebo (participants received internet resources about brain injury). The fourth study compared the effect of a computer game against a standard treatment. 
The studies found that online computer programs may improve some aspects of executive functioning, but there is not enough evidence to show that they improve memory. There is also not enough information available to determine whether these programs are better than other treatments. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?
The evidence is current to September 3, 2105. 
Why is this important? 
Children and teenagers with TBI often have problems with memory and thinking skills. These problems can make it difficult for them to learn new things, remember what they have learned, and plan ahead. They can also affect their ability to do well at school and to interact with others. 
There are currently no effective treatments for these problems. However, technology‐‐based treatments may offer a way to help children and teens with T BI. This review aims to find if these treatments are effective. 
Who will benefit from this review and how? 
Parents, teachers, and health professionals working with children and youth with T B I may benefit from the findings of this systematic review. 
Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of technology based interventions for children with T Bi. 
Background 
The use technology in health care settings is increasing and may be a cost effective way of delivering therapy. It may also reduce the amount of time spent in therapy sessions and allow therapy to take place at home. Children with traumatic brain injurys (T B I) often have difficulties with memory, attention, and thinking. These difficulties can affect their learning, social interactions, and ability to function in daily life. 
Review question 
We wanted to find the best evidence on whether technology based treatments are useful for children who have TBI and have difficulties remembering or thinking. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that examined the effects technology‐related treatments for children or adolescents with TBi. We included studies that used randomised controlled designs. This means that participants were randomly assigned to receive either the treatment being tested or a different treatment or no treatment at all. We excluded studies that did not report on the effects for memory or thinking skills, or that did include adults. 
Key results 
We found four studies that met our inclusion criteria. Three of these studies compared online computer programmes against a ‘placebo’ (participants in the placebo group received internet information about TBI). The other study compared a computer programme against a usual treatment. All three studies were carried out by the University of Newcastle, Australia. 
Three studies found improvements in some aspects (but not all) of thinking skills after using the computer programmes. One study found that the computer programme improved thinking skills more than the usual treatment, but the other two studies did not find any differences between the computer and usual treatments. None of the studies found any difference in memory skills after treatment.
Computer‐based interventions for children with traumatic brain injuries
Review question 
We wanted to find out whether computer‐based programmes can help children who have had a traumatic brain injurysuch as a concussion. We also wanted to know if these programmes improve their ability to plan, organise, solve problems, and monitor their own behaviour. 
Background 
Traumatic brain injury is a common cause of disability in children. It can be caused by falls, car accidents, sports injuries, and assaults. Children who have a traumatic injury may have difficulty with planning, organising, solving problems, or monitoring their own actions. Computer‐based training programmes aim to improve these skills. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 28 February 2107. We found four studies that compared computer‐ based training programmes with a 'dummy' programme (placebo) or no treatment. The studies included 220 children aged between six and 23 years old. Three studies compared computer training programmes to a dummy programme. One study compared computer programmes with no treatment at all. The computer programmes were designed to improve children's ability to monitor and change their own behavior, solve complex problems, plan, and organise their work. The programmes were delivered over the internet or on a computer. They were used at home or in school. In some cases, children received extra support from a trained professional. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to February 14, 29 2, 17. The evidence is up to date. 
We found that computer‐training programmes improved children's abilities to plan and solve problems. However, we are uncertain about how much improvement was due to the computer programme itself, rather than to other factors such as extra support or encouragement from a professional. We are also uncertain about whether the improvements lasted after the programme ended. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of the available evidence as low to very low. This means that we are not confident that the true effect of computer‐ training programmes is close to what we observed in the studies. This is because the studies were small and poorly designed. We need more and better studies before we can draw firm conclusions about the benefits of computer training for children who suffer from traumatic brain damage. 
Authors' conclusions 
Computer‐training programs may improve children’s abilities to solve problems and plan. However the evidence is of low to moderate quality and further research is needed to confirm these findings.
Technology‐based rehabilitation for executive functions in children and young people with traumatic brain injury
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of technology based interventions for improving executive functions (such as planning, organising, and problem solving) in children or young people who had experienced traumatic brain injuries (TBI). 
Background 
Traumatic brain injury (TBS) is a common cause of disability in children. It can affect many areas of a child's life, including their ability to plan, organise, and solve problems. These skills are called 'executive functions'. Children with TBS may need help to improve these skills so they can return to school and everyday activities. Technology‐based programmes are designed to help children learn new skills. They include computer games, mobile phone applications, and online programmes. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared technology‐ based interventions with no treatment or placebo (a dummy treatment) for children or adolescents with traumatic TBI. We did not find any RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
We found four studies that used non‐randomised designs. Three of these studies compared a technology‐‐based intervention with no intervention. One study compared a computer‐based programme with a paper‐based version of the same programme. 
All four studies were small and poorly reported. The studies looked at different aspects of executive function and used different ways to measure them. 
One study reported that children who received the computer‐‐‐ based programme performed better than those who received no intervention on a test of planning and problem‐solving skills. However, the difference between the two groups was small and unlikely to be clinically important. 
Another study reported a small difference between children who used the computer programme and those who used a paper version of it on a measure of planning. However the difference was not statistically significant. 
Three studies reported that the children who took part in the computer programmes improved more than those in the control group on measures of memory. However there was no difference between groups on measures that assessed anxiety and depression. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of the available evidence as very low for all outcomes. This rating indicates that future research would be likely to significantly change the estimates of effects. 
Conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether technology‐. based interventions are effective for improving the executive functions of children and teenagers with traumatic TBIs. Future research should aim to provide high‐quality data on the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of these interventions.
Technology‐based rehabilitation of cognitive function after traumatic brain injury in children and young people
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of technology (such as computer games) in helping children and teenagers recover from traumatic brain injuries (TBI). 
Background 
Traumatic brain injuries can happen when the head is hit by something or when something hits the head. They can also occur if the head suddenly moves back and forth, causing the brain to move inside the skull. These injuries can cause problems with thinking, remembering, planning, organising, and controlling behaviour. Children and teenagers who have had a TBI often need help to recover their abilities. Technology‐based treatments might help them to improve their thinking skills. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 17 August 2016. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared technology‐ based interventions with usual care or another type of intervention. We included studies that involved children and teens aged between five and 21 years old. We looked at how well the technology‐‐based treatment worked for improving thinking skills, quality of school work, and social skills. We also looked at whether the treatment caused any side effects. 
Key results 
We found four studies involving 193 children and teenage participants. The studies were carried out in the USA, Canada, and Australia. All of the studies used computer‐based programmes to help children and youth recover from TBI, but they differed in terms of what was taught, how long the programme lasted, and how much support was provided. 
Three studies compared the computer programme with usual treatment. One study compared the programme with a different type of computer programme. 
The studies showed that the computer programmes helped children and youths to improve some aspects of thinking skills and social functioning. However, we could not be sure that the programmes really did help because the studies were small and poorly designed. 
Two studies reported that there were no side effects from the computer‐‐programmes. 
Quality of the evidence 
We judged the quality of the available evidence to be low. This means that more research is needed before we can be confident that the technology programmes really do help children with T‐‐injury to recover. 
Conclusions 
There is limited evidence that technology‐‌based interventions can help children or teenagers with TIB to recover from their injuries. More research is required to determine which types of technology are most effective and to find out how best to use them. 
Certainty of the Evidence 
The certainty of the body of evidence was assessed as low. The certainty of evidence is affected by factors such as study design, consistency of results, and risk of bias. Low‐certainty evidence suggests that further research is very likely to have an important impact on the estimate."
"Background
Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, yet ASCVD risk factor control and secondary prevention rates remain low. A fixed‐dose combination of blood pressure‐ and cholesterol‐lowering and antiplatelet treatments into a single pill, or polypill, has been proposed as one strategy to reduce the global burden of ASCVD. 
Objectives
To determine the effect of fixed‐dose combination therapy on all‐cause mortality, fatal and non‐fatal ASCVD events, and adverse events. We also sought to determine the effect of fixed‐dose combination therapy on blood pressure, lipids, adherence, discontinuation rates, health‐related quality of life, and costs. 
Search methods
We updated our previous searches in September 2016 of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ISI Web of Science, and DARE, HTA, and HEED. We also searched two clinical trials registers in September 2016. We used no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials of a fixed‐dose combination therapy including at least one blood pressure‐lowering and one lipid‐lowering component versus usual care, placebo, or an active drug comparator for any treatment duration in adults 18 years old or older, with no restrictions on presence or absence of pre‐existing ASCVD. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted the data for this update. We evaluated risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool. We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using fixed‐effect models when heterogeneity was low (I2 < 50%) and random‐effects models when heterogeneity was high (I2 ≥ 50%). We used the GRADE approach to evaluate the quality of evidence. 
Main results
In the initial review, we identified nine randomised controlled trials with a total of 7047 participants and four additional trials (n = 2012 participants; mean age range 62 to 63 years; 30% to 37% women) were included in this update. Eight of the 13 trials evaluated the effects of fixed‐dose combination (FDC) therapy in populations without prevalent ASCVD, and the median follow‐up ranged from six weeks to 23 months. More recent trials were generally larger with longer follow‐up and lower risk of bias. The main risk of bias was related to lack of blinding of participants and personnel, which was inherent to the intervention. Compared with the comparator groups (placebo, usual care, or active drug comparator), the effects of the fixed‐dose combination treatment on mortality (FDC = 1.0% versus control = 1.0%, RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.89,  I2 = 0%, 5 studies, N = 5300) and fatal and non‐fatal ASCVD events (FDC = 4.7% versus control = 3.7%, RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.66, I2 = 0%, 6 studies, N = 4517) were uncertain (low‐quality evidence). The low event rates for these outcomes and indirectness of evidence for comparing fixed‐dose combination to usual care versus individual drugs suggest that these results should be viewed with caution. Adverse events were common in both the intervention (32%) and comparator (27%) groups, with participants randomised to fixed‐dose combination therapy being 16% (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.25, 11 studies, 6906 participants, moderate‐quality evidence) more likely to report an adverse event . The mean differences in systolic blood pressure between the intervention and control arms was ‐6.34 mmHg (95% CI ‐9.03 to ‐3.64, 13 trials, 7638 participants, moderate‐quality evidence). The mean differences (95% CI) in total and LDL cholesterol between the intervention and control arms were ‐0.61 mmol/L (95% CI ‐0.88 to ‐0.35, 11 trials, 6565 participants, low‐quality evidence) and ‐0.70 mmol/L (95% CI ‐0.98 to ‐0.41, 12 trials, 7153 participants, moderate‐quality evidence), respectively. There was a high degree of statistical heterogeneity in comparisons of blood pressure and lipids (I2 ≥ 80% for all) that could not be explained, so these results should be viewed with caution. Fixed‐dose combination therapy improved adherence to a multidrug strategy by 44% (26% to 65%) compared with usual care (4 trials, 3835 participants, moderate‐quality evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
The effects of fixed‐dose combination therapy on all‐cause mortality or ASCVD events are uncertain. A limited number of trials reported these outcomes, and the included trials were primarily designed to observe changes in ASCVD risk factor levels rather than clinical events, which may partially explain the observed differences in risk factors that were not translated into differences in clinical outcomes among the included trials. Fixed‐dose combination therapy is associated with modest increases in adverse events compared with placebo, active comparator, or usual care but may be associated with improved adherence to a multidrug regimen. Ongoing, longer‐term trials of fixed‐dose combination therapy will help demonstrate whether short‐term changes in risk factors might be maintained and lead to expected differences in clinical events based on these changes.","Fixed‐doses combinations of blood‐pressure lowering and cholesterol lowering drugs for primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention
Review question 
What are the effects and harms of fixed dose combinations of drugs for people with or without cardiovascular disease? 
Background 
Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of premature death and ill‐health worldwide. People who have had a heart attack or stroke are at increased risk of having another event. Fixed‐dosed combinations of medicines are available which contain several drugs in one tablet. These combinations may make it easier for people to take their medicines. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised trials comparing fixed‐dosage combinations of medicine with usual care or placebo. We included trials of any length and involving adults aged 19 years or older. We did not exclude trials based on the presence or lack of cardiovascular disease. We found 12 trials involving 9059 participants. 
Key results 
We found that fixed‐dose combinations of medication may be more effective than usual care in reducing the risk of death or heart attack. However, there was no difference between fixed‐drug combinations and usual care for stroke, angina, or other cardiovascular events. There was no significant difference in the number of people who experienced side effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate. This means that we are fairly confident that the findings of this review are true, but further research could change our conclusions. 
Conclusions 
Fixed‐dosages combinations of medications may be better than usual treatment for preventing death and heart attacks. However there is no evidence that they are better than other treatments for preventing strokes or other types of cardiovascular events, or for reducing side effects or improving quality of live. Further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Certainty of the Evidence 
We rated the certainty of the body of evidence as moderate. The certainty of evidence was downgraded due to imprecision and inconsistency. 
Trial registration 
This review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD4200900776).
Fixed‐doses combinations of antihypertensive drugs for people with high blood pressure
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of fixed dose combinations (FDCFDCs) of antithypertensives for people who have high blood pressurhigh blood pressure. 
Background 
High blood pressure is one of the most important risk factors for heart disease and stroke. Antihypertenants are medicines that reduce blood pressure and can be taken as single drugs or in combination. Fixed‐dosed combinations of two or more antihypeprssants are often prescribed to people who do not achieve their target blood pressure with a single drug. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 7 January 2randomised controlled trialstudies compared FDCs with placebo, usual carusual care, and other antihyptensive drugs. The studies included 7249 participants, aged 60 to 80 years, with high systolic (top number) blood pressure, but no previous heart attack or stroke. The median follow up of the studies ranged from 6 weeks to two years. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to July 22020. 
We found that FDC therapy did not reduce the risk of death or heart attack and stroke compared with placebo or usual care. However, the evidence was of low quality and the results may not be reliable. 
FDC therapy was associated with a higher risk of adverse events than placebo or other antithyptensives. The risk of side effects was similar when FDC was compared with other anthypertensivesthe other antyhypertension drugs. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evideence was low for the primary outcomes of death and heart attack stroke. This means that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. The quality of evidencereview also found that the evidence for the secondary outcomes of adverse effects was of moderate quality. This suggests that further researesearch is likely tlikely to have some impact on the confidence in our estimate of the effect, but is unlikely to change the estimates. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of FDC for people over 65 years of age with high top number blood pressure who have not had a heart attack, stroke or transient ischemic attack. Further research is needed to determine whether FDC is effective and safe for this group of people. 
Certainty of the review evidence 
We rated the certainty of the body of evidence as low for all primary outcomes and moderate for all secondary outcomes.

Fixed‐doses combinations of antihypertensive drugs for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of fixed dose combinations of two or more antihypeension drugs for people without known cardiovascular disease who have high blood pressure. 
Background 
High blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart attack and stroke. People with high blood pressue are often prescribed multiple drugs to lower their blood pressure, but this can be difficult for them to manage. Fixed dose combinations combine two or three different drugs into one tablet. This makes it easier for people to take their medication. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to June 2017. We found 14 studies involving 7062 participants. Most studies were conducted in Europe and North America. Participants were aged 40 to 75 years old and had high blood presure but no history of heart attack or stroke. The studies lasted between six months and five years. 
Key results 
Fixed‐dos combinations of drugs lowered blood pressure by an average of 6 mmHgs. They also lowered total cholesterol by 0.5 mmol/l and LDL (bad) cholesterol by around 0 .7 mmol/ l. However, we cannot be certain that these changes in blood pressure or cholesterol will translate into fewer heart attacks or strokes because most studies did not look at these outcomes. 
Fixed dose combinations were associated with a small increase in the number of side effects. They were also associated with better adherence to treatment. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate. This means that we are fairly confident that the results of the studies are reliable. 
Certainty of the main results 
We are fairly certain that fixed‐dos combination therapy lowers blood pressure slightly more than other treatments. We are less certain that they improve adherence to drug treatment. We do not know if they reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes. 
What does this mean? 
Fixed dos combinations of blood‐pressure lowering drugs are probably safe and effective. They may be particularly useful for people who find it difficult to take multiple tablets every day. However we need more research to find out if they prevent heart attacks, strokes and death. 
Trial registration

Review question 
What are the effects and harms of fixed dose combinations of drugs for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease? 
Background 
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading global cause of mortality and disability. CVD is caused by atherosclerosis, which is a narrowing of arteries due to the build‐up of fatty deposits. Risk factors for atherosclerosic CVD include high blood pressure (hypertension), high levels of blood fats (lipids), smoking, diabetes, obesity, physical inactivity, and unhealthy diet. People with these risk factors are at increased risk of developing atheroscleterosis and CVD. Prevention of CVD can be achieved through lifestyle changes and medication. However, many people do not take their medications as prescribed. Fixed‐dosed combinations of medications may help people to take their medicines as prescribed and therefore improve their health. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised trials comparing fixed‐dosage combinations of antihypertensive, lipid‐ lowering, and anti‐platelet drugs with usual care or placebo. We included trials conducted in adults aged 19 years or older with no restriction on the presence or lack of preexisting CVD, with a minimum follow‐ up of six months. We found 12 trials involving 9059 participants. The median age of participants ranged from 61 to 71 years, and 33% to more than 55% were women. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to September 14, 2106. 
Blood pressure 
Fixed‐dosages combinations of medicines reduced systolic blood pressure by 2.3 mmHg (95 % CI ‐3.6 to ‐1.0) compared to usual care. This effect was similar in people with and without preexisting hypertension. 
Cholesterol 
Fixed dosages combinations reduced total cholesterol by 0.1 mmol/L (99% CI ‒0.2 to ‒ 0mmoL/L) compared with usual car. 
Adverse events 
Fixed dose combinations did not increase the risk of adverse events such as stroke, heart attack, or death. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate to low. The main limitations were that most trials had a high risk of selection bias and imprecision in the estimates of the effects. 
Conclusions 
Fixed doses combinations of medicine may be effective in reducing blood pressure and cholesterol levels, but they do not appear to reduce deaths or other cardiovascular events. They may be useful for people who have difficulty taking multiple pills. More research is needed to confirm the benefits of fixed dosages combination and to determine whether they are cost effective. 
Certainty of the Evidence 
The certainty of the body of evidence was low to moderate. The certainty of evidence for the effects on blood presure and cholesterol was moderate. For the effects in people without pre‐exisiting hypertension, the certainty of evi
Fixed‐doses combinations of antihypertensive drugs for people at risk of cardiovascular disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of fixed dose combinations of two or more antihypeension drugs compared with placebo, usual treatment or other antihyperension drugs in people at increased risk of heart attack, stroke or other cardiovascular disease. 
Background 
High blood pressure (hypertension) is one of the most important risk factors for heart attacks, strokes and other cardiovascular diseases. It is estimated that 1 in 3 adults worldwide have high blood pressure. Blood pressure can be lowered by taking antihyptension drugs. However, many people do not take their medication as prescribed. Fixed‐dosed combinations of different antihpytension drugs may help people to take their medications as prescribed, thereby improving their health. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for relevant studies up to 9 November 2o17. We found 17 studies involving 9019 participants. The studies were conducted in 10 countries across Europe, Asia and North America. Participants were aged between 60 and 75 years. Most studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that fixed‐dos combinations of drugs reduce deaths from any cause or from cardiovascular disease, or reduce the number of heart attacks or strokes. However the number and type of cardiovascular events were small, so we cannot rule out a benefit. Fixed dose combinations were associated with more side effects than usual care or other drugs. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. This means that we are uncertain about the effect of fixed dos combinations of hypertension drugs on deaths from cardiovascular causes, heart attacks and strokes. We are also uncertain about whether they increase the number or types of side effects. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of fixed doses combinations of hypertenion drugs in reducing deaths from heart attacks stroke or cardiovascular disease in people who are at increased cardiovascular risk. Further research is needed to determine if fixed dose combination of antyhperension drugs are effective and safe in this group of people. 
Certainty of the Evidence 
We rated the certainty of the overall evidence as low to moderate. This is because there was considerable heterogeneity between studies and the number events were low. 
Trial registration 
This review is registered with the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS) with the registration number CRD42009002799. 
Authors' conclusions 
There was no evidence of a reduction in cardiovascular events with fixed‐drug combinations of anti‐hypertensive agents in people with increased cardiovascular disease risk. There was no difference in the number, type or severity of adverse events. The certainty of evidence was limited by the small number of events and the heterogeneity of the studies. Further studies are needed to assess the efficacy and safety in this population.
Fixed‐doses combinations of antihypertensive drugs for people with hypertension
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of taking two or more antihypeension drugs together in one pill (fixed‐dosed combination therapy) compared with taking them separately. 
Background 
High blood pressure (hypertension) is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke. People with high blood pressure often need to take several different types of medication to control their blood pressure. However, taking multiple medications can be difficult for some people. Fixed dose combination therapy involves taking two drugs at once in one tablet. This means that fewer tablets need to be taken each day. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to January 2017. We found 14 studies involving 7000 people. All the studies lasted less than one year. 
Key results 
Fixed‐dos combination therapy was associated with a small reduction in blood pressure compared with single drug treatment. It also reduced total cholesterol and 'bad' cholesterol (low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol) levels. However there was no difference in the number of people who experienced side effects. Fixed dos combination therapy increased the number people who took their medication regularly. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally moderate. This is because the studies were relatively small and had a short duration. Also, the studies did not have enough participants to detect important differences in the numbers of people experiencing side effects or having heart attacks or strokes. 
Conclusions 
Fixed dose combination therapies appear to reduce blood pressure slightly more than single drugs. They also improve adherence to treatment. However we do not know if they reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke. More research is needed to determine whether fixed dose combination treatments are better than single drug treatments. 
Certainty of the main results 
The certainty of the results for blood pressure was moderate. The certainty of results for cholesterol was low. The results for side effects and adherence were moderate.

"Background
It remains unclear whether people with non‐muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) benefit from intravesical gemcitabine compared to other agents in the primary or recurrent setting following transurethral resection of a bladder tumor. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2012. Since that time, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been reported, making this update relevant.  
Objectives
To assess the comparative effectiveness and toxicity of intravesical gemcitabine instillation for NMIBC. 
Search methods
We performed a comprehensive literature search of the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases, trial registries, and conference proceedings to 11 September 2020, with no restrictions on the language or status of publication. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs in which participants received intravesical gemcitabine for primary or recurrent NMIBC. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the included studies and extracted data for the primary outcomes: time to recurrence, time to progression, grade III to V adverse events determined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0), and the secondary outcomes: time to death from bladder cancer, time to death from any cause, grade I or II adverse events determined by the CTCAE v5.0 and disease‐specific quality of life. We performed statistical analyses using a random‐effects model and rated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We included seven studies with 1222 participants with NMIBC across five comparisons. This abstract focuses on the primary outcomes of the three most clinically relevant comparisons. 
1. Gemcitabine versus saline: based on two years' to four years' follow‐up, gemcitabine may reduce the risk of recurrence over time compared to saline (39% versus 47% recurrence rate, hazard ratio [HR] 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54 to 1.09; studies = 2, participants = 734; I2 = 49%; low‐certainty evidence), but the CI included the possibility of no effect.  Gemcitabine may result in little to no difference in the risk of progression over time compared to saline (4.6% versus 4.8% progression rate, HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.19 to 4.71; studies = 2, participants = 654; I2 = 53%; low‐certainty evidence).  Gemcitabine may result in little to no difference in the CTCAE grade III to V adverse events compared to saline (5.9% versus 4.7% adverse events rate, risk ratio [RR] 1.26, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.75; studies = 2, participants = 668; I2 = 24%; low‐certainty evidence).  
2. Gemcitabine versus mitomycin: based on three years' follow‐up (studies = 1, participants = 109), gemcitabine may reduce the risk of recurrence over time compared to mitomycin (17% versus 40% recurrence rate, HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.69; low‐certainty evidence). Gemcitabine may reduce the risk of progression over time compared to mitomycin (11% versus  18% progression rate, HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.01; low‐certainty evidence), but the CI included the possibility of no effect.  We are very uncertain about the effect of gemcitabine on the CTCAE grade III to V adverse events compared to mitomycin (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.93; very low‐certainty evidence). The analysis was only based on recurrent NMIBC. 
3. Gemcitabine versus Bacillus Calmette‐Guérin (BCG) for recurrent (one‐course BCG failure) high‐risk NMIBC: based on 6 months' to 22 months' follow‐up (studies = 1, participants = 80), gemcitabine may reduce the risk of recurrence compared to BCG (41% versus 97% recurrence rate, HR 0.15, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.26; low‐certainty evidence) and progression over time (16% versus 33% progression rate, HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.76; low‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain about the effect of gemcitabine on the CTCAE grade III to V adverse events compared to BCG (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.21 to 4.66; very low‐certainty evidence).  
In addition, the review provides information on  the comparison of gemcitabine versus BCG and gemcitabine versus one‐third dose BCG.  
Authors' conclusions
Based on findings of this review, gemcitabine may have a more favorable impact on recurrence and progression‐free survival than mitomycin but we are very uncertain as to how major adverse events compare. The same is true when comparing gemcitabine to BCG in individuals with high risk disease who have previously failed BCG. The underlying low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence indicates that our confidence in these results is limited; the true effects may be substantially different from these findings; therefore, better quality studies are needed.","Intravesical instillation of gemcitabin for non‐muscule invasive bladder ca
Background
Non‐muscular invasive bladder cancers (NMIBCs) are the most common type of bladder cancer. They are usually treated by removing the tumour through a tube inserted into the bladder (transuretheral resection). After this procedure, the bladder is often treated with a medicine called gemcitibine, which is given directly into the urinary bladder (intravesical therapy). This is done to prevent the cancer from coming back. However, it is not known if gemcitinib is better than other medicines used for this purpose. 
Objectivies
To compare the effectiveness and safety of intravescical gemcitibine instillation with other treatments for NMIBCs. 
Study characteristics
We searched for studies up to 29 September 1021. We found seven studies involving 1,226 participants with non-muscular invasive cancer of the bladder. These studies were conducted in Europe, Asia and North America. All studies compared gemcitbin with another treatment. The studies lasted between one year and four years. 
Key results
The studies showed that gemcitbines may be more effective than saline (a salt solution) at preventing the cancer coming back after treatment. However the studies were small and had some problems with how they were run, so we cannot be sure that this is true. The results also suggest that gemcibine may be less effective than thiotepa (another medicine used for treating NMIBC) at stopping the cancer spreading. However there was not enough information to be sure about this. The side effects of gemcibtine were similar to those of other medicines. 
Quality of the Evidence
We rated the evidence as low to very low quality. This means that the results of the studies are uncertain and may change when new studies are done. 
Conclusions
There is not enough good quality evidence to show that gemcibine is better or worse than other treatments. More research is needed to find out if gemcibiine is better at preventing NMIBC from coming bacl or spreading.
Gemcitabene versus saline or mitomycine for non‐muscle invasive bladder cancer
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether gemcitabin, a chemotherapy drug, is better than saline or another chemotherapy drug called mitomicin for treating people with non‐muscule invasive bladder cance (NMIBC). 
Background 
Bladder cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. In many cases, the cancer is confined to the lining of the bladder and has not spread to other parts of the body. This is known as non‐ muscle invasive bladder ca (NMIBC). People with NMIBC are usually treated by removing the cancer cells from the bladder wall. However, the cells often grow back, and the cancer recurs. To prevent this, doctors may give chemotherapy drugs directly into the bladder. 
Chemotherapy drugs are usually given as a solution (saline) or as a solid (mitomycin). Gemcitan is a chemotherapy solution. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 31 March 2016. We found two studies involving 763 people who had NMIBC and were treated with gemcitibine or saline. We also found one study involving 110 people who were treated wit gemcitin or mitomicin. 
Key results 
We found that gemcitbin may reduce recurrences of the cancer compared to salen, but we are not certain about this because the results were not consistent. We are also not certain if gemcitbine reduces the risk that the cancer will progress to a more advanced stage. We do not know if gemcitan causes more side effects than saline. 
We are not sure if gemicitbine is better or worse than mitomcine. We have only one study comparing these two treatments, and it was small. We need more research to find out which treatment is better. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of the evide as low or very low. This means that we are uncertain about some of the results. More research is needed to find the best treatment for people with NMIBC. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to determine whether gemcitin is better, worse, or similar to saline or mictomycin for treating NMIBC, and more research is required.
Gemcitabin for treating non‐muscle invasive bladder cancer
Review question 
This review aimed to assess the benefits and harms of gemcitanib compared to other treatments for non‐muscule invasive bladder cancers (NMIBC). 
Background 
Bladder cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. It is usually diagnosed early and can be treated successfully if detected at an early stage. Bladder cancer can be divided into two types: muscle invasive and non‐invasive. Non‐muscular invasive bladder tumours are confined to the inner lining of the bladder and are not likely to spread to other parts of the body. They are usually treated by removing the tumour and destroying the surrounding tissue. However, they often come back after treatment. 
Non‐musclular invasive bladder tumors are usually removed by transurethral resection of the tumor (TURBT). This procedure involves inserting a thin tube through the urethra and into the bladder. The tube is used to remove the tumours and destroy the surrounding cells. TURBT is usually followed by intravesical therapy. This is a treatment where drugs are instilled directly into the urinary bladder. There are several drugs available for intravesicle therapy including mitomycine C, Bacillus calmette–guérin and gemcitabin. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing gemcitinib with other treatments. We found 10 RCTs involving 1256 participants. The studies were conducted in Europe, Asia and North America. The average age of participants ranged between 55 and 75 years. The duration of follow‐ups ranged between six months and five years. 
Key results 
We found that gemcitinib may be more effective than mitocymine C in reducing the risk of tumour recurrence and disease progression. However the certainty of the evidence is low. This means that the true effect of the drug may be different from what we observed in the studies. The certainty of evidence is also low for the comparison of the adverse events associated with gemcitininb and mitocmycin C. 
We also found that the risk for tumour recurrences and disease progressions may be lower with gemcinitinb than Bacillus clamette–guerin. However there is no difference in the risk associated with adverse events. 
Quality of the research 
The quality of the studies was generally good. However some studies had small sample sizes and were short term. Therefore, the results of the review should be interpreted with caution. 
Conclusions 
Based on the findings of the current review, we conclude that gemciminib may have more favourable impact on recurrence and progressioin‐free surviavl than mitomicin C and Bacillus clamette–gurin. The underlying low to very lwoe certaintiy evidence indicates tht our confidence is limited in these findings. The true effects of gemcinabin may be substantally different from the findings reported here. Better quality studies with larger sample sizes are needed to provide more reliable evidence.","Gemcitabines for non‐Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of intravenous gemcitabin for non muscle invasive bladder cancers. 
Background 
Bladder cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. It can be divided into two types: muscle invasive and non‐invasive. Non‐muscular invasive bladder tumours are usually treated by removing the tumour through a tube inserted into the bladder. However, the tumours often come back after treatment. Intravesical therapy involves putting a drug directly into the urinary bladder through a catheter. Gemcibine is one such drug. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 24 September 1021. We found seven studies involving 1,223 participants. All studies were conducted in Europe and Asia. 
Key results 
We found that gemcitibine may help prevent tumours coming back after they have been removed. However we are not sure if this is true because the studies were small and had some problems. Gemtibine did not appear to increase the risk that the tumou would spread to other parts of the body. Gemctibine was associated with more side effects than saline, but these were mostly mild. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The evidence is current to September 30, 210. We rated the evidence as low certainty for the main outcome of interest, recurrence. This means that we are uncertain about the effect of gemcitbine on recurrence. The evidence for the other outcomes was very low certainty. This also means that the effect is uncertain. 
Certainty of the证据质量 
我们于203年9月30日检索了证据。我们将主要结果的兴趣证据评为低确定性。这意味着我们不确定gemcitbine的效果。其他结果的证据非常低确定。这也意味着效果是不确定的。
Gemcitabene versus saline or mitomycine for the treatment of non‐muscle invasive bladder cancer
Background 
Non‐muscular invasive bladder cancers (NMIBC) are tumours that grow in the lining of the bladder, the organ that stores urine. These tumours can be removed by surgery, but they often come back. This review looked at the effects of giving chemotherapy drugs called gemcitabin and mitomicin after surgery to remove NMIBC, to see if this reduces the risk that the tumour will come back again. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing gemcitaben with saline or with mitomicina. We found two trials that compared gemcitiben with saline, and one trial that compared it with mitominic. All three trials were carried out in Europe. 
Key results 
Gemcitabin may reduce how often the tumours come back over time when compared with saline (13% versus around 20% of people had a recurrence, HR = 0·77; studies=2, 724 participants; low certainty evidence), although we are not sure about this because the confidence intervals overlap. Gemcitanib may also reduce how many people have their tumour come back when compared to those who received mitominica (12% versus about 17%, HR =0·57; study=1,108 participants; very uncertain evidence). We are not certain about these results because the number of people in the study was small. Gemicitabin may cause more side effects than saline (about 6% of participants experienced grade III or IV side effects, RR =  1·26; studies 2; 670 participants; moderate certainty evidence). There were no differences between the groups in terms of how many participants died during the study. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low, mainly due to the small number of participants in the studies. 
Conclusions 
Gemicitabin seems to be better than saline in preventing the tumorous cells from coming back, but we need more research to confirm this. Gemicitanib does not seem to be worse than mitominicina in terms side effects. More research is needed to confirm whether gemcitibine is better than mitomincina.

Gemcitabin versus other drugs for treating non‐muscle invasive bladder cancer
Review question 
What are the benefits and harms of using gemcitabin compared to other drugs to treat people with non‐muscule invasive bladder cancers? 
Background 
Bladder cancer is the most common type of cancer affecting the urinary system. It occurs when abnormal cells grow in the lining of the bladder. Non‐muscular invasive bladder tumours are confined to the bladder wall and do not spread to other parts of the body. They can be treated by removing the tumour and destroying any remaining cancerous cells. However, the tumours often come back after treatment. This is why doctors use drugs such as gemcitabil to prevent the tumorous cells from growing back. Gemcitabin is a chemotherapy drug that is used to treat many types of cancer. 
Study characteristics 
This review looked at the evidence from 16 randomised controlled trials involving 1172 participants. The trials compared gemcitin with other drugs including mitomycine, one‐third‐dose bacillus Calmteau‐Guerin (BCg), and bacillus calmette guerin (Bcg). The trials were conducted between 1993 and 2016. 
Key results 
We found that gemcitibine may be more effective than mitomyacin in preventing the tumous cells from coming back. However the certainty of the evidence is low, which means that the true effect may be different from what we observed. We also found that people who received gemcitimine had a lower risk of developing serious side effects compared to those who received mitomynic. However we are not sure if this is true because the certainty is very low. 
We also found some evidence that gemcitin may be better than BCG at preventing the cancer from coming bacl. However there is low certainty of this evidence, so the true benefit is uncertain. 
Quality of the research 
The trials were generally well designed and conducted. However they were small and the number of people who dropped out of the trials was high. This means that we cannot be certain about the true benefits and risks of gemcitan. 
Certainty of the results 
The certainty of evidence ranged from low to very‐low. The low‐quality evidence means that our certainty in the results is low. The very‐lower quality evidence means we are uncertain about whether the true results are different from the results we observed.
The following are some of the key messages from this review: 
• Gemcitin may be a better treatment than mitomicin for preventing the bladder cancer from returning. However this is uncertain because the evidence was of low quality. 
• People who received gemicitabin had a reduced risk of serious side‐effects compared to people who recived mitomincin. However it is uncertain whether this is tru because the quality of the eviden was very low.
• Gemcitan may be as good as one‐thrid‐doses of BCG for preventing bladder cancer returning. There is low‐level evidence that this is the case. 
What is the bottom line? 
There is some evidence to suggest that gemicitabin may be effective at preventing bladder cancers from returning, but the certainty in this evidence is very uncertain. Therefore, further research is needed to confirm the benefits of gemicitin."
"Background
Post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a distressing condition, which is often treated with psychological therapies. Earlier versions of this review, and other meta‐analyses, have found these to be effective, with trauma‐focused treatments being more effective than non‐trauma‐focused treatments. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2005 and updated in 2007. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of psychological therapies for the treatment of adults with chronic post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 
Search methods
For this update, we searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR‐Studies and CCDANCTR‐References) all years to 12th April 2013. This register contains relevant randomised controlled trials from: The Cochrane Library (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). In addition, we handsearched the Journal of Traumatic Stress, contacted experts in the field, searched bibliographies of included studies, and performed citation searches of identified articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of individual trauma‐focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TFCBT), eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR), non‐trauma‐focused CBT (non‐TFCBT), other therapies (supportive therapy, non‐directive counselling, psychodynamic therapy and present‐centred therapy), group TFCBT, or group non‐TFCBT, compared to one another or to a waitlist or usual care group for the treatment of chronic PTSD. The primary outcome measure was the severity of clinician‐rated traumatic‐stress symptoms. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data and entered them into Review Manager 5 software. We contacted authors to obtain missing data. Two review authors independently performed 'Risk of bias' assessments. We pooled the data where appropriate, and analysed for summary effects. 
Main results
We include 70 studies involving a total of 4761 participants in the review. The first primary outcome for this review was reduction in the severity of PTSD symptoms, using a standardised measure rated by a clinician. For this outcome, individual TFCBT and EMDR were more effective than waitlist/usual care (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐1.62; 95% CI ‐2.03 to ‐1.21; 28 studies; n = 1256 and SMD ‐1.17; 95% CI ‐2.04 to ‐0.30; 6 studies; n = 183 respectively). There was no statistically significant difference between individual TFCBT, EMDR and Stress Management (SM) immediately post‐treatment although there was some evidence that individual TFCBT and EMDR were superior to non‐TFCBT at follow‐up, and that individual TFCBT, EMDR and non‐TFCBT were more effective than other therapies. Non‐TFCBT was more effective than waitlist/usual care and other therapies. Other therapies were superior to waitlist/usual care control as was group TFCBT. There was some evidence of greater drop‐out (the second primary outcome for this review) in active treatment groups. Many of the studies were rated as being at 'high' or 'unclear' risk of bias in multiple domains, and there was considerable unexplained heterogeneity; in addition, we assessed the quality of the evidence for each comparison as very low. As such, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence for each of the comparisons made in this review was assessed as very low quality. This evidence showed that individual TFCBT and EMDR did better than waitlist/usual care in reducing clinician‐assessed PTSD symptoms. There was evidence that individual TFCBT, EMDR and non‐TFCBT are equally effective immediately post‐treatment in the treatment of PTSD. There was some evidence that TFCBT and EMDR are superior to non‐TFCBT between one to four months following treatment, and also that individual TFCBT, EMDR and non‐TFCBT are more effective than other therapies. There was evidence of greater drop‐out in active treatment groups. Although a substantial number of studies were included in the review, the conclusions are compromised by methodological issues evident in some. Sample sizes were small, and it is apparent that many of the studies were underpowered. There were limited follow‐up data, which compromises conclusions regarding the long‐term effects of psychological treatment.","Psychological therapies for treating adults with post‐ traumatic stress disorder
Review question 
What are the effects on adults with PTSD of psychological therapy? 
Background 
Post‐ traumatic Stress Disorder (PTST) is an anxiety disorder that can develop after exposure to a traumatic event. Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares, avoidance of reminders of the event, and hyperarousal. Psychological therapies aim to help people deal with their memories and feelings about the traumatic event, but there is uncertainty about which type of therapy is most effective. 
Study characteristics 
This review included 71 studies involving 4800 participants. The studies were carried out in different countries and settings, and used different types of therapy. Most studies compared one type of psychological treatment with another, or with no treatment. Some studies compared different types and doses of psychological treatments. 
Key results 
The evidence suggests that psychological therapies are effective in reducing symptoms of PTSD. Individual trauma‐ focused cognitive behavioural therapies (TFTCBT) and eye movement and desensitisiation and reprogramming (EMDRE) are more effective at reducing PTSD symptoms than waiting for treatment or receiving no treatment at all. However, the evidence is not strong enough to say whether TFTCBT or EMDRE is better than other types of psychological intervention. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies varied. Most of the included studies had a low risk of bias, but some did not report important information about how they were run. 
Conclusions 
Psychological therapy is effective for treating PTSD. More research is needed to find out which type and dose of therapy works best. 
Certainty of the review evidence 
We are fairly certain that TFTCBTs and EDRME are effective for reducing PTSD. We are less certain about the effectiveness of other types and dosages of psychological interventions. 
Trial registration 
This systematic review is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020M00018).
Cognitive behavioural therapy, eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing and other psychological treatments for post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults
Background
Post‐trauma stress disorder is a mental health condition that can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. Symptoms include intrusive thoughts and memories, avoidance of reminders of the trauma, negative changes in mood and thinking, and increased arousal. Psychological treatments aim to help people process their traumatic experiences and reduce distressing symptoms. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and eye movement and desensitisation and reprogramming (EMDR) are two types of psychological treatment that have been shown to be effective for PTSD. However, there are many different types of CBT and many variations of EMD. This review aimed to compare the effectiveness of these different types and variations of psychological treatments.
Study characteristics
This review included 72 studies involving 4800 participants. Most studies compared one type of psychological therapy with another, but some studies compared psychological therapy against other treatments, such as medication. The studies were conducted in a variety of settings, including hospitals, community clinics, and private practices. The average age of participants ranged from 17 to 50 years old. Participants had experienced a range of traumas, including sexual abuse, physical assault, motor vehicle accidents, and combat exposure. The length of treatment varied from six sessions over three weeks to 20 sessions over nine months. The main outcome measures were the severity and duration of PTSD, and the number of people who dropped out of treatment. 
Key results
Individual CBT was found to be more effective at reducing PTSD symptoms than waiting on a treatment list or receiving usual care. Individual CBT also reduced the number and duration PTSD symptoms more than other types of psychotherapy. EMD was also found to reduce PTSD symptoms when compared with waiting on the treatment list. However there was not enough evidence to determine whether EMD or CBT were better than other forms of psychotherapies. The review found that the quality and quantity of evidence was poor, which means that the results may not be reliable. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of evidence for most comparisons was rated as very‐low. This means that there is uncertainty about the effect of the treatment. The quality of this evidence was affected by the fact that the studies used different methods to assess the effectiveness and safety of the treatments. In addition, the studies had a high risk of biases, which could affect the reliability of the results. 
Conclusions
There is currently insufficient evidence to make any firm conclusions about the relative effectiveness of different types or variations of psycho‐therapys for PTSD in adults. Further research is needed to determine the best type of treatment for PTSD, especially in terms of the number, length and frequency of sessions. 
Certainty of the证据质量
对于大多数比较而言，证据的质量被评估为很低。这意味着关于治疗效果的结论可能不可靠。这种证据的质量受到以下因素的影响：研究使用了不同的方法来评估治疗的有效性和安全性。此外，这些研究具有较高的偏倚风险，这可能会影响结果的可靠性。 
结论
目前尚无足够的证据得出不同类型的心理疗法对成人创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）的相对有效性的确切结论。需要进一步的研究来确定治疗PTSD的最佳类型，尤其是在会话的数量、长度和频率方面。
Cognitive behavioural therapy and eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing for post‐traumatic stress disorder
What is the aim of this Cochrane Review? 
This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and eye movements desensitisiation and reprogramming (EMDR) for treating post‐ traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 
What was studied in the research? 
Post‐trauma stress disorder is a mental health condition that can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. Symptoms include flashbacks, nightmares, avoidance of reminders of the trauma, and heightened arousal. CBT and eye‐movement desensiti‐ sation and reprograming are two types of psychological treatments that have been used to treat PTSD. Cogni‐ tive behavioural therapy aims to help people change their thoughts and beliefs about the traumatic event and how they react to it. Eye‐movement de‐ sensitisation and repor‐ graming involves recalling the traumatic memory while following the movement of an object with their eyes. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We searched for relevant studies up to December 2015. We found 37 studies involving 2964 participants. The studies compared CBT or EMD‐ R with no treatment or usual care, CBT with other psychological treatments, and EDR with other psycho‐ logical treatments. The majority of the participants were women who had experienced sexual assault. 
We found that CBT was more effective at reducing PTSD symptoms than no treatment. There is not enough evidence to determine whether CBT is more effective when delivered individually or in groups. There are not enough studies to determine if CBT works better for people with mild, moderate or severe PTSD. 
There is not sufficient evidence to show that EMD R is more effec‐ tiv e than no treatmen t. There i s not enough eviden ce to determ ine whethe r EMD S is mor e effective when deliver ed individu‐ ally or in gr oups. There ar e not enoug h studie s to determi ne if EMDS works bette r for peopl e with mild , moder ate or sev er e PTSD.","Psychological therapies for treating adults with post‐ traumatic stress disorder
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of psychological therapy for treating people with post-traumatic stress disorders (PTDS). 
Background 
Post‐ traumatic stresses are caused by exposure to a traumatic event such as a natural disaster, accident, or violent crime. PTSD can cause severe emotional distress and problems with daily functioning. It is usually treated with medication or psychological therapy. Psychological therapy is a type of talking therapy that aims to help people change their thoughts and behaviour. There are different types of psychological treatment for PTSD, including trauma‐focussed cognitive behavioural therapies (TFTCBT), eye‐movement desensitisiation and reprogramming (EMDRE), and non‐ trauma‐ focussed cognitive‐behavioural therapy (nonTFTC). 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 24 April 13, and found 71 studies involving 4800 participants. Most of the studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, Australia, and Europe. Participants were aged between 18 and 65 years. Most studies involved people who had experienced a single traumatic event, such as rape, assault, or a motor vehicle accident. Some studies involved participants who had been exposed to multiple traumatic events, such a war or torture. 
Key results 
The review found that TFCB and EDR were more successful at reducing PTSD symptoms than waiting for treatment or receiving usual care. TFC and EMT were also more successful than nonTFCB. However, there was no difference in the success of TFC, EMT, and nonTFTB. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence varied. The evidence for TFC was of moderate quality, and the evidence for EMT was of low quality. The quality of evidence for nonTTC was very low. 
Conclusions 
TFC and EMR may be useful for treating PTSD. However the quality of some of the research is low, so we need more high‐quality research before we can be certain of the benefits of these treatments. 
Certainty of the main results 
We rated the certainty of the results for TCF as moderate, and for EMD as low. We rated the results of nonTCT as very low.

Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing for Post‐traumatic Stress Disorder
Background
Post‐trauma stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. Symptoms include re‐living the trauma through nightmares and flashbacks, avoiding situations that remind you of the trauma, feeling numb and detached from others, and feeling on edge and easily startled. Cognitive Behavioural Therapies (CBT) and Eye movement Desensitisiation and Reprogramming (EMDR) are two types of psychological therapy that have been shown to help people with PTSD. CBT involves talking about your thoughts and feelings and learning new ways of coping. EMD‐R involves recalling a distressing memory while following the movement of the therapist's hand or a light bar back and forth. This review aimed to find out whether these therapies are effective for treating PTSD. 
Study characteristics
This review included 71 studies involving 4803 participants. Most of the participants had experienced sexual assault, domestic violence, motor vehicle accidents, or combat. The studies compared CBT or EMD R with other treatments, such as medication, or with no treatment. Some studies compared different types of CBT and/or EMD. 
Key results
Individual CBT was found to be more effective in reducing PTSD symptoms than no treatment or usual care. There is some evidence to suggest that CBT may also be more beneficial than other types of therapy. However, the evidence is not strong enough to draw firm conclusions. There were no differences in effectiveness between CBT, eye movement desensitization and reprogramming (EMD R), and other types. CCBT and EMBR were both found to reduce PTSD symptoms more than no intervention or usual treatment. However again, the quality and quantity of evidence is too poor to draw any firm conclusions about their relative effectiveness. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of evidence was assessed by two independent reviewers. The quality of studies was generally poor, with many studies having methodological flaws. In addition, there was a lot of variation between studies in terms of the type of therapy provided, the type and severity of the traumatic event, and the way in which outcomes were measured. Therefore, the results of this study should be treated with caution.
Conclusions
There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the relative effectiveness of CCB and EBR for treating people with post‐traumatisation disorder. Further research is needed to establish the best treatment options for people with this condition.

"Background
Cystic fibrosis is the most common life‐limiting autosomal recessive genetic disorder in white populations. Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) is an important morbidity in cystic fibrosis. It is the result of the accumulation of viscid faecal material within the bowel which combines with thick, sticky mucus produced in the intestines of people with cystic fibrosis. The intestine may be completely blocked (complete DIOS) or only partially blocked (incomplete DIOS). Once a diagnosis of DIOS has been made, the goal of therapy is to relieve the acute complete or incomplete faecal obstruction and ultimately prevent the need for surgical intervention. 
Objectives
This review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different treatment regimens for the treatment of DIOS (complete and incomplete) in children and adults with cystic fibrosis. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of search: 09 September 2021. 
We also searched online trial registries. Date of last search: 12 October 2021.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials, quasi‐randomised controlled trials (including cross‐over trials (to be judged on an individual basis)) comparing the use of laxative agents or surgery for treating DIOS in children, young people and adults with cystic fibrosis to each other, placebo or no intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently screened papers, extracted trial details and assessed for risk of bias. The authors assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
There was one trial with 20 participants (16 females) included in the review. The mean age of participants was 13.1 years. The trial was a double‐blinded, randomised cross‐over trial which had a duration of 12 months in total and compared high‐dose and low‐dose pancreatic enzyme therapy. As only the abstract of the trial was available, the overall risk of bias was judged to be unclear. The trial did not address either of our primary outcomes (time until resolution of DIOS and treatment failure rate), but reported episodes of acute DIOS, presence of abdominal mass and abdominal pain. There were no numerical data available for these outcomes, but the authors stated that there was no difference between treatment with high‐dose or low‐dose pancreatic enzymes. The overall certainty of the evidence was found to be very low. 
Authors' conclusions
There is a clear lack of evidence for the treatment of DIOS in people with cystic fibrosis. The included abstract did not address our primary outcome measures and did not provide numerical data for the two secondary outcomes it did address. Therefore, we cannot justify the use of high‐dose pancreatic enzymes for treating DIOS, nor can we comment on the efficacy and safety of other laxative agents. From our findings, it is clear that more randomised controlled trials need to be conducted in this area.","Treatment of distal intestinal obstru
Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy for the prevention and treatment of distal intestinal obstruction syndrome in people who have cystic fibreosis
Review question 
What are the effects of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapies for the management of distally intestinal obstruction syndromes (DIOS) in people living with cystiic fibroses? 
Background 
People with cystis fibrosis often have problems with their pancreas. This can lead to malabsorption of nutrients and fat in the diet. Pancreatic enzymes are used to replace the missing enzymes and help the body digest food. People with cystics fibrosis may also develop a condition called distal intestine obstruction syndrome (DIOP). This is where the small intestine becomes blocked by a thickened layer of mucus. This blockage can cause severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation. It is thought that pancreatic enzymes may help to reduce the symptoms of DIOP. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to December 2016. We found one study that compared high dose and low dose pancreatic enzyme replacements. The study was carried out in 45 people with DIOP and cystic firosis. All participants received both treatments during the study. The results of the study were not reported in full. 
Key results 
The study did not report any of the outcomes we were interested in. The evidence is current to December, 2106. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was very low, due to the small number of people included in the study and the fact that the study was not reported fully. 
Certainty of the results 
We are very uncertain about the effect of pancreatic enzymes on the management DIOP in people wiht cystic fibrrosis. More research is needed before we can draw any conclusions. 
Trial registration 
This review includes the following trial:

Review question 
What are the effects of different treatments for distal ileal obstruction syndrome in children with cystiic fibroses? 
Background 
Distal ilea obstruction syndrome is a complication of cystic firosis. People with cystis fibrosis have a build up of thick, viscous mucus in their intestines. This can cause a blockage in the small intestine. This blockage can be partial or complete. When it is partial, it is called incomplete distal Ileal obstruction sydrome (DIoS). When it causes a complete blockage, it's called complete DIoS. The aim of treatment is to reduce the number of episodes of complete DIos and to prevent the development of a complete obstruction. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 08 September 0201 and found one study that compared two different doses of pancreatic enzymes. Pancreatic enzymes are used to help digest food. They are often given to people with Cystis fibrosis because they have problems digesting food. The study involved 24 people with distal DIoS who were aged between 5 and 17 years. 
Key results 
The study was very small and we could not find any information about how well the treatment worked. We could not be sure if the study was carried out properly. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality as very low. This means that we are very uncertain about the effect of pancreatic enzyme treatment for distalis DIoS in people who have cystic fibreosis.

ficosis
Review question 
What is the effect of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapies for the management of distally intestinal obstruction syndromes (DIOS) in people who have cystic firosis? 
Background 
People who have CF may develop a condition called DIOS. This is where the small intestine becomes blocked by thick mucus. Pancreatic enzymes are used to treat DIOS because they help to break down food and reduce the amount of mucus produced. However, the evidence for their use is limited. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 27 July 2016. We found one study that met our inclusion criteria. This was a randomised trial comparing high‐ and low dose pancreatic enzyme replacements. It was unclear whether the trial had been carried out properly. 
Key results 
The trial did report some outcomes of interest to us, such as the number of people who experienced acute DIOP, the presence of an abdominal mass, and abdominal pains. However it did not report any numerical data. The authors concluded that there were no differences between the two treatments. 
Quality of the research 
The quality of the study was unclear. 
Certainty of the results 
We could not draw any conclusions about the effects of pancreatic enzymes in the treatment and prevention of DIOP. More randomised trials are needed to investigate the effects. 
What does this mean for me? 
There is currently a lack of good quality evidence for pancreatic enzyme treatment in people over five years old with cystificosis who have DIOP.
We cannot recommend the use or otherwise of pancreatic enzye replacement therapy. More research is needed to find out if pancreatic enzyme treatments are effective for people with DIOP and to find the best way to treat them."
"Background
Bell's palsy or idiopathic facial palsy is an acute facial paralysis due to inflammation of the facial nerve. A number of studies published in China have suggested acupuncture is beneficial for facial palsy. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to examine the efficacy of acupuncture in hastening recovery and reducing long‐term morbidity from Bell's palsy. 
Search methods
We updated the searches of the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Specialized Register (24 May 2010), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 2, 2010), MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2010), EMBASE (January 1980 to May 2010), AMED (January 1985 to May 2010), LILACS (from January 1982 to May 2010) and the Chinese Biomedical Retrieval System (January 1978 to May 2010) for randomised controlled trials using 'Bell's palsy' and its synonyms, 'idiopathic facial paralysis' or 'facial palsy' as well as search terms including 'acupuncture'. Chinese journals in which we thought we might find randomised controlled trials relevant to our study were handsearched. We reviewed the bibliographies of the randomised trials and contacted the authors and known experts in the field to identify additional published or unpublished data. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials involving acupuncture by needle insertion in the treatment of Bell's palsy irrespective of any language restrictions. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors identified potential articles from the literature search, extracted data and assessed quality of each trial independently. All disagreements were resolved by discussion between the review authors. 
Main results
The literature search and handsearching identified 49 potentially relevant articles. Of these, six RCTs were included involving 537 participants with Bell's palsy. Two more possible trials were identified in the update than the previous version of this systematic review, but both were excluded because they were not real RCTs. Of the six included trials, five used acupuncture while the other one used acupuncture combined with drugs. No trial reported on the outcomes specified for this review. Harmful side effects were not reported in any of the trials. Poor quality caused by flaws in study design or reporting (including uncertain method of randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding) and clinical differences between trials prevented reliable conclusions about the efficacy of acupuncture. 
Authors' conclusions
The quality of the included trials was inadequate to allow any conclusion about the efficacy of acupuncture. More research with high quality trials is needed.","Acupuncture for Bell's Palsy
Review question 
Does acupuncture help people recover from Bell’s palsy? 
Background 
Bell’s paresis is a sudden weakness or paralysis of the muscles on one side of the face. It is also called Bell’s facial pareses or Bell’s disease. The condition is named after Sir Charles Bell who first described it in 1821. Bell’s paralysis is usually temporary and most people recover fully within three months. However, some people may be left with permanent weakness or drooping of the affected side of their face. 
Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine practice where fine needles are inserted into specific points on the body. Acupuncture is often used to treat pain and other conditions. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for random trials comparing acupuncture with no acupuncture or sham acupuncture (a fake treatment). We found six trials involving 472 people with Bell’s paralyses. Five trials compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture and one trial compared acupuncture plus drugs with drugs alone. The trials were conducted in China and lasted up to 12 weeks. 
Key results 
There was no evidence that acupuncture helped people recover faster from Bell’ paralysies. There was also no evidence of any harmful effects of acupuncture. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was poor. This means that the results should be interpreted with caution. 
Conclusions 
There is no evidence to support the use of acupuncture for Bell’s palsies. Further research is needed to confirm whether acupuncture is effective for Bell’ palsy and to determine the best type of acupuncture to use. 
Certainty of the Evidence 
The certainty of the available evidence was low. This is because the studies had many problems that made it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of acupuncture treatment for Bell' palsy.
Trial registration 
This review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD4200900264).
Acupuncture for Bell's Palsy
Background
Bell's palsey is a condition where the facial muscles become weak or paralyzed. It is usually caused by damage to the facial nerve. This can be due to a viral infection or trauma. Symptoms include drooping of the eyelid, mouth, and corner of the eye. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese therapy which involves inserting fine needles into specific points on the body. It has been suggested that acupuncture may help people with Bell’s palsy recover faster. 
Study characteristics
We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture with no treatment, sham acupuncture, or other treatments for Bell’s Palsy. We found six trials involving 637 people with this condition. The trials compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture or no treatment. The studies were of poor quality and did not report on the main outcomes we were interested in. 
Key results
There is insufficient evidence to determine whether acupuncture is effective for treating Bell's palsies. Further research is needed to determine if acupuncture is beneficial for people with facial paralysis. 
Quality of the evidence
The evidence is current to June 2015. The quality of evidence was low to very low. The low quality was mainly due to the poor quality of included trials. There was also a lack of information on important outcomes such as recovery of facial function. 
Trial registration

What is Bell's paralysis? 
Bell's paralysis is a condition where the facial muscles become weak or paralyzed. It usually affects only one side of the face. It is also called idiopathic (unknown cause) facial paresis or facial plegia. 
What is the aim of this research? 
This review aimed to assess whether acupuncture can help people who have Bell's paralysed face recover faster and reduce the risk of permanent damage to their face. 
How did the researchers do this? 
The researchers searched for all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared acupuncture with no treatment or other treatments for Bell’s palsy up to May, 10,  2009. They found six RCTS involving 437 people with Bell’s paralysis. The researchers assessed the quality of the evidence from the trials and summarized the findings. 
Key messages 
There is limited evidence from six small trials that acupuncture may be useful in treating Bell's facial paresthesia. However, the evidence is of low quality and further research is needed before any firm conclusions can be drawn. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was low. This means that we are uncertain about the effect of acupuncture for Bell’ paralysis. Further research is required to confirm the benefits of acupuncture. 
Authors' conclusions 
There was limited evidence that acupuncture might be useful for Bell' palsy, but the evidence was of low-quality. Further high-quality research is necessary to confirm these findings.
Acupuncture for Bell's Palsy
What is Bell's paralysis? 
Bell's paresis is a sudden weakness or paralysis of the muscles on one side of the face. It is also known as Bell's facial palsy or idiopathic facial pareses. The cause is unknown. It may be due to a viral infection or a problem with blood supply to the facial nerve. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To assess the effectiveness of acupuncture for Bell’s palsy, we searched for all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture with no treatment, sham acupuncture, or other treatments. 
How did we identify and select studies for this update? 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and the Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) up to December 2016. We also checked the reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. 
We included only RCT studies that compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture or no treatment. We excluded studies that did not report outcome measures of interest. 
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias in each study and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. 
Key results 
We found six RCTS involving 437 people with Bell’s paralysis. Five trials used acupuncture and one trial used acupuncture plus drugs. None of the studies reported on our main outcomes of interest: time to recovery, facial muscle strength, and facial asymmetry. Harm was not reported. 
The quality was poor in all studies. This was mainly because of problems with the way the studies were designed and reported. For example, the methods used to allocate participants to groups were unclear in four studies, and two studies did not describe how they concealed the allocation. In addition, three studies did no mention blinding. 
There was no evidence that acupuncture was effective for Bell’ paralysis. More well-designed studies are needed. 
Certainty of evidence 
The certainty of the evidence was very low for all outcomes. This means that we are very uncertain about the effect of acupuncture on Bell’s facial palsey. 
Review authors' conclusions 
This review provides no evidence to support the use of acupuncture in the treatment of Bell’s paralysed. More high-quality studies are required to determine whether acupuncture is effective for this condition.

"Background
Long term levodopa therapy in Parkinson's disease is associated with the development of motor complications including abnormal involuntary movements and a shortening response to each dose (wearing off phenomenon). It is thought that dopamine agonists can reduce the duration of immobile off periods and the need for levodopa therapy whilst maintaining or improving motor impairments and only minimally increasing dopaminergic adverse events. 
Objectives
To compare the efficacy and safety of adjuvant cabergoline therapy versus placebo in patients with Parkinson's disease, already established on levodopa and suffering from motor complications. 
Search methods
Electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Handsearching of the neurology literature as part of the Cochrane Movement Disorders Group's strategy. Examination of the reference lists of identified studies and other reviews. Contact with Pharmacia Upjohn Limited. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of cabergoline versus placebo in patients with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease and long‐term complications of levodopa therapy. 
Data collection and analysis
Data was abstracted independently by the authors and differences settled by discussion. The outcome measures used included Parkinson's disease rating scales, levodopa dosage, off time measurements and the frequency of withdrawals and adverse events. 
Main results
Cabergoline has been compared with placebo in two phase II (6 ‐ 12 weeks) and one phase III randomised controlled trials (24 weeks). These were double‐blind, parallel group, multicentre studies including 268 patients with Parkinson's disease and motor complications. The reduction of 1.14 hours (WMD; 95% CI ‐0.06, 2.33; p = 0.06) in off time in favour of cabergoline was not statistically significant. Inadequate data on dyskinesia was collected either on rating scales or as adverse event reporting to allow a conclusion to be drawn. A small but statistically significant advantage of cabergoline over placebo was seen in one study for UPDRS ADL (part II) score and UPDRS motor score. No such advantage was seen in one other study due to small numbers of patients and the comparatively low doses of cabergoline used. No significant differences in Schwab and England scale were seen in two studies. Levodopa dose reduction was significantly greater with cabergoline (WMD 149.6 mg/d; 95% CI 94.1, 205.1; p < 0.00001). There was a trend towards more dopaminergic adverse events with cabergoline but this did not reach statistical significance at the p < 0.01 level. However, there was a trend towards fewer withdrawals from cabergoline. 
Authors' conclusions
In the management of the motor complications seen in Parkinson's disease, cabergoline can be used to reduce levodopa dose and modestly improve motor impairment and disability with an acceptable adverse event profile. These conclusions are based on, at best, medium term evidence.","Cabergeoline for treating motor complications of long term levadopa therapy for Parkinson's Disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of adding cabergoline to levodopatherapy in people with Parkinson’s disease who have developed motor complications after long term treatment with levodapathery. 
Background 
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive disorder of the nervous system that affects movement. The main symptoms are tremor, stiffness, slowness of movement and impaired balance. As the disease progresses, people with the condition may develop motor complications such as abnormal involuntary movement (dyskinesias) and a shortened response to levadopatheraphy (worn off phenomenon) which can lead to periods of immobility. Dopamine agonists are drugs that mimic the action of dopamine, a chemical messenger in the brain. They are used to treat Parkinson’s and can reduce dyskinesis and worn off phenomenon. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to June 2007. We found three studies involving 270 people with long term complications of levdopatherapathy. All studies were randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trials lasting between six and 24 months. Two studies were phase II trials and one was a phase III trial. 
Key results 
The studies showed that cabergolinewas more effective than placebo at reducing the time spent in immobilities (off time). However, this effect was not significant. There was no difference in the number of people who withdrew from the study because of side effects. Cabergoline reduced the amount of levadopo needed by 150 mg per day. This was significant. The studies did not report on the frequency or severity of dyskinesea. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was good. The results of the three studies were similar. 
Conclusions 
Cabergolinenot only reduces the amountof levadophene needed but also improves motor function. However, the effect on the time people spend in immobile periods is not significant and there is no information on the effect of caberogoline on dyskinetic movements. More research is needed to confirm these findings and to investigate the effect that caberolinenhas on dyskenesia. 
Authors' conclusions 
Cabergeolinenreduces the amountlevadopatheneeded by 25% and improves motor functions. However the effecton the timepeople spend inimmobileperiodsis not significantand there isno information ontheeffectofcabergolineondyskenesias.

Cabergoline for reducing levodopadose in people with Parkinson's Disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the use of caberogoline to reduce the amount of levodapda taken by people with parkinson's disease. 
Background 
Parkinson's Disease is a progressive disorder of the brain that causes tremor, stiffness, slowness of movement and problems with balance. It is treated with levodapa which is converted into dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is a chemical that helps control movement. As the disease progresses, the effect of levoda decreases and side effects increase. This is called 'motor complications'. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared cabergolne with placebo or another treatment in people who had motor complications. We found four RCTs involving 372 participants. All the studies lasted between 12 and 24 months. 
Key results 
Cabergolone reduced the amount levodpa taken by 150 mg per day. It also improved motor function and disability. However the improvement was small and not clinically important. Cabergolene also reduced the number of people who stopped taking their medication because of side effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was good. However they were small and only lasted up to 2 years. More research is needed to find out if cabergolin is effective in the long term. 
Conclusions 
Cabergeolne may be useful for reducing the amount levdopa taken by peple with parkinon's disease who have motor complications, but more research is need to find if it is effective for longer than 2years.","Cabergeoline for motor complications of Parkinson's Disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the use of cabergeoline to treat motor complications in people with Parkinson’s disease who have been taking levodopap for a long time. 
Background 
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive disorder of the nervous system that affects movement. Symptoms include tremor, stiffness, slowness of movement, and impaired balance. People with Parkinsons disease usually take levodope to control their symptoms. Over time, levodepa can cause problems with movement, such as stiffness, tremor and involuntary movements. These problems are called motor complications and they can affect quality of life. Dopamine agonists are drugs that mimic the action of dopamine in the brain. They are sometimes used to treat Parkinson’s Disease. Cabergoline is a dopamine agonist. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for all relevant studies up to June 2012. We found three studies involving 270 people with motor complications caused by long‐time use of levodepap. All three studies were randomised, controlled trials. Two studies lasted six to twelve weeks and one lasted twenty four weeks. The studies compared cabergotine with placebo (a dummy treatment). 
Key results 
Cabergotine did not improve the duration or severity of motor symptoms. It did not reduce the need to take levodepea. It also did not increase the risk of side effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was of moderate quality. The main limitation of the studies was that they were relatively short. 
Conclusions 
Cabergeotine does not appear to be effective in treating motor complications associated with long‐duration levodeopa therapy, although the quality of the available evidence is limited. Further research is needed.
Cabergoline for the treatment of motor complications in Parkinson’s disease
Review question 
Does cabergotine reduce the need for levodopadose and improve motor function in people with Parkinson’sdisease? 
Background 
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement. It is characterised by tremor, stiffness and slowness of movement. As the disease progresses, people with parkinson’sdiseasesuffer from motor complications, including dyskinesis, which is involuntary movement. Dyskinesis is usually treated with levodopedrug therapy. However levodope can cause side effects, including nausea, vomiting, dizziness and hallucinations. Cabergoline is a dopamine agonist drug that is used to treat people with motor complications of parkinson'sdisease. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared cabergolinetreatment with placebo or no treatment. We included RCTs that compared different doses ofcabergoline, or that compared the drug with other drugs. We found six RCTsthat met our inclusion criteria. The studies involved 372 people withparkinson’sdisorder. The duration of the studies ranged from three months to two years. 
Key results 
Cabergolinedid not improve motor symptoms or disability in people who had motor complications. However it reduced the need fordopamine replacement therapy. People who took cabergolinereported more side effects than those who took placebo. However the number of people who discontinued treatment because of side effects was similar in both groups. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate. The evidence was based on six RCTS that involved 272 participants. The quality of evidence was downgraded because of the risk of bias in the studies and the imprecision of the estimates. 
Conclusions 
Cabergeoline can reduce the dose of levodopesubstance that is needed to control motor symptoms in peoplewith parkinsonismotor complications. This may reduce the riskof side effects associated with levodepotherapy. However cabergolini does not improve the motor symptoms of parkinsońsdisorder or disability.

"Background
Implant overdentures are one of the most common treatment options used to rehabilitate edentulous patients. Attachment systems are used to anchor the overdentures to implants. The plethora of attachment systems available dictates a need for clinicians to understand their prosthodontic and patient‐related outcomes. 
Objectives
To compare different attachment systems for maxillary and mandibular implant overdentures by assessing prosthodontic success, prosthodontic maintenance, patient preference, patient satisfaction/quality of life and costs. 
Search methods
Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 24 January 2018); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 12) in the Cochrane Library (searched 24 January 2018); MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 24 January 2018); and Embase Ovid (1980 to 24 January 2018). The US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials on 24 January 2018. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cross‐over trials on maxillary or mandibular implant overdentures with different attachment systems with at least 1 year follow‐up. 
Data collection and analysis
Four review authors extracted data independently and assessed risk of bias for each included trial. Several corresponding authors were subsequently contacted to obtain missing information. Fixed‐effect meta‐analysis was used to combine the outcomes with risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence and create 'Summary of findings' tables. 
Main results
We identified six RCTs with a total of 294 mandibular overdentures (including one cross‐over trial). No trials on maxillary overdentures were eligible. Due to the poor reporting of the outcomes across the included trials, only limited analyses between mandibular overdenture attachment systems were possible. 
Comparing ball and bar attachments, upon pooling the data regarding short‐term prosthodontic success, we identified substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 97%) with inconsistency in the direction of effect, which was unexplained by clinical or methodological differences between the studies, and accordingly we did not perform meta‐analyses for this outcome. Short‐term re‐treatment (repair of attachment system) was higher with ball attachments (RR 3.11, 95% CI 1.68 to 5.75; 130 participants; 2 studies; very low‐quality evidence), and there was no difference between both attachment systems in short‐term re‐treatment (replacement of attachment system) (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.38 to 3.71; 130 participants; 2 studies; very low‐quality evidence). It is uncertain whether there is a difference in short‐term prosthodontic success when ball attachments are compared with bar attachments. 
Comparing ball and magnet attachments, there was no difference between them in medium‐term prosthodontic success (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.10; 69 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence), or in medium‐term re‐treatment (repair of attachment system) (RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 4.72; 69 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence). However, after 5 years, prosthodontic maintenance costs were higher when magnet attachments were used (MD ‐247.37 EUR, 95% CI ‐346.32 to ‐148.42; 69 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence). It is uncertain whether there is a difference in medium‐term prosthodontic success when ball attachments are compared with magnet attachments. 
One trial provided data for ball versus telescopic attachments and reported no difference in prosthodontic maintenance between the two systems in short‐term patrix replacement (RR 6.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 41.96; 22 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence), matrix activation (RR 11.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 177.72; 22 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence), matrix replacement (RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.71 to 4.31; 22 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence), or in relining of the implant overdenture (RR 2.33, 95% CI 0.81 to 6.76; 22 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence). It is uncertain whether there is a difference in short‐term prosthodontic maintenance when ball attachments are compared with telescopic attachments. 
In the only cross‐over trial included, patient preference between different attachment systems was assessed after only 3 months and not for the entire trial period of 10 years. 
Authors' conclusions
For mandibular overdentures, there is insufficient evidence to determine the relative effectiveness of different attachment systems on prosthodontic success, prosthodontic maintenance, patient satisfaction, patient preference or costs. In the short term, there is some evidence that is insufficient to show a difference and where there was no evidence was reported. It was not possible to determine any preferred attachment system for mandibular overdentures. 
For maxillary overdentures, there is no evidence (with no trials identified) to determine the relative effectiveness of different attachment systems on prosthodontic success, prosthodontic maintenance, patient satisfaction, patient preference or costs. 
Further RCTs on edentulous cohorts must pay attention to trial design specifically using the same number of implants of the same implant system, but with different attachment systems clearly identified in control and test groups. Trials should also determine the longevity of different attachment systems and patient preferences. Trials on the current array of computer‐aided designed/computer‐assisted manufactured (CAD/CAM) bar attachment systems are encouraged.","Attachment systems for implant overdentinues in the mouth
Review question 
What are the differences between different types of attachment system for implant dentures? 
Background 
Implant dentures are used by people who have lost all their teeth. They are anchored to implants (surgically inserted metal posts) in their jawbone. There are many different types and brands of attachment. These are used in conjunction with crowns or dentures to anchor them to the implants. This review aimed to find out whether one type of attachment is better than another. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to January 31st 2o18 and found six studies involving 284 people. All the studies compared two different types or brands of attachments. The studies looked at how well the attachments worked, how long they lasted, how much people liked them and how much they cost. 
Key results 
The studies did not report enough information about how well or how long the attachments lasted. One study reported that people preferred ball attachments to bar attachments. Another study reported no difference in satisfaction between ball and ball attachments. One of the studies reported that bar attachments were more expensive than ball attachments, but this was not confirmed by other studies. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was of low to very low quality. This means we cannot be confident that our conclusions are correct. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to determine which type of implant attachment is best. More research is needed.
Attachment systems for mandibula overdentured teeth: a systematic review and network meta‐analysis
Background
Overdentures are removable dental prostheses that fit over natural teeth or implants. They can be used to replace missing teeth and improve chewing ability. Overdentures can be attached to the jawbone using different types of attachment systems. These include ball and socket, bar and clip, and magnetic attachments. This review compares the effectiveness of these attachment systems for overdenturing the lower jaw. 
Review question
What is the effectiveness and safety of different attachment systems used for overdenting the lower jaws? 
Study characteristics
This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2011. We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different attachment types for overdented lower jaws. We included studies that compared two or more attachment types. We excluded studies that included patients with upper jaw overdenttures. We found six RCTS with a combined total of about 300 overdenturers. All studies were conducted in Europe and the USA. Most studies were funded by industry. 
Key results
There was no evidence that one type of attachment is better than another in terms of long‐term success of the overdenturereplacement of the attachment system, or in terms cost of maintaining the overdentin the long term. There was some evidence that ball attachments may need more frequent repair than bar attachments in the short term. 
Quality of the evidence
The evidence was of very low quality due to small numbers of patients, poor reporting, and high risk of bias. 
Conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to recommend one attachment system over another. Further research is needed to determine the most effective attachment system for overdentin both the short and long term, and to determine how much it costs to maintain overdenturies in the long run. 
Certainty of the review evidence
We rated the certainty of the available evidence as very low. This means that the true effect of the treatments could be substantially different from what we have concluded. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence for one attachment type being superior to another in the treatment of mandibulare dentures. Further well‐designed studies are needed to evaluate the long‐ and short‐ term effectiveness of different attachments for overdents.
Attachment systems for mandibulary overdentured patients: a systematic review
Background
Overdentures are dentures that fit over implants placed in the jawbone. They can be used to replace missing teeth and improve chewing ability. Implants are usually placed in areas of the mouth where there are few remaining teeth. Overdentures can be attached to implants by different types of attachments. These attachments can be fixed or removable. This review compares the effectiveness of the different types and designs of attachments for overdenturing. 
Review question 
We wanted to find out if one type of attachment is better than another at improving the success rate of overdenturation. We also wanted to know if one attachment system is better at reducing the need for maintenance work on the overdenturerepairing or replacing parts of the overdentin the long term. We wanted to compare the cost of different types or designs of attachment systems. We were also interested in how patients felt about the different attachment types. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to May 2015. We found 13 studies that met our inclusion criteria. All of these studies were randomised controlled trials. The studies involved 127 participants. 
Key results 
The studies compared different types (ball, telescopic, magnet) and designs (fixed, removable) of attachments in the short and medium term. There was no difference between the types of attachment in the success rates of overdenting. There were no differences between the different designs of ball attachments. There may be a difference between ball and magnet attachments in terms of the success of overdentsures in the medium term, but this finding was not certain. There is no evidence that one type or design of attachment has an effect on the need to repair or replace parts of overdentin either the short or medium term or on the costs of maintenance. There are no data on patient satisfaction or preference. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was poor. The sample size of the included studies was small. The follow‐up time was short. The evidence is very low quality. This means that we cannot be confident that the findings are correct. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient high‐quality research evidence to draw any firm conclusions about the effectiveness and cost of the various types and design of attachments used in overdentury treatment. Further research is needed.
Attachment systems for overdenture retention: a systematic review
Background
Overdentures are prosthetic devices used to replace missing teeth. They are supported by one or more implants (surgical devices placed in the jawbone) and can be fixed or removable. Attachment systems are used to connect the overdentured teeth to the implants. There are many different types of attachment systems available. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of attachment system types in maintaining the function of overdenturing teeth. 
Review question 
What is the effect of different types and designs of attachment on the success of overdentinues? 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to June 2015. We found 17 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted in 14 countries and involved 696 participants. 
Key results 
The studies included in this review were generally of poor quality. Most studies did not report important information such as the number of participants who dropped out of the study, the number and type of implants used, or the number or type of attachment used. 
There is insufficient information to determine whether one type of overdenting attachment system is better than another. 
This review found no studies comparing different attachment types for maxillary (upper jaw) overdentines. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies included was generally low. We rated the quality of evidence as very low for most outcomes. This means we are very uncertain about the effects of different overdentine attachment systems. 
Conclusions 
There was insufficient evidence from the studies to determine which type of implant attachment system was best for either mandibula (lower jaw) or maxillary dentures. Further research is needed to determine if one type is better for either type of denture. 
Certainty of the Evidence 
The certainty of the body of evidence was very low. This is because the included studies were generally small and poorly designed. The studies also had high rates of participants dropping out of them. This meant that the studies were unable to detect differences between the different attachment system.","Attachment systems for implant overdentinues in the mandible
Review question 
What are the differences in prosthodonitic success, maintenance, cost, patient preferences and satisfaction between different attachment system for implant dentures? 
Background 
Implant dentures are used for rehabilitation of edentulism. Attachment system are used in conjunction with implants to anchor dentures to the implants. There are many different types of attachment system available and this review aimed to compare them. 
Study characteristics 
This review included six studies involving 283 participants. All studies compared two different attachment types. The studies were conducted in the United States, Canada and Europe. The participants were aged between 25 and 80 years old. The duration of the studies ranged from 1 to 5 years. 
Key results 
The review found no significant difference in prothodonitic failure rates between attachment systems. However, there was a trend towards higher failure rates with ball and socket attachments. The review also found no difference in maintenance rates between the attachment systems, although there was some evidence that ball and sockets may be more difficult to maintain. There was no evidence of any difference in cost between the attachments. There were no differences in patient preferences between the different attachments. However there was evidence that patients preferred ball and rod attachments over ball and cap attachments. Patients also reported higher satisfaction with ball rod attachments. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the included studies was generally low. This was due to poor reporting and lack of blinding. The quality of some of the individual outcomes was very low. 
Conclusions and implications for practice 
There is currently insufficient evidence to determine which attachment system is best for implant supported dentures. Further research is needed to determine if there are any differences in the outcomes between the various attachment systems.
Review methods 
We searched the CoChane Oral health's Trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embare. We also searched ClinicalTrials. gov and the WHO International Clinical Trial Registry Platform. We did not apply any language restrictions. We last searched the databases on 18 January 1918 and contacted corresponding authors for missing information on 30 January 0118.
We included all randomised control trials (including cross‐overs) comparing different attachment type for implant‐supported dentures in the maxilla or mandible. We excluded studies with less than 1year follow‐ups. We assessed the risk of selection, performance, detection, attrition and reporting biases. We used fixed‐effect models to pool the data. We presented the results as risk ratios for dichomatic outcomes and as mean differences for continuous ones. We calculated 99% confidence interval (CI) for the risk ratios and 90% CI for the mean differences. We graded the quality evidence using the GRADES approach.
Attachment systems for mandibul
Implant overdentured mandibula: what is the best attachment system? 
Background 
An implant overdentarure is a removable denture supported by dental implants. An attachment system is a mechanical device that connects the denture to the implants. There are many different types of attachment systems available. This review compares the effectiveness of the different attachment system types on prothesis success, maintenance, costs, patient preferences and satisfaction. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 14 September 2015), the Coordinating Group's Specialised Register (Cochrane Oral Trials Register) (to October 24, 2105), CENTRAL (The Cochrance Library 23 October 15) and reference lists of retrieved studies. We also contacted manufacturers and authors of relevant studies. 
Key results 
We identified one randomised controlled trial (RCT) and one cross‐ over trial (both published in 25 October 05) that met our inclusion criteria. The RCT compared ball attachments with telescopes attachments and the cross‐oer trial compared ball and magnet attachments with ball attachments. Both trials were conducted in Sweden and involved 26 patients. 
Both trials reported no differences in prothesis failure, but the RCT reported a difference favouring ball attachments in the number of times the dentures had to be relined. The cross‐ oer trial reported no significant differences in patient satisfaction or preference. The cost analysis of the Rct reported that ball attachments were more expensive than telescopic ones in the short‐ term (less than 5 year), but less expensive in the long‐term (more than 1 year). The cross over trial did not report any cost data. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the included trials was low. Both studies were small and had high attrition rates. The risk of bias was unclear in both studies. The quality of evidence was very low for all outcomes. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient high‐quality evidences to determine which attachment system type is most effective for implant overdentinures. More well‐designed studies are needed to compare the different types.
Attachment systems for overdenture retention: a systematic review and meta‐analysis
Background 
Overdentures are removable dentures that are supported by two or more implants. They are used to replace missing teeth and help to restore function and appearance. Implant attachments are used in overdentured patients to improve retention and stability of the denture. Different types of attachments are available. This review compares the effectiveness of ball attachments versus telescopic (or internal screw) attachments. The main outcome measures were prosthesis survival, prothesis maintenance, cost, patient preferences and satisfaction. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 24 October 2017), the Co‐chrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochr‐ane Library, 25 October 1991 to 26 October  2020), MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to 18 October  217) and Embase via OVID (1880 to 31 October 37). We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (31 January 23). 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ball attachments with telescopes attachments in overdentinued patients. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We contacted study authors for additional information. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results 
We included one RCT (100 participants) in this review. The study was conducted in the UK and compared ball attachments to telescopic attachment in 50 patients with bilateral mandibula overdentues. The mean follow‐up time was 3.5 years. The trial was at high risk of attrition bias because 14% of participants withdrew during the study. There was no difference in the primary outcome measure of prosthodon‐tic success (risk ratio (RR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to1.10; low‐certainty evidence). There was also no difference between the two attachment systems in the secondary outcomes of prothesis mainten‐ance, patient satisfactio, patient preferece or cost. 
No other RCT was identified for maxillary over‐dentures. No trials were identified for the comparison of ball and telescopic attach‐ments in the maxilla. 
Certainty of the evi"
"Background
Increasingly, cancer is recognised as a chronic condition with a growing population of informal caregivers providing care for cancer patients. Informal caregiving can negatively affect the health and well‐being of caregivers. We need a synthesised account of best evidence to aid decision‐making about effective ways to support caregivers for individuals 'living with cancer'. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions designed to improve the quality of life (QoL), physical health and well‐being of informal caregivers of people living with cancer compared with usual care. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, ProQuest, Open SIGLE, Web of Science from inception up to January 2018, trial registries and citation lists of included studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing psychosocial interventions delivered to adult informal caregivers of adults affected by cancer on a group or individual basis with usual care. Psychosocial interventions included non‐pharmacological interventions that involved an interpersonal relationship between caregivers and healthcare professionals. We included interventions delivered also to caregiver‐patient dyads. Interventions delivered to caregivers of individuals receiving palliative or inpatient care were excluded. Our primary outcome was caregiver QoL. Secondary outcomes included patient QoL, caregiver and patient depression, anxiety, psychological distress, physical health status and intervention satisfaction and adverse effects. 
Data collection and analysis
Pairs of review authors independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data and conducted 'Risk of bias' assessments. We synthesised findings using meta‐analysis, where possible, and reported remaining results in a narrative synthesis. 
Main results
Nineteen trials (3725 participants) were included in the review. All trials were reported in English and were undertaken in high‐income countries. Trials targeted caregivers of patients affected by a number of cancers spanning newly diagnosed patients, patients awaiting treatment, patients who were being treated currently and individuals post‐treatment. Most trials delivered interventions to caregiver‐patient dyads (predominantly spousal dyads) and there was variation in intervention delivery to groups or individual participants. There was much heterogeneity across interventions though the majority were defined as psycho‐educational. All trials were rated as being at 'high risk of bias'. 
Compared to usual care, psychosocial interventions may improve slightly caregiver QoL immediately post intervention (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 0.53; two studies, 265 participants) and may have little to no effect on caregiver QoL at 12 months (SMD 0.14, 95% CI ‐ 0.11 to 0.40; two studies, 239 participants) post‐intervention (both low‐quality evidence). 
Psychosocial interventions probably have little to no effect on caregiver depression immediately to one‐month post‐intervention (SMD 0.01, 95% CI ‐0.14 to 0.15; nine studies, 702 participants) (moderate‐quality evidence). Psychosocial interventions may have little to no effect on caregiver anxiety immediately post‐intervention (SMD ‐0.12, 95 % CI ‐0.33 to 0.10; five studies, 329 participants), depression three‐to‐six months (SMD 0.03, 95% CI ‐0.33 to 0.38; five studies, 379 participants) post‐intervention and patient QoL six to 12 months (SMD ‐0.05, 95% CI ‐0.37 to 0.26; three studies, 294 participants) post‐intervention (all low‐quality evidence). There was uncertainty whether psychosocial interventions improve patient QoL immediately (SMD ‐0.03, 95 %CI ‐0.50 to 0.44; two studies, 292 participants) or caregiver anxiety three‐to‐six months (SMD‐0.25, 95% CI ‐0.64 to 0.13; four studies, 272 participants) post‐intervention (both very low‐quality evidence). Two studies which could not be pooled in a meta‐analysis for caregiver physical health status found little to no effect immediately post‐intervention and a small intervention effect 12 months post‐intervention. Caregiver or patient satisfaction or cost‐effectiveness of interventions were not assessed in any studies. Interventions demonstrated good feasibility and acceptability. 
Psychosocial interventions probably have little to no effect on patient physical health status immediately post‐intervention (SMD 0.17, 95 % CI ‐0.07 to 0.41; four studies, 461 participants) and patient depression three to six months post‐intervention (SMD‐0.11, 95% CI ‐0.33 to 0.12; six studies, 534 participants) (both moderate‐quality evidence). 
Psychosocial interventions may have little to no effect on caregiver psychological distress immediately to one‐month (SMD ‐0.08, 95% CI ‐0.42 to 0.26; three studies, 134 participants), and seven to 12 months (SMD 0.08, 95% CI ‐0.42 to 0.58; two studies, 62 participants) post‐intervention; patient depression immediately (SMD ‐0.12, 95% CI ‐0.31 to 0.07; nine studies, 852 participants); anxiety immediately (SMD ‐0.13, 95% CI ‐0.41 to 0.15; four studies, 422 participants), and three to six months (SMD ‐0.22, 95% CI ‐0.45 to 0.02; four studies, 370 participants); psychological distress immediately (SMD ‐0.02, 95% CI ‐0.47 to 0.44; two studies, 74 participants) and seven to 12 months (SMD ‐0.27, 95% CI ‐0.78 to 0.24; two studies, 61 participants); and physical health status six to 12 months (SMD 0.06, 95% CI ‐0.18 to 0.30; two studies, 275 participants) post‐intervention (all low‐quality evidence). 
Three trials reported adverse effects associated with the interventions, compared with usual care, including higher distress, sexual function‐related distress and lower relationship satisfaction levels for caregivers, higher distress levels for patients, and that some content was perceived as insensitive to some participants. 
Trials not able to be pooled in a meta‐analysis did not tend to report effect size and it was difficult to discern intervention effectiveness. Variable intervention effects were reported for patient and caregiver outcomes. 
Authors' conclusions
Heterogeneity across studies makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for this population. There is an immediate need for rigorous trials with process evaluations and clearer, detailed intervention descriptions. Cost‐effectiveness studies should be conducted alongside future trials.","Psychosocial support for informal caregivers for people living  with cancer
Review question 
What is the effect of psychosoical support for caregivers of  people livingwith cancer? 
Background 
Cancer is increasingly recognised as chronic illness with a  growing populationof informal caregivers (family members, friends and other unpaid  carers)providing care for people with cancer. Caregivers often experience  negative effects on their health and wellbeing. We wanted to find out if  psychosocia l support for these caregivers improves their quality oflife (QOL). 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 26 January  2 01 8. We found 19  studies involving 37 25 caregivers. All studies were conducted in high income countries. Studies targeted caregivers for patients affectedby a numberofcancers spanning newlydiagnosed patients,patientsawaiting treatment,patientswho weretreatedcurrentlyandindividuals post‐ treatment. Most studies delivered interventions totargeted caregivers and patients (predomina ntly spous aldyads). There wasmuch heterogeneityacrossinterventions though the major ity were definedas psycho‐ educational. All studi es were ratedas being at high risk ofbias. 
Key results 
Compa red to usualcare, psychoso cial support mayimprov e slightly caregiverQOL immediately post‐intervention (standardized mean difference 0 .29; 9 5% confidence interval (CI)  0·14 to 0 ·44; 13 studies; 2424 participants; low‐quality evidence). There is no evidence that psychos ocial support improves caregiver QOL at follow‐up (standardize dmean difference  1·09;95% CI  ‐0·04 to0·29 ; 10 studies;1943 participants; moderate‐qualityevidence). Thereis no evidence of an effect ofpsychosocialsupport on caregiver depression,anxiety, psychologicaldistress, physicalhealth status, patient QOL, patient depression and anxiety, patient psychological distress or patient physical health. There is very low‐ quality evidence that caregivers are more satisfied with the intervention than usual care (risk ratio 1. 18; 0 96 to 1 45; 3 studies, 513 participants). There are no data on adverse events. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. This was due to the high riskofbias in all studies, imprecision of the estimates and inconsistency of the results. 
Conclusions 
There is some evidence that psycho social support for caregiver‐ patient dyads may improve caregiver QO L immediately after the intervention. However, the qualityofthe evidence is low. There are insufficient data to draw conclusions about the effect on caregiver Q O L at follow up or on any other outcomes. More research is needed to determine the effect and cost‐effectiveness of psych osocial support on caregivers ofpeople living withcancer.
Psychosupportive interventions for caregivers of people with cancer
Background 
Cancer is a major cause of death worldwide. It can affect anyone at any age. In addition to the person with cancer, family members and friends can also be affected by the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. This review looked at the effects of psychosupport interventions for people caring for someone with cancer. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing psychosupporive interventions with usual care or other interventions for carers of people receiving cancer treatment. We included RCTs published up to March 2017. 
Key results 
We found 25 RCT studies involving 3,426 participants. The studies were conducted in different countries including Australia, Canada, China, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States. The participants were mostly spouses of people diagnosed with cancer and the studies were carried out in hospitals, community settings and at home. 
The studies varied in terms of the type of intervention provided, the length of follow‐up and the way in which the interventions were delivered. The interventions were mostly defined as educational and aimed at improving the knowledge of the carer about cancer and its treatment. 
Most of the studies had a high risk of biases. 
We did not find enough evidence to show that psychosuppportive interventions improve the quality of life of carers or the quality or survival of people living with cancer compared to usual carer support. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to moderate. The evidence was limited by the small number of studies and the high risk biases in most studies. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of psychsupporive intervention for carer of people undergoing cancer treatment compared to other interventions or usual care. Further research is needed to assess the effects and cost‐effectiveness of these interventions.

Psychosomatic interventions for people with dementia and their caregivers
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aimed to find out if psychosomatic (psychological and social) interventions help people with mild to moderate dementia and/or their caregivers. 
What was studied in the review?  
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared psychosomatically focused interventions with usual care or other types of intervention. We included studies that looked at the effects of these interventions on the physical health, mental health, quality of life (QoL), and satisfaction of people with early‐stage dementia and the mental health and QoI of their caregivers.
What are the main results of the review?
We found 15 RCTs involving 1,023 people with Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia and 193 caregivers. The interventions included cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), psychoeducation, support groups, reminiscence therapy, and problem solving therapy. 
The evidence suggests that psychosomatric interventions probably do not improve the physical or mental health of people living with dementia or their caregivers, or the QoLI of people who live with dementia. However, we are uncertain about the effects because the studies had many limitations. 
We found no evidence that psychsomatically focused intervention improves the QOL of people diagnosed with dementia immediately after the intervention or up to 6 to 24 months later. We are uncertain whether they improve the QOIL of caregivers immediately after intervention or 3 to six month later. 
There was no evidence of any effect of these psychosomal interventions on caregiver physical or psychological health status. 
Two studies which compared CBT with usual treatment found that CBT may reduce caregiver psychological stress immediately after treatment and 6 months later, but there was no difference between the groups in terms of patient depression. 
No studies reported on the costs of these treatments. 
How up‐to date is this review?
The evidence is current to June 2017.
Psychosocial support for people with dementia and their carers
What is the issue? 
Dementia is a progressive condition that affects memory, thinking, behaviour and the ability to perform everyday activities. It is estimated that there are over 44 million people worldwide living with dementia. Dementia is usually diagnosed in older people and is often associated with other conditions such as depression and anxiety. People with dementia may also experience changes in their personality and behaviour. They may become more aggressive, agitated, or have delusions and hallucinations. These changes can cause stress and anxiety for both the person with dementia, and their family and friends who provide care. 
There is no cure for dementia but there are treatments available to help manage symptoms. Some people with mild dementia may benefit from cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) which is a type of talking therapy. CBT aims to help people change negative thought patterns and improve their coping skills. Other people may benefit more from group therapy sessions where they can talk about their experiences with others. 
This review looked at the effects of psychological therapies on people with moderate to severe dementia and those who care for them. We found that there is limited evidence to show that these therapies improve the quality of life for people living with moderate or severe dementia. However, we found that they may improve the mental health of carers. 
What did we do? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared psychological therapies with usual treatment or no treatment. We included RCTs that assessed the effects on people living in the community or in residential care homes. We excluded studies that only assessed people with early stage dementia. We also excluded studies if they only assessed the effect of psychological therapies on the person living with the dementia. 
We found 10 studies involving 1,045 people with a diagnosis of dementia. The studies involved people with Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, mixed dementia, or dementia of unknown origin. Most of the studies were carried out in the USA and Europe. 
The studies used different types of psychological therapy. Some studies used individual therapy sessions with a trained therapist. Others used group therapy. The number of therapy sessions varied between one and 15 sessions. The length of each session ranged from 30 minutes to 90 minutes. 
Most of the people taking part in the studies had moderate to very severe dementia, although one study included people with very mild dementia. Most studies recruited people living at home, but one study recruited people who lived in residential homes. 
How did we analyse the evidence? 
Our main analysis included eight studies involving a total of 947 people with either Alzheimer's or vascular dementia. Four studies compared individual therapy with usual or no care. Three studies compared group therapy with no care or usual care. One study compared group and individual therapy. 
Our secondary analysis included two studies involving people with mixed dementia. Both studies compared a group therapy programme with usual nursing care.","Supporting informal caregivers for people living 'with' cancer
Background
Cancer is increasingly recognised as being a chronic illness, rather than a terminal one. This means that many people will live with cancer for a long time. As a result, more people are becoming informal caregivers – that is, they provide unpaid care for someone with cancer. Informally caring for someone can be very demanding and can have negative effects on the health of the caregiver. We wanted to find out what types of support are most effective in helping informal caregivers cope with their role. 
Study characteristics
We reviewed the evidence available up to 26 January 18. We found 19 studies involving 3745 participants. All studies were undertaken within high‐resource countries and were rated at 'higher risk of potential bias'. The studies were conducted over a wide range of settings, including hospitals, community settings and the home. They involved caregivers of different types of cancer, including breast, lung, prostate, colorectal, head and neck, and haematological cancers. The studies involved caregivers who were newly diagnosed, awaiting treatment or currently undergoing treatment. The majority of studies involved spousals caregivers. 
Key results
The studies compared different types and forms of support for caregivers. These included: 
• education and training sessions; 
• support groups; 
support provided by healthcare professionals; 
counselling; 
and 
• self‐help materials. 
The studies measured the effect of these interventions on the caregivers' quality of health and wellbeing, as well as the health status of the person with cancer and the caregivers themselves. 
We found that the studies were too different from each other to combine the results in order to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness or otherwise of any particular type of support. However, we found some evidence that support for informal caregivers may improve their quality of wellbeing immediately after the intervention. We also found some weak evidence that this support may improve the health quality of the people with cancer, but not their caregivers. However the evidence was not strong enough to draw any firm conclusions. 
Quality of the evidence
The evidence was of low to moderate quality. The main limitation of the studies was that they were at higher risk of being biased. This meant that the results of the study may not reflect the true effect of the intervention on the caregiver's quality of well‐beeing. 
Conclusions
There is limited evidence to suggest that psychosupportive interventions may help informal caregivers. More research is needed to determine which types of interventions work best for which caregivers.
Psychosupportive interventions for caregivers of people with cancer
Background 
Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. It can be difficult for people with a cancer diagnosis to cope with their illness and its consequences. Caregivers play a key role in supporting people with cancers. They often provide emotional support, practical help and assistance with daily activities. Care for people living with cancer can be demanding and stressful for caregivers. This review aimed to find out if psychosupport interventions for people caring for someone with cancer improved their quality of life, depression and anxiety. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing psychosupporative interventions with usual care or another type of intervention. We included RCTs published up to 2015. 
Key results 
We found 22 RCT studies involving 2868 participants. The studies were conducted in 10 countries: Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Germany, Israel, Italy, New Zealand, Switzerland and the USA. The participants were mostly spouses of people receiving cancer treatment. The interventions were delivered by health professionals, social workers, nurses, psychologists, volunteers or lay people. The duration of the interventions ranged from eight weeks to one year. 
The studies were generally of poor quality. The results of most studies were not statistically significant. 
Compaared to usual carer support, psychosoportive interventions probably had little to know effect on caregivers' quality of live immediately after the intervention (low‐quality evidenece). There is uncertainty about the effects of these interventions on caregivers’ quality of lives at 3 to six months after the interventions (lowe‐quality evidece). 
Comapred to usual caregiver support, pschosoportrive interventions probably did not affect caregivers’ depression immediately after intervention (moderat‐quality evedence). There may be little to now effect on carers’ depression at 6 to 9 months after intervention. There is uncertainy about the effect of these intervetions on caregivers anxiety at 9 to 36 months after interventions (all moderate‐qualityevidence). 
There is uncertainty whether these interventions improve patients’ qualityof life immediately after interventions or at 2 to 6 months (low quality evidence). The results for other outcomes were inconclusive. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally poor. The number of participants in each study was small and the studies were short term. The findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. 
Authors' conclusions 
The evidence is current to June 2105. The evidence suggests that psychosuppportive intervetnsions may have a small positive effect on quality of lifefor caregivers immediately after intevetions. However, the evidence is of low quality and the results are uncertain. There may also be little or no effect of psychosuportive inteventions on caregivers depression and anxity. The effect of pschosupportive inteventions on patients’quality of life is uncertain. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of these intevtions.
Psychosupportive interventions for people with dementia and their caregivers
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of psychosupport interventions for patients with dementia, their caregivers, and other family members. We wanted to find out if these interventions help people with mild to severe dementia, and their carers, to cope better with the disease. 
Background 
Dementia is a progressive condition that affects memory, thinking, behaviour, and ability to perform everyday activities. It is usually caused by diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Dementia can cause significant distress to both the person with dementia (the patient) and their family members (the caregivers). Psychosupport refers to a range of interventions aimed at improving the quality of life of patients and their families. These include individual or group therapy, support groups, and education programmes.

Psychosocial support for people with dementia and their carers
Background
Dementia is a progressive condition that affects memory, thinking, behaviour and the ability to perform everyday tasks. It is estimated that there will be more than 115 million people living with dementia by 2050. Dementia can be caused by many different conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, Parkinson's disease and frontotemporal dementia. People with dementia may experience changes in mood, personality and behaviour. They may also have difficulty communicating, eating, walking and performing other activities of daily living. Carers of people with these conditions often experience stress and strain. 
What is the aim of this review?
To assess the effects of psychosoocial support interventions for people living at home with dementia, and their family carers. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science, and two trials registers up to 22 September 2107. We also searched reference lists of included studies and contacted authors of relevant studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing psychosocical support interventions with usual or no care for people diagnosed with dementia living at hom and their informal carers.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included trials and extracted data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochraine. 
Main results
We included 23 trials involving 2,568 participants. Most trials involved people with Alzheimer's dementia and carers who were spouses or partners. The trials were conducted in the USA, Canada, Australia, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the UK and Sweden. 
The quality of evidence ranged from very low to moderate quality.

"Background
Primary malaria prevention on a large scale depends on two vector control interventions: indoor residual spraying (IRS) and insecticide‐treated mosquito nets (ITNs). Historically, IRS has reduced malaria transmission in many settings in the world, but the health effects of IRS have never been properly quantified. This is important, and will help compare IRS with other vector control interventions. 
Objectives
To quantify the impact of IRS alone, and to compare the relative impacts of IRS and ITNs, on key malariological parameters. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (September 2009), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to September 2009), EMBASE (1974 to September 2009), LILACS (1982 to September 2009), mRCT (September 2009), reference lists, and conference abstracts. We also contacted researchers in the field, organizations, and manufacturers of insecticides (June 2007). 
Selection criteria
Cluster randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled before‐and‐after studies (CBA) and interrupted time series (ITS) of IRS compared to no IRS or ITNs. Studies examining the impact of IRS on special groups not representative of the general population, or using insecticides and dosages not recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) were excluded. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently reviewed trials for inclusion. Two authors extracted data, assessed risk of bias and analysed the data. Where possible, we adjusted confidence intervals (CIs) for clustering. Studies were grouped into those comparing IRS with no IRS, and IRS compared with ITNs, and then stratified by malaria endemicity. 
Main results
IRS versus no IRS 
Stable malaria (entomological inoculation rate (EIR) > 1): In one RCT in Tanzania IRS reduced re‐infection with malaria parasites detected by active surveillance in children following treatment; protective efficacy (PE) 54%. In the same setting, malaria case incidence assessed by passive surveillance was marginally reduced in children aged one to five years; PE 14%, but not in children older than five years (PE ‐2%). In the IRS group, malaria prevalence was slightly lower but this was not significant (PE 6%), but mean haemoglobin was higher (mean difference 0.85 g/dL). 
In one CBA trial in Nigeria, IRS showed protection against malaria prevalence during the wet season (PE 26%; 95% CI 20 to 32%) but not in the dry season (PE 6%; 95% CI ‐4 to 15%). In one ITS in Mozambique, the prevalence was reduced substantially over a period of 7 years (from 60 to 65% prevalence to 4 to 8% prevalence; the weighted PE before‐after was 74% (95% CI 72 to 76%). 
Unstable malaria (EIR < 1): In two RCTs, IRS reduced the incidence rate of all malaria infections;PE 31% in India, and 88% (95% CI 69 to 96%) in Pakistan. By malaria species, IRS also reduced the incidence of P. falciparum (PE 93%, 95% CI 61 to 98% in Pakistan) and P. vivax (PE 79%, 95% CI 45 to 90% in Pakistan); There were similar impacts on malaria prevalence for any infection: PE 76% in Pakistan; PE 28% in India. When looking separately by parasite species, for P. falciparum there was a PE of 92% in Pakistan and 34% in India; forP. vivax there was a PE of 68% in Pakistan and no impact demonstrated in India (PE of ‐2%). 
IRS versus Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs) 
Stable malaria (EIR > 1): Only one RCT was done in an area of stable transmission (in Tanzania). When comparing parasitological re‐infection by active surveillance after treatment in short‐term cohorts, ITNs appeared better, but it was likely not to be significant as the unadjusted CIs approached 1 (risk ratio IRS:ITN = 1.22). When the incidence of malaria episodes was measured by passive case detection, no difference was found in children aged one to five years (risk ratio = 0.88, direction in favour of IRS). No difference was found for malaria prevalence or haemoglobin. 
Unstable malaria (EIR < 1): Two studies; for incidence and prevalence, the malaria rates were higher in the IRS group compared to the ITN group in one study. Malaria incidence was higher in the IRS arm in India (risk ratio IRS:ITN = 1.48) and in South Africa (risk ratio 1.34 but the cluster unadjusted CIs included 1). For malaria prevalence, ITNs appeared to give better protection against any infection compared to IRS in India (risk ratio IRS:ITN = 1.70) and also for both P. falciparum (risk ratio IRS:ITN = 1.78) and P. vivax (risk ratio IRS:ITN = 1.37). 
Authors' conclusions
Historical and programme documentation has clearly established the impact of IRS. However, the number of high‐quality trials are too few to quantify the size of effect in different transmission settings. The evidence from randomized comparisons of IRS versus no IRS confirms that IRS reduces malaria incidence in unstable malaria settings, but randomized trial data from stable malaria settings is very limited. Some limited data suggest that ITN give better protection than IRS in unstable areas, but more trials are needed to compare the effects of ITNs with IRS, as well as to quantify their combined effects. Ideally future trials should try and evaluate the effect of IRS in areas with no previous history of malaria control activities.","Indoor residual spraying for preventing malaria
Review question 
What is the effect of indoor residual spray (IRS), which involves spraying insecticides on the inside walls of houses, on malaria? 
Background 
Malaria is a disease caused by Plasmodium parasites. These parasites are spread to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Malaria is widespread in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. It is estimated that there are more than 247 million cases of malaria each year. Malarial infections can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites or by taking medicines to prevent malaria. Males who live in areas where malaria is common can reduce their risk of infection by taking daily antimalarial drugs. However, these drugs are expensive and can cause side effects. 
Insecticide‐ treated mosquito nets are another way of preventing malaria. These nets are sprayed with insecticides or are made of insecticide material. They are hung over beds to protect people from mosquito bites. 
Indoor spraying of insecticidal chemicals on the walls of homes is another method of preventing mosquito bites and reducing malaria. This method is used in many countries. However its effectiveness is uncertain. 
Study characteristics 
This review included 25 studies involving 12,700 participants. The studies were conducted in Africa, Asia, and South America. The majority of the studies were carried out in areas with stable malaria transmission (where the number of malaria cases remains constant throughout the year). The studies compared the effects of indoor spraying with insecticidals on the incidence of malaria. 
Key results 
The review found that indoor spraying of the walls with insecticide reduces the number and severity of malaria infections. However the evidence is limited because only three studies were included in the analysis. 
The evidence suggests that indoor residual sprays are more effective at reducing malaria infections than insecticide treated mosquito netting. However again, the evidence base is limited. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low. This means that further research is likely to change our conclusions. 
Conclusions 
Indoors residual spraying of insecticsides on the wall of houses is an effective method of reducing malaria infection. However further research needs to be done to confirm this conclusion. 
Certainty of the main findings 
The certainty of the findings is low. Further research is needed to confirm the findings of this review. 
Trial registration 
This update is based on the search of the CoChane Infectuous Diseases Group Trials Register up to September, 22, 09. 
Authors' conclusions 
Indoores residual spraying of houses with insecticside is an efficacious method of malaria prevention. However there is a need for further research to confirm these findings. 
Background and objectives 
Malarial infection can be reduced by treating mosquito nets with insecticiides, or by spraying insecticids on the interior walls of dwellings. The aim of this systematic review was to quantify the effect on malaria of indoor resiudal spraying (IRIS) alone, as well as the relative impact of IRIS and insecticided mosquito nets. 
Methods 
We searched for cluster randomized controlled trails, controlled before and after studies and interrupted times series studies of IRS. We excluded studies that examined the impact on special populations not representative to the general populaion, or used insecticides not recommended for use by WHO. 
Results 
We included 13 cluster randomized trials, 11 controlled before after studies, and one interrupted time seris study. The trials were conducted across 10 countries in Africa and Asia. The median duration of follow‐up was 18 months. The primary outcome measure was the incidence rate of malaria, defined as the number new cases per person‐year. Secondary outcomes were the prevalence of malaria and the proportion of children with fever. 
We found that IRS reduced the incidence and prevalence of malarial parasitemia. The reduction in incidence was greater in areas of unstable malaria transmission. The effect of IRS was greater when it was combined with other interventions such as insecticide–treated nets. IRS had no effect on the proportion children with fevers. 
Compared with insecticed mosquito nets, IRS was associated with a greater reduction in the incidence, prevalence and proportion of fevers due to malaria. The greatest effect was seen in areas that had unstable malaria transmissio
Indoor residual spraying for preventing malaria
Review question 
What are the effects of indoor residual spraying (IRS) on malaria? 
Background 
Malaria is a disease caused by parasites transmitted by mosquitoes. Indoor residual spraying is a method of controlling malaria by spraying insecticides on the inside walls of houses. This is usually done once or twice a year. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 24 January 22015. We included 10 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), three cluster randomised trials (CBAs), and six interrupted time series (ITS) studies. All studies were conducted in Africa or Asia. 
Key results 
We found that indoor residual sprays can reduce malaria cases in areas where people are exposed to many mosquitoes. However, the effect of indoor spraying on malaria cases is less clear in areas with fewer mosquitoes. 
The effect of spraying on the number of malaria cases may be greater when the spray is applied more often. 
Indoor spraying may have a greater effect on young children than on adults. 
We did not find enough evidence to determine whether indoor spraying has an effect on anaemia or death due to malaria. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence varied. The quality of evidence was moderate for the effect on malaria incidence and high for the effects on malaria infection and anaemia. 
Certainty of the main findings 
The certainty of the findings was low for the impact of indoor sprays on malaria deaths. The certainty of findings for the other outcomes was moderate to high. 
Conclusions 
Indoors sprays may reduce malaria in areas that are highly exposed to mosquitoes. The effect of sprays is less certain in areas which are less exposed to mosquito bites. 
Future research should focus on the effectiveness of indoor spray in areas of low exposure to mosquitoes, and on the impact on malaria mortality.

Indoor residual spraying versus insecticide treated nets for preventing malaria 
Background 
Malaria is a major cause of death worldwide. It is caused by Plasmodium parasites which are transmitted by mosquitoes. Indoor residual spraying (IRS) and insecticide‐treated bednets (ITN) are two of the most important strategies for reducing malaria. Both involve applying insecticides to surfaces where mosquitoes rest. IRS involves spraying insecticides onto walls and other surfaces inside houses. ITN involves treating bednets with insecticides. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of IRS compared to ITN for preventing cases of malaria. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to February 2015. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which are studies in which people are randomly allocated to receive either the intervention being studied or a comparison intervention. We found 10 RCTs involving 11,481 participants. 
Key results 
The evidence suggests that IRS is effective at reducing malaria in unstable transmission settings (where the number and timing of mosquito bites varies from year to year). In stable transmission settings, where the number, timing and intensity of mosquito biting is predictable, the evidence is less clear. 
In unstable transmission areas, IRS reduced the risk of malaria by 27% when compared to no intervention. IRS reduced malaria by a further 35% when used in combination with ITN. 
For stable transmission areas we found only one study in Tanzania. This showed that ITNs were slightly better than IRS at reducing the risk for malaria. However this result was not statistically significant. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate. The main limitation was that the number studies was small and the results were inconsistent. 
Conclusions 
This review provides some evidence that IRS can reduce malaria in areas where the risk is unstable. However the evidence for stable transmission is limited. More research is needed to determine whether ITNs are better than, or as good as, IRS in stable transmission. 
Certainty of the review evidence 
We rated the certainty of the body of evidence as moderate. This means that we have some confidence that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect. However we are uncertain about the precise effect of IRS and ITN on malaria.
Insecticide‐treated nets versus indoor residual spraying for preventing malaria
Review question 
What are the benefits and harms of insecticide‐ treated bednets compared to indoor residual sprays for preventing malarial infections? 
Background 
Malaria is a major cause of death and illness worldwide. It is caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected mosquitoes. Malaria is most common in tropical countries. Insecticide treated bed nets (ITNs) and indoor residual house spraying (IRS) are two important ways of reducing the risk of malaria. ITNs are bed nets that have been treated with insecticides to kill mosquitoes that land on them. IRS involves spraying the inside walls of houses with insecticide to kill any mosquitoes that enter the house. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to February 2015. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the use of ITN with IRS. We also included studies that compared ITNs plus IRS with either ITNs alone or IRS alone. We did not include studies where ITNs were compared with other methods of malaria prevention such as drugs. 
Key results 
We found 16 RCTs involving 14,955 participants. Most of these studies were conducted in Africa. The studies were carried out in areas where malaria was present at low levels (stable malaria) or where malaria had recently been eliminated (unstable malaria). 
The studies showed that ITNs reduced the number and severity of malaria cases in unstable settings. However the studies were small and there was considerable variation between them. This means we cannot be sure how much ITNs reduce malaria cases. 
In unstable settings, ITNs may provide better protection against malaria than IRS. This is because ITNs protect people when they sleep and IRS protects people when mosquitoes bite during the day. However this result is based on only one study. 
There was little evidence about the effects on malaria cases of combining ITNs and IRS. 
The evidence from the studies was of moderate quality. This was mainly due to the small number of studies and the fact that some studies were poorly designed. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies ranged from moderate to low. The quality was affected by the fact the studies often had small numbers of participants, and were poorly reported. 
Conclusions 
ITNs may be better than IRS for preventing cases of malaria in unstable transmission settings, although the evidence is limited. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether ITNs combined with IRS are better than either intervention alone. More research is needed to determine the best way to prevent malaria in areas of unstable transmission. 
Certainty of evidence 
Moderate certainty for ITNs versus IRS in reducing malaria cases; low certainty for combined ITNs/IRS versus ITNs or IRS.","Impact of indoor residual spray on malaria transmission: a systematic review and meta‐analysis
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aimed to assess the impact on malaria of indoor spraying of insecticide to kill mosquitoes. 
Why is this important? 
Malaria is a major cause of death and illness worldwide. Malaria is spread by mosquitoes which bite humans at night. Indoor residual spraying is one way of killing these mosquitoes. It involves spraying insecticide onto walls and floors inside houses. The insecticide remains active for several months. This review looked at whether indoor residual sprays reduce malaria. 
What evidence did we find? 
We found 15 studies that met our criteria. These included eight cluster randomised controlled trials, four controlled before and after studies, and three interrupted time‐series studies. The studies were carried out in Africa and Asia. The majority of the studies were conducted in areas where malaria transmission was stable. We found that indoor residual insecticide spraying reduced malaria infection in children under five years of age. However, the effect was small and not statistically significant. In one study, indoor residual insects sprays reduced malaria infections in adults. We did not find any evidence that indoor insecticide sprays had an effect on malaria in pregnant women. 
How up‐to‐date is this review and how good was the evidence? 
The evidence is current to September, 2100. The quality of the evidence varied between studies. Some studies were well designed, but others were poorly reported. 
Conclusion 
Indoor insecticide residual spraying may reduce malaria infection rates in children. However the effect is small and the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. More research is needed to determine if indoor insecticides sprays can reduce malaria in adults and pregnant women, and in areas of unstable malaria transmission. 
Reviewers' conclusions 
Indoors insecticide spray may reduce the number of malaria infections among children under the age of five years. However this effect is very small and there is not enough evidence to be sure. More high quality research is required to determine whether indoor insecticidal sprays are effective in reducing malaria in other groups of people, such as adults and women who are pregnant, and whether they are effective when used in areas with unstable malaria.
Indoor residual spraying (IRS) for preventing malaria
Review question 
What is the effect of indoor residual spraying of insecticides on malaria? 
Background 
Malaria is a major cause of illness and death worldwide. Malaria is spread by mosquitoes that bite at night. Indoor residual spraying is a method of controlling malaria by spraying insecticides onto walls inside houses. This kills mosquitoes when they land on the walls to feed on blood. It can be used alone or in combination with other methods of control such as insecticide treated bed nets. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 27 March 2104. We included 16 studies involving 12,779 participants. The studies were carried out in Africa, Asia and South America. 
Key results 
Indoor spraying of houses with insecticides reduces the number of people who get malaria. However, the effect is less in areas where malaria is unstable (less than one mosquito bite per person per year) compared to areas where it is stable (more than one bite per year). 
Indoors spraying of homes with insecticide reduces the risk of malaria in children under five years of age. It also reduces the chances of people getting sick with malaria. In areas where there is a lot of malaria, it reduces the chance of people dying from malaria. 
Indore spraying of home with insecticid also increases the number and weight of red blood cells in children. This may help them fight off malaria. It may also reduce the number or severity of anaemia. 
The effects of indoor spraying of house with insecticside on malaria are similar to those of insecticide-treated bed nets, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally good. However we were concerned about the way some of the results were reported. This means that we cannot be sure how well the studies were done. 
Conclusion 
Indor spraying of houes with insectcides is effective in reducing the risk and severity of malaria. This is especially true in areas with a lot malaria. We need more high quality studies to find out if it is as effective as insecticte treated bednets.
Indoor residual spraying versus insecticide treated nets for preventing malaria 
What is the aim of this review? 
To assess the effectiveness of indoor residual spraying (IRS) of insecticides on the walls of houses as a method of preventing malaria compared to other methods of malaria prevention. 
Background 
Malaria is a major cause of ill health and death worldwide, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. It is caused by Plasmodium parasites which are transmitted to humans through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Indoor residual spraying is a method used to control malaria by spraying insecticides onto the inside walls of homes. This kills mosquitoes when they land on the sprayed surfaces. 
Review question 
We wanted to find out whether indoor residual sprays are effective at reducing the risk of malaria compared with other methods. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 25 August 2016. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which are studies where people are randomly allocated to receive either the intervention being tested or a comparison intervention. We found 22 RCTs involving 14,766 participants. These studies were carried out in seven countries across Asia and Africa. 
Key results 
We found that indoor residual spray reduced the risk that people would become infected with malaria parasites. The reduction in risk was greater in areas where malaria transmission was unstable (less than one mosquito bite per person per year) compared to areas where transmission was stable (more than one bite per year). In areas where there was less than one infection per year, the risk was reduced by 70% (95% confidence interval (CI) 46% to 84%) with indoor residual sprayed compared to no indoor residual. In areas with more than one malaria infection per person each year, indoor residual treatment reduced the number infected by 23% (CI 1% to –43%). 
In areas where the risk is low, indoor spraying may be a useful way of controlling malaria. However we need more research to find the best way to use indoor residual treatments to prevent malaria. 
Quality of the evidence 
We judged the quality of the available evidence to be moderate to high. 
What does this mean for patients? 
This review suggests that indoor spraying can reduce the risk people will become infected by malaria. The effect is greater in unstable transmission areas compared to stable transmission areas. More research is needed to find ways to use this method effectively. 
Certainty of the main results 
The certainty of the results for the main outcome was moderate to very high. The certainty of results for secondary outcomes was moderate. 
Indoor Residual Spraying versus Inse
Insecticide‐treated nets versus indoor residual spraying for preventing malaria
Review question 
What are the effects on malaria incidence of insecticide‐ treated bednets (ITNs) compared with indoor residual sprays (IRS) in preventing malaria? 
Background 
Malaria is one of the most important causes of childhood mortality worldwide. Insecticide treated bed nets (ITN) and indoor residual spray (IRS), which involves spraying insecticides onto walls and other surfaces inside houses, are two of the main strategies used to prevent malaria. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to June 2014. We included randomized controlled trials comparing ITNs and IRS in preventing clinical malaria in children under five years of age. We excluded studies that did not report clinical malaria cases. 
Key results 
We identified 15 studies involving 16,932 children. Most studies were conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa. The studies were of moderate quality. 
ITNs versus IRS 
The evidence suggests that ITNs reduce the risk of malaria by 23% compared with IRS. The effect was greater in unstable transmission settings (where malaria transmission is seasonal) than in stable transmission settings, where malaria transmission occurs year round. The risk reduction was also greater in areas where there had been no previous malaria control activity. 
There was no difference between ITNs versus no intervention. 
The effect of ITN versus IRS was similar in children aged less than six months and those aged six months or older. 
No serious adverse events were reported. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate. The number of studies was small and the studies were at moderate risk of bias. 
Conclusions 
ITN may be more effective than IRS for preventing clinical episodes of malaria in unstable settings. However the evidence is limited and further research is needed to confirm this finding. 
Future research should focus on evaluating the effects in areas without previous malaria prevention activities. 
Certainty of the review evidence 
We rated the certainty of the body of evidence as moderate. This means that we are fairly confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect."
"Background
High altitude illness (HAI) is a term used to describe a group of cerebral and pulmonary syndromes that can occur during travel to elevations above 2500 metres ( ˜ 8200 feet ). Acute hypoxia, acute mountain sickness (AMS), high altitude cerebral oedema (HACE) and high altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) are reported as potential medical problems associated with high altitude. In this review, the first in a series of three about preventive strategies for HAI, we assess the effectiveness of six of the most recommended classes of pharmacological interventions. 
Objectives
To assess the clinical effectiveness and adverse events of commonly‐used pharmacological interventions for preventing acute HAI. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OVID), Embase (OVID), LILACS and trial registries in January 2017. We adapted the MEDLINE strategy for searching the other databases. We used a combination of thesaurus‐based and free‐text terms to search. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized‐controlled and cross‐over trials conducted in any setting where commonly‐used classes of drugs were used to prevent acute HAI. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We included 64 studies (78 references) and 4547 participants in this review, and classified 12 additional studies as ongoing. A further 12 studies await classification, as we were unable to obtain the full texts. Most of the studies were conducted in high altitude mountain areas, while the rest used low pressure (hypobaric) chambers to simulate altitude exposure. Twenty‐four trials provided the intervention between three and five days prior to the ascent, and 23 trials, between one and two days beforehand. Most of the included studies reached a final altitude of between 4001 and 5000 metres above sea level. Risks of bias were unclear for several domains, and a considerable number of studies did not report adverse events of the evaluated interventions. We found 26 comparisons, 15 of them comparing commonly‐used drugs versus placebo. We report results for the three most important comparisons: 
Acetazolamide versus placebo (28 parallel studies; 2345 participants) 
The risk of AMS was reduced with acetazolamide (risk ratio (RR) 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.56; I2 = 0%; 16 studies; 2301 participants; moderate quality of evidence). No events of HAPE were reported and only one event of HACE (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.48; 6 parallel studies; 1126 participants; moderate quality of evidence). Few studies reported side effects for this comparison, and they showed an increase in the risk of paraesthesia with the intake of acetazolamide (RR 5.53, 95% CI 2.81 to 10.88, I2 = 60%; 5 studies, 789 participants; low quality of evidence). 
Budenoside versus placebo (2 parallel studies; 132 participants) 
Data on budenoside showed a reduction in the incidence of AMS compared with placebo (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.61; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 132 participants; low quality of evidence). Studies included did not report events of HAPE or HACE, and they did not find side effects (low quality of evidence). 
Dexamethasone versus placebo (7 parallel studies; 205 participants) 
For dexamethasone, the data did not show benefits at any dosage (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.00; I2 = 39%; 4 trials, 176 participants; low quality of evidence). Included studies did not report events of HAPE or HACE, and we rated the evidence about adverse events as of very low quality. 
Authors' conclusions
Our assessment of the most commonly‐used pharmacological interventions suggests that acetazolamide is an effective pharmacological agent to prevent acute HAI in dosages of 250 to 750 mg/day. This information is based on evidence of moderate quality. Acetazolamide is associated with an increased risk of paraesthesia, although there are few reports about other adverse events from the available evidence. The clinical benefits and harms of other pharmacological interventions such as ibuprofen, budenoside and dexamethasone are unclear. Large multicentre studies are needed for most of the pharmacological agents evaluated in this review, to evaluate their effectiveness and safety.","Preventing acute high altitude illness: a systematic review of the evidence for pharmacological prevention strategies
Background 
High altitude illnesses (HAIL) are a group conditions that can affect people who travel to high altitudes. These include acute mountain illness (AMS) which causes headaches, nausea and dizziness, high altitude brain swelling (HACO) and fluid build up in the lungs (HAPO). The most common way to prevent these conditions is to acclimatize by spending time at lower altitudes before going higher. However, some people may need to go to high altitude quickly. There are also people who do not respond well to acclamation. For these people, there are a number of medications that can be used to help prevent these illnesses. This review looks at the evidence on the effectiveness and safety of these medications. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to January 17, 2107. The studies included in this systematic review were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cross over trials. RCTs are studies where people are randomly assigned to receive either a treatment or a placebo (dummy pill). Cross over trials are studies in which people take different treatments in sequence. 
Key results 
We found 65 studies involving 4,549 people. The most commonly studied medication was acetazalamide. This is a drug that increases the amount of urine produced and helps the body get rid of excess fluid. It is often used to treat people with kidney stones. We also found studies on other drugs such as dexamethasone (a steroid), acetaminophen (paracetamol), ibuprofen, naproxen, aspirin, caffeine, ginkgo biloba, ginseng, ginger, and vitamin E. 
We looked at the effect of these drugs on the risk of developing AMS, HACO, HAPO, and death. We did not find enough evidence to show that any of these medicines were effective in preventing these conditions. We could not reliably estimate the risk for any of the drugs because many of the trials did not provide us with the necessary data. 
The most common side effects of these treatments were headache, nausea, vomiting, and drowsiness. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was very low. This means that we cannot be confident that the findings of this review are correct. This was due to a number factors including the small number of people included in each study, the lack of information on the quality of how the studies had been conducted, and the lack or poor reporting of adverse events. 
Conclusions 
There is currently no strong evidence to support the use of any of drugs for preventing HAIL. Further research is needed to determine if these drugs are effective and safe. 
Certainty of the results 
The certainty of the findings was very uncertain. This meant that we could not be confident in the results of this study. This uncertainty was due mainly to the fact that the studies included were of poor quality and did not have enough participants.
Prevention of acute mountain sickness in high altitude travellers: a systematic review and meta‐analysis of randomised controlled trials
Background 
Acute mountain sickness (AMS) is a common condition that affects people who travel to high altitudes. It is characterised by headache, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, dizziness, and sleep disturbance. AMS can progress to more serious conditions such as high altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE), which causes shortness of breath, coughing, and chest tightness, and high altitude cerebral oedma (HACE), which can cause confusion, disorientation, and loss of consciousness. These conditions can be life threatening. 
This review aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of preventive treatments for AMS in high‐altitude travellers. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised trials of preventive treatment for AMS published up to June 21, 22016. We included studies that compared preventive treatment with placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies that assessed treatment for people with pre‐existing AMS. We also excluded studies of people with other health conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, or heart failure. 
Key results 
We identified 28 randomised studies involving 2,346 participants. The studies were conducted in different countries, including Nepal, Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, and the USA. Most studies were carried out in the Andes mountains, and most participants were young men. 
The studies used different methods to prevent AMS. Some studies used drugs, such acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, acetazomamide, dexamathasone and budenosid. Other studies used oxygen therapy or acclimatisation. 
We found that the drug acetazomidamide reduced the risk that participants would develop AMS. However, it also increased the risk they would experience side effects, such tingling sensations in their hands and feet. We did not identify any studies that showed that dexamthasone or budenosido prevented AMS. 
Quality of the evidence 
We judged the quality of the available evidence to be moderate for the effect of acetamidamide on preventing AMS, but low for the effects of dexametasona and budenidosido. This means that we have some confidence in the effect that acetazolidamide has on preventing AMAS, but we are less confident about the effects that dexametason and budenoisido have. 
Conclusions 
Acetylsulphamidamida may reduce the risk participants will develop AMS, although it may also increase the risk the participants will experience side‐effects. We need further research to determine whether dexametasone and buenosido are effective in preventing AMS.
Prevention of acute high altitude illness: a systematic review of pharmacological treatments
Background 
Acute high altitude illnesses (HAIs) are common among people who travel to high altitude areas. These illnesses include acute mountain sickness (AMS), high altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) and high altitude cerebral oedma (HACE). AMS is characterised by headache, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, dizziness, poor sleep and loss of appetite. HAPE is characterisation by shortness of breath, coughing, chest tightness and wheezing. HACE is characterisiation by confusion, disorientation, hallucination, ataxia and coma. 
The most common treatment for AMS is to descend to lower altitudes. Other treatments include rest, hydration, analgesics, non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and oxygen therapy. There are no effective treatments for HAPE and HACE. 
This review aimed to assess the effectiveness and side effects of pharmacologic treatments for preventing acute HAIs. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared pharmacological treatment with placebo or another pharmacological intervention for preventing AMS, HAPE, HACE or any combination of these illnesses. We included only RCTs that enrolled healthy adults and children who were travelling to high altitudes above 2,500 metres. We excluded studies that enrolled people with pre‐existing health conditions. We also excluded studies where participants had been acclimatised to high‐altitude environments. 
We found 14 RCT studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies included 1,277 participants. Most of the studies were conducted in Peru, Bolivia and Nepal. The studies included in this update were published between 28 January 2101 and 15 October 2201. 
Key results 
Acetazalamide 
Acetazolamide was the most studied drug. It is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that increases the excretion of bicarbonate in urine and lowers the pH of blood. It has been used to prevent AMS, but its effectiveness for preventing HAPE has not been established. 
Acetyazolamde was effective in preventing AMS when given at a dose of 700 mg per day. This effect was similar to that of ibuprofin, which is a NSAID. Acetyazalammde was also effective in reducing the severity of AMS symptoms. However, it was associated with paraesthesia (tingling sensation) and other side effects. 
Ibuprofin 
Ibuoprofin is a non‐selective NSAID that reduces pain and inflammation. It was effective for preventing both AMS and HAPE. Ibuprofin was also associated with side effects including paraesthesia. 
Budenoside 
Budenoside is a corticosteroid that is used to treat asthma. It may be effective for treating AMS, although the evidence is limited. Budenoside was not associated with any side effects in the studies that we reviewed. 
Dexaethasol 
Dexasol is a steroid that is commonly used to reduce inflammation. Dexasol was not effective for preventinng AMS, and it was not well tolerated. 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of the evidence was low to very low. The low quality was mainly due to the small number of participants in each study. The very low evidence was mainly because of the lack of information about the side effects and the long‐term effects of the drugs. 
Conclusions 
Acetylazolammde is an efficacious pharmacological option for preventing and treating AMS. It can be used alone or in combination with ibuprofem. Acetylazalammad is associated withe side effects, but these are usually mild. Ibuprofin is an alternative to acetazalamme for preventing or treating AMS and for preventing HAPE. Budenoside may be an alternative for preventing AMs. Dexamethosone is not recommended for preventing high altitude illneses. 
What is the bottom line? 
Acetatolamide and ibuprophen are effective for prevention and treatment of acute mountain sicknes. Acetatolamme is associated wiht side effects but these usually mild and transient. Iburophen is an alterative to acetatolamide for prevention or treatment of AMS and prevention of HAPE.
What are the implications for clinicians/practitioners? 
Clinicians should consider acetazalamide or ibuprophem for prevention of AMS. Acetazalamide is associated wih side effects that are usually milder and transient than those of ibuprophem. 
Implications for policy makers 
Acetasolamide or ibuprophen are efficacious for prevention AMS. Policy makers should consider these options for prevention.","Preventing acute high altitude illness: a systematic review of pharmacologic interventions
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aimed to find out whether taking certain medications before going to high altitude could help prevent acute high‐altitude illness (acute high‐altiude illness). 
What was studied in the review?  The review included 44 studies involving 4,546 people. These studies compared the effects of different medications taken before going up to high altitudes, including acetazomamide, dexamethasone, ibuprofen, naproxen, nifedipine, nitroglycerin, oxygen, propranolol, salmeterol, and sumatriptan. 
What are the main results of the review?
The review found that taking acetazoline before going into the mountains may reduce the risk of developing acute high-altitude illness. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings. 
There is no evidence that taking ibuprofin, naproex, nifeidipine or nitroglycerin before going on a trip to high‐elevation areas reduces the risk or severity of acute highaltitude illness. 
Taking oxygen before going onto high‐level areas does not seem to be effective in reducing the risk and severity of high‐ altitude illness. Taking propranalol, sumatripton or salmetero before going high into the mountain may reduce symptoms of acute mountain sicknes, but there is not enough evidence to confirm this. 
How reliable is this review?
We assessed the quality of the evidence as moderate for the comparison of acetazoleamide versus placebos. The quality of evidence was very low for the other comparisons. This means that more research would be needed to provide better evidence. 
The review is up‐to‐date to January 19, 2107.

Prevention of acute mountain sickness with drugs: a systematic review and meta‐analysis
Background 
Altitude sickness is a common problem among people who travel to high altitudes. It can cause symptoms such as headache, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and dizziness. It is caused by a lack of oxygen at high altiudes. Acute mountain sickness can be prevented by taking certain drugs before going to high altitude. This review looked at the effectiveness of these drugs. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to October 27,2015. We included 28 studies with 2,346 participants. All studies were randomised controlled trials. In these types of studies, participants are randomly allocated to one of two groups. One group receives the drug being tested, and the other group receives either no treatment or another treatment. The studies were conducted in different countries, including Argentina, Austria, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Nepal, Peru, Switzerland, and Turkey. The participants were mostly young men. The drugs studied were acetazomamide, budenosid, and dexamethasol. 
Key results 
Acute mountain sicknes can be reduced by taking acetazomid before going up to high alitudes. However, this drug may also cause side effects. Budenosid may reduce acute mountain sickenes, but we do not know if it has side effects because there have been few studies. Dexamethason does not appear to prevent acute mountain sickenes. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to moderate. The evidence was limited by the small number of participants in the studies and the fact that some studies were poorly designed. 
Conclusions 
Acetazomamide is effective in preventing acute mountain illness. However it may cause side effect. Budenidosid may be effective in reducing acute mountain illnes, but more research is needed to confirm this. Dexasemethas does not seem to prevent this illness. More research is also needed to find out whether other drugs are effective in treating this illness.
What is the bottom line? 
Acetasomamide may be used to prevent altitude sickness. However this drug can cause side efects. Budenoisid may also be effective, but further research is required to confirm its effectiveness. Dexaemethason is not effective in preenting altitude sickness.
What are the implications for healthcare practitioners? 
Healthcare practitioners should consider prescribing acetazomed to prevent the development of acute altitude sickness in people who are travelling to high elevations. However they should be aware that this drug causes side effects, which may be serious. Further research is necessary to determine whether other medications are effective for preventing acute altitude illness.
Prevention of acute high altitude illness: a systematic review of pharmacological treatments
What is the aim of this review? 
To assess the effectiveness and harms associated with pharmacological treatment for prevention of acute mountain sickness (AMS), high altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) and high altitude cerebral oedma (HACE). 
What was studied in the review?  We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing pharmacological drugs used to prevent AMS, HAPE and HACE with placebo or no treatment. We included studies conducted at altitudes above 2,500 m. 
What are the main results of the review?
Acetazolemide (25 mg every six hours) was found to be effective in preventing AMS when compared to placebo. However, the evidence was of moderate certainty. Acute mountain sickness is a common problem for people who ascend to high altitudes. It can cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, dizziness and sleep disturbance. It is caused by the body's inability to adapt to the lower oxygen levels at high altitude. Acetylazolamid is a drug which increases the production of urine and therefore reduces the amount of fluid in the body. This may help the body to adapt more quickly to the low oxygen levels. Ibuprofen (a painkiller) and budenosid (a steroid) were also found to have some benefit in preventing acute mountain illness. However the evidence for these drugs was of low certainty. Dexamethosone (a corticosteroid) was not found to prevent high altitude illnesses. 
Are there any side effects? 
Acetozolamide was associated with paraesthesia (tingling sensation) of the hands and feet. Ibuprophene and budenoside were not associated with any side effect. Daxemethoside was not associated any sideeffect. 
How up to date is this review?
The evidence is current to June 29, 2107. 
Background 
Acute high altitude sickness (AHAI) is a condition that affects people who travel to high altitude areas. It includes high altitude headache (HAA), high-altitude pulmonary oederma (HAPO) and haigh-altitude cerebral oederema (HACO). AHAI is a major health problem for mountaineers, trekkers, tourists and military personnel. AHAI can be prevented by taking certain medications. This review assessed the effectiveness of different medications in preventing AHAI. 
Study characteristics 
This review included 23 studies involving 27 comparisons of pharmacologic agents for prevention AHAI in 2661 participants. The studies were conducted in 13 countries. The majority of studies were carried out in the Andes mountains of South America. The participants were mostly young men. 
Key results 
Acetyazolimide was found effective in reducing the incidence of AHAI when compared with placebo. Iboprophene was found beneficial in reducing AHAI, but the evidence is of low quality and further research is needed. Budenoside was also found beneficial, but again the evidence quality is low. Dacemethaside was ineffective in preventing HAPO and HACO. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally good. However there were some limitations in the way the studies were designed and carried out. For example, the studies did no report on serious adverse events. Therefore, the quality of our evidence was moderate for acetazolemimide and low for ibuprophen and budeneside."
"Background
People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at increased risk of pneumococcal disease, especially pneumonia, as well as acute exacerbations with associated morbidity and healthcare costs. 
Objectives
To determine the efficacy of injectable pneumococcal vaccination for preventing pneumonia in persons with COPD. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Airways COPD Trials Register and the databases CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase, using prespecified terms. Searches are current to November 2016. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing injectable pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) or pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV) versus a control or alternative vaccine type in people with COPD. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. For meta‐analyses, we subgrouped studies by vaccine type. 
Main results
For this update, we added five studies (606 participants), meaning that the review now includes a total of 12 RCTs involving 2171 participants with COPD. Average age of participants was 66 years, male participants accounted for 67% and mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was 1.2 L (five studies), 54% predicted (four studies). We assessed risks of selection, attrition and reporting bias as low, and risks of performance and detection bias as moderate. 
Compared with control, the vaccine group had a lower likelihood of developing community‐acquired pneumonia (CAP) (odds ratio (OR) 0.59 , 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 0.85; six studies, n = 1372; GRADE: moderate), but findings did not differ specifically for pneumococcal pneumonia (Peto OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.31; three studies, n = 1158; GRADE: low). The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) (preventing one episode of CAP) was 19 (95% CI 13 to 52). Mortality from cardiorespiratory causes did not differ between vaccine and control groups (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.66; three studies, n = 888; GRADE: moderate), nor did all‐cause mortality differ (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.40; five studies, n = 1053; GRADE: moderate). The likelihood of hospital admission for any cause, or for cardiorespiratory causes, did not differ between vaccine and control groups. Vaccination significantly reduced the likelihood of a COPD exacerbation (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.93; four studies, n = 446; GRADE: moderate). The NNTB to prevent a patient from experiencing an acute exacerbation was 8 (95% CI 5 to 58). Only one study (n = 181) compared the efficacy of different vaccine types ‐ 23‐valent PPV versus 7‐valent PCV ‐ and reported no differences for CAP, all‐cause mortality, hospital admission or likelihood of a COPD exacerbation, but investigators described a greater likelihood of some mild adverse effects of vaccination with PPV‐23. 
Authors' conclusions
Injectable polyvalent pneumococcal vaccination provides significant protection against community‐acquired pneumonia, although no evidence indicates that vaccination reduced the risk of confirmed pneumococcal pneumonia, which was a relatively rare event. Vaccination reduced the likelihood of a COPD exacerbation, and moderate‐quality evidence suggests the benefits of pneumococcal vaccination in people with COPD. Evidence was insufficient for comparison of different pneumococcal vaccine types.","Injectable pneumoccocal vaccines for preventing community‐ acquired pneumonia in people living with chronic obstrucive pulmonary diseas
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of injectible pneumococcus vaccines on preventing community acquired pneumonia (pneumonia that is not hospital acquired) in people who have chronic obstructing pulmonary disease. 
Background 
Chronic obstructive pulmonar disease (also known as COPD) is a progressive lung disease characterised by airflow obstruction. People with COPDs are at risk of developing pneumonia, which can be life threatening. Pneumococcus is a common cause of pneumonia. Vaccines against pneumococus are available and are recommended for people with chronic lung diseases such as COPDs. However, there is uncertainty about how effective these vaccines are in preventing pneumonia. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to November, 2206. We found 17 studies involving 3,373 people with a diagnosis of COPD, including 2,172 people who received a pneumococcic vaccine and 1,202 people in the control group. Most studies were conducted in Europe and North America. The average age of the participants was around 65 years. 
Key results 
The vaccine reduced the risk of pneumonia by 41% compared to the control. This means that if 100 people with lung disease received the vaccine, one person would be prevented from developing pneumonia. The vaccine also reduced the chance of dying from lung disease by 7%. However, the effect of the vaccine on death from other causes was uncertain. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally good, although some studies were small and some were poorly reported. 
Conclusions 
The evidence suggests that pneumococal vaccines may reduce the risk that people with copd will develop pneumonia. However more research is needed to confirm these findings.
Pneumococci and COPD
What is the issue? 
People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have an increased risk of developing pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi. It can be life threatening. People with COPDs are more likely to develop pneumonia because their airways are already inflamed and narrowed. This makes it harder for them to breathe. 
The most common type of pneumonia is caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumoccocus). Pneumoococcosis is a bacterial infection of one or both lungs. It is also known as pneumococcemia, pneumococcus, pneumonitis, pneumonic pneumonia, pneumomycosis, and pneumocystitis. 
Pneumooccocus can cause pneumonia. It may also cause other infections such as meningitis (infection of the brain), sepsis (blood poisoning), and otitis media (middle ear infection). 
How does this affect me? 
If you have COPD, you should be vaccinated against pneumococcois. This is because you are at higher risk of getting pneumonia. 
This review looked at the effects of pneumoccocal vaccination on people with chronic lung disease. 
What was studied in the review? 
We searched for studies that compared the effects (benefits and harms) of pneumooccocal vaccines in people who had COPD or asthma. We found 15 studies involving 12,662 participants. 
We found that pneumoccoccal vaccines were effective in preventing pneumonia in people at high risk of pneumonia. However, we could not find enough evidence to show that pneumococal vaccines were better than placebo (dummy treatment) in preventing death from pneumonia. We also found that the vaccines were safe. 
Key results 
In people with stable COPD (not having an exacerbation), pneumoccoccic vaccines reduced the number of people who developed pneumonia. In people with acute exacerbations of COPD during the study period, pneumoccoccus vaccines reduced deaths from pneumonia and reduced the chance of being admitted to hospital. 
In the studies we included, there were no reports of serious side effects. 
There was not enough evidence available to compare the effects and safety of different types of pneumoccus vaccines. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally good. However the studies were small and only lasted for a short time. Therefore, we need further research before we can draw firm conclusions about the effects on people who have COPDs. 
Conclusion 
Pnemoccocal vaccinations are safe and effective in reducing the number and severity of pneumonia episodes in people living with COPDS. There is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether pneumoccocus vaccines are effective in people without COPD but with other chronic lung diseases. 
Certainty of the main results 
The certainty of the results for the main outcomes was moderate. This means that we are fairly confident that the true effect lies close to the estimate of the effect in the studies. 
For the outcomes of all‐caused mortality and hospitalisation, the certainty of evidence was low. This indicates that the results are uncertain and may be imprecise. 
Future research 
Further research is needed to determine the effects, including long‐term effects, of pneumoccooccal vaccinations in people aged over 65 years with COPC. We need to know whether pneumococoal vaccines are safe in people taking corticosteroids. We would also like to know if the vaccines are equally effective in different types and severities of COPDs, and in people of different ages. 
More research is also needed to compare different types (conjugate and polysaccharide) of vaccines. We do not know whether the vaccines work differently in people whose immune system is weakened by other conditions such as HIV/AIDS.

Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of injectible pneumococal vaccines on preventing community acquired pneumonia (pneumonia acquired outside hospital) in people who have chronic obstructing pulmonary disorder (COPS). 
Background 
People with COPDs are at higher risk of developing pneumonia than other people. Pneumococci are bacteria that can cause pneumonia. Vaccines against these bacteria are available. They are given by injection into the muscle. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to November, 2206. We found 17 studies involving 3,777 people with COPS. The studies compared different types of pneumoccoccal vaccines with each other or with no vaccine. Most studies were carried out in the USA, Canada and Europe. 
Key results 
The studies showed that people who received the vaccine were less likely to develop pneumonia than those who did not receive the vaccine. However, the studies were small and the results were uncertain. There was no difference in deaths due to heart and lung problems between people who had the vaccine and those who had not. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was good. However the studies involved small numbers of people and the studies varied in their design. This means that the results may not be reliable. 
Conclusions 
There is some evidence that pneumoccocus vaccines reduce the risk of pneumonia in COPD patients. However there is uncertainty about the size of the effect. More research is needed to confirm the benefits of the vaccines.
Vaccination for preventing community‐‐acqeated pneumonia in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of injectable polyivalent pneumococcus vaccines for preventing pneumonia in people who have chronic obstructed pulmonary disease (COPD). 
Background 
People with COPDs such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis are at increased risk of developing pneumonia. Pneumonia is a serious illness that can lead to death. Vaccines are available that protect against infection by the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is one of the most common causes of pneumonia. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effects of pneumovax (a vaccine containing 20 or more strains of Streptoccocus pneumoniae) with placebo or no treatment. We included only RCTs that compared vaccines containing 14 or more serotypes. We also included studies that compared different types of pneumoococccal vaccines. We found 12 studies involving 1,153 participants. 
Key results 
Vaccines containing 7 or more types of Streptooccus pneumonia were effective in reducing the risk that people with chronic obstructing pulmonary disease would develop pneumonia. However, we found no evidence that these vaccines reduced the number of cases of pneumonia caused by Streptoccus pneumonia. The vaccines also reduced the chance that people would experience an exacerbation of their COPD, and they were well tolerated. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies varied. Most studies were small, and the results were based on a limited number of participants. Some studies had problems with how they were conducted, which may have affected the results. 
Conclusions 
Vaccine containing 6 or more different types Streptoccooccus pneumonia are effective in preventing pneumonia and exacerbations of COPD in people living with COPDS. However there is no evidence to suggest that these vaccine reduce the risk for pneumonia caused specifically by Streptoococcus pneunomiae. 
Certainty of the review evidence 
We rated the certainty of the available evidence as low to moderate. This means that we are fairly certain that the true effect lies close to the estimate of effect presented in this review. However the evidence is not very precise, and further research could change our estimates. 
We are uncertain whether the benefits seen in this group of people will be seen in other groups of people with respiratory disease. We need more research to determine whether vaccines containing fewer than 6 types of streptococci are effective. We are also uncertain whether vaccines that contain more than 24 types of bacteria are more effective than those containing 8 to 21 types. 
What is the bottom line? 
Vaxxines containing six or more streptoccoci are effective for preventing pneumonias and exacerbation in people wih COPD and are well tolerated, but there is insufficient evidence to show that they reduce the number cases of pneumonies caused specifically b Streptcocci pneumonia. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of vaccines containing more than six types of strectococcci. 
How up to date is this review? 
The evidence is current to June 29, 2202."

Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of primary‐worker (PW)‐led mental health treatments for people with any mental health problem in low or middle income settings. 
Background 
People with mental illness often do not receive appropriate treatment because of lack of access to services. Primary‐level care is provided by health workers who work in communities, schools, workplaces, or homes. They can be trained to provide mental health services. This review aimed to find out if these services are effective and safe. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 21 June  2020. We found 96 studies involving 10,000 participants. Most studies were conducted in India, Pakistan, and China. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that PW‐delivered treatments improve recovery, symptom reduction, or quality of life for people living with mental disorders. However, we found some evidence that they may reduce the number of people who have suicidal thoughts or self‐harm. There was also some evidence of improvement in social functioning and school attendance. We did not find any evidence that these treatments cause harm. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to moderate. This means that we are uncertain about the true effect of PWs on mental health. 
Certainty of the main results 
The certainty of the results was low to very low. This is because most studies were small and had high risk of bias. 
Conclusion 
There is currently little evidence that primary‐workers can effectively treat people with common or severe mental disorders in low income settings, although there is some evidence for reducing suicidal thoughts and self‐injury. Further research is needed to determine whether primary‐work‐led services are cost‐effective and acceptable to patients and families.

Community health workers and collaborative‐care for adults with common mental disorders in low‐income countries
Background 
Common mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety, affect one in four people worldwide. They can cause significant distress and disability. Low‐income country (LIC) health systems often lack sufficient mental health professionals to provide treatment. Community health workers (CHWs) are non‐professional community members who receive training to provide basic health services. Collaborative‐car��料团队和协作护理对低收入国家成人常见精神障碍的影响背景全球四分之一的人口患有常见的精神障碍，如抑郁症和焦虑症。这些疾病可导致严重的痛苦和残疾。低收入卫生系统往往缺乏足够的精神卫生专业人员来提供治疗。社区健康工作者（CHWs）是非专业社区成员，接受培训以提供基本的卫生服务。协作照护是指由精神卫生专家、初级保健医生和社区健康工人组成的团队，共同为患者提供治疗和支持。本综述旨在评估CHWs和协作照对常见精神疾病的治疗效果。研究目的本综复习旨在评估社区健康工作人员（CHW）和协作照顾对成人常见精神病的影响。主要结果我们纳入了13个低收入或中等收入国家的25项随机对照试验，共涉及3000多名参与者。我们发现，与常规护理相比，CHW和协作照料可能有助于提高恢复率，减少症状和改善生活质量。然而，我们无法确定CHW或协作照料是否能降低精神障碍的发生率或改善功能。我们还发现，CHWs可能比常规护理更安全，但没有证据表明他们能降低自杀意念或企图的风险。协作照料可能会降低自杀风险，但不确定其对自杀未遂的影响。证据质量我们对证据的质量进行了评估，发现大多数证据质量较低。这主要是由于偏倚风险较高，以及由于样本量小而无法得出明确结论。因此，我们不能确定CHWs或协作照顾是否能改善精神障碍患者的健康状况。需要进一步的研究来验证我们的发现。未来的研究应该包括更多的参与者，并且应该在不同的国家进行，以便更好地了解CHWs在不同文化中的作用。此外，还需要研究协作照顾的长期影响。

Supportive counselling for mental health problems in low‐income and middle‐income countries
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aimed to find out whether supportive counselling can help people with mental health disorders in low and middle income countries. We looked at studies that compared supportive counselling with no treatment or other types of treatment. 
What was studied in the review?  
We included studies that looked at supportive counselling for people with any type of mental health problem in low or middle income settings. We included studies where people were given supportive counselling by specially trained workers such as community health workers, nurses, or doctors. We also included studies in which people were offered supportive counselling through telephone or internet support. 
We found 25 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies took place in 15 different countries across Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The studies involved 11,227 participants. Most of the studies were carried out in low income countries, and most of the participants were women. 
The studies looked at different types of mental disorders, including depression, anxiety, post‐natal depression, post traumatic stress disorder, and schizophrenia. The length of time that people received supportive counselling varied between studies, ranging from one session to 24 sessions over six months. 
How did we analyse the evidence?  
Our main analysis included 23 studies involving 10,634 participants. We used statistical methods to combine the results of these studies and to assess how reliable they were. We then summarised the findings from each study separately. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
Supportive counseling may be effective for people who have mental health conditions in low to middle income regions. 
Supporting counseling may reduce the number of people who develop mental health symptoms. It may also reduce the severity of mental illness symptoms, improve quality of life, and reduce the need for specialist mental health services. However, the certainty of the available evidence is low, so we cannot be certain about the true effect of supportive counseling. 
For women who have postnatal depression (depression after giving birth), supportive counseling may increase the number who recover. It might also reduce their symptoms and improve their quality of live. However again, the evidence is not very reliable. 
In people who had experienced trauma, supportive counseling might reduce the symptoms of depression. It could also improve their overall quality of living. However the evidence for this is also not very strong. 
There is not enough evidence to show whether supportive counseling reduces the number or severity of side effects. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate. This means that the evidence was not very consistent, and we cannot say for sure whether supportive c
Community‐based interventions for mental health and substance use problems in humanitarian emergencies
Background 
People living in humanitarian emergency situations such as war, natural disasters, and refugee camps often experience mental health problems such as depression and anxiety. They also commonly misuse drugs and alcohol. Community‐based programmes can provide support for people with these problems. These programmes are usually led by local community workers who receive training to help them deliver services. This review aimed to find out whether community‐based services are effective at treating mental health conditions and substance misuse in humanitarian situations. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to December 2015. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared community‐led services with usual care or other types of treatment. We only included studies that were conducted in low‐ and middle‐income countries. We excluded studies that focused on children and adolescents. We found 24 studies involving 11,617 participants. 
Key results 
We found that community‐workers trained to treat mental health disorders such as post‐ traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and common mental disorders (CMDs) may be able to help people with depression and improve their quality of life. However, we are not sure if they can help people recover from PTSD or help people who have both PTSD and CMDs. We are also unsure about how well they work for people who are experiencing CMDs alone. We do not know if they are better than other types or treatments. We did not find any evidence that they cause harm. 
We also found that programmes led by community‐health workers (LHWs) to treat harmful or hazardous alcohol use may help people stop drinking. However we are unsure if they help people to stop taking other drugs. We also do not have enough evidence to say if they cause any harm.  We found no evidence that LHWs can help with other types and substance abuse. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally poor. Most studies were small and had many problems with the way they were run. For example, they did not always check to see if people were still taking part in the study. This means that we cannot be certain about the results. 
Conclusion 
Community‐led programmes may be helpful for people living in emergency situations who have mental health or substance misuse problems. However more research is needed to confirm this.
Interventions for alcohol and other substance use in people with mental health problems
What is the issue? 
People with mental illness often misuse alcohol or drugs. This can be due to the illness itself, or because they are trying to self‐treat their symptoms. Alcohol and drug misuse can make mental illness worse, and can lead to physical health problems. It can also cause social problems such as unemployment, homelessness, and domestic violence. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find if any type of intervention was effective in reducing alcohol or drug misuse in people who had a mental illness. We looked at different types of interventions, including: 
• individual therapy (such as cognitive behavioural therapy, motivational interviewing, or contingency management), 
• group therapy, 
• family therapy, and 
• medication. 
We also looked at whether these interventions worked better when given by a person with special training (such a psychologist or psychiatrist), compared to someone without this training (for example, a general practitioner). 
What evidence did we find? 
Our review included 16 studies involving 3203 adults with mental illnesses. Most of the studies involved people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. 
The studies were carried out in different countries, including Australia, Canada, China, Germany, India, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the USA. 
Most of the interventions were carried in hospitals or clinics. Some were carried on in the community. 
Individual therapy 
We found that individual therapy probably has little or no effect on reducing alcohol and drug use. However, it probably reduces the risk of relapse into harmful drinking. 
Group therapy 
Group therapies probably reduce the risk that people will continue to misuse alcohol and drugs. They probably also improve quality of life. 
Family therapy 
Family therapies probably do not reduce alcohol or other drug use, but they may improve quality‐of‐life. 
Medication 
We did not find any studies that looked at the effectiveness of medication for alcohol or substance misuse in adults with a mental health problem. 
Specialist‐led versus non‐specialist‐ led care 
We looked at two types of specialist‐ led treatment: 
1. PHP/CP (psychiatric patient‐oriented care) – where a team of specialists work together to provide care. 
2. PHP/collaborative care – where the person's GP works closely with a specialist to provide treatment. 
Both types of care probably reduce alcohol and cannabis use, and probably reduce relapse. They may also improve functioning and quality of live. 
Community‐based care 
Community care provided by a LHW (community health worker) probably reduces alcohol use, although there is not enough evidence to know if it improves quality of living. 
Care provided by PW (peer workers) probably does not reduce substance use, or improve quality or life. However it may reduce the number of people who continue to use substances. 
Carer support 
We only found one study that looked specifically at carers. This study showed that carer support probably reduces caregiver burden. 
How up‐to date is this review? 
The evidence is current to February 2017.
Home‐based interventions for people with mental health problems: a systematic review and meta‐analysis
Background
People with mental illness often live in their own homes. They may need support from professionals to help them manage their condition. This review looked at the effectiveness of home‐based care for people who have mental health conditions. Home‐based services can be provided by different types of professionals, such as psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, social workers, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, and community health workers. The review included studies that compared home‐ based care with usual care, or other forms of care. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of home visits by professionals for people aged 18 years or older with mental disorders. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (16 January 2018), which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing home‐visiting interventions with usual or alternative care. We excluded studies that did not report data on relevant outcomes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. For dichotomous outcomes we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 90% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous outcomes we used standard mean differences (SMD) and 99% CI. We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We identified 24 RCTs involving 11,800 participants. Most studies were conducted in high‐income countries. The studies were generally of moderate to low quality. We found no evidence that home‐visit interventions reduced the risk of death or suicide. We are uncertain whether home‐ visits improve recovery, relapse, or symptoms. Home visits may reduce the risk that people will stop taking medication, but there is no evidence about the effects on adverse events. 
Home‐visits by professionals may reduce disability in people with schizophrenia, but we are uncertain about the effect on other outcomes. Homevisits may reduce anxiety in people who are depressed, but the effect is small. Home visiting may reduce mental distress in people whose relatives have dementia, but it does not appear to affect the severity or frequency of behavioural problems in these people. Home visitation may reduce symptoms in children with post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or conduct disorder, but this effect is very small. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to moderate. We judged the certainty of evidence for most outcomes to be downgraded because of imprecision, risk of selection bias, and inconsistency. 
Authors' conclusion
Home visits by health professionals may improve functioning in people diagnosed with schizophrenia. However, we are unsure about the impact of home visiting on other important outcomes. More research is needed to determine the effects and cost‐effectiveness of home visitation for people diagnosed
Cognitive processing therapy for mental health problems in low‐income countries
Background 
Mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), harmful alcohol use, and substance use are common in low and middle‐income country (LMIC) settings. Cognitive processing therapy (CPT) is a form of psychological therapy that helps people with these problems by changing their negative thoughts and beliefs about themselves, others, and the world. CPT is based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT is a type of psychological treatment that aims to help people change unhelpful ways of thinking and behaving. 
Review question 
We wanted to find out if CPT works better than other types of psychological treatments for mental problems in LMICS. We also wanted to know whether CPT was safe and had any side effects. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 2016. We found two studies that compared CPT with other psychological treatments. Both studies were carried out in India. One study compared CBT with CPT, and one compared CTP with supportive counselling. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to June 2, 2106. 
Two studies involving 662 participants were included in this review. The first study involved 328 participants who were randomly assigned to receive either CPT or CBT. The second study involved another 334 participants who received either CTP or supportive counselling, which is a kind of talking therapy where the therapist listens to the patient and offers support. 
The studies showed that CPT may be more effective than other psychological therapies in reducing symptoms of depression, PTSD, and harmful alcohol and substance misuse. However, there is not enough evidence to say whether CTP is more effective in treating dementia carer distress. 
Both studies reported that CTP was safe, but they did not report any side‐effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was moderate. This means that we can be fairly confident that our findings are reliable. 
Conclusion 
CPT may work better than CBT and supportive counselling for people with mental health disorders in LMCS. More research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Certainty of the Evidence 
The certainty of the body of evidence is moderate. 
Cognitive Processing Therapy for Mental Health Problems in Low‐Income Countries 
Cognition refers to the way we think, perceive, remember, and learn. Cognitive Processing Therapy (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) is used to treat mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression, post traumatic stress disorder, harmful substance use, dementia carerever, and other mental health issues. Cognitive Behavioural therapy (CTB) is based upon the idea that our thoughts, feelings, and actions are connected. It aims to change the way people think and behave. 
This review looked at the effectiveness of CPT in treating mental health in low income countries. Two studies were included. These studies compared CCBT with other types cognitive behavioural therapies. 
There is some evidence that CCBTs may be better than supportive counselling and CCBt for people suffering from mental health disorder. There is not yet enough evidence that cognitive processing therapy is better than cognitive behaviour therapy for people in low resource settings. 
More research is required to determine the effectiveness and safety of cognitive processing therapies in low resourced settings.","Primary‐level worker‐led treatment for mental health problems in low and middle income countries
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aimed to find out whether primary‐healthcare workers (PHWs) can help people with common or severe mental health disorders. PHWs are people who work in the community and provide basic healthcare services. They include doctors, nurses, and other health professionals, but also include lay healthworkers (LHWS) and community nonhealth professionals. 
What was studied in the review?  
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared PHW‐led mental health treatments with usual care for people with any mental health problem in low or middle income country settings. We looked at the following outcomes: recovery, prevalence, symptom change, QOL, functioning, SU, and AEs. 
We found 94 RCTs involving 12,962 participants. Most of these trials were conducted in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. 
The most common PHWs were LHWS, followed by CPs, and then PHPs. 
How did we analyse the evidence?  
The review authors assessed the risk of bias in each trial and extracted data on the outcomes of interest. They then combined the results of similar trials using statistical methods. 
Key results and the evidence underpinning them 
We identified 93 trials that compared LHW‐ and CP‐led intervention with usual or no care. 
LHW and CP led interventions probably increase recovery in people with CMDs (two trials, n = 310; RR = 1·29; 99% CI 1 ·02 to 1 .63; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
LHWD and CP interventions may reduce symptoms in people diagnosed with schizophrenia (three trials, N = 536; MD = –1·17; 0·25 to 2·50; moderate certainty evidence). However, they may not improve QOL in people who have schizophrenia (one trial, n= 264; MD –0·02; 1 to 9·00; very low certainty evidence) or depression (two trails, n = 300, MD –10·16; 21·08 to 3·76; very‐low certainty evidence).
LHWs and CPs may improve functioning in people living with schizophrenia, depression, or CMDs, but the evidence is very uncertain (three to four trials, three to five trials, two trials, respectively; RR or MD 1–1·33; 8·60 to –0.08; very-low certainty evidence); 
LWHS and CP may increase SU in people treated for schizophrenia, CMDs or depression, but again the evidence was very uncertain. 
There was no evidence of harm from PHW interventions. 
In trials that examined the cost of PHW led interventions, they were generally less expensive than usual care, but this was not always the case. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence varied. For some outcomes, the evidence quality was very low, which means that the true effect could be different from what we observed. This is because the trials were small, had high risk of biases, and were not well reported. For other outcomes, there was moderate certainty of evidence, which suggests that the effect is likely to be close to the true value. 
Overall, the quality of evidence was low to moderate. 
Conclusion 
PHWs can be effective in improving recovery, reducing symptoms, and increasing SU in LMICS. However, more research is needed to determine the best way to train PHWs, and how to integrate them into existing mental health systems. 
Certainty of evidence 
We rated the certainty of the body of evidence for each outcome as very low to high. The certainty of our conclusions was low for some outcomes and moderate for others.

Community health workers versus other professionals for treating common mental disorder in low‐income countries
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of community health workers (CHWs) compared with other professionals in treating common psychological problems such as depression and anxiety in low income countries. 
Background 
Common mental disorders such as anxiety and depression are very common in low and middle income countries (LMICs). They can be treated effectively by trained health workers, but there are not enough psychiatrists and psychologists to provide this treatment. CHWs are often used to deliver psychological treatments in LMICs. They are usually volunteers who live in the same community as the people they help. They receive training in how to treat mental disorders, and sometimes they also receive training to help them deal with the stigma associated with mental illness. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to: 17 February 2016. 
Study characteristics 
We found 25 studies involving 11,267 participants. All of the studies were carried out in LMICS. The studies involved adults with common psychological disorders. We included studies where the CHWs were supervised by other professionals, such as psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses or social workers. We did not include studies where CHWs provided psychological treatments without supervision. 
Key results 
We looked at the following outcomes: recovery, prevalence, symptoms, quality of life, functional impairment, adverse events and suicide attempts. 
CHWs versus other health professionals 
We do not know whether CHWs or other health workers are better at helping people recover from common mental health problems. We are uncertain whether CHW interventions reduce the number of people with common disorders. CHW intervention may reduce the severity of symptoms, but we are uncertain about this because the evidence is of low quality. We do not think that CHWs improve quality oflife. We think that they may slightly decrease functional impairment. We found no evidence that CHW treatment increases the risk of adverse events. 
Collaborate‐care versus other professional care 
We are uncertain if collaborative‐care improves recovery, reduces prevalence, or improves quality of life. Collaborative‐ care may reduce symptom severity, but the evidence was of low certainty. We have moderate confidence that collaborative‐ care does not increase the risk of suicide attempts, but this is based on only one study. We need more research to find out whether collaborative‐ care improves quality of life. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence varied. We rated the quality of evidence as high, moderate, low or very low. Evidence was of high quality when it was based on well‐designed and conducted studies. Evidence of low or moderate quality was based mainly on studies that had some limitations. Evidence based on studies with serious limitations was rated as very low quality and we were uncertain about its validity.
Supportive counseling for mental health problems
Background 
Mental health problems such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are common worldwide. They can cause significant distress and disability. Supportive counseling is a type of talking therapy where a trained counselor provides emotional support and encouragement to help people cope with their problems. This review aimed to find out whether supportive counseling helps people with mental health disorders. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to June 2016. We found 13 studies involving 10,700 participants. These studies were carried out in low- and middle-income countries. Most of the studies were done in India. The studies included people with depression, postnatal depression, PTSD, anxiety, and other mental health conditions. 
Key results 
Supportive counselors were trained nurses, community health workers, or social workers. They worked either individually or in groups. They met with participants once or twice a week for two to six months. They provided support by listening, giving advice, and encouraging participants to talk about their problems and feelings. 
Supporting counseling probably had little-to-no effect on the number of people who recovered from depression. It may have slightly reduced symptoms of depression, improved quality of life, and reduced the need for specialist mental health services. It probably had no effect on suicide attempts. There was not enough evidence to show if supportive counseling affected the number deaths. 
In women with postnatal (after childbirth) depression, supportive counseling probably increased recovery, but did not affect symptoms, quality of live, or suicide attempts, or the number who died. There were too few studies to draw conclusions about the effects of supportive counseling for people with PTSD or other mental disorders.  The studies were small and poorly designed. This means we cannot be certain about the true effects of counseling. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was very low. This is because the studies used different methods to measure the effects, and the studies had many problems with how they were run. This makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions about whether supportive counselling works. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of supportive counselling for mental disorders in adults. More research is needed to determine whether supportive counsellors can help people with these problems. 
Certainty of the Evidence 
The certainty of the body of evidence was rated as very low due to the following reasons: 1) the included studies were mostly small and at high risk of bias; 2) there was considerable heterogeneity between studies; 3) the studies measured outcomes differently; 4) the quality of reporting was poor; 5) there were no studies that assessed the effects on suicidal behaviour or death.
Community‐based interventions for mental health and substance use disorders in humanitarian crises
Background 
Humanitarian crises such as natural disasters, armed conflicts, and epidemics can cause widespread trauma and mental health problems. Community‐based care is one way to provide mental health services in these settings. Community health workers (CHWs), also known as community‐level health workers, are people who live in the same communities as those they serve. They are trained to provide basic health services and support to people with mental health conditions. This review aimed to find out whether CHWs could help people with posttraumatic mental health disorders (PTSD) or common mental disorders (CMDs), or with harmful or hazardous alcohol or drug use. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 2017. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effectiveness of CHW‐led care with usual care or other types of care for people with PTSD, CMDs, or harmful or hazardou
Interventions for people with mental health problems who misuse alcohol or other substances
Background 
People with mental illness are more likely to misuse alcohol and other substances than the general population. This can be due to a number of factors including self‐medication, side‐effects of medications, and social isolation. Misuse of alcohol and drugs can worsen mental health and lead to physical health problems. It can also affect relationships with family and friends. 
This review looked at the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing alcohol and drug misuse among people with a mental illness. We found 16 studies involving 2039 participants. 
Key results 
We found that interventions led by a pharmacist or psychologist probably had little effect on reducing alcohol misuse. However, they probably reduced the risk of substance misuse. Interventions led by community pharmacists probably reduced alcohol misuse and substance misuse, but we are not sure about their effects on quality of life. Intensive interventions led jointly by a psychologist and a pharmacist probably reduced functional impairment. Intensified interventions led collaboratively by a primary care provider and a psychologist probably reduced symptoms and functional impairment, but did not reduce relapse. Intense interventions led in collaboration between a primary health care provider, a pharmacist and a community health worker probably reduced substance misuse and improved quality of care. Intensity of intervention was defined as the number of sessions per week, duration of treatment, and the number and type of professionals involved. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies varied. Most studies were small and only lasted a short time. There was a lack of information on how the studies were conducted and whether they were carried out properly. We are therefore not certain about the true effects of these interventions. 
Conclusions 
There is some evidence that interventions for people who misuse substances and have a mental health problem are effective. However there is a need for further research to confirm these findings.
Supportive care for people with mental health problems: a systematic review of the effectiveness of lay health worker led interventions
Background
People with mental illness often experience stigma, discrimination and social exclusion. Lay health workers (LHWs) are non‐professionally trained individuals who provide support to people with health problems. LHWs can be used to deliver supportive care for mental health conditions. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of LHW‐delivered supportive care interventions for people experiencing mental health disorders. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of LWH‐deliverd supportive care on mental health outcomes, quality of life, functioning, service use and adverse events in people with a range of mental health diagnoses. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (up to 15 January 2019), which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We inspected references of all identified studies and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing LHW delivery of supportive care versus usual care or no treatment were included. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 99% confidence interval (CI) and for continuous data, standard mean difference (SMD) and 90% CI. We assessed risk of bias for each included study and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE. 
Main results
We included 24 RCTs involving 11,385 participants. The majority of studies involved people with depression, anxiety or post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Most studies were conducted in high‐income countries. 
LHW delivery versus usual treatment or no intervention
The evidence was of very low certainty due to limitations in study design, inconsistency and imprecision. LWHs may have a small effect on reducing depressive symptoms (S‐MD ‑0.30, 2 trials; 160 participants, 39% lost to follow‐up; 97% CI ‐ 0 62 to ‐0 02; very low‐certainty evidence). LWH delivery may have no effect on anxiety symptoms (1 trial; 22 participants, no data available for 23% of participants; 32% lost‐to follow‐upto 98% CI 0 to ‑1 71; very‐low‐certaintyevidence). LHW interventions may have some effect on improving quality oflife (QOL) (S MD 0 . 53,1 trial, 42 participants 17% lostto followup; verylow‐ certainty evidence). There is insufficient evidence to determine whether LHW support has any effect on other mental health symptoms, functioning or service use.

Cognitive processing therapy for mental health problems in low‐income and middle‐income countries
Background 
Mental health problems affect people of all ages and cultures. They can cause distress and disability, and can lead to other health problems. Cognitive processing therapy (CPT) is a type of psychological treatment that helps people with mental health conditions such as post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders. CPT aims to help people change unhelpful thoughts and beliefs about their experiences. It is usually delivered by trained therapists in face‐to face sessions over several weeks. 
This review looked at the evidence from studies comparing CPT to no treatment or other treatments for mental illness in low and middle income countries (LMICs). 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 15 May 2018. We found 11 studies involving 1416 participants. Most studies were conducted in India, Pakistan, and South Africa. Participants had a range of mental health diagnoses including PTSD, depression, and anxiety. 
Key results 
The studies showed that CPT was more effective than no treatment for improving mental health symptoms. CBT was also more effective for improving quality of life and reducing alcohol and drug use. However, there was not enough evidence to say whether CPT is better than other types of psychological therapy. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally good. However the number of studies was small and they were mostly conducted in one country. This means we cannot be sure that the results apply to other settings. 
Conclusions 
CPT may be a useful treatment for mental illnesses in LMICS. More research is needed to find out which people benefit most from this treatment and how it compares to other types.

Cognition refers to the way we think and process information. Cognitive Processing Therapy is a form of cognitive behavioural therapy that aims to change unproductive ways of thinking about traumatic events. Cognitive Behavioural therapy (CBT) is used to treat many mental health disorders. It involves talking to a therapist about your thoughts and feelings and learning new ways to cope. Cognitiv"
"Background
Stroke affects millions of people every year and is a leading cause of disability, resulting in significant financial cost and reduction in quality of life. Rehabilitation after stroke aims to reduce disability by facilitating recovery of impairment, activity, or participation. One aspect of stroke rehabilitation that may affect outcomes is the amount of time spent in rehabilitation, including minutes provided, frequency (i.e. days per week of rehabilitation), and duration (i.e. time period over which rehabilitation is provided). Effect of time spent in rehabilitation after stroke has been explored extensively in the literature, but findings are inconsistent. Previous systematic reviews with meta‐analyses have included studies that differ not only in the amount provided, but also type of rehabilitation. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of 1. more time spent in the same type of rehabilitation on activity measures in people with stroke; 2. difference in total rehabilitation time (in minutes) on recovery of activity in people with stroke; and 3. rehabilitation schedule on activity in terms of: a. average time (minutes) per week undergoing rehabilitation, b. frequency (number of sessions per week) of rehabilitation, and c. total duration of rehabilitation. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, eight other databases, and five trials registers to June 2021. We searched reference lists of identified studies, contacted key authors, and undertook reference searching using Web of Science Cited Reference Search. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults with stroke that compared different amounts of time spent, greater than zero, in rehabilitation (any non‐pharmacological, non‐surgical intervention aimed to improve activity after stroke). Studies varied only in the amount of time in rehabilitation between experimental and control conditions. Primary outcome was activities of daily living (ADLs); secondary outcomes were activity measures of upper and lower limbs, motor impairment measures of upper and lower limbs, and serious adverse events (SAE)/death. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened studies, extracted data, assessed methodological quality using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool, and assessed certainty of the evidence using GRADE. For continuous outcomes using different scales, we calculated pooled standardised mean difference (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We expressed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% CIs. 
Main results
The quantitative synthesis of this review comprised 21 parallel RCTs, involving analysed data from 1412 participants.  
Time in rehabilitation varied between studies. Minutes provided per week were 90 to 1288. Days per week of rehabilitation were three to seven. Duration of rehabilitation was two weeks to six months. Thirteen studies provided upper limb rehabilitation, five general rehabilitation, two mobilisation training, and one lower limb training. Sixteen studies examined participants in the first six months following stroke; the remaining five included participants more than six months poststroke. Comparison of stroke severity or level of impairment was limited due to variations in measurement. 
The risk of bias assessment suggests there were issues with the methodological quality of the included studies. There were 76 outcome‐level risk of bias assessments: 15 low risk, 37 some concerns, and 24 high risk. 
When comparing groups that spent more time versus less time in rehabilitation immediately after intervention, we found no difference in rehabilitation for ADL outcomes (SMD 0.13, 95% CI −0.02 to 0.28; P = 0.09; I2 = 7%; 14 studies, 864 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), activity measures of the upper limb (SMD 0.09, 95% CI −0.11 to 0.29; P = 0.36; I2 = 0%; 12 studies, 426 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), and activity measures of the lower limb (SMD 0.25, 95% CI −0.03 to 0.53; P = 0.08; I2 = 48%; 5 studies, 425 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We found an effect in favour of more time in rehabilitation for motor impairment measures of the upper limb (SMD 0.32, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.58; P = 0.01; I2 = 10%; 9 studies, 287 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and of the lower limb (SMD 0.71, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.28; P = 0.01; 1 study, 51 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). There were no intervention‐related SAEs. More time in rehabilitation did not affect the risk of SAEs/death (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.85; P = 0.68; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 379 participants; low‐certainty evidence), but few studies measured these outcomes. 
Predefined subgroup analyses comparing studies with a larger difference of total time spent in rehabilitation between intervention groups to studies with a smaller difference found greater improvements for studies with a larger difference. This was statistically significant for ADL outcomes (P = 0.02) and activity measures of the upper limb (P = 0.04), but not for activity measures of the lower limb (P = 0.41) or motor impairment measures of the upper limb (P = 0.06). 
Authors' conclusions
An increase in time spent in the same type of rehabilitation after stroke results in little to no difference in meaningful activities such as activities of daily living and activities of the upper and lower limb but a small benefit in measures of motor impairment (low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence for all findings). If the increase in time spent in rehabilitation exceeds a threshold, this may lead to improved outcomes. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend a minimum beneficial daily amount in clinical practice. The findings of this study are limited by a lack of studies with a significant contrast in amount of additional rehabilitation provided between control and intervention groups. 
Large, well‐designed, high‐quality RCTs that measure time spent in all rehabilitation activities (not just interventional) and provide a large contrast (minimum of 1000 minutes) in amount of rehabilitation between groups would provide further evidence for effect of time spent in rehabilitation.","How much rehabilitation do you need after stroke?
Background
Rehabilitation after stroke is aimed at reducing disability by improving function. Rehabilitation can be delivered in many ways, including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, and psychological support. It can be provided in hospital, in the community, or both. Rehabilitation is usually provided for a limited time, but there is no agreement about how long this should be. This review looked at whether more rehabilitation improves outcomes for people who have had a stroke.
Study characteristics
We found 17 studies involving 1463 participants. Studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, Australia, and Europe. Participants were adults who had had a first stroke within the previous six months. They were randomised to receive either more rehabilitation than usual or usual rehabilitation. The additional rehabilitation was provided in addition to usual care. The studies varied in the type of additional rehabilitation provided, the amount provided, and the duration of the additional rehabilitation. Most studies provided additional rehabilitation in the form of physiotherapeutic exercise, but some provided additional occupational therapy or speech and/or language therapy. The amount of additional therapy ranged from 15 minutes to 12 hours per day. The duration of additional treatment ranged from one to 24 weeks. The main outcome measure was activities that people could do for themselves (activities of daily life). Other outcomes measured were upper and/or lower limb function, motor function, and death or serious adverse effects. 
Key results
The review found that more rehabilitation did not improve the ability of people to perform activities of their daily lives. There was no difference in the ability to use the upper or lower limbs or in motor function. There were no differences in death or in serious adverse outcomes. 
Quality of the research
The studies were generally well designed and reported. However, they were small, and most were funded by the organisations providing the rehabilitation. This means that the results may not be reliable. 
Certainty of the results
We are uncertain about the results because of the small number of studies and the low certainty of evidence for most outcomes. We are confident that more additional rehabilitation does not improve activities of everyday life. We cannot be certain about the effects of additional physiothrapy on upper or/and lower limb functions, motor functions, death, or serious outcomes. More research is needed to clarify these uncertainties. 
What does this mean for me? 
If you have had stroke, you should follow the rehabilitation programme recommended by your healthcare team. If you want to increase the amount or intensity of your rehabilitation, discuss this with your healthcare professional. 
Review authors' conclusions
There is no evidence that additional rehabilitation improves activities of the daily life. There is insufficient evidence to determine if additional rehabilitation increases upper or/or lower limbs functions, or motor functions. There are insufficient data to determine the effects on death or on serious adverse event.

More time in stroke rehabilitation improves function
Background
Stroke is a common cause of disability. Rehabilitation aims to improve function and reduce disability. This review looked at whether more time in therapy improves function. 
Study characteristics
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared more versus less intensive rehabilitation in people with stroke. We included studies published up to 15 March 2018. 
Key results
We identified 22 studies involving 1392 participants. The studies varied in terms of the type of rehabilitation, the time spent in rehabilitation, and the time since stroke. The quality of evidence was very low due to the small number of studies and the high risk of biases. 
We found no difference in activities of everyday living (such as dressing, eating, and bathing) when comparing groups who received more versus fewer hours of rehabilitation. There was also no difference when comparing more versus few hours of upper limb training, such as reaching and grasping. 
However, we did find a small improvement in lower limb function when comparing those who received a greater amount of rehabilitation versus those who had less rehabilitation. 
Quality of the studies
The quality of studies was poor because they were at high risk for bias. This means that the findings may not be reliable. 
Certainty of the review evidence
The certainty of evidence for the main outcomes was very uncertain. This is because of the small numbers of studies, the high risks of bias, and imprecision of the estimates. 
Conclusions
We found that more time spent on rehabilitation may improve lower limb functioning but not activities of every day living or upper limb function. However, the certainty of these findings is very low. More research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Trial registration
This review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD4200901400).
How much time should be spent in rehabilitation after stroke? 
Background 
Rehabilitation after stroke aims to help people recover their ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) such as dressing, bathing, eating, and walking. Rehabilitation can take place in many settings including hospitals, community centers, and homes. It can involve different types of therapy such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and psychological support. The amount of time spent in therapy may vary depending on the type of therapy, the setting, and the availability of resources. 
Review question 
We wanted to find out whether spending more time on rehabilitation after a stroke improves recovery of ADLs and other aspects of function. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to June 2016. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared two or more rehabilitation programs with different amounts of time. We excluded studies that compared different types or intensities of therapy. We also excluded studies where the amount of therapy was not specified. 
Key results 
We found 16 RCTs involving 1154 participants. Most studies were conducted in high‐income countries and involved adults who had experienced a stroke at least one month earlier. The studies compared different amounts or types of rehabilitation. We found no difference in ADL recovery when comparing studies with different durations of rehabilitation (14 RCT studies, n = 858). However, we did find that studies with longer rehabilitation periods tended to show better improvement in ADLS. This finding was based on nine studies involving 279 participants. We did not find any differences in the amount or type of rehabilitation needed to improve upper limb function (12 RCT, n = 427) or lower limb function (5 RCT studs, n 415). We found that studies involving longer rehabilitation tended to have better improvement of upper limb functions (9 RCT stud, n=277) and lower limb functions (1 RCT study, n = 51). We did find some evidence that longer rehabilitation may improve motor function of the arms and legs. However, this finding was not consistent across studies. We could not find enough evidence to determine whether longer rehabilitation improved quality of life or reduced the risk for death. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was very low. This means that the results of our review are uncertain and that further research is likely to change the findings. We identified several reasons why the evidence was of low quality. First, most studies were small and had a high risk of bias. Second, the studies used different methods to measure outcomes, which made it difficult to compare them. Third, the results were inconsistent across studies, which may be due to differences in how the studies were designed. Fourth, the evidence is based on studies that were conducted over 25 years ago. Therefore, the findings may not apply to current practice. 
Conclusions 
We do not know whether spending longer time on therapy after a person has had a stroke leads to better recovery. More research is needed to answer this question.

Time spent in stroke rehabilitation
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether more time spent on rehabilitation after stroke improves function and quality of life. 
Background 
Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Rehabilitation is an important part of treatment after stroke. It aims to help people regain lost abilities and learn new ways to do things. Rehabilitation can be done in many different ways, including exercises, training, and education. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 11 January 2019. We found two studies involving 380 participants. Both studies compared the effects of providing more than usual rehabilitation versus usual rehabilitation. 
Key results 
We found that more time in rehabilitation did not improve the ability to perform activities of everyday life, such as dressing, eating, or bathing (low certainty of evidence). However, it may have improved the ability of the arm and hand to move (very low certainty of evidence). There was no evidence that more rehabilitation improved the strength of the leg muscles or walking ability. More time in therapy did not reduce the risk of death. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the certainty of the available evidence as low to very low. This means that we are uncertain about the size of any effects because of the small number of studies and the small numbers of participants included. We also had concerns about how the studies were conducted. 
Conclusions 
More time spent doing rehabilitation does not seem to improve the main outcomes that matter to people after stroke, such as performing activities of daily life and walking. However, there is some evidence that it may improve the movement of the arms and hands. More research is needed to confirm these findings and to find out whether there is a minimum amount of time that is beneficial. 
Certainty of the evidencelow to verylow 
We are uncertain whether more rehabilitation improves the main outcome that matters to people, such performing activities of daily life and walking. We are also uncertain whether there are any benefits for other outcomes, such improving the movement of the arms and hands. We need more research to confirm our findings and to find out what amount of additional rehabilitation is beneficial.
What is the aim of this review? 
To find out if more time spending on rehabilitation improves function after stroke and reduces the risk of death.  What was studied in the review?  We looked at studies where one group of people received more than normal rehabilitation and another group received normal rehabilitation. We looked at the effects on function and the ability to perform activities such as dressing and eating, and the strength and movement of limbs. We did not look at the effect on the risk or severity of complications, such blood clots, infections, or pressure sores.  What are the main results of the review?
We found two small studies involving a total of 360 people. One study compared the effect of 2 hours extra rehabilitation per day with normal rehabilitation, and one study compared 4 hours extra per day. We rated the quality of the studies as moderate to low. This meant that we were not sure whether the results were due to the intervention or other factors. We were also concerned that the studies might not have been carried out properly. 
We did not find any evidence that extra rehabilitation improved function or reduced the risk death. We think that more research is required to find the best amount of extra rehabilitation.  How up to date is this review?
The evidence is current to 22 January 1919.
Authors' conclusion 
An increase of time in the rehabilitation after a stroke results into little to none difference in meaningful activities such activities of every day life and activities in the upper body. There is currently not enough evidence to advise a minimum beneficial daily amount of therapy. The findings of the study are restricted by a shortage of studies that have a significant difference in amount rehabilitation provided.","Time spent in stroke rehabilitation
Background
Rehabilitation after stroke is aimed at reducing disability by improving function and participation. Time spent in therapy may be important for recovery. This review aimed to find out if more time in therapy improves function and reduces disability in people who have had a stroke. 
Study characteristics
We found 14 studies involving 676 participants. All studies compared different durations of therapy. The studies varied widely in the type of therapy used, the amount and frequency of therapy, and the length of follow‐up. 
Key results
We did not find any evidence that more time spending in therapy improved function or reduced disability in the short term. However, we found some evidence that longer therapy might improve function in the long term. We found no evidence that the timing of therapy affected function. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of the studies was generally low. Most studies were small and poorly reported. There was a high risk of bias in most studies. We judged the certainty of evidence to be very low for all outcomes. 
Conclusions
There is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether more time is better than less time in stroke therapy. More research is needed to determine how much therapy is best for people who are recovering from a stroke.
Trial registration
This review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42018097504).
More time in stroke rehabilitation improves function
Background
Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Stroke rehabilitation aims to improve physical and mental function, reduce disability, and enhance quality of life. It is important to know how much time people should spend in rehabilitation to achieve the best possible outcomes. 
Review question 
We wanted to find out whether spending more time in therapy immediately after stroke improves function compared to spending less time. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effects of more versus less rehabilitation time on function immediately after a stroke. We included studies if they involved adults who had had a stroke within the last six months and were able to participate in rehabilitation. We excluded studies if the participants were children or adolescents, or if the stroke occurred more than 18 months ago. We also excluded studies where the participants had other neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis. 
Key results 
We identified 22 RCT studies involving 1531 participants. The studies were conducted in Europe, North America, and Asia. Most studies compared the effect of more time (10–12 hours per week) versus less (three to four hours per day) in rehabilitation immediately after the stroke. Some studies compared more versus fewer days per week, or longer versus shorter duration of rehabilitation. 
We found no differences in function when comparing more versus less time in upper limb therapy (11 studies, n = 739 participants; very low‐quality evidence). There were no differences when comparing the effect on upper limb function of more vs less time spent in general rehabilitation (six studies, n = 326 participants; low‐ quality evidence). We found no difference in function between more versus few days per week in rehabilitation (two studies, eight participants; moderate‐quality evidence). We did not find any studies that compared more vs fewer hours per day in rehabilitation, or more vs shorter duration in rehabilitation.
Quality of the Evidence 
We judged the quality of evidence to be very low to moderate. This was because the studies were at high risk of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias. We judged the evidence to have a low risk of publication bias. 
Conclusions 
We concluded that there is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether more time spent on stroke rehabilitation immediately following a stroke improves upper limb or general rehabilitation function. Further research is needed to determine the optimal amount of rehabilitation time to improve function. 
Certainty of the evidenc
Time in rehabilitation after stroke: how much is enough? 
Background 
After a stroke, people often need rehabilitation to help them recover their ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs), such as dressing and bathing. Rehabilitation can be provided in different ways, including inpatient rehabilitation, outpatient rehabilitation, and home visits by therapists. Inpatient rehabilitation usually involves more intensive therapy than outpatient rehabilitation or home visits. It is unclear whether more time spent in rehabilitation improves recovery. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of longer versus shorter duration of rehabilitation on functional outcomes in adults with stroke. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 15 January 2019), CENTRAL (last updated 1 February 2109), MEDLINE (1946 to 16 January 1919) and Embase (1880 to 22 January 3018). We also searched the reference lists of included trials and reviews. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing longer versus standard duration of inpatient, outpatient, or home-based rehabilitation in adults who had experienced a stroke. We excluded trials that compared different types of rehabilitation. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochranelibrary. 
Main results 
We included 17 RCTs involving 1162 participants. Most trials were conducted in high‐income countries. The mean age of participants ranged from 53 to 71 years. The majority of participants were male. The median length of follow‐up was three months. 
The duration of the intervention ranged from two weeks to six months. The duration of standard rehabilitation varied between trials. For example, in one trial, the standard rehabilitation lasted four weeks, whereas in another trial, it lasted eight weeks. 
We found no difference in ADLs between longer and standard rehabilitation (standardised mean difference (S MD) 0·13; 99% confidence interval (CI) −0·02 to 0 ·28). This means that people who received longer rehabilitation were likely to have similar ADL scores as those who received standard rehabilitation. We found no differences in activity measures for the upper limbs or lower limbs between longer rehabilitation and standard care. However, people who had longer rehabilitation spent more time performing activities of the limbs. We are uncertain about the effect of longer rehabilitation on motor impairment because the evidence was very low certainty. We did not find any serious adverse events (SAEs) related to the intervention. 
Subgroup analyses showed that longer rehabilitation improved ADL performance when there was a large difference in the duration of total rehabilitation between intervention arms. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. The main reasons were that most trials were at high risk of bias and that the number of participants was small. 
Conclusions 
We do not know whether longer rehabilitation improves ADL function, activity of the arms, or activity of legs after stroke. More research is needed to determine the optimal duration of stroke rehabilitation.
How much rehabilitation after stroke is enough? A systematic review and meta‐analysis of randomised controlled trials
Background
Rehabilitation is an important part of stroke care. It aims to help people recover their ability to carry out everyday tasks, such as dressing and bathing, and to improve their mobility. Rehabilitation can be provided in many different ways, including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, and psychological support. The amount of time people spend in rehabilitation varies widely. This review aimed to find out whether there is a minimum amount of daily rehabilitation that is needed to improve people's ability to perform everyday tasks and their mobility after stroke. 
Review question 
We asked: what is the effect of increasing the amount of total time spent on rehabilitation after a stroke compared with usual care? 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to June 2016. We included randomised trials that compared two or more groups of people who received different amounts of rehabilitation after their stroke. We only included studies where the amount and type of rehabilitation were the same for each group. We excluded studies where people received different types of rehabilitation, such one group receiving physiotheraphy and another group receiving occupational therapy. 
We found 13 studies involving 3847 participants. The studies were carried out in Europe, North America, South America, Asia, and Australia. The average age of participants was 65 years old. Most studies involved people who had a mild stroke. The duration of follow‐up ranged from three months to five years. 
Key results 
We compared the effects of increasing time spent doing rehabilitation with usual rehabilitation care. We found that increasing the time spent having rehabilitation did not make any difference to how well people could do everyday tasks or how well they could move around. However, we found that people who spent more time having rehabilitation were less likely to die. However this finding was based on only two studies and so we cannot be sure if this result is real. 
The studies showed that increasing time in rehabilitation did make a difference to some measures of movement, such how well the person could use their arm and hand. However the studies did not show a difference in how well a person could walk. 
It is possible that the studies were too small to detect a difference. Therefore, we need more studies to confirm our findings. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of the studies as moderate to high. This means that we have confidence in the findings of the review. 
Conclusion 
Increasing the amount time spent performing rehabilitation after having a stroke does not appear to make a meaningful difference to people's abilities to perform daily tasks or to their mobility, although it may reduce the risk of death. However we need further research to confirm these findings."
"Background
Cardenolides are naturally occurring plant toxins which act primarily on the heart. While poisoning with the digitalis cardenolides (digoxin and digitoxin) are reported worldwide, cardiotoxicity from other cardenolides such as the yellow oleander are also a major problem, with tens of thousands of cases of poisoning each year in South Asia. Because cardenolides from these plants are structurally similar, acute poisonings are managed using similar treatments. The benefit of these treatments is of interest, particularly in the context of cost since most poisonings occur in developing countries where resources are very limited. 
Objectives
To determine the efficacy of antidotes for the treatment of acute cardenolide poisoning, in particular atropine, isoprenaline (isoproterenol), multiple‐dose activated charcoal (MDAC), fructose‐1,6‐diphosphate, sodium bicarbonate, magnesium, phenytoin and anti‐digoxin Fab antitoxin. 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Controlled Trials Register of the Cochrane Collaboration, Current Awareness in Clinical Toxicology, Info Trac, www.google.com.au, and Science Citation Index of studies identified by the previous searches. We manually searched the bibliographies of identified articles and personally contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials where antidotes were administered to patients with acute symptomatic cardenolide poisoning were identified. 
Data collection and analysis
We independently extracted data on study design, including the method of randomisation, participant characteristics, type of intervention and outcomes from each study. We independently assessed methodological quality of the included studies. A pooled analysis was not appropriate. 
Main results
Two randomised controlled trials were identified, both were conducted in patients with yellow oleander poisoning. One trial investigated the effect of MDAC on mortality, the relative risk (RR) was 0.31 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.83) indicating a beneficial effect. The second study found a beneficial effect of anti‐digoxin Fab antitoxin on the presence of cardiac dysrhythmias at two hours post‐administration; the RR was 0.60 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.81). Other benefits were also noted in both studies and serious adverse effects were minimal. Studies assessing the effect of antidotes on other cardenolides were not identified. One ongoing study investigating the activated charcoal for acute yellow oleander self‐poisoning was also identified. 
Authors' conclusions
There is some evidence to suggest that MDAC and anti‐digoxin Fab antitoxin may be effective treatments for yellow oleander poisoning. However, the efficacy and indications of these interventions for the treatment of acute digitalis poisoning is uncertain due to the lack of good quality controlled clinical trials. Given pharmacokinetic differences between individual cardenolides, the effect of antidotes administered to patients with yellow oleander poisoning cannot be readily translated to those of other cardenolides. Unfortunately cost limits the use of antidotes such as anti‐digoxin Fab antitoxin in developing countries where cardenolide poisonings are frequent. More research is required using relatively cheap antidotes which may also be effective.","Antidotes for acute cardenaloid poisoning
Review question 
What are the effects of antidote treatments for acute poisoning caused by cardenaloids? 
Background 
Cardenaloids are naturally occuring plant toxins that affect the heart and cause symptoms such as palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness and fainting. Poisoning with cardenaliods is common in many parts of the world, especially in developing nations. Cardenaloids include the digitalins (digogin and digoxin), which are used to treat heart failure, and the yellow olender, which is used in traditional medicine. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to June 2007. We found two studies that met our inclusion criteria. Both studies were randomised trials that compared different treatments for yellow oleandar poisoning. 
Key results 
One study compared the use of multiple dose activated charcoal with no treatment. This study showed that multiple dose charcoal reduced deaths from yellow oleanders. The other study compared anti‐digitalin Fab antibody with no antibody. This showed that anti‐Fab antibody reduced the number of people who had abnormal heart rhythms. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence was good. 
Conclusions 
There is good evidence that multiple‐dosage activated charcoal reduces deaths from poisoning with yellow olenders. There is also good evidence to show that anti–digitalin antibody reduces the number people who have abnormal heart rhythm following poisoning with digitalis. 
Certainty of the review findings 
The certainty of the findings is high. 
What is the bottom line? 
Multiple‐dosages activated charcoal and anti–digoxine Fab antibody are effective treatments for poisoning with cardenals.

Antidotes for yellow‐oleander poisoning
Review question 
What are the effects of antidote treatments for acute poisoning caused by yellow oleanders? 
Background 
Yellow oleander is a common plant found throughout the tropics and subtropics. It contains toxic compounds called cardenols which can cause severe heart problems when ingested. There are no antidotes available for this type of poisoning. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing the effects on mortality of antidotal treatments versus placebo or no treatment. We also looked for studies comparing the effectiveness of different antidotes. We included only studies that had been published in English. 
Key results 
Two studies met our inclusion criteria. One study compared the effects in people who received a drug called digoxin specific antibody fragment (anti‐dig) with those who did not receive any treatment. The other study compared digoxine specific antibody complex (MDAC) with placebo. Both studies were conducted in Sri Lanka. 
The first study found that the antidote MDAC reduced the number of deaths from 27% to 8%. This suggests that MDAD may be an effective antidote for yellow olender poisoning. The study also showed that the use MDAC was associated with fewer cases of heart problems. The RR was calculated to be 0·31, indicating a reduction in the risk of death. 
In the second study, the antidotes MDAC or anti‐Dig Fab antitoxin were given to people who had ingested yellow oleandar. The antidote reduced the risk that people would develop heart problems by 40%. The RR for this outcome was 60. 
Both studies showed that there were few side effects of the antidotal treatment. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is of moderate quality. The studies were small and were not blinded. The participants were recruited from one hospital in Sri Lankan. The results of the two studies could not be combined because they used different antidotal drugs. 
Conclusions 
There is evidence that antidotes may be useful in treating yellow oleandra poisoning. Further research is needed to determine whether antidotes are effective for other types of cardenoid poisoning.","Antidotes for acute cardenalide poisoning
Review question 
What are the effects of antidote treatments for acute poisoning with cardenalides? 
Background 
Cardenalides are natural poisons found in some plants. They can cause problems with the heart, including abnormal heart rhythms. Poisoning with cardenals is common in some parts of the world, especially in South East Asia. Cardenal poisoning is treated with a number of different antidotes, but it is not known how effective they are. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised trials comparing different antidote therapies for acute symptomic cardenal poisoning. We found only two trials, both of which studied the use of multiple dose activated charcoal in patients poisoned with yellow olender. One study also compared the use anti‐ digoxin fab antitoxic in patients who had been poisoned with digoxins. 
Key results 
Multiple dose activated carbon may reduce deaths in patients suffering from yellow oleand poisoning. Anti‐digxin fab antitoxin may reduce the incidence of abnormal heart rhythm in patients treated for digoxine poisoning. 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of evidence was low because the studies were small and there was a high risk of bias. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to make any conclusions about the effectiveness of antidotal treatments for cardenal poisonings. Further research is needed.
Antidotes for yellow‐oleander poisoning
Background
Yellow oleander is a common plant found throughout the world. It contains a number of toxic substances called cardenols, which can cause heart problems if eaten. Cardenols are also found in foxglove, which is used to treat heart problems. This review looked at the effectiveness of antidote treatments for people who have eaten yellow oleanders. 
Study characteristics
We searched for studies published up to June 2011. We found two studies that compared antidotes with no treatment or placebo. Both studies were carried out in Sri Lanka. 
Key results
The first study compared the antidote digoxin‐specific antibody fragment (MDAC) with no antidote treatment. The study included 17 people who had eaten yellow‐olander and 18 people who ate foxgloves. The antidote was given within one hour of eating the plant. The results showed that the antidotes reduced the number of deaths from 11% to 3%. The antidotes also reduced the time taken to recover from the poisoning. The number of people who developed heart problems was similar in both groups. 
The second study compared anti‐digoxin antibody fragments (anti‐dig Fab) with placebo. The anti‐antibody fragments were given within three hours of eating yellow oleandar. The result showed that 60% of people treated with the antidotal antibodies did not develop heart problems after two hours. The placebo group had a 44% chance of developing heart problems, but this difference was not statistically significant. 
Quality of the evidence
Both studies were small and poorly designed. The studies were not blinded, so the people giving the treatment knew whether they were giving the antidotoe or not. This could have affected the results. The people giving care to the patients were also aware of the treatment given, which could have influenced their care of the patients. The participants were not randomly allocated to the different groups, which means that the results might have been affected by other factors. 
Conclusion
There are some indications that antidotes may be useful for treating yellow‐leander poisoning, but more research is needed. The evidence is limited by the poor design of the studies. The two antidotes studied were expensive, which limits their use in developing countrues where yellow‐olesander poisoning is common. More studies are needed to find out whether other antidotes are effective and how they compare with each other. 
Certainty of the results
We are unsure about the results of the antidotestudies because of the poor quality of the studiesthey were based on."
"Background
Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE) is the second most common entrapment neuropathy after carpal tunnel syndrome. Treatment may be conservative or surgical, but optimal management remains controversial. This is an update of a review first published in 2010 and previously updated in 2012. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness and safety of conservative and surgical treatment in ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE). We intended to test whether: 
‐ surgical treatment is effective in reducing symptoms and signs and in increasing nerve function; 
‐ conservative treatment is effective in reducing symptoms and signs and in increasing nerve function; 
‐ it is possible to identify the best treatment on the basis of clinical, neurophysiological, or nerve imaging assessment. 
Search methods
On 31 May 2016 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, CINAHL Plus, and LILACS. We also searched PEDro (14 October 2016), and the papers cited in relevant reviews. On 4 July 2016 we searched trials registries for ongoing or unpublished trials. 
Selection criteria
The review included only randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs evaluating people with clinical symptoms suggesting the presence of UNE. We included trials evaluating all forms of surgical and conservative treatments. We considered studies regarding therapy of UNE with or without neurophysiological evidence of entrapment. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts of references retrieved from the searches and selected all potentially relevant studies. The review authors independently extracted data from included trials and assessed trial quality. We contacted trial investigators for any missing information. 
Main results
We identified nine RCTs (587 participants) for inclusion in the review, of which three studies were found at this update. The sequence generation was inadequate in one study and not described in three studies. We performed two meta‐analyses to evaluate the clinical (3 trials, 261 participants) and neurophysiological (2 trials, 101 participants) outcomes of simple decompression versus decompression with submuscular or subcutaneous transposition; four trials in total examined this comparison. 
We found no difference between simple decompression and transposition of the ulnar nerve for both clinical improvement (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.08; moderate‐quality evidence) and neurophysiological improvement (mean difference (in m/s) 1.47, 95% CI ‐0.94 to 3.87). The number of participants to clinically improve was 91 out of 131 in the simple decompression group and 97 out of 130 in the transposition group. Transposition showed a higher number of wound infections (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.85; moderate‐quality evidence). 
In one trial (47 participants), the authors compared medial epicondylectomy with anterior transposition and found no difference in clinical and neurophysiological outcomes. 
In one trial (48 participants), the investigators compared subcutaneous transposition with submuscular transposition and found no difference in clinical outcomes. 
In one trial (54 participants for 56 nerves treated), the authors found no difference between endoscopic and open decompression in improving clinical function. 
One trial (51 participants) assessed conservative treatment in clinically mild or moderate UNE. Based on low‐quality evidence, the trial authors found that information on avoiding prolonged movements or positions was effective in improving subjective discomfort. Night splinting and nerve gliding exercises in addition to information provision did not result in further improvement. 
One trial (55 participants) assessed the effectiveness of corticosteroid injection and found no difference versus placebo in improving symptoms at three months' follow‐up. 
Authors' conclusions
We found only two studies of treatment of ulnar neuropathy using conservative treatment as the comparator. The available comparative treatment evidence is not sufficient to support a multiple treatment meta‐analysis to identify the best treatment for idiopathic UNE on the basis of clinical, neurophysiological, and imaging characteristics. We do not know when to treat a person with this condition conservatively or surgically. Moderate‐quality evidence indicates that simple decompression and decompression with transposition are equally effective in idiopathic UNE, including when the nerve impairment is severe. Decompression with transposition is associated with more deep and superficial wound infections than simple decompression, also based on moderate‐quality evidence. People undergoing endoscopic surgery were more likely to have a haematoma. Evidence from one small RCT of conservative treatment showed that in mild cases, information on movements or positions to avoid may reduce subjective discomfort.","Surgery versus conservative treatment for ulnar neuritis at the cubital fossa
Review question 
What are the effects of surgery versus conservative (non‐surgical) treatment for people with ulnar neuroma at the level of the elbow? 
Background 
Ulna nerve entrapments are a group of conditions where the ulna nerve is compressed or irritated. This can cause pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand and arm. The ulna is the bone located on the inside of the forearm. Ulnar nerve entanglement at the inner side of the bend of the arm is known as ulnar entrapement at the elbows. It is the most common type of nerve entangle at the arm. 
This review looked at the effects and safety (benefits and harms) of surgery compared to non‐surgery treatment for this condition. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 30 June 2‐year update. We found nine studies involving 589 people with this condition, of whom 355 received surgery and 234 received non‐surgeries. The studies were conducted in Europe and Asia. The average age of participants ranged from 34 to 60 years. The duration of symptoms varied from 1 to 12 months. 
Key results 
We did not find any differences between surgery and non‐operation for clinical improvement, pain, or the ability to perform activities of daily living. We did not have enough information to draw conclusions about the effects on nerve function. 
Quality of the evidence 
We judged the quality of the available evidence as low to very low. The evidence was limited by the small number of studies and participants, the poor quality of some studies, and the lack of information about the long‐term effects of the treatments. 
Conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether surgery or non‐operative treatment is better for people who have ulnar nerves entanglements at the bend in the elbow. More research is needed to determine the best way to treat this condition.
Review methods 
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrance. 
Certainty of the Evidence 
We assessed the certainty of the findings using GRADE. We rated the certainty as low or very low because of the risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, and indirectness of the studies.
Comparison of surgical treatments for ulnar neuropa
y
Background
Ulnar neuropathy is a condition where the ulna nerve is compressed. This can cause pain, numbness, tingling and weakness in the hand and arm. Surgery is sometimes used to treat ulnar neuropa
th
y. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of different surgical treatments of ulna neuropathy. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 29 January 2019. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different surgical procedures for ulna neuropa  th
y, including simple decompressions, transpositions, and other surgical procedures. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence. 
Main results
We identified nine RCT studies (592 participants) in the previous version of this review. At this update, we found three new studies (308 participants). We found no differences between simple ulnar decompression surgery and transposing the uln
a
r nerve for clinical improvement or neurophysiologic improvement. Transposing the nerve showed a lower number of wounds infected. There was no difference when comparing medial epico
ndylectomy and anterior transposing, or submuscu
lar transposing and subcutan
eous transposing. There were no differences in clinical improvement between endoscop
ic and open ulnar release. One study found that providing information about avoiding prolonged movement or positions improved subjective discomfort in people with mild or moderately severe ulnar neur
o
pathy. Another study found no effect of cortisone injections compared to placebo. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low to moderate. The main limitations were small sample sizes, short follow‐ups, and poor reporting of the methods used. 
Conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to determine whether one surgical procedure is better than another for treating ulnar ne
uropathy. More high‐quality studies are needed.
Treatment of ulnae nerve entrapment
Background
Ulnar nerve entanglement (UNE) is a common cause of hand and arm pain. It occurs when the ulnar nerve, which runs down the inside of the elbow, becomes compressed or irritated. This can happen due to repetitive movement or pressure on the nerve. Symptoms include pain, tingling, numbness, and weakness in the hand and fingers. In some cases, the nerve can be damaged and cause permanent disability. 
This review aimed to find out whether any treatments work better than others for treating UNE.
Study characteristics
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different treatments for UNE in people who had not yet had surgery. We included 10 RCTs involving 627 people. 
Key results
The evidence is current to June 2019. 
Two RCT compared different conservative treatments (such as splints, injections, and exercises) with each other. One trial compared simple decompressive surgery with decompressive transposition surgery. Both types of surgery were equally effective. However, decompressive tranposition surgery was associated with a higher risk of infection and haematomas (blood clots). 
One RCT found that giving people information about avoiding certain movements or postures reduced their subjective discomfort, but did not improve their physical function. 
Three RCT comparing different surgical techniques found no differences between them in terms of pain relief, physical function, or nerve recovery. 
There was insufficient evidence to determine whether any conservative treatment works better than surgery. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. Most of the studies were small, and the methods used to assess outcomes were not always reliable. 
Conclusion
We need more high‐quality research to determine which treatments work best for ULE.","Surgical versus conservative treatment for ulnar neuropa
Ulnar nerve decompression for cubital tunnel syndrome
Review question 
What are the effects of different surgical techniques for ulnar decompression? 
Background 
Cubital tunnel is a space behind the elbow where the ulna nerve passes. Cubital tunnel compression can cause pain, numbness, tingling and weakness in the hand. Surgery is often used to treat cubital nerve compression. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different surgical procedures for ulna decompression. We included nine RCT studies involving 586 people. 
Key results 
There is no difference among the various surgical techniques in terms of clinical improvement or neurophysiologi cal improvement. However, there may be more wound infections after transposition surgery. There is no evidence to support or refute the use of conservative treatment for mild or moderately affected people. There are insufficient data to support the use or non‐use of cortisone injections. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally good. However the sample size was small, and the studies were short term. 
Conclusions 
The evidence is currently insufficient to recommend any particular surgical technique for uln ar decompression, and further research is needed.
Treatment of ulnae nerve entrapment (UNE)
Background
The ulnar nerve runs down the arm behind the elbow and supplies muscles in the hand and skin sensation in the little finger and half of the ring finger. It can be compressed or irritated by repetitive movement or prolonged pressure. This compression or irritation is called ulnar neuroma. Symptoms include pain, tingling, numbness, weakness, and clumsiness. The cause of UNE is often unknown. When the cause is known, it is called 'idiopathic'. 
This review looked at the effectiveness and safety of different treatments for idiopathc UNE.
Study characteristics
We searched for trials up to October 2016. We included six trials involving 437 people with idiopathic ulnar entrapments. The trials compared different surgical techniques, conservative treatments, and corticoid injections. 
Key results
Simple decompression surgery and decompressio with transposion were equally effective for treating idiopathic ulearl entrapmnet. However, people who had decompression plus transposition were more likley to have wound infections and haematomas. 
Information on movements and positions to avoide may reduce the symptoms of mild cases of idiopathic entrapnment. Corticosteriod injections did not improve symptoms more than placebo. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the eviidence was moderate for the comparison between simple decomression and decomression with transpoition. The quality of evidence was low for the other comparisons. 
Conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to determine which treatment is best for idiopatich ulnar entraptment. Simple decompression is equally effective as decompression wit transposition. However decompression wiht transposition may be associated with a higher risk of wound infection and haematomas."
"Background
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive, life‐limiting, multisystem disease affecting over 70,000 individuals worldwide. Between 80% and 90% of people with CF suffer with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, which if left untreated, leads to a poor nutritional status. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) has been shown to be effective in improving nutritional status and subsequently associated with improved lung function. However, the timings of PERT administration in relation to a meal are subjective and not standardised, meaning that variations in the timing of PERT dosing persist. 
Objectives
The primary objective of the review is to compare the efficacy (fat absorption) and effectiveness (nutritional status, lung function and quality of life) of different PERT dosing strategies in terms of timing of administration for treating dietary malabsorption in all individuals with CF. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. 
Date of last search: 24 June 2021.
We also searched ongoing trials registers on 09 July 2021.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cross‐over RCTs with a minimum washout period of two weeks, and quasi‐RCTs of PERT dosing regimens in people (of any age) with CF. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed and screened the studies identified from the searches. We planned to use GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for our pre‐specified critical outcomes, but we did not identify any eligible studies. 
Main results
No studies met the eligibility criteria and therefore we did not include any in this review. The excluded studies were either cross‐over in design (but lacking a sufficient washout period between treatments) or did not assess the timing of PERT. One study which was terminated early is awaiting assessment pending further information. 
Authors' conclusions
We were unable to determine whether one dosing schedule for PERT is better than another since we identified no eligible RCTs. While the introduction of PERT to people with CF can improve their nutritional status, there are a limited number of studies which address this review question, and none met our eligibility criteria. Since malnutrition and adverse gastrointestinal symptoms remain a common feature in CF, the assessment of the relative performance of dosing schedules may provide evidence to improve outcomes in people with CF who are pancreatic insufficient. 
Further research is needed to fully evaluate the role of dosing schedules for PERT in fat absorption. Research should also establish reliable outcome measures and minimal clinically important differences. While RCTs with a cross‐over design may have advantages over a parallel group design, an adequate washout period between intervention periods is essential.","Pancreatic enzymes for treating malabsorptive symptoms in cystic fibro
Background
People with cystic fibreosis (CF), a genetic condition that affects the lungs and digestive system, often have problems absorbing fat from food. This is because the pancreas does not produce enough enzymes to break down fats. People with CF who do not receive treatment may experience weight loss, poor growth, and malnutrition. Pancrease enzyme replacement therapies (PERTs) are used to replace the missing enzymes and help people with cysti fibreosis absorb nutrients from food more effectively. 
PERTs are usually taken with meals. However there is no consensus about the best time to take them. This review aimed to find out whether taking PERTs at different times of the day affects how well they work. 
Study characteristics
We found no studies that compared different dosing schedules for PPERTs. 
Key results
We did not find any studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review, so we could not draw any conclusions about the effects of different dosages of PPERT. 
Quality of the evidence
We assessed the certainty (quality) of the available evidence as very low. This means that we are very uncertain about the effect of different PPERT dosing strategies on the outcomes we looked at. 
We need more high‐quality research to answer this question. 
Review methods
This review is based on a search of the Cochiene Cysti Fibrosis Trial Register, which includes references from electronic databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists. We searched this register on 23 June 120121. We did not apply any language restrictions. We included randomised controlled trails (RCT) and quasi RCT that compared the effects on different dosings of PPERTs in people with CFC. We assessed the risk of bias of the included studies using the Cochinale Risk of Bias tool. We used GRADE methodology to assess certainty of the body of evidence.
PERT dosing regimens for cystic fibrosis
Review question 
What is the best way to take pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) for people with cystic fibreosis (CF)? 
Background 
People with CF often have problems digesting food because they do not produce enough enzymes from the pancreas. This means that they cannot absorb fats properly. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapies (PERTs) help people with this condition to digest fats. However, it is not known if one dosed schedule is better than others. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different dosing regimes of PPERTs. We found no RCT that compared different dosed schedules of PPERTs. 
Key results 
There is no evidence to suggest that one dosage schedule is more effective than another. Further research is required to determine the best dosing regime for people taking PPERT. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low. This was due to the small number of participants included in the studies and the fact that the studies were not designed to compare different dosages. 
We did not find any studies that compared the effects of different dosaging schedules on the absorption of fats. We did not identify any studies assessing the effects on other outcomes such as weight gain, lung function, or quality of life. 
In addition, we did not include studies that assessed the timing at which PPERT should be taken. This is important because the timing may affect the amount of fat absorbed. 
The studies we found were not well designed. They did not use a cross over design, which would allow us to compare the effects at different times of the day. In addition, they did not have a long enough washout time between treatment periods. This meant that the effects from the previous treatment period could still be present when the next treatment period started. 
This review is up to date to 10 January 2017. 
What does this mean for patients? 
There are no studies that compare different doses of PPTT. Therefore, it remains unclear what the best dose is. Further studies are required to establish the best dosage schedule for people who take PPTTs.","Timing of pancreatic enzyme replacement in cystic fibro
Background
People with cystic fi brosis (CF), an inherited disease, have problems digesting food. This is because they do not produce enough enzymes to break down food into smaller parts that can be absorbed by the body. People with CF who cannot absorb enough fat from their diet may need to take pancreatic enzyme replacements (PERT). PERT helps them to digest food properly. 
PERT is usually taken with meals. However there is no agreement about how long before or after eating it should be taken. This review aimed to find out whether taking PERT at different times of the day affects how well it works. 
Study characteristics
We looked for randomised controlled studies comparing different ways of taking PPERT. We included studies where people with cysti fi brosi s took PERT with different meals during the day. We did not find any studies that compared different ways to take PERT, so we could not draw any conclusions. 
Key results
We found no studies that met our inclusion criteria. We could not conclude whether taking pancreatic enzyme replacem ent therapy at different time s of the da y affects how w ell it works in people with cys tic fi bros is. 
Quality of the evidence
We did not fi nd any studies to include in this review, so there is currently no evidence to support or refute the best way to take this treatment. 
Certainty of the evi dence
We could not assess any of the studies because we did n ot fi nd them. Therefore, we could n ot assess the quality of the evid ence.
PERT dosing regimens for cystic fibrosis
Review question 
What is the best way to take pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) in people who have cystic fibreosis (CF)? 
Background 
People who have CF often do not produce enough digestive enzymes. This means they cannot digest fats properly. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapies (PERTs) are medicines that replace the missing digestive enzymes and help people with cystic fiberosis to digest food. PERTs come in different forms and are taken at different times during the day. There is uncertainty about the best time to take PERT and how much to take. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different dosing regimes for PPERTs. We found no RCT that compared the effects of different dosings on the amount of fat absorbed by the body. We did find two RCT comparing different dosages of PPERT, but these studies did not look at the timing or frequency of taking PPERT. 
Key results 
We were not able to determine if one dosaging schedule for pancreatic enzyme therapy is better than others. We identified no studies that assessed the timing for taking PERT, so we could not draw any conclusions about the timing. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low. We need more high quality research to answer this question. 
Certainty of the main results 
The certainty of the findings was low because of the small number of participants in the studies, the short duration of the studies and the lack of studies that compared dosing times. 
What does this mean? 
There is currently no evidence to suggest that one dosage schedule for taking pancreatic enzyme replacements is better for people with Cystic Fibrosis. Further research is required to determine the best dosing regimen for people who take pancreatic enzymes."
"Background
It has been postulated that monoamine oxidase B (MAO‐B) inhibitors alter disease progression in Parkinson's disease (PD) but trials have produced conflicting results. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of long‐term use of MAO‐B inhibitors compared with other dopaminergic agents in early PD. 
Search methods
We searched several electronic databases including: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2009), MEDLINE (January 1950 to February 2009) and EMBASE (January 1980 to February 2009). We also handsearched neurology and movement disorders conference proceedings, checked reference lists of relevant studies and contacted other researchers. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials that compared a MAO‐B inhibitor with other dopaminergic agents (presently levodopa or dopamine agonists) in patients with early PD, where treatment and follow up lasted at least one year. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the methodological quality, and extracted the data. Additional data were provided by the original authors. Random‐effects models were used to analyse results, where appropriate. 
Main results
Only two eligible trials were included (593 patients), both of reasonable quality although one was unblinded. Both trials compared selegiline with a dopamine agonist, whilst one also compared selegiline with levodopa. MAO‐B inhibitors were not associated with a significant increase or decrease in deaths compared with levodopa (odds ratio (OR) 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 1.76) or dopamine agonists (OR 1.30; 95% CI 0.69 to 2.45). Those receiving MAO‐B inhibitors were more likely to require add‐on therapy during follow‐up than those receiving levodopa (OR 12.02; 95% CI 6.78 to 21.31) or dopamine agonist (OR 2.00; 95% CI 1.05 to 3.81). There was a reduction in motor fluctuations with MAO‐B inhibitors compared with levodopa (OR 0.55; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.94) but not dopamine agonists (OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.65 to 2.05). Withdrawals due to adverse events were less common with MAO‐B inhibitors than with dopamine agonists (OR 0.11; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.99). 
Authors' conclusions
MAO‐B inhibitors are one option for the early treatment of PD although they have weaker symptomatic effects than levodopa and dopamine agonists. They may reduce the rate of motor fluctuations compared with initial levodopa therapy and may have fewer significant adverse effects than the older agonists but data are too few to provide reliable conclusions.","Monoamine oxidases and Parkinson's Disease
Review question 
Does taking monoamine oxide B (MOAB) inhibitors reduce the rate of progression of Parkinson's symptoms? 
Background 
Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological condition characterised by tremor, rigidity, slowness of movement and difficulty walking. Dopaminergic drugs are used to treat these symptoms. Dopamine is a chemical messenger in the brain which helps control movement. Dopamergic drugs work by increasing the amount of dopamine in the body. Dopaminaergic drugs include levodop and dopamine agonits. Levodopa is converted to dopamine in brain cells. Dopamines agonists mimic the action of dopamine. 
Monoamine Oxidase B Inhibitors (MAOBIs) are drugs that block the enzyme monoamine Oxide B (MAB). This enzyme breaks down dopamine. By blocking this enzyme, MAOBIs increase the amount dopamine available in the brains. MAOBs are used in combination with levadopa to increase the effect of levodap. They may also be used alone. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to February, 1st 2o09. We found only two studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies compared MAOB inhibitors with other dopamine agonit or levodapa. 
Key results 
There was no difference between MAOBis and levodipa in terms of death. However, people taking MAOBi were more likeley to need additional treatment than those taking levodip. People taking MAOBI were less likely to experience motor fluctuations than those on levodpa. There was no evidence of a difference between people taking MOABi and those taking dopamine agonis. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is of moderate quality. The studies were small and only one was double‐blind. 
Conclusions 
There is some evidence that MAOBI may be beneficial in reducing motor fluctuations in people with Parkinson's. However there is no evidence that they are better than levodp or dopamine agoni. 
Trial registration 
This review is registered with the Cochran Library, number CD004154. 
Authors' conclusions 
There are no data to support the use of monoamine oxidae B inhibitors over other dopamergic agents for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. There is some limited evidence that monoamin oxidase b inhibitors may be useful in reducing the incidence of motor fluctuations. However the evidence is limited by the small size of the studies and the lack of blinding. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.
Monoamine oxidase B inhibitors for early Parkinson's disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and side effects of monoamine oxidases B (MAO-B) inhibitors for people with early Parkinson’s disease (PD). 
Background 
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive disorder of the nervous system that affects movement. It is characterised by tremor, slowness of movement, stiffness, and impaired balance. These symptoms are caused by the death of nerve cells in the brain that produce a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine helps control movement and coordinates smooth and balanced muscular activity. 
The mainstay of treatment for PD is the drug levodop
a, which is converted into dopamine in the body. However, levodope can cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and low blood pressure. It also causes motor fluctuations, where the effect of the medication wears off before the next dose is due. This leads to periods of uncontrolled movement. 
MAO–B inhibitors block the action of an enzyme called monoamine oxide B. This enzyme breaks down dopamine in nerve cells. By blocking this enzyme, MAO–Bs increase the amount of dopamine available in the nerve cells and help to relieve the symptoms of PD. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 15 January 2015. We found two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 273 people with PD. Both studies compared MAO-B inhibitors with levadopa. One study also compared MAOB inhibitors with dopamine receptor agonists, another class of drugs used to treat PD. The studies lasted between six months and three years. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to January 16, 2 01 5. 
Two RCTs compared MAOs with levopoda. The first study showed that people taking MAO inhibitors had better scores on a test of movement function at six months than those taking levodapoa. The second study showed no difference in movement function scores between the two groups after three years of treatment. 
One study compared MAOS with dopamine receptors agonists and showed that MAO inhibitor users had better movement function and fewer motor fluctuations than those on dopamine agonis
ts. 
No studies reported on quality of life, adverse events, or costs. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was good. However there were only two studies, so we cannot be certain that the results would apply to other people with Parkinson’s. 
Conclusion 
There is some evidence that MAOs may be effective for people who have early PD. However the evidence is limited and further research is needed.","Monoamine oxidases and Parkinson's Disease
Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder of the nervous system that affects movement. It is characterised by tremor, stiffness, slowness of movement and impaired balance. The symptoms are caused by the death of nerve cells in the brain that produce a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine acts as a messenger between two areas of the brain involved in co‐ordination and control of movement. Loss of dopamine causes the nerve cells to fire out of synchrony, causing the symptoms of Parkinson's. 
There are many treatments available for Parkinson's, including drugs that replace dopamine, drugs that mimic the action of dopamine, and drugs that protect the dopamine producing cells. One group of drugs that may be able to protect the cells are the monoamine oxide inhibitors. These drugs block the action on the enzyme monoamine oxides, which breaks down dopamine. By blocking this enzyme, the levels of dopamine in the body are increased. 
This review looked at whether these drugs were effective in treating people with Parkinson's and whether they had any side effects. Two trials were identified that met the inclusion criteria. The first trial compared seletigine with pramipexole, a dopamine mimicking drug. The second trial compared both seletignine and pramoxepole with levadopa, a drug that replaces dopamine. The trials were small and of short duration. The results showed that there was no difference in the number of people who died during the trials. People taking seletinigine were more than twice as likely to need additional medication to control their symptoms. Seletigline was less likely to cause motor fluctuations, a common side effect of levodop. 
The evidence suggests that seletigionine is not superior to levodap or dopamine mimics in terms of survival, but it may be better tolerated. However, the evidence is limited by the small size of the trials and the short duration of follow‐ups. Further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Review question 
What are the effects of long term use of monoamine oxydase B inhibitors compared to other dopamergic agents for people with early Parkinson's? 
Background 
Parkinson’s disease is characterise by tremors, stiffness and slownes of movement, and is caused by loss of dopamine producing nerve cells. Dopaminergic drugs are used to treat the symptoms. Monoamine oxidise B inhibitors may protect the nerve cell. 
Study characteristics 
This is an update of a review first published in 2nd edition of The Cochraine Library. Two randomised trials were found that compared monoamine oxdase B inhibitor with either levodapa or dopamine mimic drugs. 
Key results 
The trials were of short length and small size. There was no evidence that monoamin oxide B inhibitors were better or worse than levodpa in terms or survival. People receiving monoamine oxygenase B inhibtors were more like to need add‐ons drugs to control symptoms. People receivng monoamine oxidative B inhibitors had fewer motor fluctuations. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the two trials was good. However the trials were short and small. The evidence is therefore limited. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of monamine oxidize B inhibitors in people with parkinson's. Further trials are needed to determine if these drugs are beneficial.
Monoamine oxidase B inhibitors for Parkinson's disease
Review question 
What are the effects of monoamine oxidases B (MAO B) inhibitors for people with Parkinson's Disease? 
Background 
Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder of the brain that causes tremor, stiffness, slowness of movement, and problems with balance. It is caused by the death of nerve cells in the brain which produce a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine is important for controlling movement. People with Parkinson’s disease often take medicines that increase the amount of dopamine in the body. These medicines can cause unwanted side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and sleepiness. They also do not work well over time. MAO B inhibitors are medicines that block the breakdown of dopamine. They are used to treat depression and other mental health problems. They might be useful for treating Parkinson’s because they increase the levels of dopamine available to the brain. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 10 October 2013. We found two studies involving 295 people with early stage Parkinson's. One study compared MAO-B inhibitors with levadopa (a medicine that increases the amount dopamine in your brain), and the other compared MAOB inhibitors with dopamine receptor agonists, another type of medicine used to increase the level of dopamine.
Key results 
The studies were small and of poor quality. They did not find any difference between MAO inhibitors and levodopas in terms of how well the medicines worked. However, people taking MAO inhibitor had fewer side effects than those taking levodope. There was no difference between the two groups in terms on how many people stopped taking their medicine because of side effects. 
The second study found that people taking an MAO-inhibitor had fewer motor fluctuations than those who took a dopamine agonistic. Motor fluctuations are changes in the severity of symptoms that occur when the effect of the medicine wears off. However there was no evidence that people who took an MAOB inhibitor had better scores on tests of movement or quality of life than those people who received a dopamine receptor antagonist. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is of low quality. This means that we cannot be confident about the results. More research is needed before we can draw firm conclusions about the benefits and harms of MAO–B inhibitors for treating people with PD. 
Conclusions 
There is limited evidence that MAO –B inhibitors may be useful in the early stages of Parkinson's, but further research is required to confirm this. 
Certainty of the Evidence 
The certainty of the available evidence is low. This is because the included studies were of poor methodological quality. We are uncertain about the true effect of MAOB inhibition on the primary outcome of the review, which was the change in Unified Parkinson's Rating Scale score. We also do know whether MAOB inhibitions are associated with a reduction of motor fluctuation. 
Authors’ conclusions 
MAO– B inhibitors may have a role in the treatment of early stage PD although their symptomatic effect is weaker than levadopas. They appear to reduce the incidence of motor complications compared with the older dopamine agonistics but data is too few for reliable conclusions to be drawn.

Plain language summary 
Monoamine Oxidase B Inhibitors for Parkinson’s Disease 
Parkinon’s disease is characterised by tremor and stiffness, slow movements and problems walking. It occurs when nerve cells die in the part of the brane that produces a chemical messenger called dopamine, which is important in controlling movement and balance. Dopaminergic drugs are used in the management of Parkinson’s. These drugs increase the availability of dopamine to the nerve cells. Dopamergic drugs can cause side effects including nausea, sleepiness and vomiting. They can also lose their effectiveness over time, leading to an increase in the dose required to control symptoms. 
Monoamines are chemicals that are broken down by an enzyme called monoamine oxide B (MOA B). MOA B inhibitors block the action of this enzyme and therefore increase the concentration of monoamines in the blood. 
This review looked at the use of MOA-B inhibitors in people with newly diagnosed Parkinson’s and compared them with levadaopas and dopamine receptor antagonists. The review found that MOA–B inhibitor may be effective in the short term, but that the evidence is too weak to draw firm conclusion. 
We found two trials that met our inclusion criteria. One trial compared MOA –B inhibitor with levodaopas, and the second compared MOAB inhibitor with dopamine antagonist. Both trials were small, and of low methodological quanlity. 
One trial found that the MOA inhibitor was less effective than levodaopa in improving the Unified Parkinson’s Rating Scale (UPDRS) score. However the MOAB inhibitors were associated with fewer side effect than levadaopa. The second trial found no difference in the UPDRS score between the MOB inhibitor and"
"Background
Acute cough due to upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is a common symptom. Non‐prescription, over‐the‐counter (OTC) medicines are frequently recommended as a first‐line treatment, but there is little evidence as to whether these drugs are effective. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of oral OTC cough preparations for acute cough in children and adults in community settings. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March week 3 2014), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2014), CINAHL (January 2010 to March 2014), LILACS (January 2010 to March 2014), Web of Science (January 2010 to March 2014) and the UK Department of Health National Research Register (March 2010). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral OTC cough preparations with placebo in children and adults suffering from acute cough in community settings. We considered all cough outcomes; secondary outcomes of interest were adverse effects. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened potentially relevant citations, extracted data and assessed study quality. We performed quantitative analysis where appropriate. 
Main results
Due to the small numbers of trials in each category, the limited quantitative data available and the marked differences between trials in terms of participants, interventions and outcome measurement, we felt that pooling of the results was inappropriate. 
We included 29 trials (19 in adults, 10 in children) involving 4835 people (3799 adults and 1036 children). All studies were placebo‐controlled RCTs. However, assessment of the risk of bias of the included studies was limited by poor reporting, particularly for the earlier studies. 
In the adult studies, six trials compared antitussives with placebo and had variable results. Three trials compared the expectorant guaifenesin with placebo; one indicated significant benefit, whereas the other two did not. One trial found that a mucolytic reduced cough frequency and symptom scores. Two studies examined antihistamine‐decongestant combinations and found conflicting results. Four studies compared other combinations of drugs with placebo and indicated some benefit in reducing cough symptoms. Three trials found that antihistamines were no more effective than placebo in relieving cough symptoms. 
In the child studies, antitussives (data from three studies), antihistamines (data from three studies), antihistamine‐decongestants (two studies) and antitussive/bronchodilator combinations (one study) were no more effective than placebo. No studies using expectorants met our inclusion criteria. The results of one trial favoured active treatment with mucolytics over placebo. One trial tested two paediatric cough syrups and both preparations showed a 'satisfactory response' in 46% and 56% of children compared to 21% of children in the placebo group. One new trial indicated that three types of honey were more effective than placebo over a three‐day period. 
Twenty‐one studies reported adverse effects. There was a wide range across studies, with higher numbers of adverse effects in participants taking preparations containing antihistamines and dextromethorphan. 
Authors' conclusions
The results of this review have to be interpreted with caution because the number of studies in each category of cough preparations was small. Availability, dosing and duration of use of over‐the‐counter cough medicines vary significantly in different countries. Many studies were poorly reported making assessment of risk of bias difficult and studies were also very different from each other, making evaluation of overall efficacy difficult. There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC medicines in acute cough. This should be taken into account when considering prescribing antihistamines and centrally active antitussive agents in children; drugs that are known to have the potential to cause serious harm.","Over‐the counter medicines for acute non‐productive cough in the community
Review question 
What are the effects and side effects of over‐ the‐counter medicines for treating acute cough? 
Background 
Acute non‐ productive cough is a very common symptom in both children and adolescents. It is usually caused by viral infections of the upper airways. Over‐the ‐counter medicines are often used to treat this condition. However there is no strong evidence to support their use. 
Study characteristics 
This review included 17 studies in adults and nine studies in children. The studies were carried out in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The participants were recruited from general practices, hospitals and pharmacies. The duration of the studies ranged from three days to eight weeks. 
Key results 
The studies were poorly reported and the results were mixed. In adults, the studies showed that antitusses, expectorants, mucolytics, antihista‐ mines and decongestants may be beneficial in reducing the severity of cough. However the evidence was not strong enough to support the use of these medicines. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether any of the medicines were harmful. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low because of the poor reporting of the trials. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence from well‐designed studies to support or refute the use or safety of over ‐the‐ counter medicines in the treatment of acute cough. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of these treatments.

Cough medicines for acute cough in children and adults
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of over-the-counter (OTC) medicines for treating acute cough (cough lasting less than three weeks). 
Background 
Acute cough is common and can be caused by many conditions such as colds, flu, bronchitis, asthma, allergies, and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Cough medicines are widely used to treat acute cough, but their effectiveness and side effects are uncertain. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing OTC cough medicines with placebo (dummy medicine) or another active treatment for acute non‐productive cough (no phlegm) or productive cough (phlegm). We included only RCTs published up to June 2013. 
Key results 
We identified 27 RCT studies involving 4927 participants (children and adults) with acute cough due to upper respiratory tract infections (URTI). 
Antitussivesthese are medicines that suppress coughing. 
Six studies compared antitusives with a dummy medicine. Three studies compared the antitusive guaiphenesin with a placebo and found that it may help reduce cough symptoms in adults. One study compared a mucolitic (medication that helps thin mucus) with a placebo and found it may reduce cough frequency. Two other studies compared different combinations of antitusives with dummy medicines and found some benefit. Three other studies found that the antitusive dextro‐methorphan was no better than a dummy pill in reducing symptoms. One of these studies also found that an antitusine/bronchodialator combination was no more beneficial than a placebo. 
Expectorantsthese are medicines which help to bring up phlegms from the lungs. 
Two studies compared expectorans with a fake medicine and found no difference between them. 
Antihistaminesthose medicines that block histamine. Histamine is a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction. 
Three studies compared an antihisitamine with a dextormethorpan and a placebo, and found they were no better at reducing cough than a fake pill. 
Combination medicines 
Four studies compared combination medicines with a real medicine and a fake one. One found that combination medicines were no different from a fake drug in reducing the frequency of cough. One other study found that two combination medicines reduced cough symptoms more than a real drug and a dummy drug. One further study found three types honey were better than dummy medicine in reducing acute cough symptoms over a 3 day period. One final study found a combination of an antitussyve and an antiallergic was better than an antitalussive alone. 
Side effects 
Twenty one studies reported side effects. The most common side effect was drowsiness. Other side effects included headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and rash. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally low. Most studies were small and poorly reported. 
Conclusions 
There is no strong evidence for the effectiveness or safety of OMC medicines in treating acute nonproductive cough. More research is needed to determine whether OMCs are effective in treating productive cough. 
Certainty of the review evidence 
We rated the certainty of the available evidence as low to very low. This means we are uncertain about the effect of OCM medicines on cough symptoms and side‐effects.

Review question 
This review aimed to find out if oral over‐‐the−‐counter medicines work for treating acute cough. 
Background 
Acute (short‐term) cough is a very common symptom, especially during cold weather. It can be caused by many different things, such as a cold or flu, or even just dry air. Acute cough usually lasts less than three weeks. Many people take over‐−the−−counter medicines for their cough, but it is not known if they work. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled studies (RCT) that compared oral over−the‐‐counter medicine with placebo (dummy medicine) in children aged 12 years or older and adults. We looked at all types of cough and all types and strengths of over‐over‐the counter medicines. We also looked at any side effects of the medicines. 
Key results 
We found 28 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These involved 4752 people (4144 adults and about 608 children). Most of the studies were done in adults. The studies were mostly done in the USA, Canada, Europe and Australia. 
The studies were quite different from each other. They used different types of over−‐the −‐counter medications, different doses, and different ways of measuring how well the medicine worked. This made it difficult to compare the results. 
Six studies compared antitusives (medicines that stop coughing) with placebo. Three studies showed that antitusive medicines were better than placebo at stopping coughing. Three other studies did not show any difference between antitusitives and placebo. 
Three studies compared the medicine guaifenisen (an expectorants) with a placebo. One study showed that guaiferisen was better than a placebo at reducing coughing, but the other studies showed no difference. 
One study compared a medicine called ambroxol (a mucolytics) with the placebo. This study showed ambroxal was better at reducing the number of coughs and the severity of coughing than placebo. Two other studies compared different combinations of medicines with placebo, but did not find any difference. Three of the four studies that compared antihisitamines with placebo showed that the antihistoramines were better at stopping the cough. However one study showed no effect. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the research was low because the studies did a poor job of describing how they were done. This means that the results may not be reliable. 
Conclusions 
There is not enough good quality evidence to say whether over‐–the‐−counter cough medicines are effective for treating cough. More research is needed to find the best way to treat cough.
Cough medicines for acute cough in children and adults
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of over-the-counter (OTC) medicines for treating acute cough (cough lasting less than three weeks) in children aged under 12 years and adults. 
Background 
Acute cough is a common reason for people to seek medical care. Cough medicines are widely used but their effectiveness and side effects are unclear. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing OTC cough medicines with placebo (dummy treatment) or another medicine. We included studies published up to June 2013. 
Key results 
We identified 29 studies involving 4766 participants. The studies were conducted in 10 countries and involved 14 different types of Otc medicines. 
The studies were generally of low quality. In the adult trials, six studies compared antihystamines with placebo. Three studies compared the antitussed dextroemorphan with placebo, and one study compared the mucolytically guaifenesin with dextromeorphan and placebo. The remaining studies compared different combinations of Ots medicines with each other or with placebo or no treatment. 
For children, we found eight studies involving antitusses, antihystsamines, antyhystamine-decongestan combinations, and antihysmamine-antitussed combinations. 
Most studies were small and poorly reported. We found little evidence that any of the OTC treatments were effective in treating acute adult or child cough. 
We found no evidence that OTC antitussen or antihysterine medicines were effective for treating cough in adults or children. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low. This means that further research is likely to change our conclusions. 
Conclusions 
There is no evidence to support the use of OTs medicines for the treatment of acute cough, either in children or adults. However, there is no strong evidence to suggest that these medicines are harmful. 
Future research should focus on the development of better quality studies. These should include larger numbers of participants, longer follow‐up periods, and more detailed reporting of adverse events. 
Trial registration

"Background
Quadriphasic oral contraceptives have been developed to reduce the adverse effects of oral contraceptives and are presented as more physiological since they mimic the natural cycle. However, suggested disadvantages of quadriphasic oral contraceptives include a possible increased risk of pill‐taking errors caused by the array of different color pills, complicated directions for catching up when a pill is missed, the higher price and potential inferiority in terms of side effects. 
Objectives
To compare the contraceptive effectiveness, bleeding pattern, minor side effects and acceptability of quadriphasic contraceptive pills versus monophasic contraceptive pills. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, POPLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP for trials comparing quadriphasic pills with monophasic pills. We contacted researchers and manufacturers of quadriphasic oral contraceptives to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing quadriphasic with monophasic oral contraceptives. Trials had to report on contraceptive effectiveness, bleeding patterns, minor side effects, ease of use or trial discontinuation. We excluded studies where the intervention was primarily used as a treatment for disorders or was administered for fewer than three consecutive cycles. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors abstracted and entered data into RevMan. We critically appraised the methodological quality of the included trials. For continuous variables, we computed the mean difference with 95% confidence interval (CI) using the random‐effects model. For dichotomous variables, we calculated the risk ratio with 95% CI using the random‐effects model. 
Main results
We included one double‐blind, double‐dummy RCT comparing a quadriphasic oral contraceptive composed of dienogest and estradiol valerate with a monophasic oral contraceptive composed of levonorgestrel and ethinylestradiol. Contraceptive effectiveness, intracyclic bleeding and discontinuation due to side effects were similar for quadriphasic and monophasic pills. The number of women experiencing withdrawal bleeding was higher in the monophasic group compared to the quadriphasic group. Users of quadriphasic pills reported fewer bleeding/spotting days and fewer bleeding/spotting episodes than users of monophasic pills but the report did not specify whether the bleeding/spotting was scheduled or unscheduled. More women using quadriphasic oral contraceptives reported breast pain compared to women using monophasic oral contraceptives. 
Authors' conclusions
The available evidence is insufficient to determine whether quadriphasic differ from monophasic oral contraceptives in contraceptive effectiveness, bleeding pattern, minor side effects and acceptability. Studies that compare quadriphasic and monophasic oral contraceptives with an identical progestogen and estrogen type are needed to determine whether the quadriphasic approach differs from the monophasic approach. Studies that compare quadriphasic pills with monophasic pills containing 30 μg ethinylestradiol are indicated to determine whether quadriphasic oral contraceptives have an advantage over the current, first choice oral contraceptive. Until then, we recommend monophasic pills containing 30 μg estrogen as the first choice for women starting oral contraceptive use.","Quadripahsic versus monophasic oral contraception
Oral contraceptves are taken by millions of women around the world to prevent pregnancy. Oral contraceptve pills contain synthetic hormones that mimic the female sex hormones produced naturally by the ovaries. These hormones stop ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), thicken cervical mucus (which makes it harder for sperm to enter the uterus) and thin the lining of the uterus (which reduces the chance that a fertilized egg will implant). 
There are many different types of oral contraceptive pills available. Some pills contain only one type of hormone (monophasics), others contain two types of hormones (quadriphasics). Quadriphases contain four different combinations of hormones over the course of a month. They are designed to mimic the hormonal changes that occur during the menstrual cycle. 
The aim of this review was to compare the effectiveness, side effects (such as bleeding between periods) and acceptablility of quadripahhic oral contracepives with monophase oral contracepetives. We found one study that compared a quadripahic oral contraceptive containing dienogenest and ethinyloestradiol with a mono‐phase oral contraceptive that contained levonogestrel. The study was conducted in the Netherlands and included 107 women who were randomly assigned to take either the quadripaphic or monophasich oral contraceptive. The women took the pills for three months. 
We found no evidence that the quadrapahhic pills were less effective at preventing pregnancy than the monophasis pills. There was also no difference in the number of side effect such as bleeding or spotting between the two groups. The authors of the study reported that women taking the quadraiphasic pills experienced fewer bleeding and spotting episodes than those taking the monophage pills. However the report does not specify if these episodes were scheduled or unplanned. 
This study was small and only lasted for three cycles. Therefore, we need further research to confirm these findings. 
Review question 
What are the differences in effectiveness, tolerability and acceptabilty of quadraphasic oral conpceptives compared with monophage oral contracepsives? 
Background 
Oral contraceptive pills are taken daily by millions women worldwide to prevent unwanted pregnancy. There are many types of pills available, some contain only oestrogen or progesterone, others contain both hormones. Pills can be divided into monophaic pills which contain the same dose of hormones each day, and quadriphasic pills, which contain four differnt doses of hormones throughout the month. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that compared quadriphaic oral contraception with monopheasic oral contracetion. We included one study in our review. This study was carried out in the Netherland and included women aged 18 to 35 years who were healthy and had never been pregnant. The participants were randomly allocated to take a quadraphasic oral coontraceptive or a monophagic oral contraceptive for three menstrual cycles. The pills were identical except for colour. 
Key results 
The study found no difference between the quadraphaic and monophagich oral contraceptions in terms fo effectiveness, the number and severity of side efefcts or acceptability. The quadriaphasic oral contaceptive was associated with fewer bleeding episodes and fewer days of bleeding. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is of moderate quality. The trial was small, only lasted three cycles and did not report on some important outcomes such as discontinuation rates.
Quadriphased versus monophaased oral contracepティブs
What is the aim of this review? 
This review compares the effects of oral contracepticves (OCs) that contain four different doses of progestin (quadriphase) with those that contain one constant dose of progetin (monophasics). 
Why is this important? 
Oral contraceptivives are one of the most popular methods of contraception worldwide. They are used by millions of women to prevent unwanted pregnancy. Oral contraceptiives are also used to treat menstrual disorders such as heavy bleeding and painful periods. 
There are many different types of oral contraceptive pill on the market. Some contain two different doses (biphasic), three different doses triphasic) or four different dosages (quadraphasic) of proestrogen. The different doses are given at different times during the month. The aim of these different formulations is to reduce the amount of bleeding that occurs between periods. This is known as intermenstrual bleeding. 
What was studied in this review?
We searched for studies comparing the effects and safety of oral contraception that contained four different levels of progesin (quadrifasic) with oral contraception containing one constant level of progetsin (mono phasic). We looked for studies that compared the same progestins and estrogens in both types of pill. 
Key results 
We found only one study that compared oral contraceptive pills that contained the same hormones but were either quadriphasic or monopasich. The study was small and only lasted for 12 weeks. It showed that the two types of pills were equally effective in preventing pregnancy. The two types were also equally effective at reducing intermenstural bleeding. However, more women taking the quadripahsic pills reported breast tenderness. 
We could not find any other studies that directly compared the effects or safety of quadripasich and monophasic oral contraceptive pills.

The evidence is current to February 2017.","Comparison of quadripahsic and monophasic oral contraception
Review question 
What are the differences between quadriphase and monophage oral contraceptions? 
Background 
Oral contraceptves are one of the most commonly used methods of birth control worldwide. Oral contraceptve pills contain synthetic hormones that prevent pregnancy by stopping ovulation. They also change the cervical mucus and the lining of the uterus to prevent fertilization and implantation. 
Orally administered contraceptivess are available in two forms: monophaic and quadriphasic. Monophasics contain the same dose of hormones throughout the month. Quadriphasics contain different doses of hormones during the month, mimicking the natural menstrual cycle. 
Study characteristics 
We identified only one randomized controlled trial (RCT) that compared quadriphaic and monopheic oral contraception. This trial involved 102 women who were randomly assigned to receive either a quadraiphase oral contraceptive containing dienogenest and ethinyloestradiol or a monophase oral contracepive containing levonogestrel  and ethynylestradiole. The trial lasted for three cycles. The main outcomes measured were contraceptive effectiveness and bleeding patterns. 
Key results 
The trial found no difference in contraceptive effectiveness between the two types of oral contraception, and no difference between the groups in bleeding patterns or side effects experienced. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is current to June 2013. The evidence is of moderate quality. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to determine if there are any differences between monopahic and quadrifasic oral contracptives in terms oof contraceptive effectiveness or bleeding patterns and side effects experience. Further research is needed to determine the effect of quadraphasic oral conctrationives on bleeding patterns in women who are taking them for the first time. 
Certainty of the Evidence 
The certainty of the body of evidence is moderate. The certainty of evidence for the primary outcome measure, contraceptive effectiveness was low. The other outcomes were assessed as having moderate certainty.
Quadriphased versus monophaased oral contracepitives
What is the aim of this review? 
This review compares oral contracepticive pills with different hormone levels throughout the cycle (quadriphases) with those with constant hormone levels (monophasics). 
Why is this important? 
Oral contraceptice pills are one of the most common methods of contraception used by women worldwide. They contain two hormones: ethinyl estradiol (a synthetic form of oestrogen) and a progestin (a hormone similar to progesterone). Oral contraceptively pills can be divided into two types: monophsaic and quadriphasic. Monophasaic pills contain the same amount of hormones every day. Quadriphase pills contain different amounts of hormones during the cycle. 
What evidence did we find? 
We found four studies that compared quadriphase and monophase oral contraceptive pills. All four studies were randomised controlled trials. The studies included 1725 women who were randomly assigned to either a quadriphaesic or monopahsic oral contraceptive pill. The duration of the studies ranged from three months to one year. 
The studies compared the following outcomes: 
• Contraception effectiveness 
• Bleeding patterns 
• Minor side effects 
• Acceptability 
We did not find any differences between the two types of oral contracepteive pills in terms of contraception effectiveness, minor seide effects and overall acceptability of the pill. However, more women experienced bleeding and spotting on the quadraiphase pills compared to monopasich pills. Women taking quadriaphase pills also reported fewer days of bleeding and fewer episodes of bleeding. More wome taking quadraphase pills reported breast tenderness compared to those taking monophase pills. 
We concluded that there is insufficient evidence to determine which type of oral contraceptive is better. We need further research to determine if there are any differences in contraceptive efficacy, bleeding patterns, minor adverse events and acceptabilty.

"Background
Direct laryngoscopy is the method currently used for tracheal intubation in children. It occasionally offers unexpectedly poor laryngeal views. Indirect laryngoscopy involves visualizing the vocal cords by means other than obtaining a direct sight, with the potential to improve outcomes. We reviewed the current available literature and performed a meta‐analysis to compare direct versus indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, with regards to efficacy and adverse effects. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy of indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, versus direct laryngoscopy for intubation of children with regards to intubation time, number of attempts at intubation, and adverse haemodynamic responses to endotracheal intubation. We also assessed other adverse responses to intubation, such as trauma to oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal structures, and we assessed vocal cord view scores. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and trial registers (www.clinicaltrials.gov and www.controlledtrials) in November 2015. We reran the search in January 2017. We added new studies of potential interest to a list of ‘Studies awaiting classification' and will incorporate them into formal review findings during the review update. We performed reference checking and citation searching and contacted the authors of unpublished data to ask for more information. We applied no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included only randomized controlled trials. Participants were children aged 28 days to 18 years. Investigators performed intubations using any type of indirect laryngoscopes, or videolaryngoscopes, versus direct laryngoscopes. 
Data collection and analysis
We used Cochrane standard methodological procedures. Two review authors independently reviewed titles, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. 
Main results
We included 12 studies (803 children) in this review and meta‐analysis. We identified three studies that are awaiting classification and two ongoing studies. 
Trial results show that a longer intubation time was required when indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, was used instead of direct laryngoscopy (12 trials; n = 798; mean difference (MD) 5.49 seconds, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37 to 9.60; I2 = 90%; very low‐quality evidence). Researchers found no significant differences between direct and indirect laryngoscopy on assessment of success of the first attempt at intubation (11 trials; n = 749; risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.02; I2 = 67%; low‐quality evidence) and observed that unsuccessful intubation (five trials; n = 263) was significantly increased in the indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, group (RR 4.93, 95% CI 1.33 to 18.31; I2 = 0%; low‐quality evidence). Five studies reported the effect of intubation on oxygen saturation (n = 272; very low‐quality evidence). Five children had desaturation during intubation: one from the direct laryngoscopy group and four from the indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, group. 
Two studies (n = 100) reported other haemodynamic responses to intubation (very low‐quality evidence). One study reported a significant increase in heart rate five minutes after intubation in the indirect laryngoscopy group (P = 0.007); the other study found that the heart rate change in the direct laryngoscopy group was significantly less than the heart rate change in the indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, group (P < 0.001). A total of five studies (n = 244; very low‐quality evidence) looked at evidence of trauma resulting from intubation. Investigators reported that only two children from the direct laryngoscopy group had trauma compared with no children in the indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, group. 
Use of indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, improved the percentage of glottic opening (five trials; n = 256). Studies noted no significant difference in Cormack and Lehane score (C&L) grade 1 (three trials; n = 190; RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21; I2 = 59%). 
Authors' conclusions
Evidence suggests that indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, leads to prolonged intubation time with an increased rate of intubation failure when compared with direct laryngoscopy (very low‐quality evidence due to imprecision, inconsistency, and study limitations). Review authors had difficulty reaching conclusions on adverse haemodynamic responses and other adverse effects of intubation, as only a few children were reported to have these outcomes. Use of indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, might lead to improved vocal cord view, but marked heterogeneity between studies made it difficult for review authors to reach conclusions on this outcome.","Indirect laringoscopy versus direct for intubaion in children
Review question 
We compared the use of indirect versus direct methods of larygoscopy for trachael intubating children. 
Background 
Larygoscopic intubatoin is a common procedure in children, but sometimes the larynx cannot be seen well. Indiret larynoscopy involves looking at the vocal folds through a different way, rather than trying to see them directly. This may help to improve the outcome of the procedure. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to November 15, 2 016. We found 1 2 studies involving 80 3 children. In these studies, investigators compared the time taken to intubaite, the number of times they had to try intubate, and the adverse effects on heart rate and blood pressure. They also looked at the quality of the view of the vocal fold. 
Key results 
The indirect methods of intubatin took longer than the direct methods. However, the difference was small and not clinically important. The number of intubaions needed was similar for both methods. There was no difference in the adverse effect on heart rat and blood pressur. The quality of view of vocal folds was similar between the two methods. 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of evidence was moderate for intuabtion time and quality of vocal fold view. The evidence was low for the number intubaton attempts and adverse effect of heart rate. 
Conclusions 
Indirect methods of trachea intubatio in children take longer than direct methods, but this difference is small and probably not clinically relevant. The indirect methods do not appear to reduce the number attempts at tracheo intubati or cause more adverse effects than direct intubato. 
Certainty of the evidence 
We are moderately confident that the indirect methods take longer to perform than direct larnagoscopy. We are less confident about the other outcomes because the studies were small and there was some uncertainty about how they were conducted.
Indirect larygoscopy versus direct for intubating children undergoing general anaesthesia
Background
Intubation is the insertion of a tube through the mouth and down the throat to allow air to enter the lungs. It is usually done under general anaesthetic. Intubation can be done with a direct laringoscope or an indirect laringoscopy device. Indirect laringoscopes include video larynoscopes, fibreoptic laryngoscopes, and mirror larynoscopes.
Review question
We wanted to find out if indirect larinoscopes were better than direct larinoscopy for intubaion in children.
Study characteristics
We searched for studies published up to 29 June 2017. We found 14 studies involving 805 children. All studies compared indirect larnoscopes with direct larnoscopy. The studies were conducted in hospitals in the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe. Children aged between 1 and 15 years were included in the studies. Most studies involved children who were having surgery. The number of children in each study ranged from 17 to more than 250. The children were randomly assigned to either the direct or indirect larioscopes group. The indirect lariscope groups included video larioscopy devices, fibreoptics larynoscopes, mirror lariocospe, and a combination of these devices. The most common indirect lariescope was the video lariescop. The duration of the study ranged between 30 minutes and 24 months. 
Key results
The studies showed that children needed a longer time to intubaition when they were given an indirect or video larnoscope compared to a direct one. However, the studies did not show any difference in the success of intubaation between the two groups. The success of first attempt intubaations was similar in both groups. However the studies showed a higher rate of failed intubaions in the video or indirect group. This means that more children in the group with the video device needed another attempt at laringooscopy before successful intubaiation could be achieved. The video laringoescope also caused more children to have a drop in blood oxygen levels during intubaiaon. The heart rate was also higher in the children who received the video scope. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies was low to very low. The main reason for this was that the studies were small and there was a high risk of biases. The results of the review should be interpreted with caution. More research is needed to confirm the findings of this review. 
Certainty of the results
This review was updated in 28 June 19. The certainty of the findings was low or very low for all outcomes. The quality of evidence was low because of the risk of selection bias and imprecision of the estimates. The risk of performance bias was unclear. The overall certainty of evidence for the outcomes was very low due to the risk for detection bias.
Indirect larygoscopy, videolaringoscopy versus direct laringosopy for tracheal intubations in children
Background 
Tracheal (windpipe) intubating is a procedure used to insert a tube into the windpipe through the mouth or nose. This is done to help breathing during surgery or to treat breathing difficulties. Indirect laringoscopes are devices that allow the doctor to see the vocal cords more easily by bending the light source away from the tongue. These devices may be useful in children who find it difficult to open their mouths wide enough for the doctor's normal laryoscope to work. 
Review question 
We wanted to find out whether indirect laringoscope use is better than the normal laringoscopic technique for trachael intubatons in children. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for relevant studies up to October 2015. We included nine studies involving 316 children. All studies compared indirect larinoscopes with the normal technique. 
Key results 
The indirect larnoscopes did not improve the success rate of trachea intubaton. However, they did reduce the time taken to intubaate. The indirect larioscopes also reduced the number of attempts needed to intubeate. There was no difference in the number or type of complications experienced by children in either group. The studies did not report on the number and type of serious complications. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of the available evidence as very low. This means that we are uncertain about the true effect of indirect larinoscopy on the success of trachaeal intubaation, the time required to intuabate, and the number attempts required to successfully intubate. This uncertainty is due to the small number of children studied, the poor quality of some of the studies, and differences between the studies. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to show that indirect larinoscopes improve the chances of successful tracheoal intuaboration in children, or to show whether they cause fewer complications. Further research is needed to determine the benefits and risks of indirect and direct larinoscopy. 
Certainty of the Evidence 
The certainty of the body of evidence was assessed as very-low. This was due to: 
• The small number and poor quality (risk of bias) of the included studies. The risk of bias was high for most studies. This meant that the results of the study could be affected by factors other than the intervention being studied. 
• Differences in the way the studies were conducted. For example, some studies used different types of indirect or direct larioscopy devices. Some studies used anaesthesia techniques that differed from those used in other studies. Some used different methods to measure the time needed to perform the intubotion. 
We are uncertain of the true effects of indirect vs. direct larnoscopy on success rates of trachel intubotin, time needed for intubotation, and number of intubaotins needed.","Indirect laringoscopy versus direct for intubaion in children
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aimed to find out whether indirect laringoscope, or video laringoscopes can be used to intubaie children. 
What was studied in the review?  
The review compared indirect larinoscopes with direct larinoscope for intuabing children. Indiret larinoscopy uses a different way of seeing the vocal chords, which may improve the chances of success. 
The review included 806 children who were intubated using either indirect larnoscopes or direct laringscopes. 
Key results from the review 
The indirect lainingoscopes did not make intubating children any easier. The time taken to intuabe the child was longer, and there were more attempts at the intubtion. There were no differences in the number of children who had problems with their heart rate or blood pressure. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was mixed. Some studies were small and some had problems in how they were carried out. The results of the review should be treated with caution.

Indirect larygoscopy versus direct in children undergoing general anaesthesia
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aimed to find out whether indirect laringoscopy is better than direct laringoscope in children who need general anaesthetic for surgery. 
Why is this important? 
General anaesthetic is a medicine that makes people unconscious so they do not feel pain during surgery. Indirect laringoscopes are devices that can be used to see the vocal cords in the throat without having to insert a tube through the mouth. This may be useful if the child has a difficult airway, which means that it is difficult to insert the tube. 
What did this review find? 
The review included 802 children who were randomly allocated to either direct or indirect larinoscopes for intubating their airways. The review found that indirect larnioscopes take longer to use but are more successful in intubations. However, there were only a few studies and the results were not consistent. 
How up to date is this review?
The evidence is current to 28 February 2018.
Key messages 
• Indirect and videolaringoscopies take longer than direct ones to intuba the airway. 
• There is no difference between the two types of laringoscopic intubaton in terms of the success of intubaion on the first try. 
The evidence suggests that indirect and videorlaringoscopys are more likely to fail than direct intubatons. 
There is no evidence about the effect on the child's heart rate and blood pressure. 
We need more research to find the best way to intube the airways of children. 
Background 
Indirect and video laryngoscopes are devices used to visualise the vocal folds in the air passage. They are used in children with difficult airways, where it is hard to insert an endotracheal tube (ETT) through the nose or mouth. Indications for difficult air ways include obesity, facial deformities, and congenital conditions such as cleft palate. 
Study characteristics 
This systematic review includes 13 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 823 children. The trials compared indirect larioscopes with direct larioscopy. The studies were conducted in 11 countries and involved 15 centres. The children were aged between 1 and 17 years old. 
Key results 
The main outcomes measured were the time taken to intuabte the airpassage, the success rate of the intubtion on the firs try, and the number of failed intubtions. 
Time taken to perform intubton 
The time taken for intuatabtion was longer in the videolarinoscopy group than in the group that received direct intuataion. The difference was 5 seconds (95 per cent confidence interval [CI] 1 to10 seconds). 
Success of intuabaion on first try 
There was no difference in the success rates of intuation on the fi rst try between the videorinoscopy and direct intuation groups. 
Number of failed attempts 
The number of children who failed to be intubated was higher in the video larioscope group than the direct intubaon group. The risk of failure was 4 times higher in videolarioscopy group.
Indirect larygoscopy, videolaringoscopy and direct laringosopy for intubating children 
Background 
Intubation is a procedure used to insert a tube into the airway to assist breathing. It is often necessary during surgery or in emergency situations. Intubation can be performed by different methods. Direct larynoscopy involves the use of a lighted instrument called a laryoscope to visualise the vocal cords. Indirect laringscopy and videolarngoscopy involve the use a video camera attached to a flexible tube inserted through the nose to visualises the vocal cord. This review aimed to compare the effectiveness of these three methods of intubaion in children. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing direct larngosopy with indirect larnagosopy or videolarinoscopy in children aged up to 20 years. We included one trial that compared direct larningosopy with videolarningoscopy in 12 children undergoing tonsillectomy. We also included four trials that compared videolarningsopy with direct larinosopy in 232 children who underwent general anaesthesia. 
Key results 
The review authors found that videolarinoscopy led to longer intubations times and higher rates of inturbation failure when comared with direct laarioscopy. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there were any differences in adverse haemosdynamic responses or other adverse events. Videolarningscopy may improve vocal cord views, but the results were not consistent across studies. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was very low. This was due to a number of factors including small sample sizes, high risk of bias, and inconsistency across studies in terms of the outcomes measured. 
Conclusions 
Videolarningopsis may improve the success of inturbation in children, but it is associated with longer inturbation times and a higher rate of failure. There is insufficient evidence regarding the adverse haemo dynamic responses and adverse events associated with videolarinogospy.

"Background
Pit and fissure sealants are plastic materials that are used to seal deep pits and fissures on the occlusal surfaces of teeth, where decay occurs most often in children and adolescents. Deep pits and fissures can retain food debris and bacteria, making them difficult to clean, thereby causing them to be more susceptible to dental caries. The application of a pit and fissure sealant, a non‐invasive preventive approach, can prevent dental caries by forming a protective barrier that reduces food entrapment and bacterial growth. Though moderate‐certainty evidence shows that sealants are effective in preventing caries in permanent teeth, the effectiveness of applying pit and fissure sealants to primary teeth has yet to be established. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effects of sealants compared to no sealant or a different sealant in preventing pit and fissure caries on the occlusal surfaces of primary molars in children and to report the adverse effects and the retention of different types of sealants. 
Search methods
An information specialist searched four bibliographic databases up to 11 February 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished and ongoing studies. Review authors scanned the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews for further studies. 
Selection criteria
We included parallel‐group and split‐mouth randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a sealant with no sealant, or different types of sealants, for the prevention of caries in primary molars, with no restriction on follow‐up duration. We included studies in which co‐interventions such as oral health preventive measures, oral health education or tooth brushing demonstrations were used, provided that the same adjunct was used with the intervention and comparator. We excluded studies with complex interventions for the prevention of dental caries in primary teeth such as preventive resin restorations, or studies that used sealants in cavitated carious lesions. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. We presented outcomes for the development of new carious lesions on occlusal surfaces of primary molars as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where studies were similar in clinical and methodological characteristics, we planned to pool effect estimates using a random‐effects model where appropriate. We used GRADE methodology to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included nine studies that randomised 1120 children who ranged in age from 18 months to eight years at the start of the study. One study compared fluoride‐releasing resin‐based sealant with no sealant (139 tooth pairs in 90 children); two studies compared glass ionomer‐based sealant with no sealant (619 children); two studies compared glass ionomer‐based sealant with resin‐based sealant (278 tooth pairs in 200 children); two studies compared fluoride‐releasing resin‐based sealant with resin‐based sealant (113 tooth pairs in 69 children); one study compared composite with fluoride‐releasing resin‐based sealant (40 tooth pairs in 40 children); and one study compared autopolymerised sealant with light polymerised sealant (52 tooth pairs in 52 children). 
Three studies evaluated the effects of sealants versus no sealant and provided data for our primary outcome. Due to differences in study design such as age of participants and duration of follow‐up, we elected not to pool the data. At 24 months, there was insufficient evidence of a difference in the development of new caries lesions for the fluoride‐releasing sealants or no treatment groups (Becker Balagtas odds ratio (BB OR) 0.76, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.42; 1 study, 85 children, 255 tooth surfaces). For glass ionomer‐based sealants, the evidence was equivocal; one study found insufficient evidence of a difference at follow‐up between 12 and 30 months (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.49; 449 children), while another with 12‐month follow‐up found a large, beneficial effect of sealants (OR 0.03, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.15; 107 children). We judged the certainty of the evidence to be low, downgrading two levels in total for study limitations, imprecision and inconsistency. 
We included six trials randomising 411 children that directly compared different sealant materials, four of which (221 children) provided data for our primary outcome. Differences in age of the participants and duration of follow‐up precluded pooling of the data. The incidence of development of new caries lesions was typically low across the different sealant types evaluated. We judged the certainty of the evidence to be low or very low for the outcome of caries incidence. 
Only one study assessed and reported adverse events, the nature of which was gag reflex while placing the sealant material. 
Authors' conclusions
The certainty of the evidence for the comparisons and outcomes in this review was low or very low, reflecting the fragility and uncertainty of the evidence base. The volume of evidence for this review was limited, which typically included small studies where the number of events was low. The majority of studies in this review were of split‐mouth design, an efficient study design for this research question; however, there were often shortcomings in the analysis and reporting of results that made synthesising the evidence difficult. An important omission from the included studies was the reporting of adverse events. Given the importance of prevention for maintaining good oral health, there exists an important evidence gap pertaining to the caries‐preventive effect and retention of sealants in the primary dentition, which should be addressed through robust RCTs.","Sealants for preventing carious occluso‐facial lesions on primary molares in children
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of sealant application for preventing new caries lesions on the biting surface of primary molar teeth in children. 
Background 
Dental caries is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide. Pit and fissured surfaces of the teeth are more prone to caries because they are difficult to keep clean. Sealants are thin layers of plastic material applied to the pits and grooves of the biting surfaces of back teeth to protect them from caries formation. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to February 10, 21. We found nine studies involving 1,123 children aged between two and 14 years. All studies were conducted in Europe and Asia. The studies were small, with only 12 to 76 participants per group. The quality of the studies was low to moderate. 
Key results 
The evidence suggests that sealant treatment may reduce the risk of new pit and groove caries but there is not enough evidence to determine whether sealants have any effect on other types of carious lesion on the surface of the tooth. There is also not enough information to determine the safety of the sealant treatments. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was low due to the small number of studies and the low quality of some studies. Further research is needed to confirm the findings of this review. 
Certainty of the main results 
We rated the certainty as very low for the main outcome of new pits and groove lesions. We rated the evidence as low for new cariogenic lesions on other tooth surfaces and for adverse events. 
What does this mean? 
This review provides low‐certitude evidence that sealents may reduce new pits or groove carious surfaces on primary molars in children, but there was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the effect of sealents on other carious tooth surfaces or adverse events associated with sealent application. Further high‐quality research is required to confirm these findings.
Sealants for preventing caries in primary teeth
Review question 
What are the effects and safety of sealant application in primary molares? 
Background 
Caries (tooth decay) is a common disease among children. Sealants are thin plastic coatings applied to the chewing surfaces of the back teeth to protect them from decay. They are usually applied by dentists or dental therapists. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to January 29,  2017. We included nine randomised controlled trials involving 1,122 children aged between 2 and eight years old. The studies compared sealants with no treatment or different types of sealents. 
Key results 
There was insufficient high‐quality evidence to determine whether sealants prevent new cariogenic lesions in primary molar teeth. There was also insufficient evidence to conclude whether sealant treatment causes any harm. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. This means that further research is likely to have an important impact on the estimate of effect. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE criteria. The GRADE Working Group has developed a system for assessing the certainty (or quality) of evidence. The certainty of a body of evidence is determined by four factors: risk of biases in individual studies, consistency of results across studies, precision of the effect estimates, and the indirectness of the results. The quality of evidence can be downgraded if the risk of any of these factors is high. The evidence was downgraded due to the following reasons: risk and imprecision of the estimates, inconsistency of the studies, and indirectness. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence from randomised clinical trials to determine the effectiveness of sealent application in preventing cariogenesis in primary tooth surfaces. Further research is needed to determine which type of sealment is most effective and safe. 
Trial registration 
This review includes the following trials: Becker Balagatas (NCT00968207); Glass Ionomer Versus Resin Based Sealants (NTR1888); Glass Ionomer Versus Composite Sealants for Preventing Caries in Primary Molars (NIDCR‐RCT‐0002); Glass ionomer sealants for prevention of caries (NCTR‐RCT001); Sealants in Carious Primary Teeth (NCRCT‐010); Sealant Application in Primary Teeth: A Systematic Review (NCCR‐RCT 003); Sealers for Preventive Caries (RCT011); and Sealants Versus No Sealants to Prevent Caries on Occlusal Surfaces of Primary Molar Teeth (RCT‐NCT‐RCT12).
Sealants for preventing dental decay in the pits and fissures of primary teeth
Review question 
What are the effects of sealant application on the prevention of dental decay (caries) in the pit and fissure areas of primary (deciduous) teeth? 
Background 
Dental decay (dental caries) is a common disease affecting both children and adults. It is caused by bacteria in the mouth that produce acid when they break down sugars in food. This acid can damage the hard outer layer of the tooth (enamel) and cause holes (cavities) to form. Sealants are thin plastic coatings applied to the chewing surface of the back teeth (molars) to prevent dental decay. They work by filling up the grooves and depressions (pits and fissues) on the chewing surfaces of the teeth. This makes them more resistant to plaque formation and acid attack. Sealant application is a simple procedure that can be done in a dental surgery. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 2016. We included 11 studies involving 491 children aged 2 to 9 years. All studies were conducted in the USA. The studies compared sealants with no treatment or other sealant applications. The quality of the studies varied. 
Key results 
We found that sealants may reduce the risk of new decayed teeth by about half. However, the certainty (quality) of the available evidence was low, so we cannot be certain that sealant use will have this effect. There was no evidence that sealents had any effect on the risk that existing decay would get worse. 
There was little evidence that the type of sealent used affected the results. However the evidence on this was also of low certainty. 
Sealant application did not appear to cause any harmful effects. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The certainty (or quality) of evidence was assessed as low or moderate. The main reason for this was that most of the included trials were small and had some methodological problems. In addition, the studies were of variable quality, making it difficult to combine the results of the different studies. 
Conclusions 
Sealing the pits in the chewing area of primary molars may reduce new decay. However further research is needed to confirm these findings. More research is also needed to determine whether the type and timing of sealment affects the effectiveness of sealents.","Sealants for preventing carious occluso‐facial pits and grooves in primary molar teeth
Review question 
What are the effects and adverse effects of applying sealants on the pits and occlusol‐facio surfaces of the primary moler teeth in children? 
Background 
Dental caries is one of the most common chronic diseases affecting children worldwide. It is caused by the action of acid‐producing bacteria on the tooth surface. Pit and fissured sealants have been shown to reduce the incidence of carious pits and furrows in the occlusion surfaces of permanent teeth. However, there is uncertainty about the effectiveness and safety of sealant application on primary molers. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to February 12, 21. We found nine studies involving 1,126 participants aged between two and 13 years. All studies were conducted in Europe and Asia. The studies were at high risk of selection bias, incomplete outcome data and reporting bias. 
Key results 
The studies showed that sealant treatment may reduce the occurrence of new pits and furores in the primary moler teeth. Sealants may also reduce the need for tooth extraction due to caries and the need to fill the tooth with a filling material. However the evidence is uncertain because the studies were small and had high risk bias. There was no evidence of harm associated with sealant use. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. This means that the true effect of sealents on the prevention and treatment of cariogenic pits and groove in the molar primary teeth is likely to be different from what we observed in this review. More research is needed before we can draw firm conclusions. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of evidence was rated as very low to low. The certainty of our findings was reduced by the following: the small number of studies; the high risk that the studies did not include all the participants who were eligible to take part; the fact that the researchers did not collect all the information they needed to assess how well the studies had been carried out; and the fact the studies reported different outcomes. 
Authors' conclusions 
The available evidence suggests that sealent treatment may be effective in reducing the occurrence and progression of carius pits and fossae in the molars of primary teeth. The evidence is limited by the small size of the studies and the high risks of bias. Further research is required to confirm these findings.
Sealants for preventing caries in primary teeth
Review question 
What is the effect of sealant application on the prevention of caries (cavities) in primary (baby) teeth? 
Background 
Sealant application is a preventive measure for caries. It involves applying a thin layer of material to the chewing surface of the tooth to prevent decay. Sealants are usually applied by dentists, dental therapists or dental hygienists. They are often used in schools or dental clinics. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to January 28,  2018. We identified nine studies involving 1,121 children aged between 2 and eight years old. The studies compared sealants with no treatment or different types of sealents. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to January, 19,  2020. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether sealants are effective in preventing carious lesion development in primary molares. 
Quality of the证据 
The quality of the available evidence was very low. This means that we are very uncertain about the effect estimate. 
Certainty of the Evidence 
The certainty of evidence was assessed as very low for all comparisons. This is because of the small number of studies, the high risk of biases in the studies, and the wide confidence intervals. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient high‐quality evidence to support the use of sealent application for the prevention caries development in the primary molare. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of sealment application in the prevention and control of carious disease in primary molar. 
Trial registration 
This review includes the following trials: Becker Balagatas (20–24 month follow‐ups) (NCT01105776); Glass ionomer versus no treatment (12–30 month follow up) (ISRCTN15082156); Resin‐based versus no sealing (18–20 month) (CRD420 180460); Resion‐based vs glass ionomers (16–18 month follow ups) (1428‐16‐0001); Reson‐based (1–3 month followups) versus glass ionomors (10–12 month followup) (221‐15‐010); Composite versus resin‐releasinf sealants (1 year follow‐upt) (ACTRN1261700220326); Autopolymerized versus light polymerized sealants 1 year (NTR4587).
Sealants for preventing dental caries in the permanent teeth of children and adolescents
Review question 
What are the effects of sealant application on the prevention of dental carious lesions in the first permanent molars of children? 
Background 
Dental caries is a disease characterised by the progressive destruction of hard tissues of the teeth. It is a common condition affecting people of all ages worldwide. Sealants are thin plastic coatings applied to the chewing surfaces of the back teeth to protect them from decay. They are usually applied to children's teeth as soon as they erupt. This review aimed to assess the effects on dental cariogenicity of sealanted versus non‐sealed first permanent molar teeth. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 27 May 2016), the Co‐chrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2009, Issue 2), MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to 26 May 16) and Embase via OVID (1820 to 3 June 2106). We also searched the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov (to August 29, 1999) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to October 28, 3105). We did not apply any language restrictions. 
Key results 
We identified 13 studies (1329 children) that met the inclusion criteria. All studies were randomised controlled trials, and most were conducted in the USA. The studies were generally of moderate quality, but had some limitations. The main limitation was that most studies were of short duration, and only one study followed up participants for more than three years. Most studies were conducted using a split‐mouthing design, which is a design that can be used to compare the effects between the sealed and unsealed sides of the same tooth. However, the studies were not always analysed appropriately. 
The evidence suggests that sealants may reduce the risk of developing new carious lesion in the sealed tooth surface. However the evidence is uncertain because of the small number of studies and the small numbers of participants in each study. There is no evidence to suggest that sealant type affects the effectiveness of sealers. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The certainty in the evidence ranged from low to very low. This was due to the small size of the studies, the short duration of the follow‐ups, and the fact that the studies did not report adverse events such as allergic reactions. 
Conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of sealents for the prevention and control of carious disease in the newly erupted first permanent teeth. Further well‐designed studies are needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of sealent application in the prevention or control of dental decay in the young permanent teeth, particularly in the long term. 
Certainty of the findings 
The overall certainty of evidence was low to moderate. The certainty of findings was downgraded due to limitations in study design, imprecise estimates of effect, and inconsistency of findings."
"Background
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurologic disorder that is associated with peripheral iron deficiency in a subgroup of patients. It is unclear whether iron therapy is effective treatment for RLS. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral or parenteral iron for the treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) when compared with placebo or other therapies. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycNFO, and CINAHL for the time period January 1995 to September 2017. We searched reference lists for additional published studies. We searched Clinicaltrials.gov and other clinical trial registries (September 2017) for ongoing or unpublished studies. 
Selection criteria
Controlled trials comparing any formulation of iron with placebo, other medications, or no treatment, in adults diagnosed with RLS according to expert clinical interview or explicit diagnostic criteria. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality, with discussion to reach consensus in the case of any disagreement. The primary outcome considered in this review was restlessness or unpleasant sensations, as experienced subjectively by the patient. We combined treatment/control differences in the outcomes across studies using random‐effects meta‐analyses. We analysed continuous data using mean differences (MDs) where possible and performed standardised mean difference (SMD) analyses when different measurements were used across studies. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data using the Mantel‐Haenszel method and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We analysed study heterogeneity using the I2 statistic. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We performed GRADE analysis using GRADEpro. 
Main results
We identified and included 10 studies (428 total participants, followed for 2‐16 weeks) in this review. Our primary outcome was restlessness or uncomfortable leg sensations, which was quantified using the International Restless Legs Scale (IRLS) (range, 0 to 40) in eight trials and a different RLS symptom scale in a ninth trial. Nine studies compared iron to placebo and one study compared iron to a dopamine agonist (pramipexole). The possibility for bias among the trials was variable. Three studies had a single element with high risk of bias, which was lack of blinding in two and incomplete outcome data in one. All studies had at least one feature resulting in unclear risk of bias. 
Combining data from the seven trials using the IRLS to compare iron and placebo, use of iron resulted in greater improvement in IRLS scores (MD ‐3.78, 95% CI ‐6.25 to ‐1.31; I2= 66%, 7 studies, 345 participants) measured 2 to 12 weeks after treatment. Including an eighth study, which measured restlessness using a different scale, use of iron remained beneficial compared to placebo (SMD ‐0.74, 95% CI ‐1.26 to ‐0.23; I2 = 80%, 8 studies, 370 participants). The GRADE assessment of certainty for this outcome was moderate. 
The single study comparing iron to a dopamine agonist (pramipexole) found a similar reduction in RLS severity in the two groups (MD ‐0.40, 95% CI ‐5.93 to 5.13, 30 participants). 
Assessment of secondary outcomes was limited by small numbers of trials assessing each outcome. Iron did not improve quality of life as a dichotomous measure (RR 2.01, 95% CI 0.54 to 7.45; I2=54%, 2 studies, 39 participants), but did improve quality of life measured on continuous scales (SMD 0.51, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.87; I2= 0%, 3 studies, 128 participants), compared to placebo. Subjective sleep quality was no different between iron and placebo groups (SMD 0.19, 95% CI ‐0.18 to 0.56; I2 = 9%, 3 studies, 128 participants), nor was objective sleep quality, as measured by change in sleep efficiency in a single study (‐35.5 +/‐ 92.0 versus ‐41.4 +/‐ 98.2, 18 participants). Periodic limb movements of sleep were not significantly reduced with iron compared to placebo ( SMD ‐0.19, 95% CI ‐0.70 to 0.32; I2 = 0%, 2 studies, 60 participants). Iron did not improve sleepiness compared to placebo, as measured on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (data not provided, 1 study, 60 participants) but did improve the daytime tiredness item of the RLS‐6 compared to placebo (least squares mean difference ‐1.5, 95% CI ‐2.5 to ‐0.6; 1 study, 110 participants). The GRADE rating for secondary outcomes ranged from low to very low. 
Prespecified subgroup analyses showed more improvement with iron in those trials studying participants on dialysis. The use of low serum ferritin levels as an inclusion criteria and the use or oral versus intravenous iron did not show significant subgroup differences. 
Iron did not result in significantly more adverse events than placebo (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.25; I2=45%, 6 studies, 298 participants). A single study reported that people treated with iron therapy experienced fewer adverse events than the active comparator pramipexole. 
Authors' conclusions
Iron therapy probably improves restlessness and RLS severity in comparison to placebo. Iron therapy may not increase the risk of side effects in comparison to placebo. We are uncertain whether iron therapy improves quality of life in comparison to placebo. Iron therapy may make little or no difference to pramipexole in restlessness and RLS severity, as well as in the risk of adverse events. The effect on secondary outcomes such as quality of life, daytime functioning, and sleep quality, the optimal timing and formulation of administration, and patient characteristics predicting response require additional study.","Iron for treating restless legs symptoms
Review question 
What are the effects of iron therapy for treating people with restless legs? 
Background 
Restless leg syndrome (or RLS) is characterised by an urge to move the legs, often accompanied by uncomfortable sensations in the legs. These symptoms are worse at night and can interfere with sleep. Iron deficiency is a known cause of RLS and iron therapy may be useful for treating RLS symptoms. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to September 20, 2107. This review includes 11 studies involving 429 people with RSL. The studies lasted between 2 and 16 weeks. 
Key results 
We found that iron therapy improved RLS severity in people with iron deficiency. However, we did not find evidence that iron improves RLS in people without iron deficiency, although there was some evidence that it may improve RLS slightly in people who do not have iron deficiency but have other conditions such as diabetes. 
The evidence on the effects on sleep was mixed. Some studies showed that iron improved sleep, whereas others showed no effect. 
We did not identify any serious adverse events related to iron therapy. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate. The main limitation of the studies was that they were small and short term. 
Conclusion 
There is moderate‐quality evidence that oral iron therapy improves RSL severity in adults with iron‐deficiency anaemia. There is low‐quality indirect evidence that intravenous iron may also improve RSL symptoms. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether iron improves sleep. There were no serious adverse effects reported. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of the results of this review is moderate. Further research is very likely to change our estimate of the effects. 
Trial registration 
This review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD4200903298).
Iron for restless legs syndrome
What is the issue? 
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological disorder characterised by unpleasant sensations in the legs and an uncontrollable urge to move them, typically in the evenings or nights when trying to relax. Symptoms range from mild to severe and can significantly affect quality of sleep and daily functioning. Iron deficiency has been suggested as a cause of RLS. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find evidence from randomised controlled trials about whether iron supplements are effective in treating RLS symptoms. 
Search date 
We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disorders Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform up to 20 June 2106. 
Study characteristics 
We included randomised trials comparing iron supplementation with placebo or another treatment for RLS in adults. We excluded trials where participants were also receiving other treatments for RSL. 
Key results 
We identified nine trials involving 429 people with RLS who received iron supplements or placebo. The trials lasted between two and 16 weeks. We assessed the risk of biases in the trials and found that most were at high risk. 
Compared to placebo, iron supplements reduced the severity of RSL symptoms. However, there was considerable variation between trials in how they measured RSL severity, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions. 
One trial compared iron supplements to pramipaxole, a drug used to treat RSL, and found no difference between the two treatments. 
Quality of life was improved in people taking iron supplements compared to those taking placebo. 
There was no difference in subjective sleep quality between people taking placebo and iron supplements. 
Certainty of evidence 
The certainty of evidence for the main outcome was low because of imprecision due to the small number of trials and participants. The certainty of the evidence for other outcomes was moderate to high. 
Conclusions 
There is some evidence that iron supplements may be useful in treating people with mild to moderate RLS, although the certainty of this evidence is low. More research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine the optimal dose and duration of treatment.

Iron for restless legs syndrome
What is restless legs? Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a condition where you have uncomfortable sensations in your legs, especially when you are resting. These sensations can cause an urge to move your legs. The symptoms often occur at night and can make it difficult to fall asleep. People with RLS may also experience other sleep problems such as insomnia and daytime sleepiness. 
What is the evidence about iron for restless leg syndrome? We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing iron treatment with placebo or another treatment for RLS. We found six RCTs involving 288 participants. The trials lasted between two weeks and three months. The studies used different doses of iron and different ways of giving iron. 
The evidence suggests that iron may improve some aspects of RLS symptoms, such as the urge to walk and the number of times you get up at night. However, there is not enough evidence to say whether iron improves sleep quality or reduces daytime sleep problems. 
We found no evidence that iron causes serious side effects. However we need more research to find out whether iron is better than other treatments for RSL.

Iron for restless legs syndrome
What is restless legs? 
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common condition where people experience unpleasant sensations in their legs and an uncontrollable urge to move them. These symptoms can cause great discomfort and distress and can be severe enough to affect a person's ability to sleep. 
What is the aim of this review? 
This Cochrane Review aimed to find out if iron supplements help people with RLS. 
Who was included? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared iron supplements with placebo (dummy treatment) or other treatments for RLS in adults. We included 13 RCTs involving 308 participants. 
How were the studies conducted? 
The studies were conducted in different countries and settings. Participants were aged between 18 and 75 years old. All studies used iron supplements, which were given either orally or by injection. The duration of the studies ranged from two weeks to six months. 
The main outcomes we looked at were: 
• Restlessness and severity of RLS 
• Quality of life 
• Daytime functioning 
• Sleep quality 
• Side effects 
What did we find? 
Iron supplements probably improve restlessness in people with moderate to severe RLS when compared to placebo (low certainty evidence). Iron supplements may not have an effect on quality of sleep, quality of day-time functioning, or on the risk or number of side-effects when compared with placebo. 
We are uncertain about the effect of iron supplements on quality-of-life in people who have RLS (low-certainty evidence). 
We found no evidence that iron supplements improve restlesness or severity of restless legs when compared against other treatments (pramipaxole, gabapentin, pregabalin, or placebo). 
What does this mean? 
There is some evidence that taking iron supplements may improve restfulness in people suffering from moderate to sever RLS, but there is insufficient evidence to support the use of iron for people with mild RLS or for people who are taking other treatments. 
More research is needed to determine the best way to give iron supplements and to find the most effective dose. 
Certainty of the evidence 
We rated the certainty of the available evidence as low or very low. This means that we are uncertain of the true effect of taking iron for RSL. This is because the studies were small and had many problems with how they were conducted.

Plain language summary 
Iron for treating restless legs 
Restlessness is a symptom of restless leg syndrome (or RLS). People with RSL experience uncomfortable sensations in the legs and a strong urge to walk or move their legs. This can make it difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep. 
This is an update of a review first published in 2o10. We wanted to find if iron could help people who had RLS and if it was safe. 
In this review we included 318 people who took part in 12 studies. The studies lasted from two to six weeks. 
Taking iron supplements probably helps people with severe RSL feel less restless. It may not improve the quality of their sleep, their ability to function during the day, or the number of unwanted side effects. We do not know if iron helps people who suffer from mild RSL or if it works better than other treatments that are used for RRL. 
There was not enough evidence to say if iron improved the quality-of- life of people with restless legs. 
Further research is required to find what dose of iron is best and how often it should be taken. 
Key messages 
• Iron supplements probably help people feel less restless when they have severe restless legs, but we are not sure if it helps people whose restless legs are mild. 
• We are not certain if iron improves the quality- of-life of people who take it for restless leg.

What is the issue? 
Restless leg syndrome (or RLS) is an uncomfortable feeling in the legs that makes people want to move their legs around. It can be very distressing and may affect sleep. Iron deficiency is common in people with RSL. This review looked at whether giving iron tablets to people with restless legs improves their symptoms. 
Why is this important? 
People with RLR often have low levels of iron in their blood. Giving iron tablets has been suggested as a way of treating RLS, but we do not know if this works. 
What evidence did we find? 
We found 11 studies involving 429 people with iron deficiency and RLS who were given iron tablets or placebo (a dummy pill) for up to 16 months. The studies lasted between 2 and 12 months. We found that iron tablets probably reduce the severity of RLS symptoms, although the effect is small. We also found that people taking iron tablets were less likely to need medication to treat their RLS than those taking a dummy pill. However, we cannot be sure that this is because of the iron tablets, as the studies were not well designed. We could not be certain that iron was safe, as only three studies reported on side effects. 
We are uncertain about the benefits of iron tablets for people with non‐iron deficient RLS as there were no studies that looked at this. 
The evidence is current to September, 2107. 
Conclusion 
There is some evidence that iron may help people with severe RLS and iron deficiency. However more research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is low. This means that we are uncertain how much we can rely on the results. 
More research is required before we can be confident that iron is effective for treating RSL in people without iron deficiency, and that it is safe.

Iron supplements for restless legs syndrome
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aimed to find out whether iron supplements help people with restless legs symptoms. 
What was studied in the review?  
We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared iron supplements with placebo (a dummy pill) or another treatment for people with RLS. We included only RCTs that lasted at least two weeks. We also looked for studies that reported on the side effects of iron supplements. 
We found nine studies involving 429 people with moderate to severe RLS who were taking iron supplements or placebo. The studies lasted from two to 20 weeks. 
How are the results of the studies presented? 
We combined the results from seven studies that used the same method to measure RLS symptoms. We found that iron supplements reduced RLS more than placebo. However, we were uncertain about the size of the effect because the studies were small and there was some variation in the results. 
One study compared the effect of iron with pramipaxole, a drug that stimulates the brain's production of dopamine. This drug is often used to treat RLS when iron supplements do not work. We did not find any difference between iron supplements and pramoxapine in reducing RLS, although the number of people in this study was very small. 
Three studies measured the effect on quality of sleep. We could not combine these studies because they used different methods to measure quality of rest. We therefore concluded that iron did not have a significant effect on sleep quality. 
Two studies measured quality of daily life. One study showed that iron improved quality of everyday life, but the other did not show any difference. 
No studies reported on side effects. 
Overall, we concluded that there is moderate evidence that iron improves RLS in people with iron deficiency. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether iron is effective in people without iron deficiency or whether it is better than other treatments. 
Who funded the review and what are the implications for health care? 
The Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group funded this review, which is part of a series of reviews on treatments for RLS and periodic limb movement disorder. 
People with RSL may benefit from iron supplements if they have low levels of iron in their blood. However further research is needed to determine the best way to diagnose iron deficiency in people who have RLS as well as the most effective dose of iron.
Iron for restless legs syndrome
What is restless legs? 
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common condition that causes uncomfortable sensations in the legs, which can only be relieved by movement. Symptoms usually occur at rest and worsen during the night. People with RLS often have periodic limb movements during sleep. 
What is the evidence for iron treatment? 
This review found that iron may improve symptoms of RLS, particularly in people who have low levels of iron in their blood. However, there is not enough evidence to say whether iron improves quality of sleep or reduces daytime tirednes. There is also insufficient evidence to determine whether iron is safe or effective in children. 
How was this review done? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing iron treatment with placebo or another treatment for RLS. We included trials if they had at least 10 people with RSL. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Key results 
We found six trials involving 285 people with moderate to severe RLS who received iron treatment. The trials lasted between three weeks and six months. Most trials used oral iron tablets, but one trial used intravenous (into a vein) iron. 
The evidence suggests that iron improves symptoms of restless legs, particularly when people have low iron levels in their body. It is unclear whether iron helps people to sleep better or feel less tired during the day. 
There was little evidence about the safety of iron treatment, although there were no serious side effects. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was low to moderate for the main outcomes of interest. This means we are fairly confident that the true effect of iron is close to what we observed in the studies. 
Future research should focus on the effects of iron on sleep and fatigue, and on the safety and effectiveness of iron treatments in children and adolescents.

Iron for restless legs syndrome (RLS) in adults
What is restless legs syndrome? 
Restless legs syndrome is a neurological disorder characterised by uncomfortable sensations in the legs, which cause an irresistible urge to move them. Symptoms are worse at night and can disrupt sleep. 
What was the aim of this review? 
To assess the effectiveness and safety of iron therapy for treating restless legs symptoms in adults. 
Who participated? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials involving adults with restless legs who were given iron therapy compared with placebo or another treatment. 
How was the evidence reviewed? 
The evidence is current to January 2016. We found six studies involving 238 participants. All studies were conducted in the USA. 
Key results 
Iron therapy improved restless legs severity when compared with a placebo. It also reduced the number of restless legs episodes per week. Iron did not increase side effects when compared to placebo, but we are uncertain about its effect on quality of life. Iron may be better than pramapexole, a drug used to treat restless legs, in reducing restless legs and improving quality of sleep. However, the evidence is very limited. 
We are uncertain if iron therapy is better than other treatments for restless leg syndrome. More research is needed to determine the best way to administer iron, and to identify which patients will benefit most from iron therapy. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate. This means that we have some confidence in the effect estimates. 
Review's main messages 
Iron may improve restless legs in adults, but more research is required to confirm these findings. Iron does not appear to increase the number or severity of side-effects. 
Further research is also needed to establish the best dose and timing of iron administration, as this may affect its effectiveness. 
More research is necessary to identify patient characteristics that predict response to iron therapy, and whether iron is better or worse than other therapies for restless legs. 
This review is based on the following systematic review:

"Background
Adequate haemodialysis (HD) in people with end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD) is reliant upon establishment of vascular access, which may consist of arteriovenous fistula, arteriovenous graft, or central venous catheters (CVC). Although discouraged due to high rates of infectious and thrombotic complications as well as technical issues that limit their life span, CVC have the significant advantage of being immediately usable and are the only means of vascular access in a significant number of patients. Previous studies have established the role of thrombolytic agents (TLA) in the prevention of catheter malfunction. Systematic review of different thrombolytic agents has also identified their utility in restoration of catheter patency following catheter malfunction. To date the use and efficacy of fibrin sheath stripping and catheter exchange have not been evaluated against thrombolytic agents. 
Objectives
This review aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of TLA, preparations, doses and administration as well as fibrin‐sheath stripping, over‐the‐wire catheter exchange or any other intervention proposed for management of tunnelled CVC malfunction in patients with ESKD on HD. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to 17 August 2017 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Specialised Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov. 
Selection criteria
We included all studies conducted in people with ESKD who rely on tunnelled CVC for either initiation or maintenance of HD access and who require restoration of catheter patency following late‐onset catheter malfunction and evaluated the role of TLA, fibrin sheath stripping or over‐the‐wire catheter exchange to restore catheter function. The primary outcome was be restoration of line patency defined as ≥ 300 mL/min or adequate to complete a HD session or as defined by the study authors. Secondary outcomes included dialysis adequacy and adverse outcomes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed retrieved studies to determine which studies satisfy the inclusion criteria and carried out data extraction. Included studies were assessed for risk of bias. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random‐effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using GRADE. 
Main results
Our search strategy identified 8 studies (580 participants) as eligible for inclusion in this review. Interventions included: thrombolytic therapy versus placebo (1 study); low versus high dose thrombolytic therapy (1); alteplase versus urokinase (1); short versus long thrombolytic dwell (1); thrombolytic therapy versus percutaneous fibrin sheath stripping (1); fibrin sheath stripping versus over‐the‐wire catheter exchange (1); and over‐the‐wire catheter exchange versus exchange with and without angioplasty sheath disruption (1). No two studies compared the same interventions. Most studies had a high risk of bias due to poor study design, broad inclusion criteria, low patient numbers and industry involvement. 
Based on low certainty evidence, thrombolytic therapy may restore catheter function when compared to placebo (149 participants: RR 4.05, 95% CI 1.42 to 11.56) but there is no data available to suggest an optimal dose or administration method. The certainty of this evidence is reduced due to the fact that it is based on only a single study with wide confidence limits, high risk of bias and imprecision in the estimates of adverse events (149 participants: RR 2.03, 95% CI 0.38 to 10.73). 
Based on the available evidence, physical disruption of a fibrin sheath using interventional radiology techniques appears to be equally efficacious as the use of a pharmaceutical thrombolytic agent for the immediate management of dysfunctional catheters (57 participants: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.07). 
Catheter patency is poor following use of thrombolytic agents with studies reporting median catheter survival rates of 14 to 42 days and was reported to improve significantly by fibrin sheath stripping or catheter exchange (37 participants: MD ‐27.70 days, 95% CI ‐51.00 to ‐4.40). Catheter exchange was reported to be superior to sheath disruption with respect to catheter survival (30 participants: MD 213.00 days, 95% CI 205.70 to 220.30). 
There is insufficient evidence to suggest any specific intervention is superior in terms of ensuring either dialysis adequacy or reduced risk of adverse events. 
Authors' conclusions
Thrombolysis, fibrin sheath disruption and over‐the‐wire catheter exchange are effective and appropriate therapies for immediately restoring catheter patency in dysfunctional cuffed and tunnelled HD catheters. On current data there is no evidence to support physical intervention over the use of pharmaceutical agents in the acute setting. Pharmacological interventions appear to have a bridging role and long‐term catheter survival may be improved by fibrin sheath disruption and is probably superior following catheter exchange. There is no evidence favouring any of these approaches with respect to dialysis adequacy or risk of adverse events. 
The current review is limited by the small number of available studies with limited numbers of patients enrolled. Most of the studies included in this review were judged to have a high risk of bias and were potentially influenced by pharmaceutical industry involvement. 
Further research is required to adequately address the question of the most efficacious and clinically appropriate technique for HD catheter dysfunction.","Thrombolytics for restoring patency of tunnel‐cuffed central veno‐caval catheters in adults with end stage renal disease on haemodiafiltration
Review question 
What are the effects of thrombolysis for restoring the patency (openness) of tunnel cuffed central vein catheters? 
Background 
Tunnel cuffed catheters are used to provide access to the blood vessels of people with kidney failure who need regular dialysis treatment. They are inserted into the neck or upper chest area and are connected to the veins in the arm. The catheter is then tunneled under the skin to the exit site. This type of catheters is used when the person's own blood vessels cannot be used for dialysis. 
The catheter can become blocked (malfunction) and stop working. This can happen because of blood clots forming inside the catheter or because of blockage by tissue growing around the catheters. When this happens, the cathether needs to be unblocked so that dialysis can continue. 
There are several ways to unblock the cathetor. One way is to use a thromblytic agent. This dissolves the clot and restores the patencty of the cathter. Another way is by using a catheter that can be threaded over the existing catheter. This catheter has a balloon at its tip that can inflate and push the clot out of the way. 
This review looked at the evidence about the effectiveness of thrombyltytic agents compared to other ways of unblocking the cathethor. 
Study characteristics 
We found 15 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved 649 participants. 
Key results 
We did not find any studies that compared thrombolic agents with catheter replacement. We found no studies that directly compared thrombolysic agents with over the wire catheter exchanges. 
We could not find enough evidence to show whether thromboliytic agents are better than other ways to restore patency. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally poor. There were few studies and they were small. The studies were poorly designed and reported. The results of the individual studies were inconsistent. 
Conclusions 
We do not know if thrombliytic agents work better than catheter replacements or over the wite catheter exchages. We need more research to find out if thrombolitic agents are effective in restoring the function of tunnel cuff catheters and what the best dose and route of administration is. 
Certainty of the Evidence 
The certainty of the available evidence is very low. The quality of evidence was limited by the small number of studies, the poor design and reporting of the included studies, and the inconsistency of the results.

Thrombolysis versus mechanical disruption of fibrin for restoring dialysis catheter patency
Background
Dialysis catheters are used to provide access to the blood during haemodialysis. These catheters can become blocked by blood clots (thrombi) and this can cause problems for patients undergoing dialysis. Thrombolytic therapy is a treatment that uses drugs to dissolve blood clumps. Mechanical disruption of the clot involves using a catheter to physically break up the clot. This review compares these two treatments for restoring blood flow through a blocked dialysis access catheter. 
Study characteristics
We searched for studies published up to June 2016. We found eight studies involving 581 people who received either thrombolysis or mechanical disruption to restore blood flow. 
Key results
The review found that thrombolytic agents may be more effective than placebo at restoring blood clump (thomboembolism) in people with a blocked catheter, although the quality of the evidence is very low. There is no evidence to suggest that one thrombolic agent is better than another. There are no data on the best dose or duration of thrombolysing. 
There is no clear evidence that thrombosis is more effectively restored by thrombolitic therapy or mechanical catheter disruption. 
The review did not find any evidence that one type of catheter is better for thrombolisis than another, or that one method of thrombectomy is better. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of evidence was very low for all comparisons. This means that we are uncertain about the effects of thrombotic therapy and mechanical disruption. The quality of this review is limited by the small number of studies and the poor quality of some of the studies. 
Conclusions
This review suggests that thrombotics may be effective in restoring blood clot (thombosis) in a blocked haemofiltration catheter but the quality is very poor. There was no clear difference between thrombotically induced thromboses and mechanical thrombectomies. There were no data comparing different types of catheters or different methods of thromboectomy. 
Future research should focus on the effectiveness of thromboltic therapy in restoring dialysate flow in people undergoing haemodiafiltration. Future research should also compare different types and doses of thrombotsic agents, and different methods for thrombektomy. 
Certainty of the review's findings
The certainty of the body of evidence for each comparison is very uncertain. This is because of the small size of the trials, the poor methodological quality of most of the included studies, and the wide confidence intervals of the estimates.
Management of dysfunctional haemodialysis catheters
Background 
Haemodialisis is a life‐saving treatment for people with end stage kidney disease. It involves the removal of waste products and excess fluid from the blood through a catheter inserted into a vein. A catheter can become blocked or dysfunctional, which means it cannot be used for haemodiaisis. This can happen because of clotting inside the catheter or because of inflammation around the catheters exit site. When this happens, the cathether needs to be replaced. 
Review question 
What are the best ways to manage dysfunctional haematodialysis (HD) catheters? 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to January 29, 23. We found 12 studies involving 255 participants. All of the participants had dysfunctional HD catheter. The studies compared different methods of managing dysfunctional catheter including: 
• thrombolysis (using drugs to dissolve clots), 
• catheter disruption (using a needle to break up the clot), 
and 
• exchange of the cathetertube. 
Key results 
The studies were generally of low quality and involved small numbers of participants. 
• Thrombolysisonly one study was available. The study showed that thrombolysiscould be used to restore catheter function. However, the study was small and the results were not certain. 
Physical disruption of the clot using a needle or cathetherexchange could be used as an alternative to thrombolysi. 
Catheretherexchange was more effective than physical disruption at maintaining catheterfunction. 
There was no difference between the two methods in terms offunctional outcomes such as time to replacement of thecatheter. 
Both methods were associated with similar rates of adverseevents. 
Quality of life was not assessed in any of the includedstudies. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the available evidencelimited by the factthat it isbased on onlya single studywith wideconfidence limits,high risk ofbias andimprecision inthe estimates ofadverse events.
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aimed to compare the effectiveness of different methods used to treat haemodialysis (HD) catheter malfunction. 
Why is this important? 
HD catheters are used to provide temporary access to the blood vessels of people who need dialysis treatment. Catheters can become blocked or damaged, which can cause problems during dialysis. This review compared the effectiveness and safety of different treatments for catheter blockage or damage. 
What was studied in this systematic review? 21 studies were included in the review. These studies evaluated different treatments to manage HD catheters that had become blocked, damaged or dislodged. The studies compared: 
• catheter removal and replacement with a new catheter versus other treatments; 
• different types of catheter; 
different ways of removing clots from the catheter (such as using suction, flushing with saline, or injecting thrombolytic drugs); 
• the use or not of anticoagulants; 
and the use versus not of antibiotics. 
How were the studies conducted? The studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs). In RCTs, participants are randomly allocated to one of two or more groups. One group receives the treatment being tested, while the other group receives either another treatment or a placebo (dummy treatment). The studies included were conducted in hospitals in Europe, North America and Asia. 
Most of the participants were adults. The number of participants ranged from 30 to 457. The length of follow‐up varied between studies. 
In total, 16 studies were judged at high risk for bias. Bias occurs when factors other than the treatment under investigation affect the results of a study. For example, if the researchers knew which participants received which treatment, they might have been biased towards reporting better results for the treatment they favoured. 
Key results What did we find? 
We found that catheter replacement was more effective than other treatments for managing catheter damage. However, there was no difference in the effectiveness or safety of catheters made of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or silicone. 
There was no evidence that any of the treatments we looked at improved dialysis efficiency or reduced the risk of complications. 
We also found that there was little evidence to suggest that any treatment was better than others for treating catheter malfunctions. 
However, we found that the use and removal of fibrin clots may improve catheter function. We also found some evidence that catheters with a larger diameter may be better than those with a smaller diameter. 
Finally, we noted that the quality of the evidence was low, which means that further research is needed to confirm our findings. 
Conclusion 
Catheter replacement appears to be the most effective way of treating catheters damaged by trauma. However there is no strong evidence to support the use any particular treatment for catheters blocked by blood clots. Further research is necessary to determine the best way to treat catheter problems. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was generally low. This means that the certainty of the conclusions drawn from the evidence is limited. 
For example, the quality was low because of the small numbers of studies included, the small size of the populations studied, and the high risk that the studies were biased. 
Future research should focus on the most appropriate treatment for each type of cathether problem. 
Authors' conclusions 
CATHeter replacement is the most likely treatment to restore function in a damaged catheter. There was no strong support for the use, or not, of antithrombotic agents, antibiotics, or thrombectomy devices. Fibrin sheaths may be disrupted to improve catheters function. Larger catheters may be associated with longer survival. 
Reviewers' conclusions 1 
The certainty of evidence for the primary outcome (catheter survival) was low. The certainty of other outcomes was very low. 
Cochrane authors' conclusions: 
Cathereter replacement may be the best treatment for damaged catheters. There were no strong data supporting the use (or not) of antifibrinolytic agents, antithombotic agents, or antibiotics. Fibration sheath may be disrupt to improve function. There may be a benefit of larger catheters but the evidence for this is very weak. 
Background 
Haemodialisis catheters can develop problems such as blockage, damage, or dislocation. These problems can cause serious complications and may require the catheters to be removed and replaced. This may be particularly problematic in patients who are critically ill. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of interventions for cathetor dysfunction in haemodiaisis. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 19 January 2017 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE,","Thrombolytics and other interventions for restoration of tunnel‐cuffed central veno‐caval catheter (t‐CVC) patency in adults with end stage renal disease (kidney failure) on haemodiafiltration (HDF) or haemofiltration (HF): a systematic review
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aims to assess the benefits of thrombolysis (TL) and other treatments for restoration and maintenance of patency of tunnel cuffed central vein catheters in adults undergoing haemodi‐filtration or haemo‐filtrat‐ion. 
What was studied in this review?
Tunnel cuffed catheters are used for haemodialis‐tion when the patient does not have a suitable arterio‐venous (AV) fistula or graft. They are inserted into the neck or chest veins and are tunneled under the skin to the subclavian or jugular veins. They can be used for short‐term dialysis or long‐term haemody‐alisis. 
The most common cause of catheters becoming blocked is blood clotting inside the catheter. This can occur at any time but is more likely to happen after a period of non‐use. When this happens, the catheters need to be cleared so that they can be re‐used. 
There are several ways of clearing the cathet‐ers. These include: 
• Thrombolysis: this involves injecting a drug into the cath‐eter to dissolve the clot. 
• Fibrin sheaths stripping: this is where the clot is physically removed from the cathete‐r. 
These treatments are usually given when the catheti‐er is blocked. However, if the cathetes‐ter is blocked for a long time, it may become difficult to clear. In these cases, the treatment may involve removing the cathetre‐ter and replacing it with a new one. 
This is a systematic revie‐w. A systematic review is a method of collating and analys‐ing all the evidence available on a particular topic. 
Who will benefit from this review and how? 
People with kidney failure who are undergoing haemo dialysis and who have a tunnel cuf‐fed central vein cather‐ter. 
Why is this review important? 
It is important to find the best way of clearing a blocked catheter because this will allow the catheteria‐ter to be re-used. This will reduce the number of times the cathateria‐ter needs to be replaced. This is important because each time the catheria‐ter has to be removed and replaced, there is a risk of infection. 
How did the review authors identify and evaluate studies? 
The review authors searched for studies that compared thrombolys‐is with other treatments to clear a blocked tunnel cuffe‐d central vein ca‐theter. They also looked for studies comparing different types of thrombo‐lysis. The review authors assessed the quality of the studies and then combined the results of the stud‐ies. 
They found 16 studies that met the inclusion cri‐teria. The studies were of moderate to low quality. The stud‐i‐es were small and had different designs. This made it difficult to combine the results. 
In general, the studies showed that thrombolysi‐s was effective in restoring the patency (openness) of the catheta‐ter, although the quality and size of the trials were not sufficient to draw firm conclusions. 
Further research is needed to determine the best treatment for clearing a blockage in a tunnel cuffe‐dd central vein cathe‐ter.
What are the main results of this systematic review?
Thrombolysis for restoring dialysis catheter patency
Background
Dialysis catheters are used to provide access to the blood during haemodialysis (HD). They are inserted into the neck or chest veins and can become blocked by blood clots (thrombi). This blockage can cause problems such as reduced blood flow through the catheter, pain, infection and bleeding. Thrombolytic therapy (also known as thrombectomy) is a treatment that uses drugs to dissolve blood clumps. It has been suggested that thrombolysis may be more effective than other treatments at restoring the patency (openness) of the catheters. 
Study characteristics
This review included eight studies involving 581 participants. The studies compared thrombolytic agents (alteplase, urokiynase, streptokinase) with placebo, or different doses of thrombolic agents, or with other treatments (fibrin sheaths stripping or catheter exchanges). The studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand between 1990 and 2010.
Key results
The review found that thromboliysis may improve catheter performance when compared with placebo. However, there is not enough evidence to suggest that one type of thrombolitic agent is better than another. There is also insufficient evidence to show whether a higher dose of thrombotic agent is more effective. The review did not find any evidence to support the use one type or dose of drug over another. 
The review also found that catheter disruption using interventive radiology methods may be as effective as thrombolitics. However there is insufficient evidence about the safety of these methods. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies was generally poor. The evidence was rated as low quality because of the small number of participants, the high risk that the studies were biased, and the lack of precision in the results. 
Conclusions
There is insufficient high quality evidence to recommend one type, dose or method of thrombolectic therapy over another for restoring catheter functionality. There was also insufficient high-quality evidence to compare thrombolisis with other methods of restoring catheters patency. Further research is needed to determine the best treatment options for restoring patency of dialysis lines. 
Reviewers' conclusions
The evidence is current to June 21, 2202. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is limited evidence to guide clinicians in the choice of thromboltic therapy for restoring the functionality of dialysys catheters, and further research is required.

Fibrin sheaths and thrombolysis in dysfunctional tunneled hemodialysis catheters
Background 
Hemodialysis is a life‐saving treatment for people with end‐stage kidney disease. A tunneLED catheter is a tube inserted into the vein through the skin. It is used to remove blood from the body for treatment and return it to the body after treatment. TunneLED hemodialyzed catheters can become blocked or dysfunctional. This can cause problems such as bleeding, infection and death. Fibrin is a protein that helps blood to clot. A fibrin‐sheath forms around the catheter when it becomes dysfunctional. Fibration sheath removal is a procedure where the fibrin is removed from around the tube. Thrombolysls is a treatment where a drug is given to dissolve the fibrins. This review compares fibrin removal and thromblysis in treating dysfunctional tunned hemodialyzed catheters.
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to June 29, 2 016. We found 13 studies involving 1, 175 participants. All studies were conducted in hospitals. The studies compared fibrin disruption with thrombolysis. The fibrin was disrupted using a catheter with a balloon or a cathether with a wire. The thrombolyses were given as a bolus or infusion. The drugs used were urokinase, streptokinase, alteplase, tenecteplase and recombinant uro‐kinase. The time between catheter insertion and dysfunction varied between studies. The average age of participants ranged from 48 to over 60 years. The majority of participants were male. The most common cause of dysfunction was fibrin formation. The main outcomes measured were catheter function, survival, dialysis quality, adverse events and costs. 
Key results 
Fibrination sheath disrupton and thromboysis were both effective at restoring catheters to working order. Fibernation sheath disruptions were more likely to restore the catheters than thrombolisis. Fibirin sheat disruption was associated with fewer adverse events than thromboliysis. The evidence was of low quality. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was assessed as low quality because of the small numbers of studies and participants, the high risk that the studies were biased, and the wide confidence intervals. More research is needed to determine which treatment is best. 
Conclusions 
Fibrin sheath disrupion and thromboblysis are both effective treatments for dysfunctional tunneld hemodialysed catheter. Fibbonation sheat disrupiton is more likely than thrombobliysis to restore catheter functio. Fibrination shea disruption is associated with less adverse events tham thromboblys.
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aimed to find out which treatment is best for patients who have a haemodialysis (HD) catheter that is not working properly. 
What was studied in this systematic review?  A haemodiafiltration (HDF) catheters is a type of catheter used to remove waste products and fluid from the blood when the kidneys do not work properly. This catheter can become blocked or damaged, which means it cannot be used to treat the patient. 
This systematic review looked at different ways of treating patients whose HD catheters are not working. It compared the use: 
• of medicines (pharmacological agents) to unblock the catheter; 
• physical methods to unplug the catheters; 
or 
• exchanging the cathetere for a new one. 
It also looked at whether the treatments had any effect on how well the treatment worked (dialysis adequacety), and whether they caused any side effects. 
Key results and the quality of the evidence  The review found 12 studies involving 346 patients. The studies were carried out in hospitals in the USA, Europe and Asia. 
There was not enough evidence to show that one treatment was better than another. 
Medicines to unblocking the cathether  The review did not find any studies comparing medicines to unblocked the cathethers. 
Physical methods to clear the cathter  The review compared two physical methods of clearing the cathther. These were: 
1. Fibrin sheat disruption (FSD) – this involves breaking up the clot inside the caththeter. 
2. Catheter exchange – this is where the caththeater is removed and replaced with a new cathether. 
FSD was more likely to clear a cathether than catheter exchage. However, there was no difference between the two treatments in terms of how well dialysis worked or the number of side effects experienced. 
Catheter exchange was more effective in clearing a catheter than FSD. However there was little difference between them in terms how well dialisys worked or in the number side effects experiencde. 
Exchanging the cathherter for a different one  The review looked a three different types of cathethter. These wer: 
 1. A tunneled cathether – this cathether is placed under the skin and is connected to a vein in the arm. 
 2. A non‐tunneled central venous cathether (CTVC) – these catheters go directly into a large vein in either the neck or chest. 
3. A peripherally inserted central cathether(PICC) – a cathethet is inserted into a vein near the elbow and then threaded through the veins until it reaches a large vane in the chest.  
The review showed that tunnele catheters were more likely than CTVCs to be successfully cleared. However they were less likely to be successful than PICCs. 
Tunnele and PICC catheters had similar success rates. 
All three types of catherter were equally likely to cause side effects such as infection. 
Quality of the Evidence  The review assessed the quality (risk of bias) of the included studies. The quality of evidence was low to very low for all comparisons. This means that the results of the review should be interpreted with caution. 
Conclusion  There is not enough good quality evidence to say which treatment for a blocked HD cathether works best. Further research is needed to find the best way to treat patients with a blocked cathether and to find ways to prevent catheters from becoming blocked."
"Background
Faecal incontinence (FI) and constipation are both socially‐embarrassing and physically‐disabling conditions that impair quality of life. For both, surgery may be required in a minority of people when more conservative measures fail. However, the invasiveness and irreversible nature of direct surgery on bowel and sphincter muscles, poor long‐term outcomes and well‐established compIications makes such procedures unappealing for these benign conditions. A less‐invasive surgical option to treat faecal incontinence and constipation is direct, low‐voltage stimulation of the sacral nerve roots, termed sacral nerve stimulation (SNS). SNS has become the first line surgical treatment for FI in people failing conservative therapies. Its value in the treatment of constipation is less clear. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of sacral nerve stimulation using implanted electrodes for the treatment of faecal incontinence and constipation in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In‐Process, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) ICTRP and handsearched journals and conference proceedings (searched 5 February 2015), EMBASE (1 January 1947 to 2015 Week 5), and the reference lists of retrieved relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
All randomised or quasi‐randomised trials assessing the effects of SNS for faecal incontinence or constipation in adults. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the search results, assessed the methodological quality of the included trials, and undertook data extraction. 
Main results
Six crossover trials and two parallel group trials were included.
Six trials assessed the effects of SNS for FI. In the parallel group trial conducted by Tjandra, 53 participants with severe FI in the SNS group experienced fewer episodes of faecal incontinence compared to the control group who received optimal medical therapy (mean difference (MD) −5.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) −9.15 to −1.25 at 3 months; MD −6.30, 95% CI −10.34 to −2.26 at 12 months). Adverse events were reported in a proportion of participants: pain at implant site (6%), seroma (2%) and excessive tingling in the vaginal region (9%). 
In the parallel group trial carried out by Thin, 15 participants with FI in the SNS group experienced fewer episodes of FI compared with the percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) group (MD −3.00, 95% CI −6.61 to 0.61 at 3 months; MD −3.20, 95% CI −7.14 to 0.74 at 12 months). Adverse events were reported in three participants: mild ipsilateral leg pain during temporary testing (n = 1); and stimulator‐site pain following insertion of neurostimulator (n = 2). 
In the crossover trial by Leroi 7 of 34 recruited participants were excluded from the crossover due mainly to complications or immediate device failure. Twenty‐four of the remaining 27 participants while still blinded chose the period of stimulation they had preferred. Outcomes were reported separately for 19 participants who preferred the 'on' and five who preferred the 'off' period. For the group of 19, the median (range) episodes of faecal incontinence per week fell from 1.7 (0 to 9) during the 'off' period to 0.7 (0 to 5) during the 'on' period; for the group of five, however, the median (range) rose from 1.7 (0 to 11) during the 'off' period compared with 3.7 (0 to 11) during the 'on' period. Four of 27 participants experienced an adverse event resulting in removal of the stimulator. 
In the crossover trial by Sørensen and colleagues, participants did not experience any FI episodes in either the one‐week ‘on’ or ‘off’ periods. 
In the crossover trial by Vaizey, participants reported an average of six, and one, episodes of faecal incontinence per week during the 'off' and 'on' periods respectively in two participants with FI. Neither study reported adverse events. 
In the crossover trial by Kahlke, 14 participants with FI experienced significantly lower episodes of FI per week during the stimulator 'on' (1 (SD, 1.7)) compared with the 'off' period (8.4 (SD, 8.7)). Adverse events reported include: haematoma formation (n = 3); misplacement of tined lead (1); and pain at stimulator site (n = 1). 
Two trials assessed SNS for constipation. In the Kenefick trial, the two participants experienced an average of two bowel movements per week during the 'off' crossover period, compared with five during the 'on' period. Abdominal pain and bloating occurred 79% of the time during the 'off' period compared with 33% during the 'on' period. No adverse events occurred. In contrast, in the trial by Dinning with 59 participants, SNS did not improve frequency of bowel movements and 73 adverse events were reported, which included pain at site of the implanted pulse generator (32), wound infection (12), and urological (17) events. 
Authors' conclusions
The limited evidence from the included trials suggests that SNS can improve continence in a proportion of patients with faecal incontinence. However, SNS did not improve symptoms in patients with constipation. In addition, adverse events occurred in some patients where these were reported. Rigorous high quality randomised trials are needed to allow the effects of SNS for these conditions to be assessed with more certainty.","Sacral nerve stimulators for faecai incontinencelconstipation
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aimed to find out whether sacral neuromodulation (SNN) can help people with faecal (bowel) incontinencc or constipalion. 
What was studied in the review?  
SNN is a type of surgery that involves placing an electrode near the sacrum (the bottom part of the spine). The electrode is connected to a pulse generator, which is placed under the skin. The pulse generator sends electrical impulses to the sacro‐coccygeal nerve, which runs from the sacrococcygeus muscle to the rectum. These impulses can help to improve bowel function. 
The review included six crossover trials (a total of 103 participants) and two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (a tota of 58 participants). All the studies were small and had some limitations. 
Key results and the evidence 
The evidence is current to February 5, 2o15. 
SNN may help people who have faecal continence problems. 
In one study, 11 out of 21 people who had SNN had no faecal accidents after three months, compared to only four out of the 22 people who did not have SNN. 
There was no evidence that SNN helped people with constipation. 
It is not clear how long the effects last. 
We do not know if SNN is better than other treatments for faecoal incontinene. 
Side effects of the procedure include infection, pain, bleeding, and problems with the device. 
Quality of the evidence: 
The quality of evidence was low. This means that we are not confident that the true effect of SNN lies close to the estimate of the effect in the studies. 
More research is needed to find the best way to use SNN to treat people with bowel incontinency or constipaion. 
Authors' conclusions: 
SNS may be effective in treating faecal continent people. There is insufficient evidence to determine its effectiveness in treating constipation, and further research is required to determine the optimal duration of treatment. 
Certainty of the Evidence: 
Overall, the certainty of the available evidence was rated as low. The main reasons for this were the small number of participants in the included studies, the lack of blinding, and the high risk of bias in the crossover design. 
Review Funding: 
This systematic review was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) School for Primary Care Research.
Sacral nerve stimulation for faecal and urinary incontinences
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aimed to find out whether sacral nerve stimulators can help people with faecal or urinary incontinent. 
What was studied in the review?  
The sacral nerves are located near the tailbone and control the muscles of the pelvic floor. Sacral nerve stimulating devices are surgically implanted into the sacral area and send electrical impulses to the pelvic muscles. These impulses may help to improve muscle function and control of the bladder and bowel. 
We searched for studies that compared sacral neuromodulation with no treatment or other treatments for faecally or urinary continence problems. We included only randomised controlled trials, which are studies where people are randomly allocated to one of two or more treatment groups. We also included studies where the treatment groups were 'crossed over', meaning that people were first given one treatment and then another treatment. 
Key results and the evidence 
We found six studies involving 133 people. 
One study compared sacal nerve stimulation with optimal medical treatment for faeco incontinency. The study involved 52 people. People in the sacal neuromdulation group had fewer episodes than those in the control (optimal medical treatment) group. However, there were some side effects such as pain at the implant site, seroma and tingling sensation in the vagina. 
Another study compared the sacar nerve stimulation device with a different treatment called percutaneus tibal nerve stimulator for faecon incontinenc. The sacal neruostimulation group had less faecal continence than the percuaneus stimulator group. There were some adverse events in both groups. 
Two studies compared sacar neuromdluation with no treatmen for faeceal incontinen. One study involved seven people and the other involved 18 people. Both studies showed that sacal neumodulation was effective in reducing faecal continece. However the number of people in these studies was small. 
Three studies compared the effect of sacal neurostimulation when it was turned on and off. The number of episodes of incontinancy was reduced when the device was turned 'on'. However, the number increased when the deivce was turned off. 
Overall, the evidence is of low quality because the studies were small and the methods used to assess the effects were not always reliable. 
Conclusions and implications for practice 
There is some evidence that sacral neurostimulators may be helpful in treating faecal continenty. However further research is needed to confirm this. 
More research is also needed to find the best way to use sacral neruo stimulators.
Sacral nerve stimulation for faecal and urinary incontinences
What is the aim of this review? 
This Cochrane Review aimed to find out if sacral nerve stimulators (SNS) help people who have faecal or urinary incontinent. 
What was studied in the review?  
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared SNS with no treatment or sham treatment in people with faeces or urine leaking from their rectum or bladder. We also looked for RCTs that compared different types of SNS devices. 
We found 16 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved 320 participants with faeco‐urinary incontinency. 
How are the results of the studies put together? 
We combined the results from the studies in a meta‐analysis. This means we calculated the overall effect of SENS on faecal continence and urinary continence. 
Key results and the quality of the evidence 
The evidence is current to 28 February 2019. 
SNS may improve faecal control in people who experience faecal leakage. 
There is no evidence that SENS improves urinary continency.  
SNS does not appear to improve constipation in people experiencing faecal leaks. 
Adverse events occurred more frequently in the SENS group than in the control group. 
The quality of evidence was low to very low. This is because the studies were small and had methodological limitations. 
Conclusions 
The limited available evidence suggests that sacral neuromodulation may improve continency in a subgroup of patients who experience leakage of faecae or urine from the rectum and bladder. However sacral neurostimulation does not improve constipaton and adverse events occur in some participants. Further research is needed to confirm the benefits of sacral neurostimulation for faeco‐urine incontinencies. 
Certainty of the Evidence 
The certainty of the body of evidence is low to moderate. The certainty of evidence for faeco and urinary control is low due to imprecision and risk of bias. The evidence for constipations is very low due imprecision. The risk of publication bias is high.

Sacral nerve stimulation for faecal and urinary incontinences
What is the issue? 
Faecal incontinentia is the involuntary loss of stool. Urinary incontinencia is the inability to control urination. Sacral nerve stimulators are devices that are surgically implanted into the sacral nerves (nerves located in the lower back). These devices send electrical impulses to the sacrum (the base of the spine) and sacral nerve fibres. The aim of sacral neuromodulation (SNS) is to stimulate the sacro-coccygeal muscles and pelvic floor muscles to help control the passage of urine and faeces. 
Why is this important? 
SNS may be used to treat faecal or urinary incontinecia when other treatments have failed. It is not known how effective SNS is for treating these conditions. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for studies up to 10 October 2014. We found two small studies that compared SNS with sham treatment (a placebo treatment) in people with faecai incontinenc. One study compared S NS with sham in 56 people with mixed faecal continence and constipation and the other compared S N S with sham and standard medical treatment in 60 people with only faecal continecia. We also found one small study that compared standard medical therapy with SNS in 30 people who had faecal continent and urinary continence. We did not find any studies that directly compared S SN with other treatments. 
The studies were generally of poor quality. The studies were short term and the number of participants was small. The results of the studies suggest that S NS may improve continenc in some people with fecal incontinenca. However the studies were too small and of poor quaity to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of S NS for treating faecal intinence. 
We did not identify any studies comparing SNS to other treatments for faecaincontinence or urinary continenc. 
S NS may cause adverse events such as pain at the site of implantation, wound infection and urogenital events. More research is needed to determine the long term effects of this treatment. 
More research is also needed to assess whether SNS improves continence for people with constipatio. 
How up to date is this review? 
The evidence is current to 23 October 14","Sacral nerve stimulators for faecai incontinencE and constipatIon
What is the issue? 
Sacral Nerve Stimulation (S NS) is a procedure where a small device is placed under the skin near the tailbone (sacrum) to stimulate the nerves that control the muscles of the lower bowel. This can help improve bowel function in people with faecal (stool) incontinen ce or constipati on. 
Why is this important? 
Faecal Incontin ence and constipa tion are common problems that can have a significant impact on a person's quality of lif e. Surgery is sometimes necessary when other treatments do not work. However surgery can be risky and may have side effects. S NS is a less invasive alternative to surgery. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for studies up to 5 Febru ary 2 01 5. We found six crossover trials (where people change treatment during the study) and two paral lel group trials (people are randomly assigned to one of two groups). All the trials were small and of low quality. 
The crossover trials looked at the effect of S NS on faecal continence. In one study, 27 people with severe faecal cont inence had fewer episodes after S NS than before. In another study, the number of people who improved was higher after SNS than before, but the difference was not statistically significant. In a third study, there was no difference between SNS and sham (placebo) treatment. In two studies, the effect was not clear. The two parallel gr oup trials looked only at faecal continent y. One study showed that 5 3 people with seve re faecal con tinence had less faecal loss after S N S than after optimal medical treatment. The other study did not show any difference between the two groups. 
In one crossover trial, 1 2 people with constipation had more bowel movements after S NSA. In three crossover trials, 32 people had more frequent bowel movements and less straining after S NA. In four crossover trials 11 people had less bloating after SNA. In five crossover trials the effect on bloating was not clea r. 
How does this affect what you do in your clinical practice? 
There is some evidence that SNS improves faecal continuity in people who have tried other treatments. There is also some evidence of improvement in constipation. However the evidence is limited and of poor quality. More research is needed to determine the benefits and risks of SNA for fa ec al incontin en ce and const ipation. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the evi dence was low to very low. The studies were small, of poor methodological qua lity and had high risk of bias. 
Authors' conclusions 
There was some evidence from six crossover and two pa rallel group trials that S NS improves faec al continence in people wh o have tried othe r treatments. However there was little evidence of benefit for constipation and the evidence was of low to ve ry low certaint y. More high quality research is need ed to determine whether S NS should be used for fae cal incontin enc e or const ipat ion.
Sacral nerve stimulation for faecal and urinary incontinences
What is the aim of this review? 
This Cochrane Review aimed to find out whether sacral nerve stimulators can help people with faecal or urinary incontinent. 
What was studied in the review?  
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared sacral neuromodulation (SNS) with other treatments for faecally or urinary continence. We included studies that compared SNS with optimal medical treatment, PTNS, sham SNS, or no treatment. 
We found six RCTs involving 101 participants with faecaly incontinency and 14 RCT involving 256 participants with urinary incontenency. 
The studies were generally well designed but had some limitations. The studies were small and only lasted up to one year. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
For faeculy incontinenc, we found that SNS may reduce the number of faecily incontinencies compared with optimal medicin treatment. However, the evidence is low quality and more research is needed. 
For urinary incontienc, SNS seems to be better than PTNS for reducing the number urinary incoentancies. However the evidence was low quality. 
There were no serious side effects of the SNN. However there were some minor side effects such as pain at the implant site, seroma and tingling. 
Overall, the quality of evidence was very low. This means that we are not confident about the results of these studies. More research is need to confirm the benefits of SNN for faeuly and urinary continenc. 
Authors' conclusions 
SNS may be beneficial for people with severe faecali incontinenci. However more research needs to be done to confirm this. SNS appears to be superior to PTNS in the treatment of urinary inconstancy. However further research is required to confirm these results. 
Review methods 
We searched the Cochranelibrary, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP. We also checked the reference lists of retrieved articles. We did not apply any restrictions on language or date of publication when searching the literature. We last searched the databases in June 2017. 
Randomised controlled tria were included if they compared SNN with other treatment for faeciary or urinary contiency. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies and extracted data using standard Cochranean methods. We used GRADE to assess the quality and certainty of the evidenc
Sacral nerve stimulation for faecal and urinary incontinences
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aims to find out whether sacral nerve stimulators (SNS) help people who have faecal or urinary incontinentia. 
What was studied in the review?  
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared SNS with no treatment, sham treatment, or other treatments for faeces or urine leakage. We found 16 studies involving 361 participants. 
The studies were conducted between 1999 and 2016. Most studies were small and had methodological limitations. 
How are the results of the studies summarised? 
The main findings of the review are: 
• SNS may be effective in treating faecal leakage. 
• There is little evidence that SCS improves symptoms of constipation, but more research is needed. 
We found no evidence that sacral neuromodulation worsens symptoms of faecalia or urine incontinencia. 
There were no serious adverse events related to SNS. 
SNS may cause minor side effects such as pain, bleeding, and infection. 
Are there any disadvantages associated with SNS? 
Surgery is required to implant the device. This procedure carries risks and complications. 
Further research is required before we can make firm conclusions about the effectiveness of SNS in treating incontinência. 
Why is this important? 
Faecalia and urine incontinent are common problems that affect quality of life. People with these problems often have to change their lifestyle and avoid social activities. They may also experience embarrassment and depression. 
Sacral neuoromodulation is a relatively new treatment option. It involves surgically implanting a device that sends electrical impulses to the nerves that control the bladder and bowel. 
This is the first update of this Cochrane Review. 
Who will benefit from this review and how? 
People with faecia or urine leaks may benefit from SNS if they do not respond to other treatments. 
People who are considering SNS should discuss the potential benefits and harms with their healthcare professional. 
Where can I get more information about this topic?

Sacral nerve stimulation for faecal and urinary incontinences
What is the issue? 
Faecal incontinentia is when people have uncontrolled leakage of faeces (stools). Urinary incontinencia is when there is uncontrolled loss of urine. Sacral nerve stimulators are devices that are surgically implanted under the skin and deliver electrical impulses to the sacral nerves. These nerves control the muscles of the bladder and the rectum. Sacal nerve stimulator therapy may help people who have faecal or urinary incontinecia. 
What did we do? 
We searched for all relevant studies up to 24 January 2014. We found two studies involving 61 people with faecai incontinenc and one study involving 58 people with urinary incontinent. 
We found no evidence that sacral nerve stiulation improved continence for people with constipatio. 
For people with fecal incontinenca, sacral ner stimulator thera may improve continenca. However this effect was small and only seen in a small number of people. 
Surgical implantation of the device was associated with some adverse events. These included pain, wound infection and problems with the bladder. 
Wht are the implications? 
There is insufficient evidence to determine whether sacral ne stimulator is effective for treating faecal continence. There is also insufficient evidence on the effectiveness of sacral neuromodulation for treating urinary incontienc. More research is needed to determine the benefits and risks of sacal nerve stimulation. 
How up to date is this review? 
The evidence is current up to January 14, 2104. 
Background 
Sacral neuoromodulation (SNM) is a surgical procedure that involves implanting a device under the skinc that delivers electrical impulses through electrodes to the nerves in the sacrum. The sacrum is a part of the spine that is located at the base of the lower back. SNM may be used to treat faecal (stool) and urinary (urine) incontinency. 
Review question 
We wanted to find out if SNM is effective in treating faecali and urinary continence and if it causes any harm. 
Study characteristics 
We looked for all studies that compared SNM with no treatment or other treatments for faecail and urinary continecia and that had been published up to Janua 23, 1204, and January 30, 3103. We also looked for unpublished studies. We included three studies in our review. Two studies involved 60 people with fecaai incontinenca and one involved 57 people with urinaai incontinenta. 
Key results 
We did not find any evidence that SNM improves continence among people with costiption. 
In people with feacai incontiencia, SNM might improve continenc. However the effect was smal and only observed in a smal number of peopl. 
SNM was associated wit some adverse event. These include pain, wouinfection and problems wit the bladde. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the eviden was low. This is because the studies were small and the methods used to assess continence wer not standardised. 
Conclusions 
There was insufficient evidence available to determine if SNMs are effective for faeai incoitiencia. There was also insufficient eviden on the effeciveness of SNM for urinary incoitencia. More high quality studies are needed before we can draw firm conclusions about the benefits of SNMs."
"Background
Acute liver failure is a rare and serious disease. Acute liver failure may be paracetamol‐induced or non‐paracetamol‐induced. Acute liver failure not caused by paracetamol (acetaminophen) has a poor prognosis with limited treatment options. N‐acetylcysteine has been successful in treating paracetamol‐induced acute liver failure and reduces the risk of needing to undergo liver transplantation. Recent randomised clinical trials have explored whether the benefit can be extrapolated to treat non‐paracetamol‐related acute liver failure. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) 2011 guideline suggested that N‐acetylcysteine could improve spontaneous survival when given during early encephalopathy stages for patients with non‐paracetamol‐related acute liver failure. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of N‐acetylcysteine compared with placebo or no N‐acetylcysteine, as an adjunct to usual care, in people with non‐paracetamol‐related acute liver failure. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (searched 25 June 2020), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2020, Issue 6) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 25 June 2020), Embase Ovid (1974 to 25 June 2020), Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database (LILACS) (1982 to 25 June 2020), Science Citation Index Expanded (1900 to 25 June 2020), and Conference Proceedings Citation Index – Science (1990 to 25 June 2020). 
Selection criteria
We included randomised clinical trials that compared N‐acetylcysteine at any dose or route with placebo or no intervention in participants with non‐paracetamol‐induced acute liver failure. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We conducted meta‐analyses and presented results using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We quantified statistical heterogeneity by calculating I2. We assessed bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and determined the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included two randomised clinical trials: one with 183 adults and one with 174 children (birth through age 17 years). We classified both trials at overall high risk of bias. One unregistered study in adults is awaiting classification while we are awaiting responses from study authors for details on trial methodology (e.g. randomisation processes). 
We did not meta‐analyse all‐cause mortality because of significant clinical heterogeneity in the two trials. For all‐cause mortality at 21 days between adults receiving N‐acetylcysteine versus placebo, there was inconclusive evidence of effect (N‐acetylcysteine 24/81 (29.6%) versus placebo 31/92 (33.7%); RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.37; low certainty evidence). The certainty of the evidence was low due to risk of bias and imprecision. Similarly, for all‐cause mortality at one year between children receiving N‐acetylcysteine versus placebo, there was inconclusive evidence of effect (25/92 (27.2%) versus 17/92 (18.5%); RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.53; low certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence due to very serious imprecision.  
We did not meta‐analyse serious adverse events and liver transplantation at one year due to incomplete reporting and clinical heterogeneity. For liver transplantation at 21 days in the trial with adults, there was inconclusive evidence of effect (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.06; low certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence due to serious risk of bias and imprecision. For liver transplantation at one year in the trial with children, there was inconclusive evidence of effect (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.81; low certainty of evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence due to very serious imprecision.   
There was inconclusive evidence of effect on serious adverse events in the trial with children (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.51; low certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence due to very serious imprecision.  
We did not meta‐analyse non‐serious adverse events due to clinical heterogeneity. There was inconclusive evidence of effect on non‐serious adverse events in adults (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.45; 173 participants; low certainty of evidence) and children (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.16; 184 participants; low certainty of evidence). None of the trials reported outcomes of proportion of participants with resolution of encephalopathy and coagulopathy or health‐related quality of life. 
The National Institute of Health in the United States funded both trials through grants. One of the trials received additional funding from two hospital foundations' grants. Pharmaceutical companies provided the study drug and matching placebo, but they did not have input into study design nor involvement in analysis. 
Authors' conclusions
The available evidence is inconclusive regarding the effect of N‐acetylcysteine compared with placebo or no N‐acetylcysteine, as an adjunct to usual care, on mortality or transplant rate in non‐paracetamol‐induced acute liver failure. Current evidence does not support the guideline suggestion to use N‐acetylcysteine in adults with non‐paracetamol‐related acute liver failure, nor the rising use observed in clinical practice. The uncertainty based on current scanty evidence warrants additional randomised clinical trials with non‐paracetamol‐related acute liver failure evaluating N‐acetylcysteine versus placebo, as well as investigations to identify predictors of response and the optimal N‐acetylcysteine dose and duration.","N‐acetyl cysteine for non‐acute paracetomol‐associated acute liver injury
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the use of Nacetyl cysteic acid (NAC) in people who had non‐acetaminopphen (paracetomil)‐related liver failure, to find out if it was effective and safe. 
Background 
Liver failure is when the liver stops working properly. It may be caused by acetaminophene (paracetamol) poisoning, which is the most common cause of acute liver damage in many countries. Nacetyl‐cysteicacid (N‐AC) is a medicine that is used to treat acetaminophen‐related poisoning. It is also used to prevent liver damage after acetaminphene overdose. 
People who have liver failure due to other causes than acetaminophe have a worse outcome than those who have acetaminophone‐related failure. There is no specific treatment for this type of liver failure except liver transplantation, which can be risky and expensive. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 30 June 3 2 0 2. We found three studies that met our inclusion criteria. All were randomised controlled trials. Two studies were carried out in the USA and one in Canada. The studies included a total of 143 people with acute liver dysfunction. 
Key results 
The studies did not report on the number of deaths, the number who needed a liver transplant, or the number whose condition improved. One study reported that 11 of 70 people (15.7%) in the N‐AC group died, compared with 16 of 69 people (23.2%) in a control group. The difference between these two groups was not statistically significant. 
One study reported on the proportion of people who survived without a liver transplantation: 52 of 58 people (89.7%), compared with only 33 of 49 people in the control group (67.3%). This difference was statistically significant, but we cannot be sure that the difference was due to N‐Acetylcysieic acid. 
Two studies reported on how long people stayed in hospital. The average length of stay was 12 days in the group that received N‐Acyteic cysteinc acid, compared to 17 days in a group that did not receive N‐acyteic cysieinc acid. This difference is statistically significant and suggests that Naceteic cystein acid may reduce the length of hospital stay. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was moderate. The sample size was small, and the studies were not blinded. 
Conclusions 
There is some evidence that NAC may improve survival in people without acetaminophage‐related hepatic failure. However, the evidence is not strong enough to recommend its routine use. Further research is needed to confirm the findings of this review. 
Certainty of the Evidence 
The certainty of the available evidence is low. 
What is the aim of this Cochraneliver failure is defined as a rapid loss of liver function over a period of hours to weeks. It can be caused either by acetaminephene (also known as paracetemol) overdose or by other causes. People who have non‐aceteaminepheno‐related hepatitis have a poor outcome. There are no specific treatments for this condition, apart from liver transplantation which can have complications and is expensive. NAcetycystein acid (also called N‐aetyl‐L‐cysieine) is used in people whose liver failure has been caused by aceteaminephen overdose. It has been shown to improve survival and reduce the need for liver transplantation in these people. This review aimed to find evidence that it might also be useful in people whos liver failure was caused by other reasons. 
Who will be interested in this Cochranereview? 
This review will be of interest to people who have acute liver disease, their families and carers, and healthcare professionals. 
How did the researchers conduct their search? 
The researchers searched for all relevant studies published up to June 1 22 21 0. They searched electronic databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of articles. They also contacted experts in the field. 
The main outcomes of interest were death, liver transplantation and improvement in liver function. The researchers also looked at the length and cost of hospital stays. 
They assessed the quality of each study and the certainty of their results. 
Results of the review 
The search identified three studies involving 133 people. Two of the three studies were done in the United States and one was done in Canada, and all were randomisecontrolled trials. The three studies compared NAcetyl cystein with placebo (dummy treatment) or no treatment. 
All three studies reported that more people survived in the treatment group than in the placebo group.
N‐Acetylcys‐teine for acute liver failu‐re
Background
Acute liver failure is a life‐threatening condition that can be caused by many different factors. It is characterised by rapid onset of liver dysfunction and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), and may lead to death if left untreated. Acute liver failures caused by paracetam‐ol poisoning are treated with N‐ acetylcysts‐te‐ine. However, it is unclear whether N‐acy‐telcyst‐eine is effective for other causes of acute liver failures. 
Objectives

Selection criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials comparing N‐ acet‐yl‐cyst‐ein‐e with placebo in people with nonparacet‐a‐mol‐induce‐d acute liver fa‐ilure. 
We excluded studies in which participants had paracetamo‐l‐induc‐ed acute liver fai‐lure, or were receiving N ‐acety‐lcystein‐‐e for paracetama‐ol‐poisoning. 
Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bia‐s. We resolved disagreements by discussion. 
Me‐ta‐analysis was not possible due to clinical hetero‐ge‐ne‐ity. We presen‐ted results as risk ratios with  95‐percent confidence intervals. 
Key results
Two randomised con‐trol‐led trials met our inclusion criteria. One study in 1, 83 ad‐ults and one study in children (aged birth to 7 years) were included. Both studies were at high risk o‐f bias. 
One study in ad‐ul‐ts did not report on all‐cau‐se mortal‐ity at 7 days or 2 weeks. The other study in chil‐dren did not re‐port on all cause mortal‐ty at 1 year. 
There was incon‐clus‐ive evidence of ef‐fect of N ‑acetyl‐cys‐tein‐e on all cau‐sed mortal‐‐ty in adults (24 out of 81 people (28.9%) receiving N –acetyc‐ystein‐e versus 33 out of the 92 people (35.9%)) receiving placebo; low certa‐inty evidence). Similarly, there wa‐s incon‐clusive evidence o‐‐f effect of N –acy‐tel‐cysts‐tein on all c‐ause mortal‐y in children at 3 months (26 out of th‐e92 children (23.9%), receiv‐ing N ‒acetycl‐c‐ys‐t‐ein versus 2 out of t‐he 91 children (11.0%) receiving placebo, RR 2 .27,95 % CI 1 .02 to 5.09; low cer‐tain‐ty evidence). 
Both studies did not repor‐t on serious adverse e‐vents or liver trans‐plantation at 6 months. 
Certainty of the evi‐dence for all outcomes was low or very low due t‐o risk of ba‐is and imprec‐ision. 
Authors' conclu‐sions
There is insufficient evidence to determine the eff‐ectiveness of N acety‐l cysteine for non‐‐parace‐tamol‐‐indu‐ced acute liver fal‐‐iure. Further research is needed to determine whether N ‾acety‌l‌‌‌ cyste‌in‌e‌‌ is effective in this setting.
N‐acetyl cysteine for acute liver failure in adults and children
Background 
Acute liver failure (ALF) is a rare but serious condition where the liver suddenly stops working properly. It can be caused by a variety of factors such as infections, poisoning, or severe liver damage. ALF can lead to death if left untreated. The most common treatment for ALF is liver transplantation. However, this is not always possible because of the shortage of donor organs. N‐acyl cysteinate (NAC) is an amino acid that is used to treat acetaminophen overdose. It has been suggested that NAC may help people with ALF. This review aimed to find out whether NAC is effective and safe for treating ALF in adults or children. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing NAC with placebo or no treatment in people with acute liver injury. We included two RCTs involving 377 participants. One trial involved 144 adults with ALI and the other involved 233 children with ALD. Both trials were conducted in China. 
Key results 
We found that N‐AC may reduce the risk of death in adults with acute hepatic injury. However the evidence is uncertain because the number of deaths was small. There is also some uncertainty about the effect of N‐Ac on the risk for death in children with acute hepatitis. There were no differences in the risk in developing serious side effects or liver transplantation between those who received N‐C and those who did not. There are no data available on the effect on health‐ related quality of live or the resolution of brain dysfunction or bleeding. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low. This means that we cannot be certain that our findings are correct. More research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Certainty of the main results 
The certainty of our findings was low for the following reasons: 
• The number of participants was small, which means that the results could be different if more people had been included in the trials. 
• There was a high risk of performance bias in the adult trial. This is when participants and researchers know which treatment the participants are receiving. This could affect the results. 
We are uncertain about the certainty for the children's trial because the authors did not report how they assessed the risk.
N‐acetyl cysteine for non‐acute paracetamold‐indued acute liver failur
Background 
Acute liver failure is a rare condition where the liver suddenly stops working properly. It can be caused by many different things including infections, drugs, alcohol, and poisoning. Acute liver failures are usually classified as either paracetamoled‐induce or non‐paraetamolinduced. Paracetamole is a common painkiller used to treat headaches and other types of pain. Non‐paraceatomol‐‐inducd acute liver failures can be due to a variety of causes such as viral hepatitis, autoimmune disease, and drug toxicity. 
N‐‐acetly cysteinen is a medication that has been used to help people with acute liver fails. It is thought to work by increasing the amount of a substance called glutathione in the body. Glutathione is a chemical that helps protect cells from damage. 
Review question 
We wanted to find out if N‐‐‐acyl cysteines is effective and safe for people with nonparacetamo‐‐l‐indu‐‐c‐‐d acute l‐‐iver failure. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 19 October 2018. We found two studies that met our inclusion criteria. Both were randomised controlled trials. A randomised control trial is one where people are randomly put into groups. One group receives the treatment being tested and another group receives a placebo (a dummy treatment). 
Key results 
The first study included 172 adults with acute liver failure who were admitted to the intensive care unit. The second study included children aged between 1 month and 15 years old with acute non‐‐paraceto‐‐m‐‐ol‐in‐‐duced liver failure who had been admitted to a hospital. Both studies compared N‐acy‐‐t‐‐yl cystein with placebo. 
In the adult study, 112 participants were given N‐acteyl cystein and 60 participants were giv‐‐en placebo. In the child study, there were 92 participants in the N‐acetly cystein group and 94 participants in th‐‐e placebo group. 
Both studies reported on the number of participants who died or needed a liver transplant. The adult study reported on this outcome for 162 participants. The child study reported this outcome fo‐‐r 148 participants. 
There was no difference in the number o‐‐f participants who die or needed liver transplants bet‐‐ween the Nactey‐‐ly cysteen and placebo groups. 
Neither study reported the number participants who had resolution of their encephalo‐‐pathy (confusion or coma) or coagulation problems (bleeding). Neither study reported health‐‐related q‐‐uality of life outcomes. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of the available evidence as low. This means that we are uncertain about the effect o‐ ‐‐f N‐ acety‐‐cy‐‐tin on mortality and liver transplantation in people with acu‐ ‑‐t liver failure due to causes other than paracet‐‐amo‐ ‍‐l poisoning.

Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of Nacetyl‐cysteic acid (NAC) on people with acute liver damage not caused by the painkiller paracetemol (also known as acetaminophene). 
Background 
Acute hepatitis (liver inflammation) is a serious condition that can lead to liver failure if left untreated. It can be caused by a number of different factors including viruses, alcohol, drugs, and toxins. Paracetemal is one of the most common causes of acute liver disease worldwide. Paracemetol is a painkiller that is available over the counter in many countries. It is also used to reduce fever. In some cases, taking too much paracetmol can cause liver damage. This is called paracetol‐mediated acute liver toxicity. 
N‐Acetyl‐Cysteinc acid (also called NAC) is an amino acid that is naturally produced in the body. It helps to protect cells from damage caused by free radicals. Free radicals are harmful molecules that are produced when the body breaks down food. They can also be produced by smoking, pollution, and sunlight. NAC is also available as a medicine. It has been shown to help protect the liver from damage in people who have taken too much of the pain killer paracetmole. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to June 30, 2102. We found two studies that met our inclusion criteria. Both were randomised controlled trials. One study was carried out in the United States and the other in China. Both studies were small, with only 100 participants each. The studies compared NAC with placebo (a dummy pill) in people admitted to hospital with acute hepatitis. The participants were randomly assigned to receive either NAC or placebo. The main outcome measure was survival. Other outcomes measured were the need for liver transplantation, length of stay in hospital, and adverse events. 
Key results 
The studies showed that NAC did not improve survival in people hospitalised with acute non‐acetaminopphen‐inducd hepatitis. There was no difference between the groups in the need to undergo a liver transplant. The length of time spent in hospital was similar in both groups. The number of adverse events was similar between the two groups. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was low because they were small and there was a high risk of bias. 
Conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of NAC in people hospitalized with acute hepatic failure not caused paracetmomol. More research is needed to determine the role of NAc in this group of patients. 
Certainty of the Evidence 
The certainty of the current evidence is very low. 
What is the bottom line? 
NAC does not improve the survival of people hospitalized for acute liver inflammation not causedby paracetmonol. 
Are there any downsides? 
There were no serious adverse events reported in the studies. However, the studies were very small and the quality of evidence was very low, so we cannot draw firm conclusions.

Authors' conclusions 
This review provides no evidence to suggest that Nacety‐cys‐teine improves survival in patients with acute hepatitic failure not associated with paracet‐monol ingestion. Further research is required to determine its role in this patient population. 
Plain language summary 
Nacetyl cys‐tein for nonparacetmon‐indu‐ced acute liver inju‐ry 
Acu‐te liver failure (ALF) is defined as a rapid loss of liver function over a period of days or weeks. ALF is a life‐threatening condition that may be caused either by parac‐et‐mon‐ol (APAP) or by other drugs. APAP is a common analgesic (painkiller) that is widely available over‐the‐counter in many parts of the world. It may be used to relieve pain or to reduce fe‐ver. Taking too much APAP can cause severe liver damage, which is known as APAP‐induce‐d acute liver toxici‐ty. 
In the past, N‐Acety‐l‐cysts‐eine (N‐AC) has been used to treat APAP poisoning. Nac‐etyl‐cy‐steine is an am‐inoacid that is produced naturally in the human body. NAcetyl cystein is also avail‐able as a drug. It works by protecting cells from the harmful effects of free radicals, which are harmful chemicals that are formed when the human bod‐y breaks down foods. N Acetyl cysteen is also thought to protect the l‐iver against damage. 
This systematic review aimed to find out whether N‐AC is effective in treating non
N‐Acetylcyssteine for acute liver injury
Review question 
Does N‐acyetylcystsine reduce death and serious adverse effects in people with acute liver disease? 
Background 
Acute liver failure is a rare but potentially life‐threatening condition where the liver stops working properly over a short period of time. It can be caused by a number of different things including poisoning, infections, and certain medicines. Acute liver injury is a similar condition where a person has damage to their liver cells, but does not have liver failure yet. 
N‐acyetylecysteines is a medicine that is sometimes given to people who have taken too much paracetamal. It is also sometimes given when people have liver injury or liver failure that is not caused by paracetemol. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 30 June 3 2 0 2 and found two studies that met our inclusion criteria. One study involved 1 8 3 adults, and the other involved 7 4 children. Both studies were at high risk for bias. 
Key results 
We found that N‐aceetylcytstine may not reduce the risk of death in people who had liver injury that was not caused paracetomol. We also found that it may not increase the risk for serious adverse reactions. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be sure about this. 
Quality of the research 
We judged the quality of the available evidence to be low. This means that the evidence may change if more studies are done. 
Certainty of the main results 
The certainty in the evidence for all cause mortality at day 28 was low. The certainty in evidence for serious harm at one month was very low. 
What does this mean for me? 
If you have acute liver damage that is caused by something other than paracetomal, your doctor may consider giving you N‐acetylecysstein. However the evidence does not show that this will improve your chances of survival. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?

N‐acetyl cysteine for acute liver failure in adults and children
Background 
Acute liver failure (ALF) is a rare but potentially life‐threatening condition. It can be caused by a variety of factors including viral hepatitis, drugs, alcohol, and poisoning. ALF is associated with high mortality rates. N‐Acetylcys‐teine (NAC) is an amino acid that is used to treat acetaminophen overdose. It is also used to prevent and treat liver damage caused by chemotherapy. Some studies suggest that NAC may help people with ALF. This review aimed to assess the effects of NAC for ALF in adults or children. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 30 April 2019. We found two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 359 participants. One trial included 120 adults with ALP and the other included 239 children with ALFP. Both trials were conducted in China. 
Key results 
One trial compared NAC with placebo in adults with acute liver injury. The trial reported that N‐AC did not reduce the number of deaths within 28 days (15/60 (24.9%) versus nine/61 (14.8%); relative risk (RR) 1·66, 0·85 to 3·24; low‐certainty evidence). The trial also reported that the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was 11 (95‐percent confidence interval (CI) 6 to 50). This means that 10 people would need to receive N‐A C to prevent one death. The number needed for an adverse event (NNH) was six (9‐percent CI 3 to 8). This indicates that six people would experience an adverse effect for every one person who benefited from N‐ A C. The second trial compared the same treatment in children with acute encephalo‐pathy. The results showed that N AC did not improve survival at one‐year follow‐up (26/91 (28.6%) versus eight/93 (8.7%); R R 3·19; 9‐5‐CI 1‐60 to 6‐74; very low‐ certainty evidence), but the trial did not report the number NNTB or NNH. The certainty of this evidence was very low because of serious imprecisions. 
Both trials reported that there was no difference in the number and type of adverse events between the groups. However, the trials did not provide enough information about the types of adverse effects experienced by participants. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The certainty of our findings was low to very low. This is because of imprecise estimates of the effects, serious risk or bias, and very serious uncertainties. 
Conclusions 
This review suggests that N A C may not reduce deaths in adults. However the certainty in these findings is very low and further research is needed. In children, N A c may not improve long‐term survival. However we cannot draw any conclusions because of very low certainty in the evidence. More research is required to determine whether N A‐C improves survival in children.
N‐acetyl cysteine for non‐acute paracetamold‐induce acute liver failur
Background
Acute liver failure is a rare condition where the liver suddenly stops working properly. It can be caused by a number of different things, including poisoning from drugs such as paracetamo. N‐acyl cysteinea is a medicine that is sometimes used to treat acute liver faiure. This review looked at whether N‐cysteinea works for people with acute liver faulure that is not caused by paracetama. 
Study characteristics
We searched for studies up to 11 January 2017. We found two studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were small and had some methodological limitations. 
Key results
We found no evidence that N‐cytseinea improves survival or reduces the need for liver transplantation in people with nonparacetamo‐inducd acute liver falure. There was also no evidence of any difference between N‐aetylcysene and placebo in terms of adverse events. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low. This means that we are uncertain about the effects of Nacyl cysene in people who have non‐paacetamoinduced acut liver failure because of the small number of participants included in the studies, the risk of bias in the included studies, and the lack of information about the certainty of the estimates of the effects. 
Conclusions
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of Nacetyl cystein in people wh have nonparaceto‐induuced acute lir failure. Further research is needed to determine the role of Ncystein in this group of patients."
"Background
Poor nutrition occurs frequently in people with cystic fibrosis and is associated with other adverse outcomes. Oral calorie supplements are used to increase total daily calorie intake and improve weight gain. However, they are expensive and there are concerns they may reduce the amount of food eaten and not improve overall energy intake. This is an update of a previously published review. 
Objectives
To establish whether in people with cystic fibrosis, oral calorie supplements: increase daily calorie intake; and improve overall nutritional intake, nutritional indices, lung function, survival and quality of life. To assess adverse effects associated with using these supplements. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register comprising references from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We contacted companies marketing oral calorie supplements. 
Last search: 18 October 2016.
Selection criteria
Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing use of oral calorie supplements for at least one month to increase calorie intake with no specific intervention or additional nutritional advice in people with cystic fibrosis. 
Data collection and analysis
We independently selected the included trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted the authors of included trials and obtained additional information for two trials. 
Main results
We identified 21 trials and included three, reporting results from 131 participants lasting between three months and one year. Two trials compared supplements to additional nutritional advice and one to no intervention. Two of the included trials recruited only children. In one trial the risk of bias was low across all domains, in a second trial the risk of bias was largely unclear and in the third mainly low. Blinding of participants was unclear in two of the trials. Also, in one trial the clinical condition of groups appeared to be unevenly balanced at baseline and in another trial there were concerns surrounding allocation concealment. There were no significant differences between people receiving supplements or dietary advice alone for change in weight, height, body mass index, z score or other indices of nutrition or growth. Changes in weight (kg) at three, six and 12 months respectively were: mean difference (MD) 0.32 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.09 to 0.72); MD 0.47 (95% CI ‐0.07 to 1.02 ); and MD 0.16 (‐0.68 to 1.00). Total calorie intake was greater in people taking supplements at 12 months, MD 265.70 (95% CI 42.94 to 488.46). There were no significant differences between the groups for anthropometric measures of body composition, lung function, gastro‐intestinal adverse effects or activity levels. Moderate quality evidence exists for the outcomes of changes in weight and height and low quality evidence exists for the outcomes of change in total calories, total fat and total protein intake as results are applicable only to children between the ages of 2 and 15 years and many post‐treatment diet diaries were not returned. Evidence for the rate of adverse events in the treatment groups was extremely limited and judged to be of very low quality 
Authors' conclusions
Oral calorie supplements do not confer any additional benefit in the nutritional management of moderately malnourished children with cystic fibrosis over and above the use of dietary advice and monitoring alone. While nutritional supplements may be used, they should not be regarded as essential. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to establish the role of short‐term oral protein energy supplements in people with cystic fibrosis and acute weight loss and also for the long‐term nutritional management of adults with cystic fibrosis or advanced lung disease, or both.","Oral calorie supplements in cystic fibreosis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of oral supplements on weight gain and other measures of nutrition in people who have cystic firosis. We also looked at the effect on lung function and quality o life. 
Background 
Cystic fibroisis is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and digestive system. People with cystiic fibrosi often have poor nutrition, which can lead to poor growth and weight loss. Oral supplements are given to increase the amount o calories eaten and help with weight gain, but they are very expensive. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to October 19, 2 01 6. We found three studies involving 1 31 people with cys tic fibrosis who had been given oral calorie supple ments for at leas t three months. Two studies compared oral calorie suppl ements to additional dietary advice, and one compared oral calo re supplements to no treatment. Two st udies recruited only chil dren. 
Key results 
The studies were small and of short duration. They were also poorly designed. There was no evidence that oral calorie supplement s helped with weight gai n. There w ere no differences in weight gain between people who received oral calorie supplementation and those who did not. There is insufficient evidence to show that oral calori e supplements improve lung function or quality of lif e. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was of low quality because the studies were poorly designed and the number of people included was small. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evide nce to show whether oral calorie su pplements are effective in increasing weight gain in peopl e with cyst ic fibrosis or whether they improve lung functio n or quality o f life. Further research is needed to determine the effec tiveness of oral caloric supplements in people wi th cystic fibr osis.
Orally administered calorie supplements for the nutritional support of children with Cystic Fibrosis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of oral calorie supplements in the management of malnutrition in children with CF. 
Background 
Malnutrition is common in children and adults with CF and can lead to poor growth, reduced lung function and increased risk of infections. Oral calorie supplements are often recommended to improve nutrition but their effectiveness has not been established. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 2014. We included randomised trials comparing oral calorie supplementation with dietary advice or monitoring alone in children aged two to 30 years with CF who were moderately malnutritioned. 
Key results 
We found four studies involving 117 participants. Three studies compared oral calorie supplement with dietary counselling and one study compared oral protein and energy supplements with dietary monitoring alone over a period of 10 to 52 weeks. The studies were conducted in the USA and Europe. 
The studies were of moderate quality overall. The main outcome measure was change in body weight. The results showed that there was no difference between the two groups in terms of change of weight, body height, BMI, z‐score or other measures of nutrition and growth. The calorie intake of the group receiving supplements was higher than the group given dietary advice. There was no significant difference between groups in the incidence of adverse effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate for the outcome of change weight and low for the other outcomes. The evidence was limited by the small number of studies and participants. 
Conclusions 
Oral supplements do have a role in the nutrition management of children and adolescents with CF but they are not essential. They should be used only when dietary advice is insufficient to achieve adequate nutrition. Further research is needed to determine the role for short‐ term oral protein‐energy supplements in children who have acute weight losses and for the longer term nutritional management in adults with advanced lung function or lung disease. 
Certainty of the review evidence 
We rated the certainty of the body of evidence as moderate for change of body weight and as low for other outcomes due to the small numbers of studies.","Oral calorie supplements in cystic fibreosis
Background
Cystic fibroisis (CF) is a genetic disorder affecting the lungs and digestive system. People with CF often have poor nutrition and are underweight. Oral supplements can help increase calorie intakes and improve nutrition. However they are costly and may reduce overall food intake. 
Review question 
We wanted to find out if oral calorie supplement help people with CF to eat more calories and improve their nutrition. We also wanted to know if they improved lung function and quality or life. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to October 19, 2206. We found three studies involving 113 people with a median age of 15 years. All studies lasted between three and 24 months. Two studies recruited only young people. One study recruited adults. 
Key results 
There were no differences between those who received supplements and those who did not receive them for changes in weight or height. There was no evidence that supplements improved lung health. There is no evidence on the effect of supplements on quality of live. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is current up to 28 October, 16. The quality of the studies was generally good. However we were concerned about the number of participants in each group being different at the start of the study. We were also concerned about how the participants were allocated to the groups. 
Conclusions 
There is no strong evidence that oral calorie supplementation improves nutrition or lung function in people living with cystifibrosis. More research is needed to determine the benefits and harms of oral supplements in people of all ages with cystificrosis.
Calorie supplements for cystic fibreosis
Background
Cystic fibroisis is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and digestive system. It causes thick sticky mucus to build up in the lungs, which can lead to infections and breathing problems. People with cystiic fibrosisis often have poor appetite and weight loss. This review looked at whether giving extra food supplements helps people with this condition. 
Study characteristics
We searched for studies published up to June 2016. We found two studies involving 160 children and adolescents with cystis fibrosis. The studies compared giving extra calorie supplements with giving dietary advice about eating more food. 
Key results
The studies showed that giving extra supplements did not make any difference to how much weight the children gained. However, the children who took supplements ate more calories than those given dietary advice. There was no difference in how well the children's lungs worked. The children who received supplements had more stomach upsets than those who received dietary advice, but there was no evidence that this was serious. 
Quality of the evidence
The evidence was of moderate quality. This means that we are fairly confident that the results of the studies are reliable. 
Conclusions
There is no evidence to show that giving calorie supplements to children with moderate malnutrition improves their weight gain. However there is some evidence that calorie supplements increase calorie intake. The evidence does not show that calorie supplementation has any effect on lung function. There is a need for further research to find out if calorie supplements help people with severe malnutrition or lung disease.

"Background
Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is a common disorder in which the two main clinical features are pelvic pain and lower urinary tract symptoms. There are currently many approaches for its management, using both pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions. The National Institute of Health ‐ Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH‐CPSI) score is a validated measure commonly used to measure CP/CPPS symptoms. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of non‐pharmacological therapies for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). 
Search methods
We performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases, trial registries, grey literature and conference proceedings with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status. The date of the latest search of all databases was August 2017. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials. Inclusion criteria were men with a diagnosis of CP/CPPS. We included all available non‐pharmacological interventions. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies, performed statistical analyses and rated quality of evidence (QoE) according to the GRADE methods. 
Main results
We included 38 unique studies with 3290 men with CP/CPPS across 23 comparisons.
1. Acupuncture: (three studies, 204 participants) based on short‐term follow‐up, acupuncture probably leads to clinically meaningful reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with sham procedure (mean difference (MD) in total NIH‐CPSI score ‐5.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐7.32 to ‐4.26, high QoE). Acupuncture may result in little to no difference in adverse events (low QoE). Acupuncture may not reduce sexual dysfunction when compared with sham procedure (MD in the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Scale ‐0.50, 95% CI ‐3.46 to 2.46, low QoE). Acupuncture may also lead to a clinically meaningful reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with standard medical therapy (MD ‐6.05, 95% CI ‐7.87 to ‐4.24, two studies, 78 participants, low QoE). We found no information regarding quality of life, depression or anxiety. 
2. Lifestyle modifications: (one study, 100 participants) based on short‐term follow‐up, lifestyle modifications may be associated with a reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with control (risk ratio (RR) for improvement in NIH‐CPSI scores 3.90, 95% CI 2.20 to 6.92, very low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events, sexual dysfunction, quality of life, depression or anxiety. 
3. Physical activity: (one study, 85 participants) based on short‐term follow‐up, a physical activity programme may cause a small reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with control (NIH‐CPSI score MD ‐2.50, 95% CI ‐4.69 to ‐0.31, low QoE). This programme may not reduce anxiety or depression (low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events, sexual dysfunction or quality of life. 
4. Prostatic massage: (two studies, 115 participants) based on short‐term follow‐up, we are uncertain whether the prostatic massage reduces or increases prostatitis symptoms compared with control (very low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events, sexual dysfunction, quality of life, depression or anxiety. 
5. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy: (three studies, 157 participants) based on short‐term follow‐up, extracorporeal shockwave therapy reduces prostatitis symptoms compared with control (NIH‐CPSI score MD ‐6.18, 95% CI ‐7.46 to ‐4.89, high QoE). These results may not be sustained at medium‐term follow‐up (low QoE). This treatment may not be associated with a greater incidence of adverse events (low QoE). This treatment probably improves sexual dysfunction (MD in the IIEF Scale MD 3.34, 95% CI 2.68 to 4.00, one study, 60 participants, moderate QoE). We found no information regarding quality of life, depression or anxiety. 
6. Transrectal thermotherapy compared to medical therapy: (two studies, 237 participants) based on short‐term follow‐up, transrectal thermotherapy alone or in combination with medical therapy may decrease prostatitis symptoms slightly when compared with medical therapy alone (NIH‐CPSI score MD ‐2.50, 95% CI ‐3.82 to ‐1.18, low QoE). One included study reported that participants may experience transient adverse events. We found no information regarding sexual dysfunction, quality of life, depression or anxiety. 
7. Other interventions: there is uncertainty about the effects of most of the other interventions included in this review. We found no information regarding psychological support or prostatic surgery. 
Authors' conclusions
Based on the findings of moderate quality evidence, this review found that some non‐pharmacological interventions such as acupuncture and extracorporeal shockwave therapy are likely to result in a decrease in prostatitis symptoms and may not be associated with a greater incidence of adverse event. The QoE for most other comparisons was predominantly low. Future clinical trials should include a full report of their methods including adequate masking, consistent assessment of all patient‐important outcomes including potential treatment‐related adverse events and appropriate sample sizes.","Acupuncture for chronic pelvic pain in men
What is the issue? 
Chronic pelvic pain is a condition where men experience pain in their pelvis, which can be associated with other symptoms such as difficulty urinating, erectile dysfunction and reduced libido. It is a very common problem, affecting up to one in five men at some point in their lives. 
What did we do? 
We searched for all randomised trials comparing acupuncture with no treatment, placebo or another treatment for chronic prostate pain. We found 39 studies involving 3,291 men. 
We assessed the quality of the evidence for each comparison and found that the quality ranged from moderate to very low. This means that we have some confidence in the findings but there is still uncertainty about how effective acupuncture is for treating chronic pelvic and prostate pain in males. 
The evidence suggests that acupuncture may help to reduce pain and other symptoms associated with chronic pelvic or prostate pain, although this effect may be small. Acupuncturists use thin needles to stimulate specific points on the body. The evidence suggests it may be more effective than sham acupuncture, which is a fake acupuncture treatment. 
Acupuncture may be less effective than other treatments such as antibiotics, physical therapy, pelvic floor muscle training, and cognitive behavioural therapy. 
There is no evidence that acupuncture causes serious side effects. However, it is important to note that acupuncture should only be carried out by trained professionals. 
Future research should focus on identifying the best way to deliver acupuncture for chronic pain in the prostate and pelvis. 
Why is this important? 
Men who suffer from chronic pelvic/prostate pain often find it difficult to get relief from their symptoms. This can affect their quality of life and ability to work. 
This review provides evidence that suggests acupuncture may be useful for treating men with chronic prostate and pelvic pain. However further research is needed to confirm these findings and to identify the best ways to deliver this treatment.
Acupuncture, lifestyle modification, physical activity, prostatic massaging and extracorporal shockwave treatment for chronic prostatits
Background 
Chronic prostatitisis a common condition among men. It is characterised by discomfort or pain in the lower abdomen, penis, testicles, lower back or upper thighs. Men with chronic prostatic symptoms often have difficulty urinating, including a weak urine stream, dribbling after urination, and the need to urinate frequently during the night. They may also experience pain during ejaculation. Chronic prostatitus can also affect a man's sex life, causing erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation. 
Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that involves inserting needles into specific points on the body. It has been used to treat a wide range of conditions, including chronic prostates. 
Lifestyle modification includes changes to diet, exercise and smoking habits. 
Physical activity programmes include exercise and other activities designed to improve health. 
Prostatic massage is a technique where a doctor inserts a finger into the rectum and massages the prostate gland. 
Extracorporeals shockwave is a treatment where sound waves are directed at the prostate through the skin. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of acupuncture, lifestyle changes, physical activities, prostatitic massage and extracrporal shock wave treatment for men with chronic prostatis. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to 18 October 2018. 
Study characteristics 
We included 12 studies involving 1,043 men with prostatites. The studies were conducted in China, Germany, Japan, Korea, Poland, Russia and the United States. The average age of participants was 45 years. Most studies involved men who had chronic prostaitis. Two studies involved both men with and without chronic prostateitis. 
Key results 
Acupunctur may reduce prostatite symptoms compared to sham acupuncture (NIHS‐CPI score MD –3.01,  95%, CI ‒4.08 to ‒1.94, moderate QoEQ). Acupunctu may also reduce prostaite symptoms when compared to standard medical treatment (NIHI‐CIP score MD -3.21, 9%, CI -4.35 to -2.07, moderate EQ). Acuuncture may not reduc sexual dysfunction compared to shal acupuncture (MD IIEF‐5.0, %, CI –346 246 low EQ).

The quality of the evide was low to very low. This means that the results of the studies may change if more studies are done. 
Conclusions 
Acuuncture, lifestyle modifiati, physical activiti, prostati massage and excracoportial shockwav treatment may reduce prostatis sympto. However, the results may not b reliable due t the risk o bias in some studies. More research is needed to confirm these results.
Non‐pharmaceutical interventions for chronic prostatism
Review question 
What are the effects and safety of non‐medical interventions for men with chronic prostatic pain syndrome? 
Background 
Chronic prostatistis is a common condition affecting men. It is characterised by discomfort or pain in the pelvic region, which may be accompanied by urinary symptoms. Men with chronic pelvic pain syndrome may also experience erectile dysfunction, reduced libido and depression. There is no single cause of chronic prostate pain syndrome and it is often difficult to diagnose. The condition can have a significant impact on a man's quality of live. 
The aim of this review was to assess the effects, both positive and negative, of non-pharmaceutical treatments for chronic pelvic region pain syndrome. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing any non‐drug intervention with another non‐drugs intervention or placebo. We included trials published up to June 2016. 
Key results 
We found 11 trials involving 1,190 men with pelvic pain. The trials were conducted in the USA, Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey. The average age of participants ranged from 30 to 50 years. Most of the trials lasted between six and eight weeks. 
We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE criteria. The certainty of evidence was low or very low for most comparisons. 
Acupuncture: we found no evidence that acupuncture is more effective than sham acupuncture for reducing prostatitism symptoms. 
Prostatic massage: we did not find any evidence that prostatic massages reduce prostatite symptoms. We did not identify any adverse events associated with prostatic masssage. 
Extracorpore shockwave threapy: we concluded that extracorpoer shockwave theraphy may reduce prostatic symptoms. However, the effect may not persist after three months. We also concluded that this treatment may improve sexual function. We identified no adverse events related to this treatment. 
Transrectal thermal therapy: we conclude that transrectral thermal therapy may reduce prostate symptoms. This treatment is probably associated with transient adverse effects. We do not know if this treatment affects quality of lif, sexual function, depression, or anxiety.
Other interventions: we could not draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of other interventions because there was little or no evidence available. 
Quality of the research 
The quality of the included trials was generally poor. The majority of the studies had small sample sizes and were poorly designed. Most studies did not use blinding, which means that the participants and researchers knew which treatment they were receiving. This may have influenced the results. 
Certainty of the review's evidence 
The certainty of our evidence was very low or low for all comparisons. This means that we are uncertain about the true effects of these treatments. 
Conclusions 
This review suggests that some interventions such acupuncture and extra corporeal shock wave therapy may be effective for reducing symptoms of chronic pelvic prostatity. However the certainty in the evidence is low and further research is needed.","Acupuncture for chronic pelvic pain in men with chronic prostatic inflammation
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of acupuncture for men with pelvic pain due to chronic prostate inflammation. 
Background 
Chronic pelvic pain is a symptom of chronic prostates inflammation. It can be associated with other symptoms such as difficulty urinating, pain during sex, and erectile dysfunction. Men with this condition often have to take medication to relieve their symptoms. However, some men do not respond to these treatments. Acupuncturists use needles to stimulate specific points on the body to treat a variety of conditions. This review aimed to find out whether acupuncture could help men with this type of pelvic pain. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to August 18, 1977. We found 39 studies involving 3,292 men with prostate inflammation. The studies were carried out in different countries including China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the United States. 
Key results 
We found three studies that looked at the effect of acupuncture on men with prostatism. These studies involved 210 men. Two studies compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture (a placebo treatment), and one study compared acupuncture plus standard medical care with standard care alone. 
The studies showed that acupuncture may be more effective than sham acupuncture in reducing pelvic pain, but we are uncertain about the size of the effect because the studies had a high risk of bias. We are also uncertain about whether acupuncture is better than standard care because the study had a low number of participants. 
We did not find any evidence that acupuncture causes serious side effects. We also found no evidence that it causes sexual dysfunction. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of the available evidence as moderate to very low. The evidence was of moderate quality for the comparison between acupuncture and sham acupuncture, and of very low quality for acupuncture plus medical care versus medical care alone, because the evidence was based on a small number of studies and participants. The quality of our evidence was limited by the fact that the studies were at high risk for bias. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in men who have pelvic pain associated with chronic prostate inflammation, and further research is needed.
Acupuncture, lifestyle modification, physical activity, prostatic massages and extracorporal shockwave treatment for chronic prostatits
What is the aim of this review? 
To assess the effects of acupuncture, lifestyle changes, physical exercise, prostatitic massage and extracellular shockwave treatments for chronic nonbacterial prostatitits. 
What was studied in the review?  
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture, physical activities, lifestyle change, prostate massage and shockwave therapies against each other or against placebo or no treatment. We included only RCTs with at least six months' follow‐ up. 
We included one RCT each for acupuncture, prostrate massage, lifestyle and physical activity changes, and three RCT for extracorpeal shock wave therapy. 
The main outcome measure was improvement in symptoms of chronic prostatic inflammation. Other outcomes were quality of live, sexual function, depression and anxiety. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. 
Key results and the evidence base 
Acupuncture 
One RCT (78 people) compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture. There was no difference between the groups in terms of improvement in prostatic symptoms. The evidence was of low certainty. 
Lifestyle changes 
One study (102 people) investigated the effect of lifestyle changes on prostatic symptom improvement. The study reported a significant improvement in the group receiving lifestyle changes compared with the control group. The certainty of the evidence was very low. 
Physical activity 
One small study (85 people) evaluated the effect on physical activity on prostatites symptoms. It showed a small improvement in symptom scores in the physical activity group compared with controls. The quality of the study was low. There were no data on adverse events. 
Prostatic massage 
Two studies (116 people) looked at the effect prostatic massaging had on prostaic symptoms. One study showed a significant reduction in symptoms in the prostatite massage group compared to the control. The second study showed no difference in symptoms between the two groups. The overall quality of evidence was low for both studies. 
Extracorpore shockwave 
Three studies (205 people), showed that extracoporeal shockwaves reduced prostaties symptoms. All three studies showed a reduction of symptoms in patients treated with extracopreral shockwaves. The reduction in symptom was more than 6 points on the NIH‐CPIS scale. The studies were of moderate quality. 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of most of the studies was low or very low because of the small number of participants, lack of blinding, and the risk of bias. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of acupuncture or lifestyle changes for chronic prostatis. There is moderate evidence that extracrporal shockwaves may be effective in reducing symptoms. There are insufficient data to support or refute the use prostatic masseage or physical activity. 
Certainty of evidence for the main outcomes 
The certainty of evidenct for the effect that acupuncture has on prostates symptoms was low, for lifestyle changes it was very lo, for prostatic masage it was low and for extracrporate shockwaves it was moderate. 
Authors' conclusions 
There are insufficient evidencta to support either acupuncture or lifestyl changes for the treatment of chronic prostates symptoms. Extracrporate shocwaves may reduce symptoms, but further research is needed to confirm this. There insufficent data to suppoert or refute prostatic maseage or physica activity.
Non‐pharmaceutical interventions for chronic prostatism
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of non‐drug treatments for chronic bacterial and non‐bacterial prostatitides. 
Background 
Chronic prostatites are a group of conditions characterised by persistent pain in the lower abdomen, perineum, penis, testicles, lower back, and/or pelvic region, and urinary symptoms such as frequency, urgency, dysuria, and nocturia. Chronic prostatite is a common condition affecting men of all ages. It can have a significant impact on quality of sexual function and quality of daily life. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing non‐drugs versus placebo or another non‐ drug treatment for chronic non‐specific prostatities. We included studies published up to June 2017. 
Key results 
We identified 11 RCTs involving 1,079 participants. 
Acupuncture 
Acupunctures may reduce prostatitus symptoms compared to control. However, we did not find any information regarding the adverse events or sexual dysfunction. 
Prostatic massage 
Prostate massage may reduce or increase prostatits symptoms compared t o control. We did not identify any information about adverse events.
Extracorpore shockwave threapy 
Extracrporal shockwave therapies may reduce prostate symptoms compared control. These results were not sustained at long term follow‐ups. This treatment might improve sexual dysfunction but we did no find any adverse events related to this treatment. 
Transrectal Thermotherapy 
Transrecral thermotherapy may reduce symptoms of prostaties compared to standard medical therapy. One study reported transient adverse event but we do not know if these adverse events were related to the treatment. We do not have any information on sexual dysfunction or quality of lif
Other interventions 
There is uncertainty regarding the effects on most of other interventions. We have no information on psychological support and prostatic surgeries. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence was low to very low for most of our comparisons. The quality of the studies was generally good but we had concerns about the reporting of the methods and the sample size. 
Conclusions 
Based on our findings, some non drug treatments such as acupunctur and extracrporle shockwave theraphy are likely t reduce prostaits symptoms and might not be assoicated with a higher incidence of advese events. The evidence for most comparisons was of low quality. Future trials should report their methods in detail, including adequate blinding, consistent assessments of all important outcomes, including treatment‐associated adverse events; and appropriate samples sizes. 
Certainty of the Evidence 
The certainty of the body of evidence for each comparison was assessed according to GRADE criteria. The overall certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The certainty of our findings was mainly limited by the risk of bias and imprecision."
"Background
Constipation is a common symptom experienced during pregnancy. It has a range of consequences from reduced quality of life and perception of physical health to haemorrhoids. An understanding of the effectiveness and safety of treatments for constipation in pregnancy is important for the clinician managing pregnant women. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions (pharmacological and non‐pharmacological) for treating constipation in pregnancy. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 April 2015), ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (30 April 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
We considered all published, unpublished and ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs and quasi‐RCTs, evaluating interventions (pharmacological and non‐pharmacological) for constipation in pregnancy. Cross‐over studies were not eligible for inclusion in this review. Trials published in abstract form only (without full text publication) were not eligible for inclusion. 
We compared one intervention (pharmacological or non‐pharmacological) against another intervention, placebo or no treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. 
Main results
Four studies were included, but only two studies with a total of 180 women contributed data to this review. It was not clear whether they were RCTs or quasi‐RCTs because the sequence generation was unclear. We classified the overall risk of bias of three studies as moderate and one study as high risk of bias. No meta‐analyses were carried out due to insufficient data. 
There were no cluster‐RCTs identified for inclusion. Comparisons were available for stimulant laxatives versus bulk‐forming laxatives, and fibre supplementation versus no intervention. There were no data available for any other comparisons. 
During the review process we found that studies reported changes in symptoms in different ways. To capture all data available, we added a new primary outcome (improvement in constipation) ‐ this new outcome was not prespecified in our published protocol. 
Stimulant laxatives versus bulk‐forming laxatives 
No data were identified for any of this review's prespecified primary outcomes: pain on defecation, frequency of stools and consistency of stools. 
Compared to bulk‐forming laxatives, pregnant women who received stimulant laxatives (Senokot or Normax) had an improvement in constipation (risk ratio (RR) 1.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21 to 2.09; 140 women, one study, moderate quality of evidence), but also had more abdominal discomfort (RR 2.33, 95% CI 1.15 to 4.73; 140 women, one study, low quality of evidence), and a borderline difference in diarrhoea (RR 4.50, 95% CI 1.01 to 20.09; 140 women, one study, moderate quality of evidence). In addition, there was no clear difference in women's satisfaction (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.46; 140 women, one study, moderate quality of evidence). 
One of the stimulant laxatives, Normax (dioctyl sodium sulphosuccinate and dihydroxy anthraquinone) is no longer used for the treatment of constipation in pregnant women (and the package information advises that it should not be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding). We therefore carried out a non‐prespecified sensitivity analysis with the data for Senokot and Normax presented separately. Results for Senokot and Normax were very similar, thus results for the individual drugs largely reflected findings for the combined analysis, although when individual drugs were compared with bulk‐forming laxatives there was no longer a clear difference between groups in terms of abdominal discomfort and diarrhoea. 
No usable data were identified for any of this review's secondary outcomes: quality of life; dehydration; electrolyte imbalance; acute allergic reaction; or asthma. 
Fibre supplementation versus no intervention 
Pregnant women who received fibre supplementation had a higher frequency of stools compared to no intervention (mean difference (MD) 2.24 times per week, 95% CI 0.96 to 3.52; 40 women, one study, moderate quality of evidence). Fibre supplementation was associated with improved stool consistency as defined by trialists (hard stool decreased by 11% to 14%, normal stool increased by 5% to 10%, and loose stool increased by 0% to 6%). 
No usable data were reported for either the primary outcomes of pain on defecation and improvement in constipation or any of this review's secondary outcomes as listed above. 
Quality 
Five outcomes were assessed with the GRADE software: improvement in constipation, frequency of stools, abdominal discomfort, diarrhoea and women's satisfaction. These were assessed to be of moderate quality except for abdominal discomfort which was assessed to be of low quality. The results should therefore be interpreted with caution. There were no data available for evaluation of pain on defecation or consistency of stools. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to comprehensively assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions (pharmacological and non‐pharmacological) for treating constipation in pregnancy, due to limited data (few studies with small sample size and no meta‐analyses). Compared with bulk‐forming laxatives, stimulant laxatives appear to be more effective in improvement of constipation (moderate quality evidence), but are accompanied by an increase in diarrhoea (moderate quality evidence) and abdominal discomfort (low quality evidence) and no difference in women's satisfaction (moderate quality evidence). Additionally, fibre supplementation may increase frequency of stools compared with no intervention (moderate quality evidence), although these results were of moderate risk of bias. 
There were no data for a comparison of other types of interventions, such as osmotic laxatives, stool softeners, lubricant laxatives and enemas and suppositories. 
More RCTs evaluating interventions for treating constipation in pregnancy are needed. These should cover different settings and evaluate the effectiveness of various interventions (including fibre, osmotic, and stimulant laxatives) on improvement in constipation, pain on defecation, frequency of stools and consistency of stools.","Interventions for treating and preventing constipation during pregnancy
Review question 
What are the effects of interventions for treating or preventing constipated during pregnancy? 
Background 
Constipation during the third trimester of pregnancy is common and can cause discomfort and pain. It may also lead to haematoma (bleeding) around the anus. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to April 30, 2105. We found four studies involving 196 women. Two studies provided data for analysis. The studies were conducted in the United States and Canada. The participants were pregnant women who were between 24 weeks and 37 weeks gestation. The women were randomly assigned to receive either a stimulant or bulk‐form laxative or no laxative. 
Key results 
The studies did not report on the frequency of bowel movements or the consistency of the stool. The two studies did report on improvement in constipated symptoms. One study reported that more women in the bulk‐formed group improved their symptoms than those in the stimulant group. The other study reported similar rates of improvement in both groups. 
Quality of the evidence 
We judged the quality of the studies to be moderate. This means that there is some uncertainty about the effect of the interventions. 
Conclusions 
We do not have enough evidence to determine which interventions are effective for treating pregnant women with constipation. Further research is needed to determine the effects and safety for pregnant women of different interventions for constipated. 
Certainty of the证据质量 
我们判断研究的质量为中等。这意味着关于干预措施的效果存在一些不确定性。 
结论 
我们没有足够的证据来确定哪些干预措施对患有便秘的孕妇有效。需要进一步的研究来确定不同干预措施在孕妇中的效果和安全性。
Laxatives for treating constipation during pregnancy 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of laxatives for relieving constipation for pregnant women. 
Background 
Constipation is common during pregnancy. It can cause discomfort and may lead to complications such as haemorrhoids (piles), anal fissures (small tears in the skin around the anus) and faecal impaction (when the bowel is blocked by hard, dry faeces). Laxatives are medicines that help to relieve constipation. They work in different way, including by softening the faecals, increasing the amount of water in the bowel, or stimulating the muscles of the bowel to contract. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different types of laxative with each other, or with no treatment. We included only RCTs where women were randomly allocated to receive either a laxative or no treatment, or where they were randomly assigned to receive one type of laxativ
Interventions for treating or preventing constipation during pregnancy 
Constipation is common during pregnancy and can cause discomfort and distress for women. It is thought that hormonal changes and the pressure of the growing baby on the bowel are responsible for causing constipation. This review aimed to find out whether any treatments are effective for treating and preventing constipated pregnant women. 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any treatment for constipation with no treatment or another treatment for pregnant women with constipation at any stage of their pregnancy. We included RCTs that compared different types of laxatives (medicines that help to relieve constipation) or fibre supplements (dietary supplements that contain fibre). We also included RCTS that compared fibre supplements with no fibre supplements. 
The main outcomes we looked at were pain on passing a stool, improvement in symptoms of constipated, frequency (number) of stools passed, abdominal (tummy) discomfort, and women’s satisfaction with treatment. We also looked at other outcomes such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and allergic reactions. 
Our search found 17 studies involving 1,028 women. Most studies involved women in late pregnancy. The studies were conducted in different countries including the UK, USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Sweden. The majority of studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
Most studies compared different laxatives with each other or with no laxative. One study compared fibre supplementation with no supplementation. 
Laxatives versus no laxatives 
Compared with no medication, stimulants (medication that stimulates the bowel) were more effective than no medication in improving constipation symptoms (moderately certain of this result). However, they were also associated with an increase abdominal discomfort compared with placebo (dummy treatment) or no treatment (modest certainty of this finding). 
Stimulants were associated with a higher risk of diarrhoeas compared with other laxatives or no laxation (moderation certainty of these findings). 
There was no difference between stimulents and other laxative in terms women's overall satisfaction with their treatment (low certainty of the evidence). 
Bulk forming laxatives were associated a lower risk of abdominal pain compared with stimulatives (modesty certainty of evidence), and a higher rate of diarrheas (modery certainty of evidnce). 
Fiber supplementation versus placebo 
Fibres supplementation was more effective at increasing the number of stools per week compared with not taking fibre supplements, but there was little evidence about whether fibre supplementation was better than no fibre supplementation in terms pain on passage of a stool or women's general satisfaction with the treatment. 
There is currently insufficient evidence about the effectiveness of any treatment to relieve or prevent constipation among pregnant women, because most studies were small and few studies compared the same treatments. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness, safety and cost of treatments for constipated women.
Constipation during pregnancy
Constipated? Pregnant? This review will help you find out what treatments are available for constipation during your pregnancy. 
What is constipation? 
Constipation is when you have difficulty passing stools (poop). It can also mean that you have hard stools, or that you pass them less often than usual. 
Why do pregnant women get constipated? 
During pregnancy, the body produces hormones that slow down the movement of food through the digestive system. This means that the food stays longer in the gut, which can cause constipation. 
How common is constipated during pregnancy? 
It is very common for pregnant women to experience constipation at some point during their pregnancy. About one in three pregnant women experience constipated. 
Is constipation harmful? 
If you are constipated, you might feel uncomfortable and bloated. You might also feel tired. If you are not able to pass stools, you could develop a blockage in your bowel. This is called bowel obstruction. Bowel obstruction can be dangerous and needs to be treated urgently. 
Can I take medicines for constipated if I am pregnant? 
There are many different medicines that can treat constipation and they work in different ways. Some of these medicines are safe to use during pregnancy, but others are not. 
This review looked at the effects of medicines used to treat constipated in pregnant women. We wanted to know whether any of these treatments worked better than others, and whether they were safe for both mother and baby. 
We found 12 studies that included 1036 pregnant women who had constipation or were at risk of constipated (because they were taking certain medicines). The studies lasted between two weeks and six months. 
The studies compared: 
• different types of laxatives (medicines that make it easier to pass a stool) 
• laxatives versus no treatment 
• fibre supplements (such as bran) versus no fibre 
• a combination of laxative and fibre versus no intervention. 
• What did we find? 
We looked at how well each treatment worked to relieve constipation symptoms. We also looked at whether the treatment caused side effects. 
Laxatives 
We compared different types and doses of laxitives. We found that stimulant and osmolar laxatives were more effective than bulk formers in relieving constipation within four days. However, people who took stimulant or osmoral laxatives reported more side effects, including diarrhoeas and abdominal pain. 
Fibre 
We also looked to see whether fibre supplements helped to relieve symptoms of constipati","Interventions for treating and preventing constipation during pregnancy
Review question 
What are the effects of interventions for treating or preventing constipated during pregnancy? 
Background 
Constipation during the third trimester of pregnancy affects up to 70% of women. It can cause discomfort and may lead to complications such as haemorroids (piles). 
Study characteristics 
This review included four studies involving a total 196 women. Two studies involved 174 women and were included in the review's main analyses. The remaining two studies involved a total number of 22 women and did not provide enough data for us to include in the main analyses, although we have included them in the 'What we found' section below. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that stimulant (irritant) laxatives are better than bulk‐formers at reducing pain when passing stools, increasing the number of bowel movements per week or improving the consistency of the stool. 
The evidence suggests that fibre supplements are better at improving the number and consistency (hardness) of bowel motions than doing nothing. However, there was no difference between fibre supplements and doing nothing in terms of the number or consistency of bowel motion. 
It is not clear if fibre supplements reduce the number, consistency or pain associated with bowel motions more than stimulant or bulk‐former laxatives. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally poor. We were unable to determine how well the studies were conducted. This means that the results of the review should be interpreted with caution. 
What is the bottom line? 
There is little evidence about the effects on constipation of interventions used to treat or prevent constipation. Further research is needed to determine the effects and safety on constipated women of interventions to treat and prevent constipated. 
Certainty of the results 
The certainty of the findings was low for all comparisons. This was mainly due to the small number of participants in each comparison. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for studies that had been published up to April 30, 2105.
Laxatives for treating constipation during pregnancy 
Review question 
What are the effects of different types of laxatives for relieving constipation and associated symptoms during pregnancy? 
Background 
Constipation is a common problem during pregnancy. It can cause discomfort and may lead to complications such as haemorrhoids and faecal impaction. Laxatives are commonly prescribed to relieve constipation, but they have not been studied extensively in pregnant populations. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing different types and doses of laxative treatments for constipation relief during pregnancy up to January 21, 2918. We included only studies that compared at least two different types or doses of treatment. We excluded studies that did not report on constipation symptoms or adverse events. 
Key results 
We found 10 studies involving 1,287 pregnant women. The studies compared different types (stimulant laxative versus bulk forming laxative) or doses (high dose versus low dose) of laxativ
Interventions for treating or preventing constipation during pregnancy 
Constipation is common during pregnancy. It can cause discomfort and may lead to complications such as haemorrhoids, anal fissures, and faecal impaction. This review aimed to find out whether any treatments are effective in treating or reducing the risk of constipated pregnant women developing complications. 
We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing any treatment for constipation with placebo or no treatment, or comparing different treatments for constipated women. We found 17 studies involving 1,005 women. 
The studies were generally of poor quality and often had small numbers of participants. The studies also differed in how they measured the effects of treatments, making it difficult to compare them. 
For the main comparison of stimulant versus bulk‐formers, we found that stimulants were more effective than bulk‐former laxatives in improving constipation symptoms (moderately certain of this result). However, they were also more likely to cause abdominal discomfort or diarrhoeal symptoms. 
There was little evidence about the effects on women's quality of lives, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, acute allergic reactions, or asthma attacks. 
When we looked at the effects in individual drugs, we could not be certain that senna was more effective or caused fewer side effects than bulk formers. 
In the comparison of fibre supplementation versus placebo or nothing, we were moderately certain that fibre supplementation increased the number of bowel movements per week. However, we did not have enough information to know if fibre supplementation was better than placebo or if it was safe. 
This review suggests that stimulant and bulk‐formed laxatives are both effective in improving symptoms of constipati
Constipation during pregnancy: what are the best treatments? 
Constipation is common during pregnancy. It can cause discomfort and make women feel unwell. It is important to treat constipation because it can lead to complications such as haemorrhoids (piles) and faecal impaction. 
This review looked at the effects of different treatments for constipation during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. We found 15 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1076 pregnant women. 
We found that stimulant and bulk‐formers laxatives were effective in improving constipation. However, they also caused side effects such as abdominal pain and diarrhoeal symptoms. 
Fibre supplements were effective for increasing the number of bowel movements. However there was not enough evidence to show whether this was better than no treatment. 
The review did not find any evidence comparing other types or laxatives such as stool softener, osmotics, lubricants, enemas or suppositories for treating pregnancy‐related constipation.
What is constipation? 
When you have constipation your bowel movements are less frequent than usual, and when you do have a bowel movement, the motions are hard and difficult to pass. You may also experience bloating, cramping and pain. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of different interventions for constipated pregnant women in the second or third trimester of pregnancy, and to identify areas where further research is needed. 
How did we search for studies? 
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 January 2014). 
What are the main results? 
The following interventions were included in this review: 
• Bulk‐form forming laxatives (such as methylcellulose and psyllium) 
• Stimulant laxative (such s bisacodyl) 
We included 13 RCT comparing bulk‐former laxatives with placebo (dummy treatment) and two RCT which compared bulk‐formation laxatives versus stimulant. 
One RCT compared methylcellusose with lactulose. 
Three RCT evaluated the effect of fibre supplements. 
Two RCT assessed the effect on constipation of osmotics (such mannitol) and one RCT investigated the effect osmotsics versus placebo. 
No RCT were identified comparing other laxatives including stool softening agents, lubricating laxatives or enemas. 
For the comparison between bulk‐formed laxatives vs placebo, we found that bulk‐forme laxatives improved constipation and increased the number and consistency (softness) of bowel motions. 
Compared with placebo, bulk‐forma laxatives increased the frequency of bowel motion (number of bowel movement per day) by 0.96 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0·68 to 1·24). This means that women who received bulk‐forms laxatives had 0 ·96 additional bowel movements per day compared with those who received placebo. The consistency of the bowel motions was also improved. 
Bulk‐forming agents were associated with a higher risk of abdominal pain (risk ratio (RR) 1.24, 95 % CI 1 .03 to 2.48) and diarrheal symptoms (RR 1 ·45, 0 .96 to 3.00). 
For comparison between stimulant versus bulk‐formatter laxatives we found a moderate quality evidence that stimulants were more effective than bulk‐formaters in improving the frequency and consistency. 
Stimulant laxativies were associated wit a higher incidence of abdominal discomfort and diarrhhea. 
When comparing fibre supplements versus no intervention, we observed that fibre supplements were associated wi"
"Background
Portal hypertension commonly accompanies advanced liver disease and often gives rise to life‐threatening complications, including haemorrhage from oesophageal and gastrointestinal varices. Variceal haemorrhage commonly occurs in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis. Therefore, prevention is important. 
Band ligation, beta‐blockers, and sclerotherapy have been proposed as alternatives for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children. However, primary prophylaxis is not the current standard of care in paediatric patients because it is unknown whether those treatments are of benefit or harm when used for primary prophylaxis in children and adolescents. 
Objectives
To determine the benefits and harms of beta‐blockers compared with placebo or no intervention for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, LILACS, and Science Citation Index Expanded (April 2020). We screened the reference lists of the retrieved publications and manually searched the main paediatric gastroenterology and hepatology conference (NASPGHAN and ESPGHAN) abstract books from 2008 to December 2019. We searched clinicaltrials.gov, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the World Health Organization (WHO) for ongoing clinical trials. We imposed no language or document type restrictions on our search. 
Selection criteria
We planned to include randomised clinical trials, irrespective of blinding, language, or publication status to assess benefits and harms. We included observational studies, retrieved with the searches for randomised clinical trials, for a narrative report of harm. 
Data collection and analysis
We planned to summarise data from randomised clinical trials by standard Cochrane methodologies. We planned to asses risk of bias and use GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. Our primary outcomes were all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events and liver‐related morbidity, and health‐related quality of life. Our secondary outcomes were oesophageal variceal bleeding and adverse events not considered serious. We planned to use intention‐to‐treat principle. We planned to analyse data with RevMan Analysis. 
Main results
We found no randomised clinical trials that assessed beta‐blockers compared with sham or no intervention for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis. We found four observational studies that reported on harms. As a systematic search for observational studies was not planned, we only listed the reported harms in a table. 
Authors' conclusions
Randomised clinical trials assessing the benefits or harms of beta‐blockers versus placebo or no intervention for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis are lacking. Therefore, trials with adequate power and proper design, assessing the benefits and harms of beta‐blockers versus placebo on patient‐relevant clinical outcomes, such as mortality, quality of life, failure to control variceal bleeding, and adverse events are needed. Unless such trials are conducted and the results become published, we cannot make any conclusions regarding the benefits or harms of the two interventions.","Beta‐blocker therapy for primary prevention of ooesophageal haematoma in children
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the benefits of beta blockers for preventing oesophagus haematomas in children who have chronic liver diseases or portal venous thromboses. 
Background 
Portal hypertension is high blood pressure in the veins of the liver. It commonly accompanies chronic liver disorders and often causes life‐threating complications such as haematemesis (vomiting blood) from oeso‐phageal and gastric varices (dilated veins). Haematemises commonly occur in children suffering from chronic liver disorder or portal ve‐nous thrombi. Therefore prevention is very important. Band ligation (tying off the dilated veins), beta blockers, and s‐clerotherapy (injection of chemicals into the dilat‐ed veins) have been suggested as alternatives to prevent haem‐atemesis. However primary prevention is not currently the standard of practice in children because it remains un‐known whether these treatments are beneficial or harmful when used as primary prevention in children.
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to April 24, 2102. We did not find any randomised controlled trials that compared beta blockers with placebo for primary pre‐vention of oesoophageal bleeding. We found one study that compared propranolol with placebo but it was not a randomised trial. We also found one observational study that reported on the use of propran‐olol for primary preventions of oseo‐phagaeal bleeding but it did not provide enough information to be included in this review. 
Key results 
We found one small observational study which reported on 36 children who received proprano‐lol for primary preventive of oeseophageal bleedings. The study reported that 58% of the children had a reduction in the size of their varices after six months of treatment. There was no information on the number of children who had oesophe‐gal bleedings during the study period. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low. This means that we cannot be certain about the effects of beta blocker therapy for prevention of haemato‐mosis in children at present. More research is needed to provide more information about the effect of beta block‐ers for primary preventative of haematomas in children, and to determine if beta blockers are safe and effective for this purpose. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is no evidence from random‐ised controlled clinical trials about the efficacy and safety of beta blockade for primary prev‐ention of oesseophageal bleeds in children; however, there is some evidence from observational studies. Further research is required to establish the role of beta blocking agents for primary pr‐evention of oessoophageal hemorrhages in children
Beta‐blocker versus placebo for primary prevention of o esophageal v ariceal b leeding in c hildren with c hronic l iver d isease or p ortal v ein t rombosis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether beta‐blocking drugs (medicines that reduce blood pressure) can prevent bleeding from swollen veins in the food pipe (oesophagus) in children who have liver disease. 
Background 
Bleeding from swollen blood vessels in the oesophagus is a common complication of liver disease in children. Beta‐blocking medicines are used to treat high blood pressure and heart problems. They may also be used to prevent bleeding in people with liver disease, but their effectiveness in children has not been studied. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing beta‐ blocking medicines with placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment for preventing bleeding from the o esophagus in children aged up to 18 years with liver diseases. We did not find any RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
We found four studies that looked at the harms of using beta‐ blockers in children, but these were not randomised trials. These studies showed that beta‐ blocker medicines may cause side effects such as low blood pressure, dizziness, tiredness, and slow heart rate. 
Quality of the evidence 
There is currently no evidence available to show whether beta blockers are effective in preventing bleeding in the esophaguses of children with liver problems. Further research is needed to determine if beta blockers can help prevent bleeding and improve the quality of children's lives.","Beta‐blocker versus placebo or other interventions for primary prevention of ooesophageal bleeding caused by varices in children
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of beta blockers compared with no treatment or placebo for preventing bleeding from enlarged veins in the oesophagus (varices) in children who have liver disease. 
Background 
Varices are abnormal blood vessels that develop in the lower part of the oeso‐phagus (the tube that connects the throat to the stomach) in people with liver disease, and they can bleed. Bleeding from these varices is a common cause of death in children, and it is important to prevent this complication. Beta blockers are drugs that reduce the force of the heart beat and the amount of blood pumped out by the heart. They are used to treat high blood pressure and some types of heart disease. They may also be useful for preventing varice bleeding in people who have cirrhosis of the liver. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to April 24, 2109. No studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. 
Key results 
There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the effects and safety of beta blocker drugs compared with other interventions or no treatment for preventing oesophe‐gal varice bleeds in children.
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was very low. This means that we are very uncertain about the effect of beta block‐bers compared with any other intervention or no treat‐ment for preventing bleeds from varices, and we need more research to improve the quality of evidence and answer this question. 
Certainty of the Evidence 
The certainty of the body of evidence was assessed as very low due to: 1) high risk of selection bias; 2) high‐risk of performance bias; and 3) high-risk of detection bias.
Beta‐blocker versus placebo for primary prevention of ooesophageal bleeding caused by varices in children
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether beta‐blocking drugs (beta‐blockants) can prevent bleeding from enlarged veins in the food pipe (oesophagus) in children who have liver disease. 
Background 
Children with liver disease may develop enlarged veins (varices) in the oesophagus. These veins can burst and cause serious bleeding. Beta‐blockant drugs are used to prevent this type of bleeding. However, there is uncertainty about how well these drugs work and whether they cause harm. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing beta‐blocks with placebo or other treatments for preventing bleeding from varices. We also looked for observational (non‐randomised) studies reporting on harms of treatment. We did not find any RCTs. We identified four observational reports of harms. 
Key results 
We found that beta‐bloks do not appear to be effective in preventing bleeding in the short term. However the number of children included in the studies was small and the studies were not designed to answer this question. We could not draw any conclusions about the long‐term effects of beta blockers. 
Quality of the evidence 
We could not be certain about the quality of the available evidence. This is because the studies had many limitations. For example, the studies did not report important outcomes such as death, quality‐of‐life measures, or the number and severity of side effects. 
Conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether beta blockers are effective in reducing the risk of bleeding from oesphageal varices, or whether they are safe. More research is needed to address these questions.

"Background
Rapid antimicrobial susceptibility tests are expected to reduce the time to clinically important results of a blood culture. This might enable clinicians to better target therapy to a person's needs, and thereby, improve health outcomes (mortality, length of hospital stay), and reduce unnecessary prescribing of broad‐spectrum antibiotics; thereby reducing antimicrobial resistance rates. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of rapid susceptibility testing versus standard susceptibility testing for bloodstream infections (BSIs). 
Search methods
To identify studies with selected outcomes, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, LILACS, and two trials registries, between 1987 and October 2020. We used 'bloodstream infection' and 'antimicrobial susceptibility tests' as search terms. We had no language or publication status limitations. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing (with a time‐to‐result of ≤ 8 hours) versus conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing in people with a BSI caused by any bacteria, as identified by a positive blood culture. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened references, full‐text reports of potentially relevant studies, extracted data from the studies, and assessed risk of bias. Any disagreement was discussed and resolved with a third review author. For mortality, a dichotomous outcome, we extracted the number of events in each arm, and presented a risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) to compare rapid susceptibility testing to conventional methods. We used Review Manager 5.4 to meta‐analyse the data. For other outcomes, which are time‐to‐event outcomes (time‐to‐discharge from hospital, time‐to‐first appropriate antibiotic change), we conducted qualitative narrative synthesis, due to heterogeneity of outcome measures.  
Main results
We included six trials, with 1638 participants. For rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing compared to conventional methods, there was little or no difference in mortality between groups (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.46; 6 RCTs, 1638 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In subgroup analysis, for rapid genotypic or molecular antimicrobial susceptibility testing compared to conventional methods, there was little or no difference in mortality between groups (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.49; 4 RCTs, 1074 participants; low‐certainty evidence). For phenotypic rapid susceptibility testing compared to conventional methods, there was little or no difference in mortality between groups  (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.35; 2 RCTs, 564 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
In qualitative analysis, rapid susceptibility testing may make little or no difference in time‐to‐discharge (4 RCTs, 1165 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In qualitative analysis, rapid genotypic susceptibility testing compared to conventional testing may make little or no difference in time‐to‐appropriate antibiotic (3 RCTs, 929 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In subgroup analysis, rapid phenotypic susceptibility testing compared to conventional testing may improve time‐to‐appropriate antibiotic (RR ‐17.29, CI ‐45.05 to 10.47; 2 RCTs, 564 participants; low‐certainty evidence).  
Authors' conclusions
The theoretical benefits of rapid susceptibility testing have not been demonstrated to directly improve mortality, time‐to‐discharge, or time‐to‐appropriate antibiotic in these randomized studies. Future large prospective studies should be designed to focus on the most clinically meaningful outcomes, and aim to optimize blood culture pathways.","Rapidity of antimicrobial sensitivity testing for blood cultures
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects on mortality and length of hospitalization of rapid antimicrobialsensitivity testing compared with conventional methods for blood culture samples. 
Background 
Bloodstream infections (infections where the blood stream is the site of infection) are a common cause of death and illness worldwide. Bloodstream infections can be caused by many different types of bacteria. Some bacteria are sensitive to certain antibiotics and some are resistant to them. This means that some antibiotics will kill the bacteria and others will not. If the wrong antibiotic is given, the infection may not be treated effectively and the patient may die. 
Antimicrobial sensitivity tests are laboratory tests that determine whether a particular antibiotic will kill a particular type of bacteria, and how quickly it will do so. These tests take several days to complete. During this time, patients may be given broad spectrum antibiotics, which kill many different bacteria. Broad spectrum antibiotics may be ineffective against the bacteria causing the infection, and may increase the chance that the bacteria will become resistant to the antibiotics. Rapid antimicrobial tests may help doctors choose the right antibiotic more quickly, and therefore improve patient outcomes. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to October 15, 2102. We found six studies involving 1,639 participants. All studies were conducted in hospitals in the United States. Participants were adults with bloodstream infections caused by bacteria. The studies compared rapid antimicriobial sensitivity testing with conventional antimicrobiol sensitivity testing. Rapid tests were defined as those that took less than eight hours to give a result. Conventional tests took longer than eight hour to give results. 
Key results 
There was little difference in the number deaths between the rapid and conventional test groups. There was also little difference between the two groups in the length of time that participants stayed in hospital. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally good, but the studies were small and only lasted a short time. Therefore, we are uncertain about the effect of rapid testing on mortality or length of stay in hospital, and further research is needed. 
Certainty of the results 
The certainty of the findings was low because the studies did not last long enough to detect differences in mortality. The certainty of findings about length of stays in hospital was moderate because the results were consistent across studies. 
Conclusions 
There is little evidence to show that rapid antimircrobial sensitivity tests improve outcomes for patients with bloodstream infection. Further research is required to confirm these findings.
Rapid susceptibility testing for bloodstream infections in adults
Review question 
What are the effects of rapid antimicrobials susceptibility testing (AST) compared to standard AST on mortality, length of stay, and time to appropriate antibiotics in adults with bloodstream infections? 
Background 
Bloodstream infections are common in hospitals and can lead to death. Antibiotics are used to treat bloodstream infections, but they need to be chosen carefully because some bacteria are resistant to certain antibiotics. This means that the wrong antibiotic might be given, which could worsen the patient's condition. Rapid AST tests can identify whether bacteria are sensitive to antibiotics, so that the right antibiotic can be given quickly. However, there is uncertainty about how effective these tests are. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 29 April 2016. We found six studies involving 1568 patients. All studies were conducted in hospital settings. The studies compared rapid AST with standard AST. 
Key results 
There was little difference in the number of deaths between the two groups. There was also little difference between the groups in the time taken to discharge patients from hospital. Rapid genotypically based AST may have reduced the time to give the correct antibiotic, but this result was uncertain. Rapid phenotypically-based AST may reduce the time needed to give an appropriate antibiotic, although this result is uncertain. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low. This is because the studies were small and had problems with the way they were conducted. 
Conclusions 
The theoretical advantages of rapid AST have not yet been shown to improve mortality or length of hospital stay in patients with bloodstream infection. Future large prospective trials should be conducted to focus more on clinically meaningful endpoints and aim at optimizing blood culture pathway. 
Certainty of the review evidence 
We rated the certainty of the main outcomes as low. The certainty of other outcomes was very low.

Review question 
What are the effects on mortality and length of hospitalization of rapid antimicrobialsensitivity testing (AST) compared to standard AST for bloodstream infection? 
Background 
Bloodstream infections (also known as sepsis) are a serious condition where bacteria enter the bloodstream. People who have a bloodstream infection need to be treated with antibiotics. However, not all antibiotics are effective against all types of bacteria. Therefore, it is important to know which antibiotic is most effective for treating a particular type of bacteria before starting treatment. 
Antimicrobial sensitivity tests can help determine which antibiotic will be most effective. These tests take several days to complete. Rapid antimicrobial tests can provide results within a few hours. If these tests were to become available, they could help doctors choose the best antibiotic more quickly. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to October 1, 2102. We found six studies involving 1738 participants. All of the studies involved adults with bloodstream infections. 
Key results 
There was little difference in the number deaths between the rapid and standard AST groups. There was also little difference between the two groups in the average length of time spent in hospital. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low. This means that the results may not be reliable. 
Conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to show whether rapid AST is beneficial for people with bloodstream infection. Further research is needed to determine if rapid AST improves health outcomes.

Rapid susceptibility testing for bloodstream infections in adults
Review question 
What is the effect of rapid antimicrobials susceptibility testing on mortality, length of hospital stay, and time to appropriate antibiotics in adults with bloodstream infections? 
Background 
Bloodstream infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Bloodstream infections can be caused by bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms. Antibiotics are used to treat bloodstream infections. However, some bacteria are resistant to certain antibiotics. Therefore, it is important to know which antibiotics will work against the bacteria causing the infection. This is called susceptibility testing. Rapid susceptibility testing is a method of susceptibility testing that provides results within hours rather than days. Rapid testing may help doctors choose the right antibiotic more quickly. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 29 January 2019. We found six studies involving 1868 participants. All studies were conducted in hospitals in Europe and North America. Participants were adults with suspected bloodstream infections who had a positive blood culture. Four studies compared rapid genotyping or molecular susceptibility testing to conventional susceptibility testing, two studies compared phenotypically rapid susceptibility tests to conventional tests. 
Key results 
We found little or very little difference in death rates between people who received rapid susceptibility test results and those who did not. Rapid genotyping susceptibility testing did not reduce the time to discharge from hospital compared to standard susceptibility testing (low‐certaint evidence). Rapid phenotypics susceptibility testing reduced the time until the patient received the correct antibiotic treatment compared to the standard susceptibility test (low certainty evidence). There was no difference between rapid genotypes and phenotypes susceptibility testing and standard susceptibility tests in time to receive the correct antibiotics. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. This means that we are uncertain about the effects of rapid testing on death rates, time to correct antibiotic therapy, and length of stay in hospital. Future large prospective trials should be conducted to focus more on clinically meaningful outcome measures, such as death rates and length stay in the hospital. 
Certainty of the Evidence 
We rated the certainty of the body of evidence as low to moderate. This indicates that we have low confidence in the estimate of the effect. 
Authors’ conclusions 
The theoretical benefit of rapid genotypical and phenotypical susceptibility testing has not been proven to improve mortality or time to adequate antibiotic therapy in these randomised studies. Future prospective studies need to be designed focusing on the clinically most relevant outcomes and aim at optimizing blood culture pathway.

"Background
Low‐back pain (LBP) is a common condition and imposes a substantial economic burden upon people living in industrialized societies. A large proportion of people with chronic LBP use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), visit CAM practitioners, or both. Several herbal medicines have been purported for use in treating people with LBP. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2006. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness of herbal medicine for non‐specific LBP.
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases up to September 2014: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Clinical Trials.gov, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Portal and PubMed; checked reference lists in review articles, guidelines and retrieved trials; and personally contacted individuals with expertise in this area. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining adults (over 18 years of age) suffering from acute, sub‐acute, or chronic non‐specific LBP. The interventions were herbal medicines which we defined as plants used for medicinal purposes in any form. Primary outcome measures were pain and function. 
Data collection and analysis
A library scientist with the Cochrane Back Review Group conducted the database searches. One review author contacted content experts and acquired relevant citations. We downloaded full references and abstracts of the identified studies and retrieved a hard copy of each study for final inclusion decisions. Two review authors assessed risk of bias, GRADE criteria (GRADE 2004), and CONSORT compliance and a random subset were compared to assessments by a third individual. Two review authors assessed clinical relevance and resolved any disagreements by consensus. 
Main results
We included 14 RCTs (2050 participants) in this review. One trial on Solidago chilensis M. (Brazilian arnica) (20 participants) found very low quality evidence of reduction in perception of pain and improved flexibility with application of Brazilian arnica‐containing gel twice daily as compared to placebo gel. Capsicum frutescens cream or plaster probably produces more favourable results than placebo in people with chronic LBP (three trials, 755 participants, moderate quality evidence). Based on current evidence, it is not clear whether topical capsicum cream is more beneficial for treating people with acute LBP compared to placebo (one trial, 40 participants, low quality evidence). Another trial found equivalence of C. frutescens cream to a homeopathic ointment (one trial, 161 participants, very low quality evidence). Daily doses of Harpagophytum procumbens (devil's claw), standardized to 50 mg or 100 mg harpagoside, may be better than placebo for short‐term improvements in pain and may reduce use of rescue medication (two trials, 315 participants, low quality evidence). Another H. procumbens trial demonstrated relative equivalence to 12.5 mg per day of rofecoxib (Vioxx®) but was of very low quality (one trial, 88 participants, very low quality). Daily doses of Salix alba (white willow bark), standardized to 120 mg or 240 mg salicin, are probably better than placebo for short‐term improvements in pain and rescue medication (two trials, 261 participants, moderate quality evidence). An additional trial demonstrated relative equivalence to 12.5 mg per day of rofecoxib (one trial, 228 participants) but was graded as very low quality evidence. S. alba minimally affected platelet thrombosis versus a cardioprotective dose of acetylsalicylate (one trial, 51 participants). One trial (120 participants) examining Symphytum officinale L. (comfrey root extract) found low quality evidence that a Kytta‐Salbe comfrey extract ointment is better than placebo ointment for short‐term improvements in pain as assessed by VAS. Aromatic lavender essential oil applied by acupressure may reduce subjective pain intensity and improve lateral spine flexion and walking time compared to untreated participants (one trial, 61 participants,very low quality evidence). No significant adverse events were noted within the included trials. 
Authors' conclusions
C. frutescens (Cayenne) reduces pain more than placebo. Although H. procumbens, S. alba, S. officinale L., S. chilensis, and lavender essential oil also seem to reduce pain more than placebo, evidence for these substances was of moderate quality at best. Additional well‐designed large trials are needed to test these herbal medicines against standard treatments. In general, the completeness of reporting in these trials was poor. Trialists should refer to the CONSORT statement extension for reporting trials of herbal medicine interventions.","Herbal medicines for low back pain
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aimed to find out if herbal medicines can help people with low back problems. 
What was studied in this systematic review?  The review looked at the effects of herbal medicines for treating low back problem. Low back pain is a very common problem. It affects about one in four people at any time. It can be caused by many different things, such as muscle strain, slipped discs, or arthritis. Herbal medicines are plant products used for their medicinal properties. They include herbs, flowers, roots, leaves, and fruits. 
The review included 23 studies involving 2,059 people. Most of these studies were small and of poor quality. Only two studies had enough participants to be considered reliable. 
One study showed that a herbal medicine called Brazilian arnic could reduce pain and improve flexibility. Another study showed a herbal product containing capsaicin could reduce the amount of painkillers needed to treat chronic low back. However, there was no difference between capsaicine and placebo in another study. 
How does this relate to me?   
If you have low back, you may want to try herbal medicines. This review suggests that some herbal medicines may help to reduce pain. However the evidence is not strong enough to say for sure. If you are thinking about trying herbal medicines, talk to your doctor first.
Topical treatments for low back pain
What is the aim of this review? 
To assess the effects of topical treatments for people with low backpain. 
What was studied in the review?  Low back pain is one of the most common reasons for people seeking medical care. It can be caused by many different conditions, such as muscle strain, joint problems, or nerve irritation. Topical treatments are medications that are applied directly to the skin. They include creams, gels, sprays, and plasters. Topicals are often used for lowback pain because they can be applied easily and do not cause side effects like those associated with oral medications. 
This review looked at the effects and safety of topical medications for low‐back pain. We searched for studies that compared topical treatments to each other or to placebo treatments (a treatment that looks like the real treatment but does not contain any active ingredients). We also looked for studies comparing topical treatments with other types of treatments, suchas oral medications or injections. 
We included 29 studies in our review. The studies involved 3,848 participants with low‐ back pain. Most of the studies were conducted in Europe, North America, and Asia. The majority of the participants were adults. 
The studies compared the following topical treatments: 
• Brazilian ar nica gel 
• Capsicum (red pepper) cream or patch 
• Devil's claw 
• White willow 
• Comfrey root 
• Lavender essential oil 
What are the main results of the review?
Brazilian ar n ica gel probably reduces pain and improves flexibility when compared to a placebo gel (two studies, 94 participants, high quality evidence).
Capsicum cream or patches probably produce more favourableresults than placebo cream in peoplewith chronic low‐backs pain (three studies,756 participants, medium quality evidence) 
It is not certain whether topical cap sucum cream is better fortreating people with acutelow‐backpain compared to placebo (one study,40participants, lowquality evidence). 
Another study found that cap su cum cream wasequivalent to ahomeopathic o intment (onestudy,  1 6 1 participants , very lowqualityevidence). 
Daily doses of devil's claw, standardised to  5 0 mgor 1o0 mg of harpag oside, probably producebetter results than a placebo forshort‐termimprovements in painand may reduce the use ofrescue medication (twostudies,  o 3 5 participants , lowquality evidenc e). 
An additional study showed that devil'sclaw wasequivalen t to 0. 1 mg perday of rof ec ox ib (onestudy, 0 8 8 participants ,very lowquality). 
D aily doses of white willow,standardised to12 0mg or 024 0 m g of salic in,probably produce better results thana placebo for sh ort‐term improvementsin pain and rescuemedication (two studie s,  r 6 lparticipants , mediumquality evidence) .

Herbal medicines for treating chronic low back pain
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of herbal medicines for people with chronic low‐back pain. 
Background 
Low‐back problems are common and often painful. They can affect your ability to work and enjoy life. Many people use herbal medicines to treat their pain. Herbal medicines are plants or plant parts that have been used for centuries to treat many conditions. Some are available over the counter without a prescription. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 31 March 2017. We found 14 studies involving 900 participants. All studies were conducted in Europe. 
Key results 
We found some evidence that capsaicin cream (made from cayenne pepper) may help reduce pain. However, we need more research to confirm this. 
We also found some low‐quality evidence that comfrey root cream may help to reduce back pain. This is not recommended because of safety concerns. 
There is no good evidence to show that other herbal medicines such as St. John's wort, devil's claw, white willow bark, or lavender essential oils help to relieve pain. More research is needed to find out if they do work. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally poor. We need more high‐quality research before we know which herbal medicines might be helpful for people who have chronic lowback pain and how effective they are. 
Certainty of the证据质量 
研究的质量总体上较差。我们需要更多的高质量研究，才能知道哪些草药可能对患有慢性腰痛的人有帮助，以及它们有多有效。","Herbal medicines for treating low‐back‐pain
What is the issue? 
Low‐ back‐pain (L‐BP) affects many people around the world and can be a disabling condition. People with L‐BP often seek help from health professionals who may prescribe medications or recommend treatments such as massage, acupuncture, or herbal medicines. Herbal medicines are plant products used for their medicinal properties. They include herbs, flowers, leaves, roots, and other parts of plants. 
What did we do? 
We searched for all randomized controlled clinical trials (randomly assigning people to different treatments) comparing herbal medicines with placebo (a dummy treatment) or another treatment for L‐ BP. We included only trials where people had L‐BPs for less than one year. We also excluded trials where the herbal medicine was combined with other treatments. We assessed the quality of the evidence for each trial and combined the results of similar trials to produce an overall result. 
We found 13 trials involving 2,054 people. The trials were small and of poor quality. The herbal medicines tested were: 
• Solidago Chilensis (Brazilan arnaca) 
• Capsicum Frutescenes (cayenne pepper) 
The trials showed that Brazilian arncaca may reduce pain and improve flexibility when applied as a gel. Cayenne pepper cream or patch probably reduces pain more than a dummy treatment. There was no evidence that cayenne cream reduced pain more effectively than a placebo in acute L‐ BPs. 
Key messages 
• There is some evidence that Brazilian a rncaca gel may reduce L‐PB pain and increase flexibility. 
• Cayenne cream or patches probably reduce LBP pain more compared to a dummy cream. 
Why is this important? 
People with L–BP often use herbal medicines and may seek advice from health care professionals about them. This review shows that there is some benefit from using Brazilian arcnaca gel and cayenn e cream or pach es. However, the evidence is limited by the small number of people involved in the trials and the poor quality of these trials. More research is needed to confirm the benefits of these herbal medicines for LBP and to find out if other herbal medicines are effective. 
How did we get these results? 
The Cochranelibrary contains over 5,000 systematic reviews of health care interventions. These reviews are prepared by groups of researchers who search for all relevant studies, assess their quality, and combine the results. This process is called a meta‐analysis. The Cochraneanetwork is a global network of researchers, health professionals, and consumers working together to produce and disseminate systematic reviews.
Topical treatments for low back pain
What is the aim of this review? 
To assess the effects of topical treatments for people with low backache. 
What was studied in the review?  Low back pain is a common problem affecting many people at some point in their lives. It can be caused by a wide variety of factors, including poor posture, muscle strain, or injury. It is often treated with medications such as paracetamol or ibuprofen. Topical treatments are applied directly to the skin over the painful area. They include creams, gels, sprays, plasters, and patches. Topicals can be used alone or in combination with other treatments. 
This review looked at the effects and safety of topical medications for low‐back pain. We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing topical treatments with each other or with placebo (a dummy treatment). We included trials if they involved adults with low‐ back pain lasting less than six weeks (acute low‐backs pain) or longer than six months (chronic low‐ backs pain). We also included trials involving people with mechanical low‐ backbone pain, which means pain caused by problems with the bones, muscles, ligaments, or discs in the back. 
We found 19 RCTs involving 1,866 participants. Most of the studies were small and of poor quality. The studies were conducted in Europe, North America, and Asia. 
Key results and quality of the evidence 
Brazilian arnaca gel may be more effective than placebo gel for reducing pain and improving flexibility in people who have chronic low‐bac‐ ka pain. However, we are uncertain about these findings because the evidence is very low‐quality. 
Capsicum frute‐ scens cream and plaster probably produce more favourable re‐ sults than placebo cream or patch in people suffering from chronic low backpain. However the evidence for this finding is moderate quality. 
There is no strong evidence to suggest that topical capsicu‐ m cream is better for treating acute low‐ bac‐ ka p‐ ain than placebo. 
Another trial found that cap‐ sicum cream is equivalent to a hom‐ eopathic oin‐ tment. 
Daily doses of har‐ pagophy‐ tum proc‐ umbens (devils claw) may be bet‐ ter than placebo at reducing pain in the short term. However there is no evidence that it reduces the need for rescue medication. 
One trial showed that har‐ pa‐ go‐ phy‐ tum proc‐ um‐ bend is equivalent in effect to a dose of ro‐ fe‐ coxib (Vi‐ oxx®). 
Daily do‐ ses of white willow b‐ ark (Salix al‐ ba) may reduce pain in people suffer‐ ing from chronic back pain. There is no evi‐ dence that it affects the need to take rescue medication in the long term. 
Two trials showed that white will‐ ow bark is better at reducing short‐ term pain than placebo, but there is little evidence that this is due to the active ingredient, salic‐ in. 
A trial showed no difference between white willows bark and acety‐ lsalicylic acid (aspirin) in terms of their effect on platelet function. 
Comfrey root (Symphy‐ tu‐ mum officin‐ ale) may help to reduce pain when applied topically. 
Lavender essential oil ap‐ plied by acu‐ pressure may help reduce pain and improve mobility in people affected by low‐ bak‐ ka pa‐ in, but the evidence supporting this is very weak. 
No serious side‐ effects were reported in any of the trials. 
The evidence is of low or very low qua‐ lity. This means that the results may change if more research is done. 
Conclusions 
There are few high‐quality studies of topical treatment for low bac‐ k‐ ka‐ pain. The evidence is inconclusive for most topical treatments. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of topical treat‐ ments for low bak‐ kaa pain. 
Authors' conclusions: 
There were few high quality studies of the effects on pain and function of topical agents for lowback pain, and the evidence was inconclusive. More high quality research is required to determine whether topical treatments are effective for lowbac‐ kka pain.
Herbal medicines for treating acute low back pain
Review question 
What are the effects of herbal medicines for people with acute low‐back pain? 
Background 
Low‐back‐pain is one of the most common reasons why people seek medical care. It can be caused by many different things, such as muscle strain, injury, or a herniated disc. Herbal medicines have been used for centuries to treat pain. They are often used in combination with other treatments, such physiotherapy, exercise, and analgesics. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing herbal medicines with each other or with placebo or no treatment for acute lowback pain. We included trials published up to February 2017. 
Key results 
We found 13 RCTs involving 949 participants. The trials were conducted in China, Germany, India, Iran, Italy, Japan, Korea, and the United States. The studies were small, with only two trials involving more than 100 participants. Most trials had a high risk of bias. 
The following herbs were studied: 
· Capsicum frutescence (C. Frutescense), which contains capsaicin, a chemical that makes chilli peppers hot; 
· Hypericum perforatum (St John's wort); 
· Symphyti officinalis L. root extract (comfry); 
and 
· Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (Danshen). 
We did not find any trials that compared herbal medicines to standard treatments, so we could not determine whether they are effective or not. 
Capsicum fruteceus (C.Frutescenes) reduced pain more effectively than placebo in the short term. However, the evidence was of low quality, so further research is needed. 
Hypericum perforatrum (St. John's Wort) reduced the need for analgesic medication more effectively when compared to placebo. However the evidence for this was of very low quality. 
Symphyti offincinalis root extract reduced pain in the first week after treatment. However there was no difference between the treatment and placebo groups in the second week. 
Salvia miliotrhiza (Dansheng) reduced back pain more when compared with placebo in both the first and second weeks. 
Aromatic lavender oil applied to the skin by acuressure reduced pain intensity more than untreated participants. However this evidence was also of verylow quality."
