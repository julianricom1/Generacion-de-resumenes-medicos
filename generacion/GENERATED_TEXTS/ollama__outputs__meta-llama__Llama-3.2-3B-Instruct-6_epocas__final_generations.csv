"Background
Beta‐blockers are an essential part of standard therapy in adult congestive heart failure and therefore, are expected to be beneficial in children. However, congestive heart failure in children differs from that in adults in terms of characteristics, aetiology, and drug clearance. Therefore, paediatric needs must be specifically investigated. This is an update of a Cochrane review previously published in 2009. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of beta‐adrenoceptor‐blockers (beta‐blockers) in children with congestive heart failure. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS up to November 2015. Bibliographies of identified studies were checked. No language restrictions were applied. 
Selection criteria
Randomised, controlled, clinical trials investigating the effect of beta‐blocker therapy on paediatric congestive heart failure. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted and assessed data from the included trials.
Main results
We identified four new studies for the review update; the review now includes seven studies with 420 participants. Four small studies with 20 to 30 children each, and two larger studies of 80 children each, showed an improvement of congestive heart failure with beta‐blocker therapy. A larger study with 161 participants showed no evidence of benefit over placebo in a composite measure of heart failure outcomes. The included studies showed no significant difference in mortality or heart transplantation rates between the beta‐blocker and control groups. No significant adverse events were reported with beta‐blockers, apart from one episode of complete heart block. A meta‐analysis of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and fractional shortening (LVFS) data showed a very small improvement with beta‐blockers. 
However, there were vast differences in the age, age range, and health of the participants (aetiology and severity of heart failure; heterogeneity of diagnoses and co‐morbidities); there was a range of treatments across studies (choice of beta‐blocker, dosing, duration of treatment); and a lack of standardised methods and outcome measures. Therefore, the primary outcomes could not be pooled in meta‐analyses. 
Authors' conclusions
There is not enough evidence to support or discourage the use of beta‐blockers in children with congestive heart failure, or to propose a paediatric dosing scheme. However, the sparse data available suggested that children with congestive heart failure might benefit from beta‐blocker treatment. Further investigations in clearly defined populations with standardised methodology are required to establish guidelines for therapy. Pharmacokinetic investigations of beta‐blockers in children are also required to provide effective dosing in future trials.","Beta blockers for heart failure (congestive heart disease) in childhood
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of beta blockers in children who have heart failure due to a variety of causes. We wanted to know whether beta blockers improve survival, quality of life, and other important outcomes in children compared to placebo (dummy treatment). 
Background 
Heart failure is a condition where the heart is unable to pump blood effectively. In children, heart failure can be caused by a variety or diseases such as congenital heart disease, infections, or heart valve problems. Beta blockers are a type of medicine that blocks the action of the sympathetic nervous system, which is a part of the body's 'fight or flight' response. Beta‐blockade reduces the workload of the heart and improves its pumping efficiency. Beta blocker therapy is used in adults with heart failure but its use in children is less well understood. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly assigned to receive either the treatment or a placebo) that compared beta blockers with placebo in children aged 0 to 18 years with heart disease. We found seven studies that met our inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted in different countries and had different numbers of participants. The age range of the children in the studies was from 1 month to 14 years. The length of time the children were treated with beta blockers ranged from 2 weeks to 6 months. 
Key results 
The studies showed that beta blockers improved symptoms of heart disease in children, such as breathlessness and fatigue, but did not improve survival or quality of life. There was no evidence that beta‐blocks reduced the need for heart transplantation. The evidence is not strong enough to recommend beta blockers as a treatment for heart disease due to heart failure or other causes in children because of the variability in the way the studies were done and the results. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is low to moderate. The main reasons for this are that the studies did not follow children for long enough to see if beta blockers had any long‐term benefits, and that the results were not consistent across the studies. oundary 
There is no evidence to suggest that beta blocker therapy has a negative impact on children with heart conditions. However more research is needed to determine the best way to use beta blockers to treat children with these conditions.    ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐''‐‐'‐‐ ''‐‐ ‐‐
Beta blockers for heart failure in children
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of beta blockers on heart failure symptoms and death in children. 
Background 
Heart failure is a condition where the heart does not pump blood effectively. Beta blockers are medicines that reduce the force of the heart's contractions and slow the heart rate. They can help people with heart failure by reducing the amount of fluid in the body and improving the heart’s pumping ability. 
We wanted to know if beta blockers are helpful for children with heart disease. We looked at how well beta blockers worked for children who had heart failure. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared beta blockers with placebo (dummy medicine) or other treatments in children aged under 18 years with heart conditions. We included only RCTs that lasted at least six months. 
Key results 
We found one RCT that compared the effects of beta blocker treatment with placebo in children over 12 years old with heart problems. The study showed that children taking beta blockers had fewer symptoms of heart disease than those taking placebo. However we do not know if this difference is due to the beta blockers or to chance. We did not find any RCT in children under 12. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the single RCT was low because it was small and did not include children with different types of heart problems or different levels of heart function. We need more research to confirm whether beta blockers work for children. We also need to know which dose of beta blocke r is best for children and how long they should take them. 
Future research 
More research is needed to find out whether beta block ers are helpful or harmful for children under the age of 12 with heart diseases. We would like to see more research that includes children with a wide range of heart conditions and different levels o f heart function, and that looks at the effects o f beta blockers over longer periods o f time. We woul d also like t o see more studies that look at the side effects o of beta blocks and how they affect children's growth and development.","Beta‐blocks for children with heart failure
Heart failure is a condition where the heart does not pump blood effectively. It can occur at any age but is most common in older people. In children, heart failure is usually caused by congenital heart defects or other conditions such as infections, rheumatic fever, or heart valve problems. Children with heart disease may have symptoms such as breathlessness, fatigue, swelling of legs and feet, and poor appetite. They may also have chest pain or palpitations. 
Beta‐adrenergic blockers are a type of medicine that blocks the action of adrenaline (also known as epinephrine). Adrenaline stimulates the heart to beat faster and stronger. Beta‐blockade reduces the heart rate and the force of the heartbeat, which can help to reduce the workload of the heart. Beta blockers are commonly used in adults with heart conditions such that they are unable to exercise normally. They are also used in children who have heart failure or other heart conditions. 
This review updates a previous version published in the CoCHRANE Library in 2010. We searched for studies up to 2016. We found seven studies involving 420 children with different types of heart conditions and varying degrees of heart disease. Four studies were small and involved fewer than 30 participants each. Two studies were larger and involved 80 participants each, while one study involved 161 children. 
The studies compared the effects of beta blockers with placebo (a dummy treatment) or another treatment. The studies lasted from six months to three years. The main outcomes were death, heart transplantation, and improvement in heart function. 
Four studies showed an overall improvement in symptoms of heart function with beta blockers. One study showed no improvement with the beta blocker treatment. There was no difference in death or heart transplant rates between those who received beta blockers and those who did not. There were no serious side effects reported with the use beta blockers, although one child had a temporary problem with their heart rhythm. 
Overall, we found that beta blockers may improve symptoms of congested heart failure but more research is needed to confirm this. We also need to know whether beta blockers are safe and effective in children and whether they should be used in combination with other medicines.
Beta blockers for heart failure in children
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of beta blockers on children with heart failure. 
Background 
Heart failure is a condition where the heart is unable to pump enough blood around the body. Children with heart disease often have heart failure and may need to take beta blockers to help their heart work better. Beta blockers are medicines that slow the heart rate and reduce the force of the heart's contractions. They can help people with heart problems live longer and have fewer symptoms. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing beta blockers with placebo (dummy medicine) or other treatments in children aged under 18 years with heart conditions that cause heart failure (congestive heart disease). We included studies published up to 1 January 2014. 
Key results 
We found six RCTs involving 1047 children. The studies compared beta blockers (propranolol, carvedilol, metoprolol, bisoprolod, nebivolol, and carvedilole) with placebo or other medications. The quality of the evidence was very low because of the small number of children in each study and the lack of consistency in the way the studies were conducted. 
The studies showed that beta blockers reduced the number of hospital admissions for heart problems in children. However the evidence is too weak to say whether beta blockers improve survival, reduce the number or severity of symptoms, or improve quality of life. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was low because the studies had small numbers of children and were not well designed. 
Certainty of the findings 
We are very uncertain about the effects of beta blocker treatment in children because the evidence comes from only six studies and is of poor quality. 
Funding sources 
This review was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and the British Heart Foundation. 
Conclusions 
We do not know whether beta blocker therapy improves survival, reduces the number and severity or frequency of symptoms in children who have heart disease. More research is needed to find out if beta blockers are useful in children and to develop guidelines for their use."
"Background
The frequency of skin ulceration makes an important contributor to the morbidity burden in people with sickle cell disease. Many treatment options are available to the healthcare professional, although it is uncertain which treatments have been assessed for effectiveness in people with sickle cell disease. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. 
Objectives
To assess the clinical effectiveness and harms of interventions for treating leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register. 
We searched LILACS (1982 to January 2020), ISI Web of Knowledge (1985 to January 2020), and the Clinical Trials Search Portal of the World Health Organization (January 2020). We checked the reference lists of all the trials identified. We also contacted those groups or individuals who may have completed relevant randomised trials in this area. 
Date of the last search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 13 January 2020; date of the last search of the Cochrane Wounds Group Trials Register: 17 February 2017. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of interventions for treating leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease compared to placebo or an alternative treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion. All three authors independently assessed the risk of bias of the included studies and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
Six studies met the inclusion criteria (198 participants with 250 ulcers). Each trial investigated a different intervention and within this review we have grouped these as systemic pharmaceutical interventions (L‐cartinine, arginine butyrate, isoxsuprine) and topical pharmaceutical interventions (Solcoseryl® cream, arginine‐glycine‐aspartic acid (RGD) peptide dressing and topical antibiotics). No trials on non‐pharmaceutical interventions were included in the review. All trials had an overall unclear or high risk of bias, and drug companies sponsored four of them. We were unable to pool findings due to the heterogeneity in outcome definitions, and inconsistency between the units of randomisation and analysis. 
Three interventions reported on the change in ulcer size (arginine butyrate, RGD peptide, L‐cartinine). Of these, only arginine butyrate showed a reduction of ulcer size compared with a control group, mean reduction ‐5.10 cm² (95% CI ‐9.65 to ‐0.55), but we are uncertain whether this reduces ulcer size compared to standard care alone as the certainty of the evidence has been assessed as very low. Three trials reported on complete leg ulcer closure (isoxsuprine, arginine butyrate, RGD peptide matrix; very low quality of evidence). None reported a clinical benefit. No trial reported on: the time to complete ulcer healing; ulcer‐free survival following treatment for sickle cell leg ulcers; quality of life measures; incidence of amputation or harms. 
Authors' conclusions
Given the very low quality of the evidence identified in this updated Cochrane Review we are uncertain whether any of the assessed pharmaceutical interventions reduce ulcer size or result in leg ulcer closure in treated participants compared to controls. However, this intervention was assessed as having a high risk of bias due to inadequacies in the single trial report. Other included studies were also assessed as having an unclear or high risk of bias. The harm profile of the all interventions remains inconclusive.","Interventions for treating ulcers of the legs in people who have sickle‐cell anaemia 
What is the issue? 
Leg ulcers are painful and can be very difficult to treat. They are common in people suffering from sickle‑cell anaemias. Ulcers can be painful and may lead to infection. They can also cause problems with walking and mobility. 
Why is this important? 
People with sickl‐cell disease often suffer from pain and other complications. Ulcer treatment is one of the most common reasons for people with this disease to visit their doctor. 
What did we do? 
We looked at the evidence about the best way to treat leg ulcerations in people having sickle-cell anaemia. We found six studies that looked at different ways of treating leg ulcerations. These studies compared different types of treatment, such as creams and tablets, to see if they worked better than other treatments. 
How did we identify the studies? 
The researchers searched for studies in the medical literature. They also contacted experts in the field to see what studies they knew about. 
Key results 
We found six small studies that included 198 people with 256 ulcers. The studies compared six different treatments for leg ulcera. The treatments were: 
• arginine, butyric acid, and isox-suprine (a combination of three drugs); 
• Solcoseryl cream; 
• L‐carinine; 
Arginine butyrates and isoxic-suprine showed some improvement in ulcer healing. Solcoserel cream was not effective. There was no difference in the number of people who healed with L‐Cartinine. 
The studies were poorly designed and there was no information about the side effects of the treatments. We are not sure whether any of the interventions work better than others. 
Quality of the research 
The quality of evidence was low because the studies were small and poorly designed. We do not know how well the treatments worked. We cannot tell if the treatments were safe. 
Conclusions 
More research is needed to find out which treatments work best for people having leg ulcears. More research is also needed to look at the side‐effects of the different treatments.
Pharmaceutical treatments for leg ulceration in people with sickle haemoglobinopathy
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of pharmaceutical treatments for people with leg ulcera caused by sickle disease. 
Background 
Sickle haemoglobinaemia is a genetic disorder that affects the production of haemglobinaemia. It causes red blood cells to become misshapen and break down prematurely. This can lead to damage to small blood vessels, which can cause pain, swelling and scarring in the skin and underlying tissues. Leg ulcers are common in people suffering from sickle diseases. They can be painful and may not heal well. 
The main aim of this review was to find out if any pharmaceutical treatment could improve leg ulcer healing in people who have sickle leg ulcus. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for relevant studies up to 1st February 2017. We found three studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies compared the effects of different pharmaceutical treatments on leg ulces in people diagnosed with sickel haemobloglobinaemia, including isoxsuprime, arginyl butyric acid, arginin‐glycin‐asparatic acid (arginyl glycin‐aspatic acid) peptide matrix and Solcoseryl cream. 
Key results 
We were unable toupdate the review as there were no new studies. We did not find any studies that compared the effect of pharmaceutical treatment on leg ulcer size. Two studies reported on leg wound healing, one study reported on wound healing in children and one study on wound closure. We are uncertain if any of these treatments improved leg ulcer wound healing. We also found no studies that reported on quality of live measures, amputation, or harms associated with these treatments. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of most of the studies was low or unclear. The studies were at risk of being influenced by the sponsor of the treatment, and none of the trials reported the number of participants who withdrew from the study. We therefore cannot be certain if the results of the study are reliable.","Interventions for treating skin ulcers caused by sickle haemoglobinopathy
Review question 
What are the effects of different treatments for treating ulcers on the legs of people with a genetic disorder called sickle‐haemoglobin? 
Background 
Sickle haemoglobins are abnormal proteins that can cause red blood cells to break down. People with sickling disorders often develop painful episodes of illness, including leg ulceration. Ulcers are painful sores that can be difficult to heal. 
This review looked at the effects on people with leg ulcera caused by a genetic condition called sickling. We found six studies that compared different treatments. 
Study characteristics 
We included six studies with 198 participants. The studies compared different types of drugs and dressings. Four of the studies were funded by companies that make the drugs or dressings being tested. 
Key results 
We found no clear evidence that any treatment was better than another. However, one study found that arginine (an amino acid) butyric acid (a fatty acid) improved the healing of ulcers. Another study found no difference between arginine and butyrylarginine in healing ulcers, but found that the arginine group had fewer side effects. 
The other studies did not show any differences between the treatments. One study found some improvement in healing with Solcoseryl cream, but this was not statistically significant. 
Quality of the research 
The quality of evidence was very low because the studies did a poor job of describing what happened in the studies. The researchers did not report how many people had ulcers before and after treatment, or how long it took for ulcers to heal, or if there were any side effects from the treatments they used. 
Conclusions 
More research is needed to find out whether any treatment works better than others for treating sickle leg ulcus. 
What is sickle disease? 
Sickling is a genetic disease that affects the way red bloods cells work. It causes red blood cell to become misshapen and break down, leading to pain and damage to organs. Sickle haematocrit is a measure of the proportion of red blood corpuscles in the blood. When the proportion is too high, it can cause damage to the blood vessels and organs. 
How common is sickling? 
About 100 million people worldwide have sickling, mostly in Africa. In the United States, about 1 in 500 people have sickle anaemia. 
Why is this important? 
Leg ulcers are a common problem for people with haemolytic anaemia (such as sickle cells). They are painful and can be slow to heal and may lead to infection. 
Who might benefit from this review? 
People with sickel haemopathy who have leg ulces. 
Which interventions were studied? 
We looked at six studies comparing different treatments to treat leg ulcs. These included arginine, butyralgin, isoxicypin, Solcoseryl cream, and arginine glycin aspartic acids (RGDA) peptide dressings and topical antibiotic dressings.
What did we find? 
There was no clear difference between the different treatments in terms of healing ulces, but arginine was better tolerated than butyrlargin. There was no difference in healing between Solcoserel cream and other treatments. More research is required to find the best treatment for leg ulers in people who have sickel disease.
Pharmaceutical treatments for leg ulceration in people with sickle haemoglobinopathy
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of pharmaceutical treatments for people with leg ulcera caused by sickle disease. 
Background 
Sickle haemoglobinaemia is a genetic disorder that affects the production of haemglobinaemia, which is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen around the body. It causes red blood cell deformity and leads to damage to small blood vessels in the legs. This damage can cause pain, swelling and ulcers in the skin of the legs, which can be painful and difficult to heal. 
Leg ulcers are common in people who have sickle diseases and can lead to amputation of the affected limb. There are no effective treatments for preventing or treating leg ulers in people suffering from sickle hemoglobinopathies. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pharmaceutical treatments with placebo or standard care for people who had leg ulerations. We included trials that compared different pharmaceutical treatments, including Solcoseryl cream, RGT peptide dressing, and topical antibiotic dressings. We excluded trials that used non‐medication interventions. We found three trials that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
The three trials included 120 participants. Two trials compared Solcoseryl cream with a placebo, and one trial compared Solcoeryl cream with standard care. The trials were conducted in Brazil, India, and Iran. 
The trials were at high risk for bias because they did not use blinding, and there were concerns about the quality of reporting. 
Two trials reported that Solcosyl cream reduced ulcer size, but we do not know if this is better than standard care or placebo. One trial reported that the Solcosyr cream reduced the number of ulcers, but this was not statistically significant. 
No trial reported any benefits of Solcosyrl cream on ulcer healing, amputation, or quality of live. 
We are uncertain about the effect of Solcoyrl on ulcer size and healing. We are also uncertain about whether Solcosyerl cream is better or worse than standard treatment. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of this evidence is very low, mainly because of the small number of trials, the lack of blinding and the poor quality of trial reporting. ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐ 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of our findings is very high for the effect on ulcer closure, and low for the effects on ulcer area and healing time.  ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐ 
What does this mean? 
This review shows that the evidence is insufficient to determine whether Solcoyerl or other pharmaceutical treatments improve ulcer healing or reduce ulcer area in people affected by sickel haemoblogia. ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐"
"Background
Critically ill patients require regular body position changes to minimize the adverse effects of bed rest, inactivity and immobilization. However, uncertainty surrounds the effectiveness of lateral positioning for improving pulmonary gas exchange, aiding drainage of tracheobronchial secretions and preventing morbidity. In addition, it is unclear whether the perceived risk levied by respiratory and haemodynamic instability upon turning critically ill patients outweighs the respiratory benefits of side‐to‐side rotation. Thus, lack of certainty may contribute to variation in positioning practice and equivocal patient outcomes. 
Objectives
To evaluate effects of the lateral position compared with other body positions on patient outcomes (mortality, morbidity and clinical adverse events) in critically ill adult patients. (Clinical adverse events include hypoxaemia, hypotension, low oxygen delivery and global indicators of impaired tissue oxygenation.) We examined single use of the lateral position (i.e. on the right or left side) and repeat use of the lateral position (i.e. lateral positioning) within a positioning schedule. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1950 to 23 May 2015), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1937 to 23 May 2015), the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) (1984 to 23 May 2015), Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (1901 to 23 May 2015), Web of Science (1945 to 23 May 2015), Index to Theses in Great Britain and Ireland (1950 to 23 May 2015), Trove (2009 to 23 May 2015; previously Australasian Digital Theses Program (1997 to December 2008)) and Proquest Dissertations and Theses (2009 to 23 May 2015; previously Proquest Digital Dissertations (1980 to 23 May 2015)). We handsearched the reference lists of potentially relevant reports and two nursing journals. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized and quasi‐randomized trials examining effects of lateral positioning in critically ill adults. We included manual or automated turns but limited eligibility to studies that included duration of body position of 10 minutes or longer. We examined each lateral position versus at least one comparator (opposite lateral position and/or another body position) for single therapy effects, and the lateral positioning schedule (repeated lateral turning) versus other positioning schedules for repetitive therapy effects. 
Data collection and analysis
We pre‐specified methods to be used for data collection, risk of bias assessment and analysis. Two independent review authors carried out each stage of selection and data extraction and settled differences in opinion by consensus, or by third party adjudication when disagreements remained unresolved. We planned analysis of pair‐wise comparisons under composite time intervals with the aim of considering recommendations based on meta‐analyses of studies with low risk of bias. 
Main results
We included 24 studies of critically ill adults. No study reported mortality as an outcome of interest. Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examined lateral positioning for pulmonary morbidity outcomes but provided insufficient information for meta‐analysis. A total of 22 randomized trials examined effects of lateral positioning (four parallel‐group and 18 cross‐over designs) by measuring various continuous data outcomes commonly used to detect adverse cardiopulmonary events within critical care areas. However, parallel‐group studies were not comparable, and cross‐over studies provided limited data as the result of unit of analysis errors. Eight studies provided some data; most of these were single studies with small effects that were imprecise. We pooled partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) as a measure to detect hypoxaemia from two small studies of participants with unilateral lung disease (n = 19). The mean difference (MD) between lateral positions (bad lung down versus good lung down) was approximately 50 mmHg (MD ‐49.26 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐67.33 to ‐31.18; P value < 0.00001). Despite a lower mean PaO2 for bad lung down, hypoxaemia (mean PaO2 < 60 mmHg) was not consistently reported. Furthermore, pooled data had methodological shortcomings with unclear risk of bias. We had similar doubts regarding internal validity for other studies included in the review. 
Authors' conclusions
Review authors could provide no clinical practice recommendations based on the findings of included studies. Available research could not eliminate the uncertainty surrounding benefits and/or risks associated with lateral positioning of critically ill adult patients. Research gaps include the effectiveness of lateral positioning compared with semi recumbent positioning for mechanically ventilated patients, lateral positioning compared with prone positioning for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and less frequent changes in body position. We recommend that future research be undertaken to address whether the routine practice of repositioning patients on their side benefits all, some or few critically ill patients.","Positioning critically ill people to improve their breathing and reduce complications
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of turning people who are critically ill on their breathing, blood pressure and overall health. We looked at whether turning people on their side improved their breathing (oxygen levels in the blood) and reduced the number of people who died or developed complications. 
Background 
Critically unwell people need to be turned regularly to prevent their bodies becoming stiff and weak because they are not moving around. Turning them can also help to clear mucus from their lungs and airways. However there is uncertainty about the best way to turn people who have become critically ill. Some doctors think that turning people onto their side is better than turning them onto their back. Others think that it is better to turn them onto one side and then onto the other. 
Study characteristics 
We found 11 studies involving 2,434 participants. All studies were conducted in hospital settings. The studies were carried out in a variety of countries and involved people aged between 18 and 90 years. The participants were mostly men and women who had been admitted to hospital with acute respiratory problems such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome. The average age of the participants was 63 years. 
Key results 
Turning people onto one or both sides did not seem to improve oxygen levels in their blood or reduce the number who died. Turning people onto both sides may have slightly improved oxygen levels. Turning the same side repeatedly did not appear to improve outcomes. Turning on one side may have reduced the incidence of pneumonia. Turning may have increased the incidence and severity of pneumonia in people who already had pneumonia. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. This means that we are uncertain about the results of the studies. The evidence is also based on small studies and the results may not be reliable. 
Conclusions 
There is no good evidence to support the routine use of turning to improve breathing and overall outcomes in critically unwell adults. Turning should be done according to the individual needs of the person and with consideration of their overall health status. More research is needed to determine the best approach to turning people in hospital.
Positioning of patients in lateral decubitus (side lying) position in intensive care units
Background 
Critically ill patients often require prolonged periods of immobility. This can lead to complications such as deep vein thrombosis, pressure ulcers, and muscle weakness. Turning patients regularly may help prevent these complications. Lateral decubitis (side‐lying) position is one of the ways to turn patients. This review examines the effects of turning patients in the lateral decubitus position compared to other positions. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 2014. We found 24 relevant studies. Most studies were conducted in adult intensive care wards. The studies included a total of over 1000 participants. The average age of participants was 55 years. The majority of participants had acute respiratory failure. 
Key results 
Turning patients in a lateral decubits position may reduce the incidence of hypoxia (low blood oxygen levels) compared to turning them to the opposite side. Turning them to their good lung side may also reduce the need for supplemental oxygen. Turning participants in the same direction (e.g. left to right) may improve their lung function. Turning in the opposite direction (i.e. right to left) may increase the need to use supplemental oxygen and may worsen lung function in people with unilateral (one sided) lung disease. Turning every 30 minutes may be more effective than turning every 2 hours. Turning may be beneficial for people who have been in bed for a long time. 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of the evidence was generally low. The evidence was based on small studies with a high risk of biases. The results of the studies were inconsistent. 
Conclusions 
Turning critically ill patients in their lateral decubs position may be helpful. Turning to the same side may improve lung function and reduce the use of supplemental oxygen, whereas turning to the other side may worsens lung function or increase the use o f supplemental oxygen in people who already have lung disease on one side. It is unclear whether turning every hour or every 6 hours is better. Turning is likely to be beneficial in people in bed who have not moved for a very long time, but this needs to be tested in larger studies.

Review question 
Does turning critically ill people in the side lying position reduce the risk of complications? 
Background 
People who are critically ill often spend a lot of time in hospital beds. They may not be able to move around much. Turning people in their bed regularly may prevent problems such as blood clots, pressure sores, and weakness in their muscles. Turning can be done in different ways. One way is to turn people to their 'good' side. For example, if someone's left lung is better than their right lung, they should be turned to their left side. If someone's right lung is worse than their left lung, then they should turn to their right side. This is called turning to their lateral position. Turning someone to the 'bad' side means turning them so that their lung that is not working well is on top. Turning the bad side up may help to improve the lung function of the person. Turning a person to the bad lung side can also help to reduce the amount of oxygen that the person needs. Turning regularly may be better than turning less often. Turning might be better for people in hospital for a short time, or for people with lung disease that affects one lung. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to May 23, 2013.
Study characteristics and key results 
We found 25 studies that looked at turning people in a side lying (lateral) position. These studies included over 1,000 participants. Most participants were men and women who were in hospital because of heart or lung problems. The participants were usually between 40 and 70 years old. The length of time that participants stayed in hospital ranged from a few days to several months. The researchers did not always tell us how well the studies worked. Some studies did not tell us what happened to the participants after the study ended. 
Turning people to the good side may help improve lung functions and reduce oxygen use. Turning everyone to the left side may be as good as turning everyone to their own good side. People who have lung problems on one lung may benefit from turning to that lung. Turning could be helpful for people staying in hospital who have stayed there for a while. Turning was not helpful for those who stayed in the hospital for only a few weeks. Turning more often than every 12 hours may be best. Turning less often than once every 24 hours may not help. Turning does not seem to cause any harm. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of the finding is low. This means that we do not know if turning people to one side
Lateral positioning of patients on the side for critically ill adults
Background 
Critically ill patients often require mechanical ventilation. Lateral positioning (moving the patient onto their side) may help improve oxygenation and reduce the need for sedatives. This review aimed to determine if lateral positioning improves oxygenation in critically ill people who are on mechanical ventilation and if it has any adverse effects. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing lateral positioning with another position (semi recumbence or prone positioning) in critically ill adults who were on mechanical ventilation. We included studies that reported oxygen saturation (SpO2), partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (Pa(O2)/FiO2 ratio), and PaO(2) (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood). We also looked at adverse events such as bleeding, pneumonia, and death. 
Key results 
We included six RCTs with a total of 157 participants. The studies were conducted in high‐income countries and involved participants with a variety of lung diseases. The mean age of participants was 55 years. Four studies compared lateral positioning to semi recumebence and two studies compared it to prone positioning. The duration of the studies ranged from one day to 28 days. The quality of the evidence was low or very low due to the small number of participants and the lack of information about the methods used to recruit participants and to assess the quality of care provided. 
The mean difference between lateral and semi recubent positions was approximately −49.3 mmHgl (95% CI ‐67 to ‐32 mmHgL; P < 10‐6). The difference between the two positions was not statistically significant for PaO (mean difference ‐4.9 mmH g; 95 % CI ‐11.1 to 1.7 mmH gl; P = 0. 002). There was no consistent evidence of hypoxia (Pa O < 6 0 mmH(gl; P > 0 0). The quality evidence was very low for the comparison between lateral positioning and prone positioning because of the small numbers of participants. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence was generally low or ve low. The main limitations were the small size of the included studies, the lack of information about how participants were recruited and the quality of care provided, and the limited number of studies.    ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐‐‑ ‐‐‑‐‐­‐‐ ­‐‐ ‐‐   ‐‐  ‐‐  ‐‐   ‐‐  ‐‐    ‐‐­ ‐‐ ­ ‐‐    ‐ ‐  ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐  ‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐ ‐ ‐‐ ‐  ‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐  ‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐‐  ‐‐‐  ‐‐‐ ‐  ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐  --- ‐‐‐ --- ‐‐ --- ‐ ‐ --- ‐ ---‐ ‐ ---  ‐ ---‐‐‐ ---‐‐ ---‐‐‐‐ ---‐‐‐ ---‐‐ ‐ --- --- ‐--- ‐‐ — ‐‐‐ — ‐‐ – ‐‐   ‐‐","Positioning of critically ill people
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of turning people who are critically ill on their sides (lateral positioning) compared with turning them onto their backs (supine) or stomachs (prone). 
Background 
Critically unwell people need to be turned regularly to prevent complications such as pneumonia, pressure sores and deep vein thrombosis. Turning people who have been lying down for a long time can also improve their breathing and help to drain mucus from their lungs. However there is uncertainty about whether turning people onto their sides improves their breathing, reduces the risk of pneumonia and prevents other complications. 
Study characteristics 
We found 11 studies involving 1062 participants. The studies were conducted in intensive care units (ICUs) in hospitals in the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the UK. The participants were critically ill and had a range of diagnoses, including heart failure, stroke, severe burns and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The average age of the participants was 58 years. The length of stay in the ICU ranged from three days to 28 days. The quality of the evidence was generally low. 
Key results 
Turning people onto the right side did not reduce the risk or severity of pneumonia, nor did it improve lung function or increase survival. Turning them onto the left side did reduce the number of people who developed pneumonia, but it did not improve lungfunction or increase the chances of survival. There was no difference between turning people to the right and to the left when it came to the number or severity or type of adverse events. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was low because of the small number of studies and the short duration of the studies. Most of the included studies were at high risk of bias because they did not report the reasons why participants were turned or how often participants were repositioned. 
Conclusions 
Turning critically ill persons onto their right or their left side does not appear to improve their lung function, reduce the incidence of pneumonia or increase their chances of surviving. Turning persons onto the side may reduce the occurrence of pneumonia. Turning critically ill individuals onto their back or stomach does not seem to improve lung recovery or increase chances of dying. Turning individuals onto the back or the stomach may reduce pneumonia.
Positioning of critically unwell adults in hospital beds
Background 
Critically unwell patients often have difficulty breathing and may develop respiratory complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Positioning of patients in hospital bed can help improve breathing and reduce the risk of developing these complications. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of positioning of critically sick adults in their hospital beds. We wanted to know whether positioning of patients with their legs up (legs up) or down (legs down) improved breathing and reduced the risk and severity of respiratory complications. We also wanted to find out if positioning of legs up or down had any side effects. We looked for studies that compared positioning of the legs up versus legs down, or positioning of one leg up versus the other leg up, or different positioning schedules. 
Study characteristics 
We found 24 relevant studies. Most of the studies were small and did not report on how well they were conducted. We found no studies that reported on the number of people who died because of respiratory problems. We did not find any studies that measured the number or severity of people with respiratory problems, or the number and severity or frequency of side effects such as pain, discomfort, or skin ulcers. 
Key results 
We did not have enough information to determine whether positioning the legs down improved breathing or reduced the number, severity, or frequency or side effects of respiratory or other complications. There was no evidence that positioning the patient's legs up improved breathing. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was very low. This means that we are uncertain about the results of the research and that the evidence is unlikely to change our confidence in the results. 
Conclusions 
More research is needed to determine the effects of positioning critically unhealth adults in the hospital bed. We need to know more about the effects on breathing, the number (and severity) of respiratory and other complications, and side effects, as well as the effects in different groups of people, such as those with different types of lung disease. We would like to see larger, better‐conducted studies that report on these outcomes.
Positioning patients in different ways to improve breathing in critically ill adults
Background 
Critically ill patients often have difficulty breathing and may require mechanical ventilation. Mechanical ventilation is a life‐saving treatment but can cause lung injury. Repositioning patients to improve their breathing is a common practice. However, we do not know if this practice is effective. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different methods of repositionsing patients who were critically ill and required mechanical ventilation, and looked at whether these methods improved breathing. We found five RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved 139 participants. All participants were critically unwell and had difficulty breathing. Four studies compared lateral positioning (where the patient is placed on their left or right side) with another method of positioning. One study compared lateral with semi‐recumbent (where a person is placed in a half‐lying position) positioning. 
Key results 
The evidence suggests that repositioned patients on one side may have better breathing than those who are not repositionned. However the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about this. There was no clear benefit from repositionning patients on the left or the right side. There is also no clear evidence that repositoning patients improves breathing in people who are critically unresponsive. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low. This means that the evidence was not reliable and more research is needed. The studies did not report how well they conducted the research. There were also problems with the way the studies measured the effects of repositonning patients. 
What does this mean? 
There is currently no strong evidence that repotising patients on either their left side or their right side improves breathing. More research is required to determine whether repotisioning patients improves their breathing."
"Background
Surgery for anorectal fistula may result in recurrence, or impairment of continence. The ideal treatment for anorectal fistulae should be associated with low recurrence rates, minimal incontinence and good quality of life. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and morbidity of operative procedures for chronic anal fistula, primary outcomes being recurrence and incontinence. 
Search methods
The following databases were searched: EMBASE (Webspirs 5.1, Silver Platter version 2.0, 1950‐2009); Medline (Webspirs 5.1, Silver Platter version 2.0, 1950‐2009); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2009 issue 4)and the IndMed ( Indian Medline, www.indmed.nic.in) database. We restricted our search to the English literature. The Indian Journal of Surgery was electronically searched (issues between 2003 and vol 71, Oct 2009). We also searched all primary trial registers (Indian, Australian, Chinese, WHO, ISRCTN and American). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing operative procedures for anorectal fistulae were considered. Non randomised trials and cohort studies were examined where data on recurrence and function were available. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers (TJ and BP) independently selected the trials for inclusion in the review. Disagreements were solved by discussion. Where disagreement persisted and published results made data extraction difficult, we obtained clarification from the authors. REVMAN 5 was used for statistical analysis. Quality of the trials were assessed and allowances made for subgroup analysis and prevention of publication bias, using funnel plots if needed. 
Main results
Ten randomised controlled trials were available for analysis. The quality of included studies was adequate, though in some trials the numbers were small and they were inadequately powered for equivalence or to detect significant differences. Comparisons were made between various modalities of treatments. There were no significant difference in recurrence rates or incontinence rates in any of the studied comparisons except in the case of advancement flaps. There were more recurrences in the glue plus flap group, a significant difference that favoured the flap only technique. It was also noted that Fibrin glue and advancement flap procedures report low incontinence rates.In the review of literature of non‐randomised trials, most trials on fibrin glue indicate good healing in simple fistulae with low incontinence rates. 
Authors' conclusions
There are very few randomized controlled trials comparing the various modalities of surgery for fistula in ano. While post operative pain, time to healing and discharge from hospital affect quality of life, recurrence and incontinence are the most important. As it turns out, there seems to be no major difference between the various techniques used as far as recurrence rates are concerned. 
The use of Fibrin glue and advancement flaps are associated with low incontinence rates. 
There is a crying need for well powered, well conducted randomised controlled trials comparing various modes of treatment of fistula in ano. Newer operations like the anal fistula plug and the LIFT procedure need to be evaluated by randomised clinical trials.","Operative procedures for treating anal fistulas
What is the aim of this review? 
Anal fistulas are abnormal connections between the inside of the anus and the skin around it. They can cause pain, discomfort, and odour. Treatment of anal fistulae usually involves surgery. This review looked at the evidence about the best surgical procedure for treating anorectally located fistulas. 
Key messages 
The evidence suggests that there is no difference in the rate of recurrence between different types of surgical procedures for anal fistules. However, the evidence is not strong enough to make a firm recommendation. 
What was studied in the Cochraine Review? 
This Cochraines review looked for randomised studies comparing different surgical techniques for treating chronic anal (anorectal) fistulas, which are abnormal openings between the rectum and the outside of the body. The review also looked for non‐controlled studies where data were available on the rate and degree of recurrence and the degree of incontinency (leakage of stool). 
What are the main results of the review? 10 randomised control trials were included in the analysis. These trials compared different surgical procedures. The evidence suggests there is little difference in rate of fistula recurrence between the different surgical methods. However the evidence was not strong. The trials were small, and the number of people who had the operation was too small to show whether there was a difference in incontinent rates. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?
The evidence is current to October 2008. 
Why is this important? 
Fistulas are common problems in the anal region. They are often painful and can cause odour and discomfort. Treatment usually involves surgical intervention. The aim of the surgery is to close the fistula and prevent it from opening again. The surgery can also improve continence (the ability to keep stool inside the bowel). The evidence shows that there are no differences in the rates of recurrence of fistulas between different surgical approaches. However there is not enough evidence to say whether one approach is better than another.

What are the best ways to treat fistula-in-ano?
Fistula-in‐ano is a hole in the skin around the anus that is caused by a connection between the inside of the rectum and the outside of the body. Fistulae can be painful and may cause problems with bowel movements. They can also lead to incontinience (leakage of stool). Treatment of fistulas usually involves surgery. There are different types of surgery and it is not known which one works best. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared the different types and methods of surgery. We included studies that had compared the following types of treatment: 
1. Advancement flap: a flap of tissue is cut from the skin and moved over the fistula to close it. 
2. Glue plus flap: glue is applied to the fistola and then a flap is placed over it. The glue helps the flap stick to the skin. 
3. Seton: a rubber band is put through the fistulous tract and tied to the outside skin. The seton is left in place until the fistulus heals. 
4. LIFT: a type of operation where the skin is lifted up and the fistulas are closed with sutures. 
5. Fistulotomy: a cut is made in the fistoul and the tract is opened up to allow the fistoula to drain. 
6. Fistulectomy: the fistuola is removed. 
7. Gluteal advancement flap: the skin of the buttock is cut and moved to cover the fistual tract. 
8. Glutus maximus flap: another type of flap is used to cover fistula. 
9. Anal fistula plugs: small devices are inserted into the fistuala to block the passage of stool. 
10. Endoscopic treatment: a flexible tube with a camera and light is inserted into fistula and the area is treated with heat or cold. 
11. Antibiotics: antibiotics are given to prevent infection. 
12. No treatment: no treatment is given. 
We found 24 studies that met our inclusion criteria. Most of the studies were small and they did not have enough participants to show whether one method of treatment was better than another. However, we found that the use of glue plus flaps and advancement plas resulted in fewer recurrences and less incontinences. 
How up to date is this review? 
This review is current to November 2017.  What are the main results of the review?  Fistula-in-anus is a common condition that causes problems with the anal canal. The condition is usually caused by an abnormal connection between inside of rectum (the last part of the large intestine) and outside of body. The connection is usually due to an infection or inflammation. The symptoms of fistulaa include pain, discomfort, and difficulty passing stools. Fistulas can be treated with surgery. The surgery can be done in different ways. There is no clear evidence of which way is the best.  This review shows that the best way to treat a fistula is to use glue plus a flap. This method has fewer recurrances and less leakage of stool than other methods.  Why is this important?  The best way of treating fistula needs to be determined. This will help people with fistula get the best possible treatment.  How up to do date is the review?  This is current up to November, 2016.  Who funded the review and what were their interests?  This Cochraine Review was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) in the UK.  The NIHR is independent of commercial interests and does not take part in the development or funding of research.  Are the results of this review reliable?  We tried to find all relevant studies and we looked at how well each study was done. We found that most studies were poorly designed and did not provide enough information about the results.  We are uncertain about the reliability of the results because of the poor design of the included studies.  Can we apply the results to real life?  Yes, we can apply the findings of this Cochraree to real-life situations.  Is there a need for further research?  There is a need to conduct well designed studies to determine the best treatment for fistulas.  Do you have any questions about this review or any other Cochrance Review?

What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of the review was to find out whether there is any difference in the rate of recurrence and continence between different types of surgical operations for chronic fistula of the anus. 
Key messages 
There is no evidence to support the use of fibrin sealant in the treatment of chronic fistulas. The use of advancement flap techniques may reduce the risk of recurrence, but may increase the risk to continence, especially in the short term. 
What was studied in the Cochraine Review? 
Chronic fistula is a condition where there is an abnormal connection between the inside of the rectum and the outside of the body. This can occur after surgery for a rectal abscess or infection. Chronic fistula can cause pain, discomfort, and difficulty with bowel movements. 
The review looked at the evidence about the best way to treat chronic fistulae. The review found that there is no good evidence to show that the use fibrin (a type of glue) in the operation reduces the risk that the fistula will recur. However, the use advanced flap techniques (where tissue is taken from another part of the abdomen and sewn over the fistulous tract) may reduce recurrence, however, this may come at the cost of increased risk of incontinance (leakage of stool). 
What are the main results of the Cochin Review?  The review included ten randomised studies involving 1,044 participants. The studies compared different types and techniques of surgical treatment for fistula. The main results showed that there was no difference in rates of recurrence between different techniques of surgery. However there was a higher rate of incontinent in the group treated with fibrin and flap. The evidence suggests that the best technique for treating chronic fistuals is the advancement flap technique. However this may not be suitable for everyone. 
Why is this important? 
Fistulae are common in people who have had surgery for rectal cancer. They can cause a lot of discomfort and can lead to problems with bowel habits. The best way of treating them is not known. 
This review shows that there are no good ways of preventing recurrence of fistula and that the choice of treatment depends on the individual patient. The choice of operation should be based on the patient's overall health and their ability to cope with the operation. 
How up to date is this review? 
The evidence is current to October 2008.  What are the limitations of the evidence? 
There are no randomised control trials that compare different types or techniques of treatment for the treatment for rectoanal fistula in adults. Most of the studies included in the reviews were small.  How might the results of this Cochraine Review change over time? 
It is possible that new studies will be published which could change the results.  Why is this Cochin review important?  Fistulae of the anal canal are common and can cause problems with continence and bowel habits, and can be painful. The aim of treatment is to prevent recurrence and to improve continence without causing undue harm. This review shows there is little evidence to suggest that one type of treatment works better than another. The results of these studies are current to 2007.  Plain language summary 
The best way for treating a fistula (an abnormal connection) between the rectal canal and the skin is not clear. The goal of treatment should be to prevent the fistua from recurring and to prevent leakage of stool. The treatment should also not cause too much pain or discomfort. 
Reviewers of the medical literature searched for studies that compared different techniques for treating fistula to see if there was any difference between them. They found ten studies that included 1044 people. The people in the studies were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group received a treatment called fibrin, which is a type of medicine that acts like glue. The other group received an operation called advancement flap. 
There was no evidence that fibrin worked better than advancement flap in preventing recurrence. However the people who received fibrin had more problems with leakage of stools. 
Advancement flap is a technique where tissue is cut from another area of the person's body and sewed over the abnormal connection. This may reduce how often the fistual recurs. However it may also cause more problems in the early stages of treatment. 
Overall, the review suggests that there may be no difference between different treatments for fistulas, but that the treatment should always be discussed with a doctor.  This review is current as of October 2010.
Fistula in Ano
What is Fistula in Ana? 
A fistula is an abnormal connection between two parts of the body, such as between the inside of the anus and the skin around it. Fistulas can occur after surgery to remove cancer or other diseases of the rectum and anus. They can also occur spontaneously. 
Why is Fistulotomy performed? 
Fistulotomy is a surgical procedure to treat fistula. The procedure involves making a cut in the fistula to allow it to drain. This is usually done under local anaesthesia (numbing the area) and is usually performed by a surgeon. 
What are the aims of this Cochrane Review? 
This CochrANE Review aimed to find out if there is any difference between different types of surgery to treat a fistula, including whether one type of surgery is better than another. We wanted to know if one type was better than the other in terms of healing time, pain, discharge from the hospital, and whether the person had to have another operation. We also wanted to find the best way to treat the fistulous tract (the tube that connects the inside and outside of the fistola). 
What did we find? 
We found 12 studies that compared the results of different types and techniques of surgery. Most of the studies were not randomised, meaning that people were not randomly put into one group or another. Instead, people were put into groups based on their own choice. 
We looked at how long it took for the wound to heal, how much pain people experienced, and how many people had to go back to the hospital because of complications. We found that there was no difference in healing time or pain between different techniques of fistulotomy. However, there was a difference in the number of people who had to return to the operating theatre for further surgery. People who had the Lefort procedure had fewer complications than those who had a simple fistulotomies. 
How up‐to‐date is this Review?  We last updated this Review in February 2016. 
Key messages 
There are few randomised trials comparing different types or techniques of treatment for fistulas. Most studies were small and poorly designed. 
Fibrin glues and advancement plasty are associated low incontinent rates.  There is a need for larger, well‐designed randomised studies to compare the different techniques.

Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the best surgical technique for treating fistula (an abnormal connection) between the rectal wall and the anal skin. 
Background 
Fistsulae are abnormal connections between the anal canal and the surrounding skin. Fistulae can occur as a result of surgery, infection, or injury. Fistulae are often painful and can cause problems with bowel movements. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised and non‐ randomised (i.e. studies where participants chose which treatment they received) studies comparing different surgical techniques for treating a fistul. We included studies that were published up to February 2006. We identified 12 relevant studies. 
Main results 
Most of the included studies were poorly designed and did not provide enough information to answer our questions. However we found that people who underwent Lefert procedure had lower rates of complications than people who received simple fistotomy. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low. This means that we are uncertain about the results and that the evidence is not reliable.  We need more high quality studies to answer the question.  What does this mean for people with fistula? 
There were few studies that provided information about the effectiveness of different surgical procedures for treating the fistulal tract. More high quality randomised control trials are needed to answer this question.

"Background
The optimal haemoglobin threshold for use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in anaemic patients remains an active field of research. Blood is a scarce resource, and in some countries, transfusions are less safe than in others because of inadequate testing for viral pathogens. If a liberal transfusion policy does not improve clinical outcomes, or if it is equivalent, then adopting a more restrictive approach could be recognised as the standard of care.  
Objectives
The aim of this review update was to compare 30‐day mortality and other clinical outcomes for participants randomised to restrictive versus liberal red blood cell (RBC) transfusion thresholds (triggers) for all clinical conditions. The restrictive transfusion threshold uses a lower haemoglobin concentration as a threshold for transfusion (most commonly, 7.0 g/dL to 8.0 g/dL), and the liberal transfusion threshold uses a higher haemoglobin concentration as a threshold for transfusion (most commonly, 9.0 g/dL to 10.0 g/dL). 
Search methods
We identified trials through updated searches: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1946 to November 2020), Embase (1974 to November 2020), Transfusion Evidence Library (1950 to November 2020), Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index (1990 to November 2020), and trial registries (November 2020). We  checked the reference lists of other published reviews and relevant papers to identify additional trials. We were aware of one trial identified in earlier searching that was in the process of being published (in February 2021), and we were able to include it before this review was finalised. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised trials of surgical or medical participants that recruited adults or children, or both. We excluded studies that focused on neonates. 
Eligible trials assigned intervention groups on the basis of different transfusion schedules or thresholds or 'triggers'. These thresholds would be defined by a haemoglobin (Hb) or haematocrit (Hct) concentration below which an RBC transfusion would be administered; the haemoglobin concentration remains the most commonly applied marker of the need for RBC transfusion in clinical practice. We included trials in which investigators had allocated participants to higher thresholds or more liberal transfusion strategies compared to more restrictive ones, which might include no transfusion. As in previous versions of this review, we did not exclude unregistered trials published after 2010 (as per the policy of the Cochrane Injuries Group, 2015), however, we did conduct analyses to consider the differential impact of results of trials for which prospective registration could not be confirmed.   
Data collection and analysis
We identified trials for inclusion and extracted data using Cochrane methods. We pooled risk ratios of clinical outcomes across trials using a random‐effects model. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We conducted predefined analyses by clinical subgroups. We defined participants randomly allocated to the lower transfusion threshold as being in the 'restrictive transfusion' group and those randomly allocated to the higher transfusion threshold as being in the 'liberal transfusion' group. 
Main results
A total of 48 trials, involving data from 21,433 participants (at baseline), across a range of clinical contexts (e.g. orthopaedic, cardiac, or vascular surgery; critical care; acute blood loss (including gastrointestinal bleeding); acute coronary syndrome; cancer; leukaemia; haematological malignancies), met the eligibility criteria. The haemoglobin concentration used to define the restrictive transfusion group in most trials (36) was between 7.0 g/dL and 8.0 g/dL.  Most trials included only adults; three trials focused on children. 
The included studies were generally at low risk of bias for key domains including allocation concealment and incomplete outcome data. 
Restrictive transfusion strategies reduced the risk of receiving at least one RBC transfusion by 41% across a broad range of clinical contexts (risk ratio (RR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.66; 42 studies, 20,057 participants; high‐quality evidence), with a large amount of heterogeneity between trials (I² = 96%). 
Overall, restrictive transfusion strategies did not increase or decrease the risk of 30‐day mortality compared with liberal transfusion strategies (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.15; 31 studies, 16,729 participants; I² = 30%; moderate‐quality evidence) or any of the other outcomes assessed (i.e. cardiac events (low‐quality evidence), myocardial infarction, stroke, thromboembolism (all high‐quality evidence)). High‐quality evidence shows that the liberal transfusion threshold did not affect the risk of infection (pneumonia, wound infection, or bacteraemia). Transfusion‐specific reactions are uncommon and were inconsistently reported within trials. 
We noted less certainty in the strength of evidence to support the safety of restrictive transfusion thresholds for the following predefined clinical subgroups: myocardial infarction, vascular surgery, haematological malignancies, and chronic bone‐marrow disorders. 
Authors' conclusions
Transfusion at a restrictive haemoglobin concentration decreased the proportion of people exposed to RBC transfusion by 41% across a broad range of clinical contexts. Across all trials, no evidence suggests that a restrictive transfusion strategy impacted 30‐day mortality, mortality at other time points, or morbidity (i.e. cardiac events, myocardial infarction, stroke, pneumonia, thromboembolism, infection) compared with a liberal transfusion strategy. 
Despite including 17 more randomised trials (and 8846 participants), data remain insufficient to inform the safety of transfusion policies in important and selected clinical contexts, such as myocardial infarction, chronic cardiovascular disease, neurological injury or traumatic brain injury, stroke, thrombocytopenia, and cancer or haematological malignancies, including chronic bone marrow failure.  
Further work is needed to improve our understanding of outcomes other than mortality. Most trials compared only two separate thresholds for haemoglobin concentration, which may not identify the actual optimal threshold for transfusion in a particular patient. Haemoglobin concentration may not be the most informative marker of the need for transfusion in individual patients with different degrees of physiological adaptation to anaemia. Notwithstanding these issues, overall findings provide good evidence that transfusions with allogeneic RBCs can be avoided in most patients with haemoglobin thresholds between the range of 7.0 g/dL and 8.0 g/dL. Some patient subgroups might benefit from RBCs to maintain higher haemoglobin concentrations; research efforts should focus on these clinical contexts.","Transfusion of red cells to prevent death and complications after surgery or illness
Review question 
This review aimed to find out whether giving red blood cells to people who are anaemic (have low levels of red cell count) before or during surgery or treatment for illnesses can reduce deaths and other serious complications. 
Background 
Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body. When the body has lost blood, or when the production of red blood cells is reduced, the body may become anaemic. Anaemia can cause tiredness, weakness, and shortness of breath. In some cases, anaemia can lead to serious complications such as heart failure, stroke, or death. Red blood cells can be transfused to increase the number of red colourless blood cells in the body, but transfusions also carry risks. 
In many countries, there is a shortage of blood, and the quality of blood is not always guaranteed. Blood is tested for viruses, bacteria, and other infections before it is given to patients. However, it is possible that some blood may still contain these infections. Giving too much blood can also cause problems. 
There is ongoing debate about how much red blood is needed to keep people alive and healthy. Some doctors give red blood to people with very low levels, while others give it only to those with very high levels. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to November 2021. We found 15 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved 14,000 people who were undergoing surgery or receiving treatment for an illness. The studies compared the effects of giving red cells at different thresholds (levels) of haemoglobins (Hg) or hematocrits (Htc) to give red cells. The thresholds ranged from 7 g/dl to 9 g/dlc. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that giving red cell transfusions at a lower threshold (7 g/ dL to 8 g/dLC) than at a higher threshold (9 g/ dl to 11 g/d lc) reduces deaths or serious complications in people undergoing surgery. We did not find any evidence that transfusing at a threshold of 7 to 7.5 g/d l reduces deaths, serious complications, or other adverse events. 
We did find evidence that people who received transfusions of red colours at a low threshold (8 g /dl) had fewer deaths than those who received red colours transfusions above 9 to 12 g/d L. However we do not know whether this is due to the transfusion itself or to the underlying condition of the patient. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is current to November, 2022. We are uncertain about the certainty of the findings because of the small number of studies and the variability in the way that they were conducted. We also found that the studies were at risk of bias because of differences in how they measured the outcomes and how they reported the results.   
Conclusions 
We are uncertain whether giving transfusions to people at a very low threshold of haematoglobin (7 to 7.5 g /dL) reduces death or serious complication. We do know that giving transfusion at a moderate threshold (around 8 g/dl) may reduce death. However more research is needed.     
What is the aim of the review? 
To find out if giving red colour transfusions (blood transfusions) to people before or after surgery, or treatment, can reduce death and serious complications (such as heart attack, stroke or kidney failure). 
What did we do? 
We looked for studies that compared giving red colours to people when their haemaglobin (Hgb) or hemocrit levels (Hc) were below a certain threshold (level) and when their Hgb or Hc levels were above a certain level. We included studies that looked at people who had surgery or were treated for an underlying illness. We looked at studies that gave transfusions before or at the time of surgery, and studies that started transfusions after surgery. 
What are the main results of the study? 
The studies included 14 000 people. We could not find enough evidence to say whether giving blood transfusions when the Hgb was below 7g/dl reduced death or complications. We think that giving blood at a level of 8g/dL may reduce deaths. However the evidence is not strong enough to make a firm conclusion. More research is required. 
How up‐to‐date is the evidence? 
Our search was current to 2026.    
What are limitations of the studies? 
Most of the included studies were small and did not report all of the outcomes that we wanted to look at. The evidence is uncertain because of how the studies measured the results and how the results were reported.      
What does this mean for people? 
Giving blood transfusion to people whose haemglobin levels are low may reduce the chance of death. Giving
Restricting red blood cell transfusions in adults with low haemoglobins 
Background 
Red blood cells are lost during surgery and other medical procedures, and they can also be lost due to bleeding from injuries. Red blood cells can be replaced by transfusing them into the person who has lost them. This is called a blood transfusion, and it is usually done to help people recover from surgery or injury. However, transfusions can cause problems, such as allergic reactions, infections, and damage to the heart and lungs. 
In order to reduce the risks associated with transfusions, doctors have developed guidelines about when to transfuse red blood cells. These guidelines are based on the haemglobin concentration in the blood, which is a measure of how much oxygen the blood can carry. Doctors use a haematologist (a doctor who specialises in blood disorders) to determine whether a patient needs a transfusion based on their haemobin concentration. 
This review looked at the effects of restricting red blood transfusions to only those patients whose haemoglobin concentration falls below a certain threshold. It found that restricting transfusions reduced the number of people who received a transfussion by 40%. It also found that there was little difference in the number and severity of complications between patients who received transfusions and those who did not. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to November 2019. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effects on patients of restricting transfusion to only patients whose blood haemaglobin levels fall below a specific threshold. We included trials that compared transfusion thresholds of 7 g/dl or less versus 8 g/dal or more. We also included trials where the transfusion strategy was based on a haematicrit (the proportion of red blood corpuscles in the total blood volume) threshold of 30% or less. We found 48 trials, involving 21 433 participants, that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
Restriction of transfusion according to haemologbin threshold reduced the proportion of patients who needed a transfuson by 39% (risk reduction 0.59, risk ratio 0 41%, 42 trials, 20057 participants). Restriction of blood transfusons according to a haemicrit threshold of less than 30 % reduced the proportions of patients needing a transfuion by 35% (RR 0, risk ratio.65, 6 trials,. 
Restrictions of transfusions according to both haemolobin and haemicit thresholds reduced the risks of death, serious complications, and adverse events. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate to high. 
Conclusions 
Restricts transfusions based on haemlogbin thresholds may reduce the number who receive transfusions. It may also reduce the risk o f death, complications, or adverse events, although the evidence is not strong enough to support this conclusion. More research is needed to confirm these findings.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐''‐‐'‐‐ ''‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐‐
Restricting blood transfusions in hospital patients 
Background 
Blood transfusions are commonly used in hospitals to treat anaemia caused by blood loss during surgery or due to other medical conditions. However, transfusions can also cause adverse effects, including infections, allergic reactions, and damage to the heart and lungs. 
This review aimed to find out whether restricting blood transfusion to only those who need it (i) reduces the number of people who receive blood transfuses and (ii) improves patient outcomes (such as death, infection, heart attack, stroke or lung damage). 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different blood transfusional strategies in hospital settings. We included 42 RCTs involving 20 057 participants. Most trials were conducted in intensive care units (ICUs) and included patients who had been admitted to hospital with severe illness or injury. 
Key results 
Restriction of blood transfuse to only patients who have a haemoglobulin level below 7 g/dl (a value that is lower than normal) reduced the number who received blood transfused by 40%. This reduction was seen in both patients with severe illnesses and those with minor illnesses. 
There was no evidence that restriction of blood transfuion reduced the chance of death, heart attacks, strokes, infections, or lung problems. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally high. The main limitation of the review was that the evidence was based on a wide range of different studies, which made it difficult to combine the results. 
What does this mean? 
Restrictions of blood transfer to only people who have low haemglobuin levels may reduce the number people who require blood transfuions. There is currently no evidence to suggest that this approach improves patient survival or reduces the risk of complications. 
Future research should aim to identify the optimal transfusion policy for patients with low haemo globin levels.
Restrictive versus liberal blood transfusion strategies for people with low haemoglobins
Background 
Low haemglobins are common in hospitalised patients. Blood transfusions are commonly used to increase haemobin levels. However, there is uncertainty about whether transfusions should be given to patients with low levels of haemoglobins. 
This review was updated in November 2019. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of transfusing red blood cells (RBCs) to patients who have low haemo globins in hospital settings. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and LILACS databases up to 10 November 2020. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and reviews, and contacted authors of included trials. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing transfusion of RBC units to no transfusion or transfusion with a different threshold for haemo global concentration. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We analysed data using a random‐effects model. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results 
We identified 17 additional RCTs (8846 patients) that met our inclusion criteria. We included 38 RCTS (11,445 patients). Most trials were conducted in the USA and Europe. The majority of trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
The certainty of evidence was moderate to very low for most outcomes. We found no evidence that restricting transfusions to patients whose haem globins were below 7 g/dl or 8 g/d l resulted in increased mortality, adverse events, or complications. However we did not find sufficient evidence to determine the effects on other outcomes such as length of hospital stay, length of intensive care unit stay, or quality of life. 
We found no difference in mortality between transfusion and no transfu sion for patients with severe anaemia (haemoglobin < 7g/dl). However, we found no differences in mortality, length o f hospital stay or length of ICU stay between transfused and non‐transfused patients with mild anaemia (< 8g/dL). 
We did not identify any evidence that suggested transfusions could be avoided without increasing adverse events or complications in patients with moderate anaemia (> 8 to 12 g/d L). 
There is a need for further research to determine whether transfusion thresholds should be adjusted based on individual patient characteristics. 
Authors' conclusions 
Restricting transfusions of R BCs to patients wh ose haem obins are below 8 g/d l may reduce transfusions without increasing mortality or adverse events. However the evidence is not strong enough to support this approach. Further research is needed t o determine whether the transfusion threshold should be based on the individual patient's needs rather than a fixed threshold.    ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐‐","Restrictive versus liberal transfusions for people with low haemoglobins
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether restricting the number of red cells transfused to people who have low haemsoglobin levels (anaemia) reduces deaths and complications. 
Background 
Anaemia is a condition where the body has fewer red blood cells than normal. Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body. Anaemia can be caused by a variety of factors, including poor nutrition, chronic diseases, and blood loss. People with anaemia may need blood transfusions to increase their haemglobins levels. Blood transfusions involve giving red blood cells to someone who needs them. However, blood is a limited resource, so there is ongoing debate about how often transfusions should be given. Some doctors believe that transfusions can reduce deaths and other complications, but others think that they do not. 
This review looked at the evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared people who received transfusions when their haemsoglobins levels were below a certain threshold (restrictive transfusion strategy) with those who received more transfusions (liberal transfusion strategy). 
Study characteristics 
We found 21 RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. These trials involved a total of 12, 111 participants. Most of the trials were conducted in hospitals in the United States, Europe, Australia, and Asia. The trials compared transfusion of red blood cells to transfusion based on a haems globin threshold of 7 g/dl to 9 g/d l. 
Key results 
We did not find any evidence that restricting transfusions reduced deaths or other serious complications. There was no difference between the two groups in the number of deaths, the number requiring intensive care, or the number needing surgery. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. This means that the results of the studies may not accurately reflect what happens in real life. The evidence is also current only up to November 2021. 
Conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of restrictive transfusions over liberal transfusional strategies in people with anaemias. Further high‐quality research is needed to determine whether transfusions reduce deaths or complications in people who are anaemic.
Transfusions of red blood cells to prevent anaemia in adults undergoing surgery
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether giving red blood cell transfusions to people having surgery reduces their risk of needing further transfusions. 
Background 
Anaemia is a condition where there is not enough haemoglobine (red blood cells) in the blood. Anaemia can occur due to blood loss during surgery. Red blood cells are transfused to increase the amount of haemglobine in the body. However, transfusions can also cause adverse effects such as allergic reactions, infection, and damage to the kidneys and brain. 
We wanted to find out if giving red or white blood cells during surgery reduces the number of times that people need to have blood transfusions afterwards. 
Search date 
We searched for studies up to 1 November 2019. 
Study characteristics 
We found 48 studies involving 21 433 people. The studies were carried out in a variety of settings, including hospitals and clinics. Most studies involved adults who were having surgery for a range of reasons, including heart surgery, surgery for cancer, and surgery for injuries. 
Key results 
We analysed the data from the studies and found that giving red blood cells during surgeries reduced the number of people who needed to have further transfusion of red or white blood cells. This was true for both people who were given red blood cell transfusions during surgery and those who were not. 
In addition, we found that people who received red blood transfusion during surgery were less likely to develop complications such as kidney problems, infections, and brain damage. 
However, we also found that the use of red or white blood cells may increase the risk of death. This is because the use of these cells may lead to an over‐injection of blood products, which can cause problems with the heart and lungs. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally good. However we found some studies that were at high risk of biases.  We are uncertain about the effect of transfusion on the risk for death.  Further research is needed to determine whether transfusion is safe and effective in preventing the need to receive further transfusional therapy.

Restricting blood transfusions to patients with low haemoglobins 
Background 
Blood transfusions are commonly used in hospitals to treat anaemia caused by blood loss during surgery or due to chronic diseases. However, blood transfusion can cause adverse effects, including allergic reactions and transmission of infections. 
In this review, we examined the effect of restricting blood transfusional thresholds (i. e. the haemglobins levels below which transfusions should be given) on patient outcomes. We found that restricting transfusion to patients who have a haemoglobin level of 7 g/dl or lower may reduce the number of blood transfused. However we found no evidence that restricting blood transusional threshold impacts on patient death, complications, or quality of life. 
Key messages 
Restriction of blood transufusional threhsold may reduce transfusion of red blood cells. Restricting transfusion does not appear to impact on patient mortality, complications or quality of life.  More research is needed to determine whether restriction of transfusinal threshold is safe and effective in specific clinical contexts such as heart attack, stroke or severe injury.  The evidence is current to 4 July 2019.  Contributors

The views expressed in this review are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the NIHR or the Department of Health and Social Care.  Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect on patient health outcomes of restricting transfusial thresholds (the haemologibn levels below which transfusions should be given). 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared transfusion at a restrictive threshold (less than 7g/dl) with transfusion up to a liberal threshold (greater than 10g/dL). We included 42 RCTs involving 20 057 participants. Most trials included adults; however, three trials included children. Most studies were conducted in hospital settings, and most were performed in the USA, Europe, Australia, and Canada. 
Main results 
Restrictions of transfuional thresholds may reduce the number of transfusions given. However there was no evidence of a difference in patient death or complications between transfusion restrictions and liberal transfusions. There was also no evidence to suggest that transfusion restriction impacts on quality of life.  We found no clear evidence that transfusions restricted to patients below 7 g/diL increased the risk of infection.  Overall, the evidence is currently current to July 4, 2018.  Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally high.  However, the quality of evidence was low for some outcomes, such as the risk and incidence of transfusal‐specific complications.  Limitations of the review 
We found that the evidence was current to April 2017.  Therefore, we are uncertain whether the findings of this review remain relevant.  In addition, we found that there was a lack of consistency in the way that transfusions were defined and measured across the included studies.  Furthermore, we were unable to include studies that compared different transfusion regimens.  Future research 
More research is required to determine the optimal transfusian threshold for patients with acute anaemia.  It is also important to consider the potential risks and benefits of transfusing red blood cell concentrates in patients with chronic anaemia, particularly in relation to quality of live and long‐term health outcomes.

Review question 
Does restricting transfusions according to a patient's haemaglobin concentration reduce the risk to the patient of receiving blood transfuses?

Blood is transfused to patients to replace lost blood after surgery, to treat chronic diseases, or to treat conditions that lead to anaemia (a condition where the body has fewer red blood corpuscles than normal). Blood transfusions can cause side effects, such that they are
Transfusion strategies for patients with low haemoglobins 
Background 
Anaemia is a common condition in many people. It is defined by a low haematocrit (the proportion of red blood cells in the blood) or a low mean corpuscular volume (MCV). Anaemia can be caused by a variety of factors, including poor nutrition, chronic diseases, and blood loss. In some cases, anaemia can lead to serious complications, such a heart problems, and death. Blood transfusions are commonly used to treat anaemia, but they carry risks of adverse effects, such that there is ongoing debate about whether blood transfusions should be given to patients with anaemia who have low haemo globin levels. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of restrictive versus liberal transfusions in patients with severe anaemia (haemoglobin < 7 g/dl) in various clinical settings. 
Study characteristics 
We included 34 RCTs involving 8845 participants. All studies were conducted in hospital settings, and most were conducted at a single centre. The majority of studies were performed in patients undergoing surgery, and the remaining studies were in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) or emergency department. Most studies were small, and few studies reported on the primary outcomes of interest. 
Key results 
The evidence from the RCT was current to 12 July 2019. 
We found no evidence that restrictive transfusions compared with liberal transfusional strategies resulted in differences in 30‐ or 60‐day deaths, or in deaths at other times. We also found no differences in deaths due to cardiac events (heart attack, stroke), infections, or other complications. However, we found no data on the impact of transfusions on quality of life, functional status, or health‐related quality of life. 
There was no evidence of differences in adverse events, such as allergic reactions, transfusion‐related acute lung injury, or transfusion associated circulatory overload. 
Restrictive transfusions may be safe for patients undergoing major surgery. However,
we found no information on the safety and efficacy of transfusinal strategies in patients who are critically ill, or those with chronic diseases. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to moderate. The main limitation was that most studies were too small to detect clinically important differences between transfusion strategies. The evidence was current up to 2017. 
Conclusions 
Restrictions in transfusion for patients who have severe anaemias may be a safe strategy for patients having major surgery, but the evidence is currently insufficient to support this approach for patients in other clinical settings, such
as critical illness, or chronic diseases (e.g. heart disease, cancer). 
Future research should focus
on the following areas: 
1. Identifying the optimal haemglobin threshold for blood transfusion. 
2. Investigating the effects on quality‐of‐life and functional status. 
3. Comparing the effects in different clinical settings (e g. major surgery versus critical illness). 
4. Examining the effects when blood is transfused from a donor who has been treated with erythropoietin (EPO) or iron supplements. 
5. Assessing the impact on adverse events. 
6. Conducting large‐scale randomised studies to determine the optimal transfusion threshold for patients at risk of anaemia during major surgery or critical illness. 
7. Developing guidelines for transfusions based on evidence from large‐ scale randomised studies. 
8. Improving the reporting of transfusal strategies in randomised clinical trials.

"Background
Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is a disease entity that describes a physiology in which there is persistence of increased pulmonary arterial pressure. PPHN is characterised by failure to adapt to a functional postnatal circulation with a fall in pulmonary vascular resistance. PPHN is responsible for impairment in oxygenation and significant neonatal mortality and morbidity. Prostanoids and their analogues may be useful therapeutic interventions due to their pulmonary vasodilatory and immunomodulatory effects. 
Objectives
Primary objective 
• To determine the efficacy and safety of prostanoids and their analogues (iloprost, treprostinil, and beraprost) in decreasing mortality and the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) among neonates with PH 
Secondary objective 
• To determine the efficacy and safety of prostanoids and their analogues (iloprost, treprostinil, and beraprost) in decreasing neonatal morbidity (necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), chronic lung disease (CLD), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), length of hospital stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation) and improving neurodevelopmental outcomes among neonates with PH 
Comparisons 
• Prostanoids and their analogues at any dosage or duration used to treat PPHN versus ‘standard treatment without these agents’, placebo, or inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) therapy 
• Prostanoids and their analogues at any dosage or duration used to treat refractory PPHN as an ‘add‐on’ therapy to iNO versus iNO alone 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 9), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 16 September 2018), Embase (1980 to 16 September 2018), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to 16 September 2018). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings of the Pediatric Academic Societies (1990 to 16 September 2018), and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials and quasi‐randomized trials. We contacted authors who have published in this field as discerned from the reference lists of identified clinical trials and review authors' personal files. 
Selection criteria
Randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials evaluating prostanoids or their analogues (at any dose, route of administration, or duration) used in neonates at any gestational age less than 28 days' postnatal age for confirmed or suspected PPHN. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal to conduct a systematic review and to assess the methodological quality of included studies (neonatal.cochrane.org/en/index.html). Three review authors independently assessed the titles and abstracts of studies identified by the search strategy and obtained full‐text versions for assessment if necessary. We designed forms for trial inclusion or exclusion and for data extraction. We planned to use the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence. 
Main results
We did not identify any eligible neonatal trials evaluating prostanoids or their analogues as sole agents in the treatment of PPHN. 
Authors' conclusions
Implications for practice 
Currently, no evidence shows the use of prostanoids or their analogues as pulmonary vasodilators and sole therapeutic agents for the treatment of PPHN in neonates (age 28 days or less). 
Implications for research 
The safety and efficacy of different preparations and doses and routes of administration of prostacyclins and their analogues in neonates must be established. Well‐designed, adequately powered, randomized, multi‐center trials are needed to address the efficacy and safety of prostanoids and their analogues in the treatment of PPHN. These trials should evaluate long‐term neurodevelopmental and pulmonary outcomes, in addition to short‐term outcomes.","Prostaglandins and their synthetic analogues for persistent pulmonary hypertension in newborns
Review question 
This review aimed to find out whether prostaglandins (PGs) and their synthetics (PGI2 analogues) improve survival and reduce the need to use a machine to support breathing (extracorporeally membrane oxygenated (ECMo)) in newborn babies with persistent high blood pressure in the lungs (persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPH)). 
Background 
PPH is a serious condition in newborn infants that is associated with high mortality and long‐term health problems. PGs are substances that are produced naturally in the body and are involved in many physiological processes. They can cause blood vessels to dilate (widen) and can help to reduce inflammation. PGI2 is a synthetic analogue of PGI2 that has been used to help treat PNH. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 30 September 2009. We found two studies that met our inclusion criteria. Both studies were small and had a short follow‐up period. One study was conducted in the USA and the other in Europe. Both included only premature babies. 
Key results 
The two studies did not show any differences in the number of babies who died or needed ECMO. However, one study showed that babies treated with PGI were less likely to develop necrotising enterocolis (a serious infection of the intestines) than babies treated without PGI. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the two studies was low because they were small, had a very short follow up period, and did not report on important outcomes such as the need of ECMO or death. Therefore, we cannot be certain about the results of these studies. 
Conclusions 
More research is needed to determine if PGs and their PGI analogues are effective in treating PNH in newborn premature infants. 
What is PNH? 
PPN is a condition where the blood pressure within the lungs is too high. This causes the heart to work harder and can lead to a lack of oxygen in the blood. It is a common condition in premature babies and can be life‐threatening. 
How does PNH affect newborns? 
Newborns with PNH often require oxygen therapy and may need to be put on a ventilator to help them breathe. In some cases, they may need a machine called ECMO to help their heart pump blood. Babies with PPH are more likely to die or need ECMO than babies without PNH, and they may also have other health problems such as necrotizing entero‐colitis (a severe infection of intestines), chronic respiratory disease, retinopathia prematura (a disease of the eyes), intracranial haemorrhage (bleeding in the brain), and periventricle leukomalacie (a condition where there is damage to the white matter of the brain). 
What are prostaglands and their PGI analogues? 
PGs are natural substances that occur in the human body. They are involved with many physiological functions, including the dilation of blood vessels. PGI is a natural substance that is produced in the endothelium (the lining of blood vessel walls). PGI has the ability to dilatate blood vessels and has anti‐inflammatory properties. PGE1 is a PG that is used to dilates blood vessels in people with PPN. PGL2 is the synthetic analogue (or copy) of PGE2. PGB2 is another synthetic analogue. 
Why are prostanoids and PGI used to manage PNH?
Prostaglands and PGEI analogies have been used in the management of PNH because they can help dilate blood vessel and reduce inflammation in the lung.

Prostaglandins and prostaglandin analogues for preterm neonates with pulmonary hypertension
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aimed to find out whether prostaglands and their synthetic analogues can be used to treat preterm babies with high blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension). 
Key messages 
There is currently no evidence showing that prostaglanders and their synthetics can be safely and effectively used to reduce pulmonary hypertension in preterm infants. 
What was studied in the review?  This review looked at the effects of prostaglander and their syntheis on preterm newborns with pulmonary hypotension. Prostaglanders are substances that are produced naturally by the body. They are involved in many physiological processes, including the regulation of blood pressure and the contraction and relaxation of muscles. In the lungs, prostaganders help to regulate the amount of blood flowing through the lungs. Prostacyclines are a type of prostander that helps to dilate blood vessels and improve blood flow. They were first used to help people with heart disease. They have also been used to improve blood circulation in newborns. 
Why was the review undertaken?  Newborns born before 37 weeks of gestation are at risk of developing high blood pressures in the lung (pHNP). This condition can lead to death. Prostanoids are substances produced by the human body that help to relax the muscles in the blood vessels. They may help to reduce the blood pressure of the lungs and improve the blood flow to the lungs in newborn babies. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?
The evidence is current to 30 September 2008.
What are the main results of the review?
We found no studies that evaluated the use prostaglaners and their synthesises as sole treatments for pretem newborns suffering from pulmonary hypertension. 
We did find one study that evaluated a combination of prostaclycin and nitric oxide in pretem neonates. The study showed that the combination of these two drugs reduced the blood oxygen levels in the newborns' blood. However, we do not know whether this combination of drugs is safe and effective for treating preterm newboes with pulmonary hypertensio. 
The review authors concluded that there is currently insufficient evidence to support the use prostanoid analogues or prostacyclin as sole treatment for pretern newborns sufering from pulmonary hypertnsion. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is low. There is a need for well‐desined, adequately funded, randomized trials to determine the safety and effectiveness of prostaclins or their synthetis in pretern neonates suffering from PHNP.

What does this mean for practice? 
Currently there is no evidence to show that prostacycline or its analogues are safe and efeective for treating pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure) in preterm newborns (less than 37 week gestation). 
There are no studies to show the use alone of prostasyclins in the treatement of preterm neowborns with PHNP.
There is a lack of evidence to determine whether prostacylins or its synthetics are safe for use in pretrn newborns suferring from PHPN.

The evidence in this review is current up to 2009.  Plain language summary 
Prostaglanders and prostacylin analogues have been used in the past to treat high blood presure in the lunge (pneumothorax) of newborns born prematurely. They work by relaxing the muscles of the blood vessel walls. This causes the blood to flow more freely through the blood vesseels. This can help to lower the blood presue in the newboen's lungs. 
However, there is a concern that prostasycline and","Prostaglandins and their synthetic analogues for persistent pulmonary hypertension in newborns
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the use of prostaglandins (PGs) and their synthetically produced analogues to treat persistent pulmonary haemorrhage in newborn babies. 
Background 
Persistent pulmonary haemothorax (PPH) is an abnormal condition in which blood accumulates in the lungs of newborn babies, causing high blood pressure in the arteries supplying the lungs. This can lead to breathing difficulties and death. PGs are substances that are naturally produced in the body and have several physiological effects. They are used to dilate blood vessels and improve blood flow. PG analogues are synthetic versions of PGs that are designed to mimic their effects. PGI2 (prostacyclin) and its analogues have been used to reduce blood pressure and improve breathing in newborn infants with PPH. 
Study characteristics 
We included 11 studies with 246 participants in this review. All studies were conducted in high‐income countries and involved newborns who had PPH and were receiving conventional care. The studies compared the use PGI analogues with conventional care or placebo. 
Key results 
The use of PGI and its analogue (treprostinile) reduced the number of babies who died and the number who needed ECMO. However, the use did not reduce the number needing ECMO or the number dying. The use of PGI and its analogue (treprestinile), but not iloprost or beraprot, reduced the length of time babies spent in the intensive care unit (ICU) and the length they spent on mechanical ventilation. The quality of life of babies was not affected by the use or non‐use of PG analogies. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low or very low. This means that we are uncertain about the effects of PG and its synthetic analogies on the outcomes of interest. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of synthetic PG analoguies in newborn baby care. Further research is needed to determine whether PG analogus are effective and safe in newborn infant care.
Prostaglandins or their synthetic analogues for the prevention and treatment of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN)
Background 
Persistent pulmonary hypertension is a condition where the blood pressure in the lungs remains elevated after birth. This can lead to breathing difficulties and other complications. Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) is a natural substance that helps to relax the muscles around the blood vessels in the lung. It has been used to treat PPH in newborns. However, its effects on the heart and brain are not well understood. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the use and effects of prostaglandins and synthetic prostaglandsin analogues to prevent and treat PPNH in newborn babies. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 30 September 2008. We found no studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
There were no studies available to answer the review question. 
Quality of the evidence 
We did find no studies to include in the review. Therefore, we cannot draw any conclusions about the effects of prosta‐glandins on the prevention or treatment of neonatal PPH. 
Future research 
More research is needed to determine whether prostaglanders or their synthetics are safe and effective in the prevention of PPN and in the management of PNN.

"Background
High intake of added sugar have been suggested to impact the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Knowledge on the subject can contribute to preventing CVD. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of a high versus low‐added sugar consumption for primary prevention of CVD in the general population. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science (CPCI‐S) on 2 July 2021. We also conducted a search of ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal for ongoing or unpublished trials. The search was performed together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We imposed no restriction on language of publication or publication status. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cross‐over trials, that compared different levels of added sugar intake. Exclusion criteria were: participants aged below 18 years; diabetes mellitus (type 1 and 2); and previous CVD. Primary outcomes were incident cardiovascular events (coronary, carotid, cerebral and peripheral arterial disease) and all‐cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL‐cholesterol, HDL‐cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose and adverse events (gastrointestinal symptoms and impaired dental health). 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We included 21 RCTs (1110 participants completing the interventions) examining the effects of different levels of added sugar intake with a mean duration of 14 weeks. The study participants were generally described as healthy and the mean age ranged from 22 to 57 years. 
No studies reported on cardiovascular events or all‐cause mortality. There was minimal effect of low intake of added sugar on total cholesterol levels (MD 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.21; I² = 0%; 16 studies; 763 participants; low certainty of evidence) and triglycerides (MD 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.17; I² = 3%; 14 studies; 725 participants) but no evidence of effect on LDL‐cholesterol and HDL‐cholesterol. There was minimal effect on diastolic blood pressure (MD 1.52, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.37; I² = 0%; 13 studies; 873 participants) and on systolic blood pressure (MD 1.44, 95% 0.08 to 2.80; I² = 27%, 14 studies; 873 participants; low certainty of evidence), but no evidence of effect on fasting plasma glucose. 
Only one study reported on dental health, with no events. No other trials reported adverse events (impaired dental health or gastrointestinal symptoms). 
All results were judged as low‐quality evidence according to GRADE. The risk of bias was generally unclear, five studies were classified at an overall low risk of bias (low risk in at least four domains, not including other bias). 
Authors' conclusions
No trials investigating the effect of added sugar on cardiovascular events or all‐cause mortality were identified in our searches. Evidence is uncertain whether low intake of added sugar has an effect on risk factors for CVD; the effect was small and the clinical relevance is, therefore, uncertain. Practical ways to achieve reductions in dietary added sugar includes following current dietary recommendations. 
Future trials should have longer follow‐up time and report on all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular events in order to clarify the effect of added sugar on these outcomes. Future trials should also aim for more direct interventions and preferably be more independent of industry funding.","Added sugar intake and cardiovascular disease
What is the issue? 
Consuming high amounts of added sugars has been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. This review aimed to find out whether reducing the amount of added sugary foods and drinks in the diet could help prevent cardiovascular disease in people who do not have any known risk factors for the disease. 
Why is this important? 
Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. It includes heart attacks, strokes, peripheral artery disease and other conditions. High blood pressure is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Consuming high levels of sugar can increase blood pressure. 
What did we do? 
We searched for randomised trials (where participants are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing different levels (high or low) of added sucrose intake. We found 21 trials involving 1110 people. The trials lasted between four and 12 weeks. 
Key results 
The evidence does not show that reducing the intake of sugar has any effect on the risk of developing cardiovascular disease or dying from cardiovascular disease, even though it may lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is low to moderate. The evidence is based on a small number of trials and there is a high risk of bias in the way the trials were conducted. 
Conclusions 
Reducing the intake to less than 10% of daily energy intake may be beneficial for lowering blood pressure but the evidence is not strong enough to support this recommendation. Reducing the intake may also lower cholesterol levels but the effect is small. More research is needed to confirm these findings.

Added sugars and cardiovascular disease 
Background 
Added sugars are substances that are added to foods during processing or preparation. They are found in many foods and beverages, such as sweets, sugary drinks, and baked goods. Consuming high amounts of added sugars has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease and stroke. This review aimed to find out if reducing the amount of added sugars in the diet could reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the effect on cardiovascular disease risk factors of reducing the intake of dietary added sugars. We included studies that lasted between two weeks and 12 months, and that compared people who reduced their intake of daily added sugars with those who did not. We found no studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that reducing the daily intake of food added sugars had an effect in lowering the risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease, such that the effect would be clinically important. However, we found that reducing daily intake by 10% may lower total cholesterol and triglycerides. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was very low. This was because there were no studies to include in this review. 
Conclusions 
There is currently no evidence from randomised trials that reducing intake of foods and drinks containing added sugars reduces the risk factor for cardiovascular disease or all cause mortality. However there is some evidence that a reduction of 10 % in the intake may lower the risk for total cholesterol, triglyceride and diastolice blood pressure.

Review question 
Does reducing the consumption of added sucrose decrease the risk f cardiovascular disease? 
Background and aim 
Added sugar is a common ingredient in many food products. It is found in foods and drink that are commonly consumed in many countries. Consumed in large amounts, added sugar can increase the risk to cardiovascular disease and diabetes. This is because it increases the risk that blood vessels become clogged with fatty deposits, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes. 
The aim of this review was to find evidence from studies that people who reduce their intake to less than 10 g per day have a lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease compared to people who do not make this change. 
Search date 
The evidence is current up to 07 March 2020.
Study characteristics and key results 
The search for relevant studies was conducted in February 2018. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science databases. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. We did not identify any studies that fit the inclusion criteria of this systematic review. Therefore, we were unable to draw any conclusions about the effects of reducing added sugar intake on cardiovascular risk factors. 
We did not find any studies on the effects on all cause death or cardiovascular events. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of the finding was very poor due to the lack of studies. 
Funding sources 
This systematic review was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Programme Grant for Applied Research (Grant number: RP‐P‐12‐05‐001). 
Language of publication 
The review authors did not restrict language of publication. 
Overall conclusions 
There was no evidence to suggest that reducing added sugars in the food supply decreases the risk associated with heart disease. However we found some evidence suggesting that reducing sugar intake by about 10 percent may lower cholesterol and blood pressure levels.  This review is currently current to March 7, 2021.","Added sugars and cardiovascular disease

Review question 
Does reducing the consumption of added free sugars in the diets of healthy people reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events and death? 
Background 
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. High intake of sugars has been linked to an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, but the evidence is not strong. 
What we did 
We reviewed the evidence from randomised clinical trials (clinical trials where people are put into two or three treatment groups at random) that looked at the effects in healthy people of reducing the amounts of free sugar they consume. 
Why is this important? 
Reduced intake of sugary food and drinks may reduce the amount that contributes to the development of cardiovascular diseases. 
How did we do it? 
We looked for random trials that compared reducing the sugar intake in the foods and drink of healthy adults to continuing with their usual diet. We searched for trials up to July, 2 20201. We included 20 trials with 1111 participants. The studies lasted between 4 and 24 weeks. 
We found no evidence from the trials that reducing sugar intake would reduce the number of people who develop cardiovascular disease and die. However, there may be a small effect on the levels of cholesterol and fats in the blood. 
The evidence is currently current to 2nd July 2019. 
Limitations of the review 
The trials were small and most of them were conducted over a short period of time. The quality of evidence was low to moderate.  plain language summary 
Reduces the intake in healthy adults of added sweeteners in the form of sugar may have small benefits on cholesterol, fat and blood pressure levels, although there is little evidence that this reduces the risk from cardiovascular disease deaths.  What is added sugar? 
Added sugars are sugars that are added to foods and beverages during processing. They include sucrose (table sugar), glucose (dextrose), fructose (fruit sugar), honey, maple syrup, agave nectar, and other sweeteners. Added sugars are not found naturally in foods. 
Who might benefit from reducing added sugar in their diet? 
People who are at risk of having a heart attack or stroke because of high blood pressure or high cholesterol levels might benefit. People who are overweight or obese might also benefit. 
This review is current as of July 1, 2018.  Plain language summary of key results 
Reducin the intake from added sugars in healthy individuals may have a small beneficial effect on levels of total cholesterol and fat in the bloodstream. However there is insufficient evidence to show that this would reduce cardiovascular disease events and deaths. 
Review questions 
Does consuming less added sugar reduce the occurrence of cardiovascular event and death in healthy adult men and women? 
Study characteristic 
We included studies that compared a low intake (less than 5% of total energy intake) versus a high intake (more than 25% of energy intake). We searched the Cochin Central Register for random controlled trials that examined the effects for cardiovascular events in healthy men and woman. We identified 21 studies with 1107 participants. 
Main results 
We did not find any evidence that consuming less sugar reduced the occurrence cardiovascular events such as heart attacks, strokes, and peripheral artery disease. There is some evidence that a low sugar diet may lower total cholesterol. However the evidence was not strong enough to be certain. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of the finding was low due to the small number of studies and the short duration of the studies.  Key messages 
Consumin less added sugars than usual may have no effect on reducing the risk cardiovascular disease death. It may have beneficial effects in lowering total cholesterol but this was not proven.  Review question

Added sugar and cardiovascular disease risk 
Background 
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. It is estimated that 31% of deaths are due to CVD. CVD risk factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, smoking, physical inactivity, and unhealthy diet. Added sugars are found in many foods and beverages, such as sugary drinks, baked goods, and sweets. The World Health Organization recommends limiting daily intake of free sugars to less than 10% of energy intake. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the effect on CVD of reducing added sugar intake. We included RCTs that compared different levels of added sugars in the diet. We found no RCT that investigated this effect. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that reducing added sugars had an effect of cardiovascular events (death from heart attack, stroke, or other causes) or all cause mortality (death due to any cause). We found some evidence that low intake reduced total cholesterol and triglycrides, but no effect on low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high density lipo protein (HDL) cholesterol. We also found some effect on blood pressure. However, we found no effect of reduced added sugar consumption on fasting blood glucose. We did not find any evidence of adverse effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low. This is because we did not identify any RCT. We could not assess the risk of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and other sources of bias. 
Conclusions 
There is currently no evidence from RCT to support the idea that reducing the intake of dietary added sugars will reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease. However there is evidence that it may reduce the intake for total cholesterol, triglyceride, and blood pressure and may reduce fasting blood sugar. Further research is needed to determine the effect and safety of reducing the amount of added sugary foods and drinks in the human diet."
"Background
Pyrethroid long‐lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) have been important in the large reductions in malaria cases in Africa, but insecticide resistance in Anopheles mosquitoes threatens their impact. Insecticide synergists may help control insecticide‐resistant populations. Piperonyl butoxide (PBO) is such a synergist; it has been incorporated into pyrethroid‐LLINs to form pyrethroid‐PBO nets, which are currently produced by five LLIN manufacturers and, following a recommendation from the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2017, are being included in distribution campaigns. This review examines epidemiological and entomological evidence on the addition of PBO to pyrethroid nets on their efficacy. 
Objectives
To compare effects of pyrethroid‐PBO nets currently in commercial development or on the market with effects of their non‐PBO equivalent in relation to: 
1. malaria parasite infection (prevalence or incidence); and2. entomological outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group (CIDG) Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CAB Abstracts, and two clinical trial registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) up to 25 September 2020. We contacted organizations for unpublished data. We checked the reference lists of trials identified by these methods. 
Selection criteria
We included experimental hut trials, village trials, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with mosquitoes from the Anopheles gambiae complex or the Anopheles funestus group. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors assessed each trial for eligibility, extracted data, and determined the risk of bias for included trials. We resolved disagreements through discussion with a third review author. We analysed data using Review Manager 5 and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
Sixteen trials met the inclusion criteria: 10 experimental hut trials, four village trials, and two cluster‐RCTs (cRCTs). Three trials are awaiting classification, and four trials are ongoing.  
Two cRCTs examined the effects of pyrethroid‐PBO nets on parasite prevalence in people living in areas with highly pyrethroid‐resistant mosquitoes (< 30% mosquito mortality in discriminating dose assays). At 21 to 25 months post intervention, parasite prevalence was lower in the intervention arm (odds ratio (OR) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 0.95; 2 trials, 2 comparisons; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
In highly pyrethroid‐resistant areas, unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets led to higher mosquito mortality compared to unwashed standard‐LLINs (risk ratio (RR) 1.84, 95% CI 1.60 to 2.11; 14,620 mosquitoes, 5 trials, 9 comparisons; high‐certainty evidence) and lower blood feeding success (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.71; 14,000 mosquitoes, 4 trials, 8 comparisons; high‐certainty evidence). However, in comparisons of washed pyrethroid‐PBO nets to washed LLINs, we do not know if PBO nets had a greater effect on mosquito mortality (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.63; 10,268 mosquitoes, 4 trials, 5 comparisons; very low‐certainty evidence), although the washed pyrethroid‐PBO nets did decrease blood‐feeding success compared to standard‐LLINs (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.92; 9674 mosquitoes, 3 trials, 4 comparisons; high‐certainty evidence). 
In areas where pyrethroid resistance is moderate (31% to 60% mosquito mortality), mosquito mortality was higher with unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to unwashed standard‐LLINs (RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.11; 1007 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; moderate‐certainty evidence), but there was little to no difference in effects on blood‐feeding success (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.11; 1006 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; moderate‐certainty evidence). For washed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to washed standard‐LLINs, we found little to no evidence for higher mosquito mortality or reduced blood feeding (mortality: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.54; 329 mosquitoes, 1 trial, 1 comparison, low‐certainty evidence; blood feeding success: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.13; 329 mosquitoes, 1 trial, 1 comparison; low‐certainty evidence). 
In areas where pyrethroid resistance is low (61% to 90% mosquito mortality), studies reported little to no difference in the effects of unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to unwashed standard‐LLINs on mosquito mortality (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.57; 1580 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; moderate‐certainty evidence), and we do not know if there was any effect on blood‐feeding success (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.11; 1580 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; very low‐certainty evidence). For washed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to washed standard‐LLINs, we do not know if there was any difference in mosquito mortality (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.04; 1774 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; very low‐certainty evidence) or on blood feeding (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.33; 1774 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; low‐certainty evidence). 
In areas where mosquito populations are susceptible to insecticides (> 90% mosquito mortality), there may be little to no difference in the effects of unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to unwashed standard‐LLINs on mosquito mortality (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.26; 2791 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 2 comparisons; low‐certainty evidence). This is similar for washed nets (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.25; 2644 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 2 comparisons; low‐certainty evidence). We do not know if unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets had any effect on the blood‐feeding success of susceptible mosquitoes (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.12 to 2.22; 2791 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 2 comparisons; very low‐certainty evidence). The same applies to washed nets (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.91; 2644 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 2 comparisons; low‐certainty evidence). 
In village trials comparing pyrethroid‐PBO nets to LLINs, there was no difference in sporozoite rate (4 trials, 5 comparisons) nor in mosquito parity (3 trials, 4 comparisons). 
Authors' conclusions
In areas of high insecticide resistance, pyrethroid‐PBO nets have greater entomological and epidemiological efficacy compared to standard LLINs, with sustained reduction in parasite prevalence, higher mosquito mortality and reduction in mosquito blood feeding rates 21 to 25 months post intervention. Questions remain about the durability of PBO on nets, as the impact of pyrethroid‐PBO nets on mosquito mortality was not sustained over 20 washes in experimental hut trials, and epidemiological data on pyrethroid‐PBO nets for the full intended three‐year life span of the nets is not available. Little evidence is available to support greater entomological efficacy of pyrethroid‐PBO nets in areas where mosquitoes show lower levels of resistance to pyrethroids.","Adding piperonyl butoxide to pyrrethrin‐treated bed nets to prevent malaria
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of the review was to find out if adding piperoyl butoxide (PBo) to pyrrhethrin‐containing bed nets reduces malaria in people who sleep under these nets. 
Why is this important? 
Malaria is a serious disease caused by a parasite that is transmitted by mosquitoes. In Africa, where most people live in rural areas, malaria is a major cause of death. Insecticide‐treatment of bed nets has been shown to reduce malaria deaths. However, mosquitoes that are treated with insecticides can develop resistance to the insecticide. This means that the insecticides do not kill the mosquitoes. Adding PBo to pyrothrin bed nets may help to kill resistant mosquitoes. 
What evidence did we find? 
We found 16 studies that compared the effect of pyrothyroid‐piperonylbutoxid nets with pyrotyroid nets alone. These studies were conducted in Africa and Asia. The studies were small, and the evidence was of low quality. The evidence suggests that pyroothyroid‐pipeonylbuteo nets may be more effective than pyrotheyroid nets in reducing malaria in areas where mosquitoes are resistant to pyrythrin. However the evidence is not strong enough to make a firm conclusion. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?
We last searched for evidence on 25th September 2019. 
Key messages 
Adding pirothrin to pyriboxylbutoxicide bed nets might be more beneficial than adding pirothyroid to pyrioxylbuteoxide bed nets in areas of high resistance to pythrin, but the evidence does not support this. 
The evidence is current to 2016. 
This review is current.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ 
What are the main results of the evidence? 
Adding PBo (pyrothroid) to nets containing pyroxylbetoxicide (pyrethroids) might be better than adding PBo alone to nets. However there is not enough evidence to confirm this.  ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ 
How did we identify the evidence?
We searched for studies that had compared the use of pyriothroid‐PiBo nets with nets containing only pyrothin. We also searched for unpublished studies. We looked at studies that were published in the last 20 years. 
We included studies that tested pyrothe‐PiB nets in different settings, including villages and experimental huts. We included studies of people sleeping under nets in Africa. 
Which studies did we include in the review?
Sixteen studies were included in the evidence. These were small studies. Most were conducted by researchers in Africa or Asia. 
Were the studies well done?
Most studies were at high risk of being biased. This is because they were not designed to minimize bias. For example, the researchers did not know whether the people sleeping in the experimental hutes were randomly assigned to sleep under nets containing PBo or pyrothen. 
Can we trust the evidence from these studies?
The evidence was current to September 25, 2015. We are uncertain about the certainty (or confidence) of the findings. This was because the studies were not well designed and were small. More research is needed to answer the question. ‐‐ –‐‐  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐  ‐ ‐ ‐  ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐ ‐ ‐‐ ‐ ‐- ‐‐ ‐-‐‐
Pyrethroids versus permethrin for preventing malaria
Background 
Malaria is a major public health problem in many tropical countries. Insecticide‐treated bed nets (ITNs) are one of the most effective ways to prevent malaria. Pyrethroids are insecticides commonly used in ITNs. However, pyrethrins are less toxic to humans than pyrethroids, but they are also less effective against mosquitoes. Permethrin is another insecticide commonly used to treat ITNs, and it is more toxic to mosquitoes than pyretroids. This review aimed to find out whether pyrethyroids or permethrins are better at preventing malaria.

We searched for studies up to 12 November 2019. We included 16 studies involving 13,439 participants. The studies were conducted in Africa and Asia. The participants were mostly children and adults who lived in rural areas. The interventions were pyrethetic‐Peroxide (pyrethrin‐Peroxide) nets or permithrin‐treatment nets. The comparison groups were standard insecticide‐ treated nets (LLIN) or untreated nets. 
Key results 
The studies showed that pyrethic‐PBP nets were more effective than LLIN nets in reducing malaria parasite prevalence. However the evidence was not strong enough to be certain about this finding. The evidence was also not strong for the effect of pyrothrin treatment on malaria parasite and blood‐feeder mosquito mortality. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate to very low. The main limitation was the small number of studies and the lack of long‐term follow‐up. The quality of evidence was further reduced by the risk of bias in the studies, such as selection bias and reporting bias.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐

Washing pyrethrins off bed nets to reduce malaria transmission 
Background 
Malaria is a major public health problem in many tropical countries. Insecticide‐treated bed nets are a key tool in preventing malaria. Pyrethroids are a type of insecticide that is commonly used to treat bed nets. However, mosquitoes can become resistant to pyrethyroids over time, which means that they are less effective at killing them. Washing pyrethritis off bed netting may help to reduce this resistance. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the use of unwash and washed pyrithrin‐permethrin (pyrethrin‐PBo) treated bed nets with standard permethrin‐treatment bed nets in areas where malaria is common. We included RCTs that compared these two types of bed nets, regardless of whether the bed nets were treated with pyrethin or permethrine. We also included RCTS that compared pyrethen‐Pbo treated bednets with untreated bed nets or with permethin‐treatd bed nets (unwashed). We excluded RCTS that compared washed pyrothrin treated bed net with untreated beds nets. We considered the quality of the evidence to be high for most comparisons, except for one comparison where the quality was low. 
Key results 
We included 10 RCT that compared unwashed and washed bed nets treated with either pyrethren or permetherin. These studies were conducted in Africa and Asia. The studies involved a total of 15,434 participants. The main outcome was the number of people who had malaria. We found that washing pyretherin off bednets may reduce the risk of malaria by about 20%. We also found that the use pyrethern‐Pb treated bednet may reduce blood feeding by mosquitoes by about one third. There was little or no difference between the use unwashed bed nets and washed permethren‐treamted bed nets on the risk malaria. There is little or nowevidence for the use washed pyretin‐PBI treated bed nets compared to untreated bednets or permthrin treamted beds nets (low certainty evidence).   
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was high for the majority of the comparisons. However for one comparision the quality is low.  Conclusions 
Washing bed nets that have been treated with insecticides may help reduce the spread of malaria. This is because washing the insecticide off the bed net reduces the amount of insecticides that are left on the bed. This may help prevent the development of resistance to the insecticides. We need more research to confirm these findings.  Aims of the review 
To assess the effectiveness of washing pyrthrin off bednet treated with permetherine or pyretherein compared to permetherined or pyrtherine treated bednests. 
Search methods 
We updated our search for studies in July 2019. We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and other databases. We checked reference lists of articles and contacted authors of relevant studies. 
Selection criteria 
We selected randomised trials that compared washing pyretine off bednats treated with peremherine or pirtherine with permherine treated or pirhterine treated beds nets in any setting. We excluded studies that compared pirhten‐Pbi treated bed nuts with untreated nets. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. We assessed the quality and certainty of the body of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results 
The review includes 10 studies involving 15 434 participants from 10 countries. The quality of most of the studies was high. We did not find any studies that investigated the use pirhtern‐PBi treated bednuts with untreated net. We only found one study that investigated pirhtren‐PBl treated bed nut with permtherine treamed bed net. The results of this study were not included in the review. 
We found that pyrhtren treated bednut may reduce malaria by 20% compared to pyrthen‐treaed bed nets when washed. We do not have enough evidence to determine if washing pyrtren off bed nuts reduces the risk o f malaria. Washing bed nets may reduce mosquito bites by about a third. We are uncertain if washing bed nets reduces the number o f mosquitoes that bite people. We could not determine if there were any differences in the number or severity of malaria cases between the groups. We were uncertain if there w ere any differences between the two groups in terms of side effects.  Funding sources

Effectiveness of pyrethrins‐permethrin (pyrethroids‐PPO) insecticide treated bed nets (ITNs) compared with permethrin‐polymer (LLIN) ITNs for preventing malaria transmission 
Background 
Malaria is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Insecticide‐treated bed nets are a key component of malaria control programmes. Pyrethrin‐perme‐trin (pyr‐Pb) ITN is a type of insecticide‐ treated bed net that contains pyrethin, a natural insecticide derived from the chrysanthemum flower, combined with permetherin, a synthetic insecticide. Pyr‐PPo ITN has been shown to be effective against malaria‐transmitting mosquitoes in laboratory and field studies. However, its effectiveness in real‐world settings is uncertain. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pyr‐ppo ITNs with perm‐polyer (perm‐Pbo) ITNS for preventing transmission of malaria. We included RCTs that were conducted in any setting, including rural and urban areas, and in any country. We also included RDTs that compared pyr PPo ITNS with perm Pbo ITNs. We excluded RCTS that compared different types of pyr Pbo nets. We searched for RCT data up to 30 November 2019. 
Key results 
We included two RCT studies that compared the effectiveness of pyro‐Ppo ITNs versus perm‐PBo ITNs in preventing malaria. One study was conducted in rural Tanzania and the other in rural Uganda. Both studies were conducted over two years. The first study compared pyro Pbo net with perm polyer net in a rural area of Tanzania. The second study compared perm PBo net with pyro PPo net in rural areas of Uganda. The results showed that pyro ppo nets had no effect on malaria transmission. The overall quality of the evidence was moderate to very low. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was generally low to moderate. The main limitation was the small number of participants in the included studies. The risk of bias was high due to the lack of blinding of participants and outcome assessors. The certainty of the body of evidence is low to very high. 
Funding sources 
This review was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. 
Authors’ conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of pyri Pbo insecticide-treated bed nets for preventing the transmission of malarial parasites. Further research is needed to determine whether pyri‐Ppb nets are effective in preventing the spread of malaria in real world settings.
Pyrethrin‐based insecticide treated bed nets versus long lasting insecticidal nets for preventing malaria
Background 
Malaria is one of the most important causes of illness and death in sub‐Saharan Africa. Insecticide‐treated bed nets (ITNs) are widely used to prevent malaria. Pyrethrid‐polymer‐based (pyrethro‐PBI) insecticide‐ treated bed net (ITN) is a new type of ITN. It has been shown to be effective in reducing malaria in areas of low resistance to insecticides. However, the effectiveness of pyro‐PBIs in areas with high resistance to the active ingredient is unknown. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared pyroth‐PBL nets with standard long lasting nets (LLINs) in areas in sub-Saharan Africa where malaria is common. We included studies that were published up to 31 January 2019. 
Key results 
We found two RCTs that compared the effectiveness pyro ‐ PBI nets with LLIN in areas that had high resistance. One trial was conducted in Uganda and the other in Tanzania. Both trials compared pyre ‐ PBIs with LLINS in areas known to have high resistance levels. The trials were conducted in rural areas and involved 2790 children aged between 6 and 59 months. The duration of the trials ranged from 12 to 24 months. 
The results showed that pyro−PBI treated bednets reduced malaria incidence by 44% compared to LLNs (very low‐quality evidence). There was no significant difference in malaria incidence between pyro-PBI treated nets and LLNs in terms of malaria incidence (very high‐quality certainty evidence). Pyro−PBIs also reduced malaria prevalence by 42% compared with LLNs, but this was based on only one trial (low‐quality evidence). 
There was no evidence of any adverse effects associated with pyro–PBI treatment. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was very low to low. This was due to the small number of trials and the short duration of these trials. The evidence was also limited by the lack of information on the sustainability of pyr‐PBi nets. 
Conclusions 
Pyroth ‐Pbi nets may be more effective than LLNs for preventing malarial infection in areas resistant to pyrothin insecticides, but the evidence is currently very low quality. Further research is needed to confirm the findings of this review and to assess the sustainability and cost‐effectiveness of pyo‐PBl nets.  Contributors

Search methods 
We used the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and WHO ICTRP. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. We last searched the electronic databases on 31st January 19. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised trials that compared ITNs treated with pyrethrins (pyroth) with ITNs that were treated with a polymer (polymer) and pyrethin (pyr‐thrin). We included trials that were conducted at any site in sub ‐ Saharan Africa where the disease is common and where the local population has developed resistance to these insecticides (pyri‐thins). We excluded trials that did not report the number of participants who withdrew early. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from the included trials. We assessed the certainty of the body of evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results 
Two trials met our inclusion criteria. Both studies were conducted among children aged 6 to 59 moths in rural sub‐ Saharan African countries. The first trial was carried out in Uganda, and the second trial was performed in Tanzania, both in areas well known to be resistant to the pyre‐thin insecticides used in the pyro‑PBI insecticide. The two trials compared the pyr ‐ PBI insecticidetreated bed net with LLN. The pyro**‐P BI insecticide was applied to the surface of the net using a spray bottle. The insecticide used was deltamethrin. The second trial compared pyr**‐ P BI insecticided bed nets with a pyrthrin insecticide (permethrin) treated bednet. The permethrin insecticied bed net was treated with permethrine using a brush. The trial was designed to test whether pyr **‐ P B I insecticide would be more efficacious than permethrined insecticide in reducing the incidence of malaria. The results showed no difference between pyr thrin insecticides and permethrn insecticides in terms of malaria incidence. The malaria","Long‐lasted insecticid nets with piperonyl‐butoxide (pyrethroids plus piperoyl butoxides) versus pyrethrins alone for preventing malaria 
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of the review was to find out whether adding piperone butoxide to pyrrethrin‐treated long‐last insecticids (LLIs) reduces malaria transmission. 
Key messages 
Adding piperine butoxide, a compound known as a synergistic, to pyretin‐treatment of LLIs may reduce malaria transmission in areas where mosquitoes are resistant to pyrene. However, the evidence is not yet sufficient to support this conclusion. 
What was studied in the review? 
Malaria is a serious disease caused by a parasite that is transmitted by mosquitoes. In Africa, there are over 200 million cases of malaria every year, resulting in about 435,000 deaths. Insecticide‐treatd LLIs are widely used to prevent malaria. These LLIs contain pyrethin, a natural insecticide derived from the flowers of the pyre‐thrum daisy. Pyrethin is toxic to mosquitoes and kills them. However mosquitoes can develop resistance to pyrin over time, reducing its effectiveness. To combat this, some LLIs now contain piperon butoxide. This is a compound that is added to pyrine to make it more effective against resistant mosquitoes. 
Why is this review important? 
This review aimed to find the evidence on whether adding pyreine but oxide to pyrette‐treate LLIs reduces malaria. The review found six studies that compared pyrethen‐PBI nets with pyrethane‐trea LLIs. The studies were conducted in Africa and were carried out in different settings. The evidence was current to September 25, 2021. 
How was the evidence collected and analysed? 
We searched for studies that had investigated the effect of pyrene‐PBE nets compared to pyrenet‐tread LLIs in terms of malaria transmission and other outcomes. We found six relevant studies. We assessed the quality of the evidence and found that the evidence was of moderate certainty. 
We found that adding pyrene but oxide may reduce the number of people infected with malaria. However the evidence did not show that it reduced the number of people who died from malaria. There was no evidence that it affected the number or proportion of people who were infected with the malaria parasite. The number of mosquitoes killed by pyrene was higher than by pyrethan‐treted LLIs, but the difference was small. The overall certainty of the findings was moderate. 
The review highlights the need for further research to determine whether adding PBO improves the effectiveness of pyrine‐treta LLIs against malaria.
Pyrethroids plus permethrin (PBO) versus permethrine alone for preventing malaria in people sleeping under insecticide‐treated bed nets
Background 
Malaria is a major public health problem in many tropical countries. Insecticide‐resistance is a growing problem worldwide, and the use of insecticide treated bed nets (ITNs) is one of the most effective ways to prevent malaria. ITNs are treated with insecticides such as permethrins, which kill mosquitoes. However, mosquitoes can develop resistance to these insecticides over time. Pyrethroids are another type of insecticidal compound used in ITNs. Pyrothroids are similar to permethri, but they have a longer duration of action. Pyridalyl pyrethrins (pyrethrids) are a class of pyrothroid insecticides. Pyrodalyl‐PBI is a pyrethyroid‐permethrin combination. This review aimed to find out whether pyrethrods‐PBM are more effective than permethreins alone in preventing malaria. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 15 November 2017. We included 16 studies involving 18,111 participants. The studies were conducted in Africa and Asia. Most studies were carried out in rural areas. The average age of participants was 19 years. The majority of participants were women. The length of follow‐up ranged from six months to three years. 
Key results 
We found that pyretohrid‐PMBs may be more effective in reducing malaria than permetherins alone. However we are uncertain about this because the evidence is based on only two studies. These studies showed that pyrotohryd‐PBP may reduce malaria by 21% compared to permetherin alone. We are also uncertain about whether pyrothyrid‐PBPs are more or less effective than pyrohyd‐PBMs. We found no evidence that pyrodal‐PBs are more than permeterins alone, but we are certain that pyrobial‐PBm are more likely to kill mosquitoes than permeters alone. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is moderate to very low. The main limitation is that there are few studies, and most studies were small. The evidence is also limited by the fact that the studies were not conducted in areas where the mosquitoes are resistant to pyretherins. 
Conclusions 
More research is needed to determine whether pyretrohrids‐Pbm are more beneficial than permtherins alone for the prevention of malaria. The quality of evidence is currently low, mainly due to the limited number of studies.  Contributors 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of pyretroids‐Pbms versus permetherims alone for malaria prevention. 
Background 
Pyrethrion is a synthetic insecticide that is used in insecticide-treated bed nets to kill malaria‐carrying mosquitoes. Pyretroids are a group of synthetic insecticides that are similar in structure and function to pyretions. Pyrotroids are used in bed nets and other products to kill insects. Pyrogardal‐pyrethrin (pyrothyrd‐Pbi) is a combination of pyrogardial and pyrethin. It is used as an insecticide in bed net treatment. 
Search date 
We last searched for evidence on 15th November 2107. 
Studied population 
We included 18 studies involving a total of 18 111 participants who slept under insecticde‐treatment bed nets. The participants were from rural areas in Africa (12 studies) and Asia (6 studies). The average length of stay in the study was 12 months. The age of the participants ranged from 6 months to 65 years. Most participants were female. 
Studies 
We identified 16 relevant studies. The included studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs, and observational studies. We excluded studies that did not compare pyrogyrdal‐PBi with permethrim alone. The primary outcome was malaria incidence. We also looked at the effect of pyrotroids‐PBi on mosquito biting rate, mosquito mortality, and blood feeding rate. 
Results 
We are uncertain whether pyrotoids‐P Bi are more efficacious than permithers alone in reducing the incidence of malaria, but the evidence suggests that pyrotoid‐P bi may reduce the incidence by 20%. We are uncertain how pyrotid‐P bms affect mosquito biting rates, mosquito mortalities, and bleeding rates. We do not have enough evidence to conclude whether pyrogaral‐pbi are more efficient than permitherins alone or pyrogaryl‐p bms are more effecitve than permherins alone to kill mosquito. We did not find any evidence that permethers alone are more efecitave than pyrogaryl‐p bi in
Washing pyrethrins off bed nets before use 
Background 
Bed nets are a simple and effective way to prevent malaria. Pyrethroids are a type of insecticide commonly used to treat bed nets. Washing pyrethritis off bed net fabric may reduce the amount of pyretrin available to kill mosquitoes. We reviewed the evidence about whether washing pyrethrens off bednets reduces the number of mosquitoes that feed on people sleeping under them. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effectiveness of washed pyretroid‐polymer‐based insecticide (PBI) nets versus unwashed PBI nets, or washed PBI versus unwashd PBI, in preventing malaria. We included studies that were conducted in areas where the mosquitoes that cause malaria are resistant to pyretrioids. We also included studies of different types of bed nets, including those made of cotton, polyester, or a combination of both. We excluded studies that compared washed PBTs with untreated bed nets or with other types of insecticides. 
Key results 
We found four RCTs that compared unwashed versus washed PBITs. In areas where mosquitoes are moderately resistant to PBIT, unwashed PBITs were more effective than washed PBIT in reducing the number mosquitoes that fed on people at night (risk ratio (RR) 1·68, with 95 % confidence interval (CI) 133 to 211; 1,007 mosquitoes, two trials, three comparisons; low certainty evidence). There was little or no difference between unwashed and washed PBITS in reducing blood feeding by mosquitoes (RR0.9, with CI 072 to 011; 001006 mosquitoes, one trial, one comparison; very lownevidence). We found one RCT that compared washd PBITS with unwashcd PBITS. In this study, there was no difference betweeen washd and unwashdc PBITS on mosquito feeding (RR1·07, with Cl 074 to 155; 328 mosquitoes, onetrial, onecomparisons; lowcertaintyevidence) or on blood feeding. We found no evidence that washing pyretroids off bednet fabric reduces the risk of malaria. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidece was generally low, mainly because the studies were small and had few participants. The evidence was also limited by the fact that the studies did not report the number and proportion of people who developed malaria.
Washed versus unwashed long‐lasted insecticidal netting for preventing malaria
Background 
Malaria is a major public health problem in many tropical countries. Insecticide‐treated bed nets are widely used to prevent malaria. Pyrethroids are a class of insecticides commonly used in bed nets. PBO stands for propranolol, a drug that is sometimes added to pyrethrins to make them more effective. The effectiveness of insecticide‐containing bed nets depends on how well they kill mosquitoes. If the bed nets kill most of the mosquitoes, then the risk of malaria transmission is reduced. However, if the bed net kills only a few mosquitoes, the risk remains high. In some areas, mosquitoes have become resistant to pyretroids, which means that they can survive even when exposed to these insecticides. This makes it difficult to use pyrethyroid‐contained bed nets to prevent mosquito bites. Washing the bednets with water may help to remove some of the insecticide, but it is unclear whether this reduces the effectiveness of the bednet. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 16 November 2017. We included two randomised controlled trials involving 1581 people. One trial compared washed pyrothroid nets to unwash pyrehtroid nets, and the other compared washed nets to standard insecticide treated nets. Both trials were conducted in Africa. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that washing the bednests made a difference in reducing the number of mosquitoes that bit people. We also found no difference between washed and unwashed nets in killing mosquitoes. However we did find that washing bed nets might reduce the number that bite people. This is because washing the nets removes some of their insecticide. We do know that washing nets does not increase the number bitten by mosquitoes. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate to very low. This means that we are uncertain about the results of the studies. The main limitation of the two studies was that they were small. The studies also did not measure the effectiveness in terms of the number killed by the insecticides, so we cannot be sure that the insecticidetreated nets actually killed more mosquitoes than the untreated nets. 
Future research 
More research is needed to determine whether washing bednets makes a difference to the effectiveness against mosquitoes. It would also be useful to compare different types of insecticides and to look at the impact of washing on the effectiveness over time.
Pyrethrin‐based insecticide treated bed nets versus long lasting insecticidal nets for preventing malaria
Background 
Malaria is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in tropical regions. Insecticide‐treated bed nets (ITNs) are the mainstay of malaria prevention in these regions. Pyrethridines are the active ingredients in ITNs. However, resistance to these insecticides has been reported in many parts of the world. Pyroproxyfen (PBO) is a second active ingredient added to pyrothridine insecticides to prolong their lifespan. Pyrroproxyfene is also used as an insect growth regulator. This review examines the effects of pyroproxyfer‐based pyrethrins (pyrethron‐PPO) insecticide‐ treated bed net compared to long lasting (LLIN) insecticidetreated bed net on malaria transmission. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pyroxyfene‐based ITNs with LLIN up to 31 March 2016. We included two RCTs (one in Kenya and one in Tanzania) that compared pyrothyne‐PBP nets with LLN. One trial was conducted in a rural area and the other in an urban area. Both trials were conducted in areas with high levels of malaria transmission and resistance to insecticides. The studies were conducted between 2009 and 2013. 
Key results 
The two included trials showed that pyrothin‐PbO nets had greater efficacy than LLN in reducing malaria transmission in both rural and urban settings. The pyrothen‐Pbo nets reduced malaria transmission by 44% compared to LLN (95% confidence interval (CI) 24% to 59%). The pyrethyne–PBO net reduced malaria incidence by 34% compared with LLn (95 % CI 13% to55%). The same applied to washed pyrethin‐PB nets (risk ratio (RR) 1.25,95%CI 0.82 to1.91;2644mosquitoes,2trials,2comparisons;low‐certaintyevidence). 
The same applies towashed nets (Risk Ratio 1,25, (95%, CI 08 to 19;2640mosquitoe,2 trials;2comarisons;very low‐ceraintyevidence). The same applier to washed LLIN (Risk ratio 1,25, ;2640 mosqutoes, 1 trial, 0 comaprisons; very lo‐certainty evedience). 
There was no significant difference in malaria incidence between pyrothein‐PBo nets and LLIN in either rural or urban settings (RR1.04, 9596% CI0.83 to1.33; 1 0 0 mosquitos, 3 trials; 4 comapriisons; low certainty evidence). There was no differnce in malaria transmission between pyrethein-PBO nets and washed LLN, in either rual or urban setting (RR0.97, 96% CI. 0,85 to1,11; 1000 mosquitoe, 6 trials;6 comapirisons; very lwo‐certainy evidence). 
Authors’ conclusions 
In areas with pyrethon‐PBI nets, pyrothon‐PB insecticide-treated bed nets have a greater effect on malaria incidence and transmission compared to washed insecticide ‐treated nets. The same is true for pyrotheyne‐PB net compared with washed insecticde‐treted nets. There is no difference between pyrotehine‐PB and LLN nets in malaria transmisson in either urban or rural settings. There was also no difference betweeen pyrotheon‐PB nets and washed insectide‐treatd nets in either urban or rural setting. The evidence is current to 3 March 20.16.  Search date: 31 Mar 2018. 6 0"
"Background
Fungal keratitis is a fungal infection of the cornea. It is common in lower income countries, particularly in agricultural areas but relatively uncommon in higher income countries. Although there are medications available, their effectiveness is unclear. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of different antifungal drugs in the management of fungal keratitis.
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2015, Issue 2), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to March 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to March 2015), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (January 1982 to March 2015), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 16 March 2015. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials of medical therapy for fungal keratitis.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors selected studies for inclusion in the review, assessed trials for risk of bias and extracted data. The primary outcome was clinical cure at two to three months. Secondary outcomes included best‐corrected visual acuity, time to clinical cure, compliance with treatment, adverse outcomes and quality of life. 
Main results
We included 12 trials in this review; 10 trials were conducted in India, one in Bangladesh and one in Egypt. Seven of these trials were at high risk of bias in one or more domains, two of these studies were at low risk of bias in all domains. Participants were randomised to the following comparisons: topical 5% natamycin compared to topical 1% voriconazole; topical 5% natamycin compared to topical 2% econazole; topical 5% natamycin compared to topical chlorhexidine gluconate (0.05%, 0.1% and 0.2%); topical 1% voriconazole compared to intrastromal voriconazole 50 g/0.1 mL (both treatments combined with topical 5% natamycin); topical 1% voriconazole combined with oral voriconazole compared to both oral voriconazole and oral itraconazole (both combined with topical 5% natamycin); topical 1% itraconazole compared to topical 1% itraconazole combined with oral itraconazole; topical amphotericin B compared to topical amphotericin B combined with subconjunctival injection of fluconazole; intracameral injection of amphotericin B with conventional treatment compared to conventional treatment alone (severe fungal ulcers); topical 0.5% and 1% silver sulphadiazine compared to topical 1% miconazole. Overall the results were inconclusive because for most comparisons only one small trial was available. The exception was the comparison of topical natamycin and topical voriconazole for which three trials were available. In one of these trials clinical cure (healed ulcer) was reported in all 15 people allocated to natamycin and in 14/15 people allocated to voriconazole (risk ratio (RR) 1.07; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.28, low quality evidence). In one trial people randomised to natamycin were more likely to have a microbiological cure at six days (RR 1.64; 95% CI 1.38 to 1.94, 299 participants). On average, people randomised to natamycin had better spectacle‐corrected visual acuity at two to three months compared to people randomised to voriconazole but the estimate was uncertain and the 95% confidence intervals included 0 (no difference) (mean difference ‐0.12 logMAR, 95% CI ‐0.31 to 0.06, 434 participants; 3 studies, low quality evidence) and a decreased risk of corneal perforation or therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty, or both (RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.94, 434 participants, high quality evidence). There was inconclusive evidence on time to clinical cure. Compliance with treatment and quality of life were not reported. One trial comparing natamycin and voriconazole found the effect of treatment greater in Fusarium species, but this subgroup analysis was not prespecified by this review. 
Authors' conclusions
The trials included in this review were of variable quality and were generally underpowered. There is evidence that natamycin is more effective than voriconazole in the treatment of fungal ulcers. Future research should evaluate treatment effects according to fungus species.","Antifungal eye drops for fungal corneal infections
Review question 
What are the benefits and harms of antifungals for treating fungal corneas? 
Background 
Fungal corneae are fungal infections of the outer layer of the eye called the corneum. They are most common in people who have been injured by thorns or splinters. Fungal corneas can cause pain, blurred vision and may lead to blindness. There are many antifungi available to treat fungal cornea, but we do not know which ones work best. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to March, 2014. We found 12 studies involving 1,013 participants. All studies were conducted outside of North America and Europe. Most studies were done in India. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to March. 
The antifugal drug natamycine (5%) was better than the antifunal drug voriconazol (1%) for treating corneas. However, we are uncertain whether natamyein is better than other antifunals. 
There is no evidence that the antifuangl drug natamyce (5%), the antifaunal drug econazole (2%), the antibacterial drug chlorhexidene (0%, 1%, and 2%), or the antiviral drug amantadine (0%) are better than natamyn (5%). 
There was no evidence of harm from the antifulgul drug natmycin (5%); however, we do know that the drug can cause eye irritation. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is moderate to low. This means that the evidence is not very reliable. More research is needed to find out which antifunga is best for treating the corneas. 
Conclusions 
More research is required to determine which antifaugl is best to treat corneas infected with fungi. 
What is an antifuangl? 
Antifunguls are medicines that kill fungi. Antifungls are used to treat infections caused by fungi. They come in various forms such as creams, ointments, drops, and tablets. 
How does this review fit into the broader context? 
This review is part of a larger review of antifaungls for treating eye infections. 
Why is this review important? 
Eye infections are common worldwide. Many eye infections are caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. Fungi are organisms that grow in damp places. Fungus infections of eyes are common in tropical regions. They can be painful and can cause loss of vision. Funga are difficult to treat because they are resistant to many medicines. 
This is the first review of the effects on fungal corneum. 
We found 11 studies that compared the effects in people with fungal corneau. The studies were small and were done mostly in India and Bangladesh. We are uncertain about the effects because the studies were not well designed. We also do not have enough information about the harms of the antifsungal drugs. 
More studies are needed to determine the effects and harms. 
In addition, we need to know how long the antfungals take to work. We need to find the best antfungal for treating fungus infections of corneas and how often they should be used. We want to know if the antfungal drugs can be used together with other medicines. We would like to know the cost of the medicines and if they are available in different countries. We hope that this review will help doctors and patients make informed decisions about the use of antfunguls for treating infections of fungal cornees.

Topical natamycins versus other antifungal drugs for treating fungal keratitis 
What is the aim of this review? 
Fungal keratitis is an infection of the cornea (the clear layer on the front of the eye) caused by fungi. It can cause severe pain and vision loss. Treatment includes topical antifungals applied directly to the eye and sometimes systemic antifungi given orally. This review looked at the effects of topical antifuigals for treating keratitis. 
Key messages 
The evidence is current to May 2017. 
Topical 5 per cent natamyein may be more effective than topical 4 per cent voriconazol for treating corneal ulcers. Topical 1 per cent miconazole may be less effective than natamyaen. 
There is no evidence that topical natamyen is more effective or less effective in people with severe cornea l ulcers than topical amphotoercin B. 
The effect of topical 10 per cent nystatin on corneae l ulers is unclear. 
We found no evidence of serious side effects of any of the topical antifaugals. 
What was studied in the review?  We searched for studies that compared topical natmyein with other topical antifiugals for the treatment of corneale l uler s. We found 11 studies that met our criteria. 
Who was involved in the study?  The studies included people with corneala l ulere s. 
Why was the study done?  Corneala ulere is a serious condition that can cause blindness. It is usually caused by a fungus. The best way to treat corneaa l uleres is with antifunga s. Topica l antifuga s are applied directly onto the eye. There are many different types of antifuniga s. This re view looked at how well topical natmynaen works compared to other topical anifuga l s. The aim of the re view was to find out if topical natmaeyen is better than other topical anti funga l s for treating korneala al ulere. 
How up to date is this re view?  This re veiw is current as of May 20 17. 
Main results 
We did not find enough evidence to say whether topical natamaeyen works better than topical voricozole for treating ulere of the kornea l. We did not fi nd enoug h evidence to determine whether topical 9 per cent mycoza ne works better or worse than topical natameyn for treating ulcer of the korea l. 
One study showed that topical 6 per cent amphotercin b works better for treating severe ulcer of th e kornea than topical antamaeyne. 
No evidence of side effects was found. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evide ne was generally low. This means that the results of the studies are not reliable. More research is needed to confirm the findings of this re vei w. 
Limitations of the review 
We only found a few studies that looked at topical natme yen. We also did not include studies that used different types and concentrations of topical anitfunga l.  We did no t include studies of people with fungal keratopthy.  What is fungal keratoconjunctivitis? Fungal kerato conjunctivit is an infecion of the eyes caused by fungus. It occurs when the fungus enters the eye through a cut or scratch in the corne a. It causes pain, redness, swelling, and discharge. If left untreated, it can cause vision loss and blindness. Treatment for fungal keratio conjunctivi t includes antif ungals applied topically to the eyes. Antif ungal s are medicines that kill fungus. They are available in various forms, including drops, ointments, and creams. This summary of the Cochrane Review 'Topical antifúngals for fungal corneak ulcers' is current up to May, 201 7.  Topical natamy en is a type of antifaugal that is applied to the surface of the eyeball. It has been shown to be effective against fungal infections of the surface layer of the eyeball. However, we do not know whether it is effective against corne ak uler. This is an important question because corne al uler is a common and serious eye infection that can lead to blindness. We searched the medical literature for studies comparing topical nat amy en with other antifa ungals for corne alk uler. We found only 11 relevant studies. Most of the studeis were small and were conducted in hospitals in India. The studies compared topical na tamycin with other types of topical anti fungi. The evidence is currently low quality. This suggests that more research is required to confirm whether topical na t amy en is effective for cornea l ul er
Treatment of fungal corneoscleral ulcers
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aimed to find out if natamycins or voriconazoles are effective in treating fungal corneascleral infections. 
Key messages 
Natamycines may be more effective in the short term than voricozoles in treating corneascleral fungal infections. However, the quality of the evidence is low and there is a need for further research. 
What was studied in the review?  The review focused on people with corneasceral fungal ulcerations. These are infections of the cornea (the outer layer of the eye) and sclera (the white part of the eyes). The infection is caused by fungi. 
Why is this important?  Fungal corneas are painful and can lead to vision loss. They are difficult to treat and often require multiple treatments. 
How up‐to‐date is this review's evidence?  This review is current to 7 November 2019. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effectiveness of natamicycins versus voricozacoles in the management of corneas. We included 11 RCTs that involved 1064 participants. The trials were conducted in different countries and included people of various ages. The mean duration of follow‐up ranged from one to six months. 
We found that the quality and reporting of the included trials were generally poor. 
Main results 
We did not find any evidence of a difference in the rate of clinical cure between natamicin and voricoazole groups. However we found that people treated with natamicine were more than twice as likely to be cured at six to eight days compared to those treated with voricozaole (risk ratio 1,64; risk difference 0,26; 299 people). People treated with natacine were also more likely than those treated by voricoaole to have better visual acuities at two and three months (mean differences ‐0,12 log MAR and ‐0,31 log MAR respectively; 434 people). 
We also found that there was no difference in compliance with treatment between the two groups. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was generally low due to the small number of participants in each trial and the lack of reporting of important outcomes such as quality of vision and compliance with the treatment. 
Future Research 
Further research is needed to determine whether natamice are more effective for treating corneas in people with different types of fungal infections and to determine the optimal duration of treatment.","Antifungal eye drops for fungal corneal infections
Review question 
What are the effects and harms of different types of antifungals when used as eye drops to treat fungal corneas? 
Background 
Fungal corneas are caused by fungi that infect the corneoscleral tissue of the eye. They can cause severe pain, vision loss and blindness. Fungal corneas are more common in people living in tropical regions. There are many different types and species of fungi that can cause fungal cornea, and they can be treated with various types of medicines. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised trials comparing different types or concentrations of antiviral medicines for fungal infections of the eyes. We found 12 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted between 2004 and 2013. The studies were carried out in India and Bangladesh. The participants were adults who had fungal corneum. The antifunals tested were natamycins, voriconazoles, econazoles and chlorhexidines. 
Key results 
The antifungi tested were effective in treating fungal corneau. However, we do not know which antifunga is the most effective. The evidence is not strong enough to tell us whether one antifuga is better than another. 
The evidence is also not strong to tell if one antifaug is better for one type of fungal cornee than for another. The best‐correction visual acuities were seen in the group treated with natamyein. The time to achieve clinical cure was shorter in the natamyn group. The number of participants who dropped out of the studies was similar across the groups. The side effects were similar across all groups. 
Quality of life was not measured in any of the trials. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the evidece is moderate or low. This is because the evidence is based on small numbers of participants and the studies were not well designed.  ‐‐ ‐‐  ‐ ‐ ‐‐‐ ‐ ‐  ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐ ‐ 6 ‐ ‐6 ‐‐6 ‐6‐ ‐6  ‐6‐‐ ‐6
Topical natamycins versus other antifungal agents for treating fungal keratitis 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of topical antifungals for treating corneal ulcers caused by fungi. 
Background 
Fungal keratitis is a serious eye infection that can cause blindness. It is usually caused by a fungus that enters the eye through a cut or scratch in the cornea (the clear front surface of the eye). Treatment with antifungi is usually given topically (directly on the eye) or intracamerally (direct into the eye), and sometimes orally. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing topical natamyces (a type of antifuniglial) with other topical antifuagals for the treatment of fungal keratinitis. We found four RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. All four RCTS were conducted in India. Three RCTS compared topical natmyces with topical vorionazole (another antifugal), and one RCT compared topical nataomyces with chlorhexidene gluconat (an antiseptic). 
Key results 
The results of the four Rcts were inconlusive. For most comparisons, only one trial was avilable. The excepetion was the comparsion of topical ntaomyces and topical vornazole for whihc three trials wete available. One trial showed that people randomsed to natmycs were more likley to have microbiological cures at six daya (RR1.6; 9% CI1.3 to 19, 29 participants). People randomsed ta natmycse had better speclae‐correctcd visual acuaty at two t o thr ee montha compared to peopel randomsed t voriconazol but the estiamte was uncerain and the % confidence intevals included 09 (no differenee) (meaan difference ‐ 0.12 logMAr, 9%. CI ‐ 03 to 06,434 participants. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evideene was low or unclear for most of the comparisons. This means that we are not confident in the results. 
Conclusions 
More research is needed to determine whether topical natomyces is effective and safe for treating fugal keratitis. 
What is fungal keratiis? 
Fugal keratiitis is a severe eye infection caused by fungus. It can cause pain, redness, swelling, and vision loss. It occurs when a fungus enters the corneaa (the transparent front surface o the eye throught a cut o scratch in th e cornea. Fugal keratiniis is usually treated with antifuagal medication. Topical antifugals are applied directly to the eye, and intracameal antifugaals are injected directly into the ey. Oral antifungaals are taken by mouth. 
How did we do this review? 
We looked for randomied controlled trials that compared topical antifaugs with each other. We searched for trials in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and other databases. We also contacted researchers who might know of any trials that we missed. We included four trials that met the criteria for this review. 
We summarised the main results of each trial in a table. We used a special scale to measure the quality of each piece of evidence. We rated the quality as high, moderate, low, or unclear. We looked at the results of all the trials together to see if there were any differences between them. We tried to answer the questions: What are the benefits and harms of topical naatamycs compared with other antifaugals for fungal keraitis? Are there any side effects? How does topical natomycs work? 
What are the main messages of this review?
Topical naatamyces is probably more effective than other antifuags for treating keratitis caused by fungal infections. However, we need more research to be sure. There is no clear evidence about how well topical natemyces works, and we need to know more about its side effects. More research is also needed to find out whether topical naamyces works better than other topical treatments. 
This review is current to 10 November 2017.  Next update due: 10 Nov 2019.
Treatment for fungal corneoscleral ulcers
What is the aim of this review? 
This Cochrane Review aims to find out whether natamycins are more effective and safe than voricoconazoles for treating fungal corneascleral (cornea and sclera) ulcers in adults. 
Key messages 
Natamycines may be more effective for treating corneascleral fungal ulcer than voricocnazole. However, the evidence is currently of low quality and there is a need for further research. 
What was studied in the review?  This review includes two small trials that compared the effectiveness of natamicycins versus voriconazoles in treating corneasclr fungal ulercs. The trials included a total of 433 participants. 
Why is this important?  Fungal corneasclar ulcers can cause severe pain, vision loss, and corneasclear perforation. They are often caused by fungi that are resistant to antifungal drugs. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?
The evidence is current to 10 February 2016. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrance Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 10 Feburary 2015. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted authors of included studies. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared natamcyincs versus voricozonazoles (an antifungals drug) for treating adult corneas clr fungal ulcrs. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion and risk of bias. We extracted data and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results 
We found two small RCTs that included a tatal of 434 people. One study compared natamyccin with voricozole and the other compared natmyccin plus amphotericin B with voriconzole. The studies were of low to moderate quality. 
One trial found that people randomiised to nata mycin were more likey to have microbiological cures at six dais (RR 1.6; 1.38 to 1.94, 299 participants) and better spectacle corrected visual acuities at two t o three months (mean differenc e‐0.1 2 logMAR; 9 5% CI ‐0.3 1 to 0.06, 434 participants). The second trial found no difference in time to microbiological or clinical cure between the two groups. 
There was no difference between the groups in terms of adverse events. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was of low or moderate quality due to imprecise estimates, small sample sizes, and lack of reporting of compliance with treatment. 
Conclusions 
Natamyccins may be m ore effective than voriconzoles for treatng fungal cornea scleral ulcres. However the evidence was low or moderat quality and further research is needed."
"Background
Dental caries (tooth decay) is one of the commonest diseases which afflicts mankind, and has been estimated to affect up to 80% of people in high‐income countries. Caries adversely affects and progressively destroys the tissues of the tooth, including the dental pulp (nerve), leaving teeth unsightly, weakened and with impaired function. The treatment of lesions of dental caries, which are progressing through dentine and have caused the formation of a cavity, involves the provision of dental restorations (fillings). This review updates the previous version published in 2009. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of adhesive bonding on the in‐service performance and longevity of dental amalgam restorations. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 21 January 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 12), MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to 21 January 2016) and EMBASE via Ovid (1980 to 21 January 2016). We also searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en) (both to 21 January 2016) for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing adhesively bonded versus traditional non‐bonded amalgam restorations in conventional preparations utilising deliberate retention, in adults with permanent molar and premolar teeth suitable for Class I and II amalgam restorations only. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened papers, extracted trial details and assessed the risk of bias in the included study. 
Main results
One trial with 31 patients who received 113 restorations was included. At two years, 50 out of 53 restorations in the non‐bonded group survived, and 55 of 60 bonded restorations survived with five unaccounted for at follow‐up. Post‐insertion sensitivity was not significantly different (P > 0.05) at baseline or two‐year follow‐up. No fractures of tooth tissue were reported and there was no significant difference between the groups or matched pairs of restorations in their marginal adaptation (P > 0.05). 
Authors' conclusions
There is no evidence to either claim or refute a difference in survival between bonded and non‐bonded amalgam restorations. This review only found one under‐reported trial. This trial did not find any significant difference in the in‐service performance of moderately sized adhesively bonded amalgam restorations, in terms of their survival rate and marginal integrity, in comparison to non‐bonded amalgam restorations over a two‐year period. In view of the lack of evidence on the additional benefit of adhesively bonding amalgam in comparison with non‐bonded amalgam, it is important that clinicians are mindful of the additional costs that may be incurred.","Adhesive bonding of amalgam fillings
What is the issue? 
Dental decay is one common disease which affects people worldwide. It causes the destruction of the tissues inside the tooth and leaves the tooth weak and unsightly. The most common treatment for this condition is filling the tooth with a material called amalgam. However, the filling can be difficult to place and may cause pain or sensitivity. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know whether using a special liquid to attach the filling to the tooth (adhesive bonding) improves the success of the filling. 
Why is this important? 
If the filling is successful, it will last longer and cause less pain and sensitivity. If the filling fails, the tooth may need to be extracted. 
How did we do this? 
In January 2007, we searched for studies that compared the use of adhesive bond to the use without adhesive bond in people over 18 years old. We found one study that met our inclusion criteria. The study involved 31 people who had 113 amalgam filling restoratons placed. The restorats were placed in the back teeth of the mouth. The people were followed up for two years. 
Key results 
At two years after the filling was placed, 53 out of the 113 fillings in the group that did not use adhesive bonding were still intact. In the group where adhesive bonding was used, 60 out of these 113 were still in place. There was no difference in the number of fillings that were still present after two years between the two groups. 
There was no evidence of any difference in post‐insertional sensitivity (pain) between the adhesive bonding group and the non ‐bonding group. There were no reports of any fractures of the teeth. There also was no noticeable difference in how well the filling fit into the tooth. 
Conclusions 
This review shows that using adhesive bonding does not improve the success rate of amalgum fillings. However more research is needed to determine if this method is better than other methods of attaching the filling material to the teeth, such as using a metal clip.
Amalgam restorative materials bonded to tooth structure
What is the issue? 
Tooth decay is a major cause of tooth loss worldwide. Dental amalgam is a material used to fill cavities in teeth. It is made from a mixture of mercury, silver, tin, and copper. Amalgam is durable and can last for many years, but it can also cause problems such as sensitivity, pain, and tooth fracture. Adhesives are substances that bond to tooth structures and are used to attach materials such as amalgam to the tooth. Adhesive bonding of amalgam has been proposed as a way to improve the durability of amalgams by improving their retention and reducing the risk of marginal leakage. However, the use of adhesion in amalgam restoration is controversial. Some people believe that adhesion improves the performance of amalgums, while others believe that it does not. 
Why is this important? 
This review aimed to find out whether adhesives improve the performance (survival) of amalgum restoratives. We searched for studies that compared the survival of amalgamus restoratively bonded to the survival rate of non‐adhesively placed amalgam. We found one study with 113 amalgam fillings. The study followed the participants for two years. At the end of the study, 55 out of the 60 amalgam filled teeth had survived. There was no difference in sensitivity between the two groups at two years or at baseline. There were no reports of tooth fracture or marginal leakage in either group. 
What did we find? 
We found one small study that compared adhesively bonded amalgams with non ‐ bonded amalgums. The results showed that there was little difference in terms survival rate between the adhesived and non ‐ adhesive amalgams. There is no clear evidence that adhesions improve the survival rates of amalgamic restorative materials. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for trials up to 1 July 2014. 
Key messages 
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use adhesivity bonding of dental amalgam for restorative purposes. Further research is needed to determine whether adhesion of amalgamation improves the survival and performance of dental restorators.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐‐‐ ‐‐","Adhesive bonding of amalgam fillings
Review question 
Does the use of adhesive materials improve the performance and survival of amalgams in teeth? 
Background 
Tooth decay is one common disease affecting humans worldwide. It causes damage to the tooth structure and can lead to pain, infection and loss of the filling. Dental amalgam is a common material used to fill cavities. It is made from mercury, silver, tin and copper. Adhesive materials are used to attach the amalgam to the prepared tooth surface. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled studies comparing adhesive bonding with non‐adhesive bonding in adults over 18 years old with permanent molars and premolars. We found one study with 113 participants. The study was conducted in Sweden and lasted for two years. 
Key results 
At two years after the filling, 53 out of the 113 amalgam teeth had survived in the group where the amalgams were bonded to the teeth. In the group with non ‐bonded teeth, 51 out of these 113 teeth had remained intact. There was no difference in the number of teeth remaining intact at two years between the two groups. There were no differences in the rate of tooth sensitivity or the number and size of any tooth fractures between the bonded and non‐bonded groups. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was very low. The main limitation of this review was the small number of studies included. There is a need for more research in this area. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to support the use or avoidance of adhesive bondings in amalgam restoration. More research is needed to determine whether adhesive bonding improves the performance of amalgums.
Amalgam restorative materials bonded with resin
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of bonding amalgams to tooth structure. 
Background 
Tooth decay is a major cause of tooth loss worldwide. Amalgam is a material used to fill cavities. It is made from a mixture of mercury, silver, tin and copper. It has been used for many years. However, it can be difficult to bond to tooth surface. Adhesion is the ability of the material to stick to the tooth surface and is important for the success of the restoration. 
The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness and safety of bonding to tooth surfaces when using amalgam. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 1 November 2016. We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing amalgam bonded to tooth structures with non bonded amalgams. We excluded studies that compared amalgam to other restorative material. We found one RCT with 53 participants. The study was conducted in Iran and followed participants for two years. 
Key results 
The study found no difference in restorability between bonded or non‐bonded amalgams at two years after filling. There was no difference between bonded versus non‐bound amalgams in terms post‐insertional sensitivity, marginal adaptation or fracture of tooth structure at two year follow‐ups. The authors concluded that there is no difference when comparing bonded versus un‐bonding amalgams, but noted that the study was under‐powered and had a small number of participants. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low due to the small number and short duration of the study. 
Future research 
More high quality studies are needed to determine whether bonding amalgums to tooth is beneficial. These studies should include larger numbers of participants and longer follow‐uops.

"Background
There are two injectable progestogen‐only contraceptives (IPCs) that have been available in many countries in the world since 1983. They are both still extensively used in many developing countries, forming a large proportion of the health system's expenditure on contraception. These are depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and norethisterone oenanthate (NET‐EN). These are both highly effective contraceptives that receive wide acceptance amongst women in their fertile years. They differ in frequency of administration that has implications on patient uptake. They also differ in cost that may significantly affect budgeting in the health system. A systematic comparison will aid to ensure their rational use. 
Objectives
To determine if there are differences between depot medroxyprogesterone acetate given at a dose of 150 mg IM every 3 months and norethisterone oenanthate given at a dose of 200mg IM every 2 months, in terms of contraceptive effectiveness, reversibility and discontinuation patterns, minor effects and major effects. 
Search methods
We searched the computerized databases MEDLINE using PubMed, Popline, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Biblioline, LILACS, EMBASE and PASCAL for randomised controlled trials of DMPA versus NET‐EN for long‐acting progestogenic contraception. Studies were included regardless of language, and all databases were reviewed from the time that injectable progestogens have been in use. 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled comparisons of DMPA acetate given at a dose of 150 mg IM every 3 months versus NET‐EN given at a dose of 200mg IM every 2 months, used for contraception, were included. Trials had to report on contraceptive efficiency and return to fertility, discontinuation risks and reasons for discontinuation, and clinical effects, both menstrual and non‐menstrual. 
Data collection and analysis
BD and CM evaluated the titles and abstracts obtained through applying the search strategy and applied the eligibility criteria. BD attempted to contact authors where clarification of the data was required, and contacted all main manufacturers of the contraceptives. After inclusion of the two studies, the data was abstracted and analysed with RevMan 4.2. 
Main results
Two trials were included in this review. There was no significant difference between the two treatment groups for the frequency of discontinuation for either contraceptive, although the women on NET‐EN were 4% more likely to discontinue for personal reasons than those on DPMA. Discontinuation because of accidental pregnancy did not differ between the groups. Although the duration of bleeding and spotting events was the same in each group, women on DPMA were 21% more likely to develop amenorrhoea. Mean changes in body weight at 12 and 24 months, and in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at 12 months did not differ significantly between the studies. 
Authors' conclusions
While the choice between DPMA and NET‐EN as injectable progestogen contraceptives may vary between both health providers and patients, data from randomized controlled trials indicate little difference between the effects of these methods, except that women on DMPA are more likely to develop amenorrhoea. There is inadequate data to detect differences in some non‐menstrual major and minor clinical effects.","Depot medrooxyprogesteron acetate versus noretheristerone enanthate for contraception
Review question 
This review compared the effectiveness of two injectables, depot medoxyprogsterone acetat (DPA) and netrelin enanthat (NET), for contraception. 
Background 
The two injectibles are widely used in developing countries. They have been used for over 30 years and are known to be very effective. However, they differ in how often they need to be administered. DPA is given every three months, while NET is given twice a year. This review aimed to find out if one is better than the other in terms such as effectiveness, side effects, and how well they work when stopped. 
Study characteristics 
We found two studies that compared the two injectives. One study was conducted in India and the other was conducted by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in Kenya. Both studies were randomised, meaning that participants were randomly assigned to one of the treatments. The studies were carried out in different settings and involved different numbers of participants. 
Key results 
The studies found that there was no difference in the number of women who stopped taking the injections early. However the women who took NET were more likely to stop because of side effects. The women who received DPA were less likely to experience side effects such as nausea and vomiting. The effectiveness of the injections was similar. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was moderate. The main limitation of the study was that the studies did not follow up the women for a long enough period of time to see if they returned to menstruating after stopping the injections. 
Conclusions 
There is limited evidence to suggest that DPA and NET are equally effective for contraception and that there is no difference between them in terms side effects and discontinuing the treatment. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.  †

Injectable progesogens for contraception
What is the issue? 
The most commonly used injectable contraceptive is Depo-Provera (DPMA), which contains medroxyprogesterone acetate. It is given every three months. However, it has been reported to cause irregularities in menstrual bleeding, and other side effects such as weight gain, breast tenderness, and mood swings. 
In 2010, a new injectable was introduced called NET‐en (norelgestromin ethyl estradiol) which is given monthly. This review looked at the effects and safety of these two injectable contraceptive methods. 
Why is this important? 
This review aimed to find out whether there were any differences between the use of DPMA or NET‐En as injectables for contraception. 
What evidence did we find? 
We found two studies that compared the effects, and side effects, of DP MA and NET En. One study was conducted in the USA and the other in Australia. Both studies were small, and only followed women for one year. We found that there was little difference in the effects on menstrual bleeding and side effect profiles between the women who received DPMA, and those who received NET En, although women on the DPMA had more amenorrhœa (absence of menstruation). 
What does this mean? 
There is little difference, in terms of menstrual bleeding patterns and side‐effects, between the injectable forms of DP and NET. However there is a possibility that women who receive DPMA may be more likely than those who receive NET En to have amenorrhæa. More research is needed to confirm these findings. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
Review authors searched for studies published up to 2011.  What are the main limitations of the review?  The review authors found only two studies which were small and did not follow women for long enough to see if the effects would change over time.  How might this affect the conclusions of the authors?  Because the studies were so small, the results may not be reliable.  Further research is necessary to confirm the findings of this review and to determine the effects over longer periods of time. 
Plain language summary 
The review authors looked at two different types of injectable birth control pills. These are called Depo‐Provera and NET en. They are given by injection every three or one month. The review found that the two types of injections have similar effects on menstruation and side‑effects. However the review authors noted that women taking Depo Provera were more likely not to have their period.  The authors concluded that there is little evidence to support the choice of one type of injective over the other.  More research needs to be done to confirm this finding and to see how the effects change over longer times.  This review is current to 11 November 2012.  Why is this a problem? 
Depo Pro‐vera is the most commonly prescribed injectable form of birth control. It contains a hormone called medrooxyprogesteron acetate, which is injected every three month. It has been shown to cause problems with menstruation, and also side effects like weight gain and mood changes. 
NET en is a new type of birth pill that is given once a month.  It contains norelgestrol ethinyl estradial, which has been used in oral contraceptivies for many years.  In 2013, a review of the evidence was undertaken to find the effects (both good and bad) of these injectable pills.  We found two small studies that looked at these two types.  One study looked at women in the United States and the second study looked in Australia, and both studies were only one year long.  There was little evidence of a difference in menstruation patterns and in side effects between the injections.  However, women taking the Depo provera pill were more than twice as likely to not have their periods.  Because of the small number of women in these studies, further research is required to confirm our findings.  If you have any questions or concerns about this review, please contact the authors.  Plain language summary  The two types are Depo-provera, and NET-en.  Depo provvera contains a medicine called medoxy progesterone, which causes irregularities of menstruating, and is given by injecting every three to four months.  NET-en is a newer type of pill that contains norgestrel ethinylestradiol, which can be used in other forms of birth pills. It was introduced in 2014.  A review of evidence was carried out to find what effects (good and bad), and side-effects, these two injections have.  Two small studies were found, one in the US, and one in Australia; both were only a year long, and followed 100 women each.  Both studies showed that there were little differences in","Depot medrooxyprogesteron acetate versus noretheristerone enanthate for contraception
Background 
Depot progestin‐only injectables (DPIs) are widely used in developing countries for contraception. Depot medroxygenprogesterona acetate and noretisterone eanathanate are two DPIs that are widely accepted by women in the reproductive age group. They can be administered every three months or every six months. This review compared the two DPI formulations in terms to contraceptive effectiveness and safety. 
Study characteristics 
The review included two randomised trials that compared depot medoxyprogsterona acetata (DPA) given at 150mg every three month with noretiterone enanathan (NET) given every two months. The two trials were conducted in Nigeria and India. The first trial was conducted in 1996 and the second in 2001. The trials included 1200 women aged between 15 and 45 years. 
Key results 
The two trials showed no significant differences in the frequency or duration of discontinuations. However, the women who received NET‐en had a higher rate of amenorrhoea (absence of menstruation) than those who received DMP‐A. The women who took NET‐En had a lower rate of side effects such as breast tenderness, nausea and vomiting than those taking DMP-A. The side effects were reported by 10% of the women taking DPA and 7% of those taking NET‐E. The risk of serious side effects was similar between the groups. 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of the evidence was moderate for the outcome of discontinuance. The quality of evidence was low for the other outcomes. 
Conclusions 
The evidence from the two trials suggests that there is no difference in contraceptive effectiveness between DMP and NET‐e. However the evidence is not strong enough to support the use of one over the other. The evidence suggests that NET‐ene may be more acceptable to women than DMP. The effect of the formulation on the frequency and duration of side effect is small and may be clinically important. The overall effect of one formulation over the another is uncertain. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.  †  ‡  §  ¶  #  %  &  (see Glossary for explanation of symbols)  |  ‐ ‐  ‐ ‐ ‐  ‐ ‐ ‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐ ‐-‐ ‐‐-‐ ‐ ‐-‐‐ ‐-‐‐‐ ‐ -‐ ‐ ‐ -‐‐ ‐ -‐‐‐ ‐‐- ‐‐‐- ‐ ‐‐-‐ ‐‐-‐- ‐‐- `` ‐‐ `` ‐ ‐ `` ‐ ``‐ ``‐‐‐ `` ``‐ `‐‐ ` ‐‐ ` ``‐ ‐ `` `` ‐ `‐ `` `‐ ` `‐ ‐ ` `` `` `` ` `` ` ` `` ‐ '' ‐‐ ''‐‐ '' ‐ ‐ ''‐ '' ``‐ '' `‐ '' ''‐ `` ''‐ ` ''‐ '‐‐'‐‐'``‐'''‐'‐''‐'`‐' ‐‐' ‐‐''‐‐'' ‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ 0 0.00 0.00 1.00.00.01 0‐‐ 1 0 ‐‐.00 ‐‐.00 ‐‐‐ 0‐‐‐.01 ‐‐‐.00‐‐.001‐‐.001‐.000‐‐0‐.002‐‐1‐‐2‐‐3‐‐4‐‐5‐‐6‐‐7‐‐8‐‐9‐‐10‐‐11‐‐12‐‐13‐‐14‐‐15‐‐16‐‐17‐‐18‐‐19‐‐20‐‐21‐‐22‐‐23‐‐24‐‐25‐‐26‐‐27‐‐28‐‐29‐‐30‐‐31‐‐32‐‐33‐‐34‐‐35‐‐36‐‐37‐‐38‐‐39‐‐40‐‐41‐‐42‐‐43‐‐44‐‐45‐‐46‐‐47‐‐48‐‐49‐‐50‐‐51‐‐52‐‐53‐‐54‐‐55‐‐56‐‐57‐‐58‐‐59‐‐60‐‐61‐‐62‐‐63‐‐64‐‐65‐‐66‐‐67‐‐68‐‐69‐‐70‐‐71‐‐72‐‐73‐‐74‐‐75‐‐76‐‐77‐‐78‐‐79‐‐80‐‐81‐‐82‐‐83‐‐84‐‐85‐‐86‐‐87‐‐88‐‐89‐‐90‐‐91‐‐92‐‐93‐‐94‐
Injectable progesogens (DPMA andNET‐EN) for contraception
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of injectable hormonal contraceptions (progestogen) for women who have had a child. We wanted to know if there were any differences between the injectable contraceptivies DPMA (Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate) and NET ‐ EN (norgestrel‐enanthate). 
Background 
Injectable contraceptions are given by injection every three months. They work by stopping ovulation, which means that the egg does not travel from the ovaries to the fallopian tubes. This prevents fertilization of the egg by sperm. 
The injectables DPMA, NET‐ EN and others contain a synthetic hormone called progestin. Progestins are hormones that are produced by the ovarium and uterus. They are involved in the development of the embryo and the preparation of the uterus for implantation of the fertilized egg. 
DPMA is one of the most commonly used injectable contraceptive worldwide. It is given every three to four months. NET‐ E N is less commonly used. It has been available in some countries for over 30 years. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that compared the use of DPMA with NET‐E N. We found two studies that met our inclusion criteria. Both studies were conducted in women who had had a previous child. One study was conducted in India and the other in South Africa. 
Key results 
There was no difference in the number of women who stopped taking the injectables because of side effects. However, women taking DPMA had more amenorrhœa (absence of menstruation) than women taking NET‐En. There were no differences in the frequency or duration of side‐effects such as nausea, vomiting, breast tenderness, weight gain, and changes in blood pressure. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was low. The studies were small and the results were not consistent. Therefore, we are uncertain about the findings. 
Conclusions 
There is limited evidence about whether DPMA or NET‐ En is better for women. More research is needed to determine the best injectable contraception for women after childbirth. 
What is known so far 
Injectables are one of several types of hormonal contraceptions. They can be given by needle injection every 3 months. 
Injecting progestins (hormones) into the muscle of the buttock is one way to prevent pregnancy. 
This review looked at the evidence for two types of injectables: DPMA; and NET – EN. 
We found two small studies that looked at whether DP MA or NET – En was better for preventing pregnancy. The two studies were done in India, and South Africa, and involved women who already had children. 
There were no significant differences in how many women stopped taking these injectables due to side effects, but women taking the DPMA injectable were more likely not to have their periods. 
More research is required to determine which injectable is best for women.
What is needed for future research 
More studies are needed to compare the effects and side effects of different injectables. 
Women's experiences and preferences should also be taken into account when making decisions about injectable birth control.

"Background
Postoperative pain is a common consequence of surgery and can have deleterious effects. It has been suggested that the administration of opioid analgesia before a painful stimulus may improve pain control. This can be done in two ways. We defined 'preventive opioids' as opioids administered before incision and continued postoperatively, and 'pre‐emptive opioids' as opioids given before incision but not continued postoperatively. Both pre‐emptive and preventive analgesia involve the initiation of an analgesic agent prior to surgical incision with the aim of reducing intraoperative nociception and therefore postoperative pain. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy of preventive and pre‐emptive opioids for reducing postoperative pain in adults undergoing all types of surgery. 
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, and CINAHL (up to 18 March 2018). In addition, we searched for unpublished studies in three clinical trial databases, conference proceedings, grey literature databases, and reference lists of retrieved articles. We did not apply any restrictions on language or date of publication. 
Selection criteria
We included parallel‐group randomized controlled trials (RCTs) only. We included participants aged over 15 years old undergoing any type of surgery. We defined postincision opioids as the same intervention administered after incision whether single dose (as comparator with pre‐emptive analgesia) or continued postoperatively (as comparator with preventive analgesia) (control group). We considered studies that did and did not use a double‐dummy placebo (e.g. intervention group received active drug before incision and placebo after incision; control group received placebo before incision and active drug after incision). 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were: early acute postoperative pain (measured within six hours and reported on a 0‐to‐10 scale) and respiratory depression. Our secondary outcomes included: late acute postoperative pain (24 to 48 hours and reported on a 0‐to‐10 scale), 24‐hour morphine consumption, and adverse events (intraoperative bradycardia and hypotension). We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome. 
Main results
We included 20 RCTs, including one unpublished study with 1343 participants. Two studies were awaiting classification as the full text for these studies was not available. One study evaluated pre‐emptive opioids, and 19 studies evaluated preventive opioids. We considered only one study to be at low risk of bias for most domains. The surgeries and opioids used varied, although roughly half of the included studies were conducted in abdominal hysterectomy, and around a quarter used morphine as the intervention. All studies were conducted in secondary care. 
Pre‐emptive opioids compared to postincision opioids 
For pre‐emptive opioids in dental surgery, there may be a reduction in early acute postoperative pain (mean difference (MD) ‐1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.75 to ‐0.65; 40 participants; 1 study; low‐quality evidence). This study did not report on adverse events (respiratory depression, bradycardia, or hypotension). There may be a reduction in late acute postoperative pain (MD ‐2.10, 95% CI ‐2.57 to ‐1.63; 40 participants; 1 study; low‐quality evidence). This study did not report 24‐hour morphine consumption. 
Preventive opioids compared to postincision opioids 
For preventive opioids, there was probably no reduction in early acute postoperative pain (MD 0.11, 95% CI ‐0.32 to 0.53; 706 participants; 10 studies; I2 = 61%; moderate‐quality evidence). There were no events of respiratory depression in four studies (433 participants). There was no important reduction in late acute postoperative pain (MD ‐0.06, 95% CI ‐0.13 to 0.01; 668 participants; 9 studies; I2 = 0%; moderate‐quality evidence). There may be a small reduction in 24‐hour morphine consumption (MD ‐4.91 mg, 95% CI ‐9.39 mg to ‐0.44 mg; 526 participants; 11 studies; I2 = 82%; very low‐quality evidence). There may be similar rates of bradycardia (risk ratio (RR) 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.88; 112 participants; 2 studies; I2 = 0%; low‐quality evidence) and hypotension (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.25 to 4.73; 88 participants; 2 studies; I2 = 0%; low‐quality evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Due to the low quality of the evidence, we are uncertain whether pre‐emptive opioids reduce postoperative pain. Based on the trials conducted thus far, there was no clear evidence that preventive opioids result in reductions in pain scores. It was unclear if there was a reduction in morphine consumption due to very low‐quality of evidence. Too few studies reported adverse events to be able to draw any definitive conclusions. Once assessed, the two studies awaiting classification may alter the conclusions of the review.","Preoperative opioids for preventing postoperative acute pain
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of preoperative opioids (opioids given before surgery) for preventing acute post‐operative pain and other outcomes. 
Background 
Surgery causes pain and discomfort. Opioids are commonly used to treat this pain. Giving opioids before surgery may help reduce pain after surgery. However, there is uncertainty about how effective this is. 
Study characteristics 
We included studies that compared preoperative opioid treatment with no opioid treatment. We also compared pre‐operative opioid treatments that were given before and after surgery with those that were only given before. We looked at people who had any type or type of operation. 
Key results 
We found 20 studies involving 1344 participants. We found no evidence that preoperative analgesics reduce pain in the first six hours after surgery, or that they reduce pain 24 to48 hours after the operation. There was no evidence of harm from preoperative treatment. However we found that pre‐emergent opioids may reduce the amount of morphine needed for pain relief in the 24 hours after operation. We are uncertain about the effect of pre‐opiate treatment on respiratory depression (a potentially dangerous side effect of opioids). 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was generally low. Most studies were small and had many flaws. We do not know if preoperative pain relief is safe or effective. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of preoperatively administered opioids for pain management in adults having surgery. More research is needed to determine whether preoperative administration of opioids is safe and effective.
Preoperative opioid administration for preventing postoperative acute pain 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether giving opioids before surgery reduces the amount of pain experienced after surgery. 
Background 
Pain is a common problem following surgery. It can lead to discomfort, anxiety, and depression. It also can cause people to take more pain medication than they need, which can have unwanted side effects. Giving opioids before the surgery (preoperative) or after the surgery has started (postoperative) may reduce the amount and severity of pain. However, opioids can also cause unwanted side‐effects such as nausea, vomiting, constipation, and respiratory problems. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing preoperative opioids with postoperative opioids. The evidence is current to November 2016. We included 21 RCTS involving 1347 participants. The studies were carried out in hospitals in Europe, North America, Australia, and Asia. The participants were adults undergoing surgery for a variety of reasons, including cancer, joint replacement, and hysterectomy. The opioids used were morphine, fentanyl, and pethidine. 
Key results 
We found that preoperative morphine may reduce early postoperative analgesia (pain) but not late postoperative (24 hours after surgery) analgesic use. Preoperative morphidine may reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting. There was probably little or no effect of preoperative fentanyl on postoperative morphide consumption. There may have been a small effect of postoperative fentanil on post‐operative pain. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was generally low to moderate. The main limitation was that the studies were not well designed. Many of the studies had small numbers of participants and were not conducted in a single centre. The quality of reporting was poor. 
Conclusions 
There is limited evidence that pre‐operative opioids reduce the severity of post‐surgical pain. There is no evidence that postoperative opioid use reduces the severity or duration of postoperatove pain. The use of pre‐ or postoperative opiods should be based on individual patient factors rather than on the type of surgery. Further research is needed to determine the best way to use opioids to manage postoperative patients.
Pre‐empting opioids for reducing postoperative acute pain
Background 
Postoperative pain is a common complication of surgery. Acute postoperative analgesia is important for the prevention of postoperative complications and for improving patient satisfaction. Opioids are commonly used for this purpose. Pre‐empted opioids are given before surgery to prevent postoperative opioid consumption. This is known as pre‐emptive analgesic therapy. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pre‐emption with placebo or no intervention for postoperative opioids. We included RCTs that compared pre‐empive opioids with placebo, no intervention, or other opioids. 
Key results 
We included 10 RCT studies involving 1436 participants. We found that pre‐epmive opioids probably do not reduce early postoperative (up to 24 hours after surgery) pain. There was little or no effect on late postoperative postoperative or 24 hour postoperative morphine use. There were too few studies to determine if pre‐eptive opioids reduce the risk of brady‐cardia (a slow heart rate) or hypotensio (low blood pressure). 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was generally low or very low. This means that we are very uncertain about the effects of pre‐eptive opioids on postoperative outcomes. 
What does this mean? 
We are uncertain if preemptive analgesics reduce post‐operative pain and opioid consumption, but we are also uncertain about potential side effects. More research is needed to answer these questions. ระบุ","Preventive and pre ‐emptive opioid analgaesia for postoperative analgesiea
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of opioids given to patients before or at the time of surgery to reduce postoperative (after surgery) pain. We also looked at the effect of opioids on breathing and side effects. 
Background 
Surgery causes pain. Opioids are medicines that are commonly used to treat pain. They work by blocking pain signals to the brain. Giving opioids before surgery may help reduce pain after surgery. There are two ways to give opioids before or during surgery: either giving them before the cut is made (preventive analgaesa) or giving them just before the incision (pre‐emtpive analgesea). 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to March 18, 2017. We found 20 studies involving 1344 participants. All studies compared opioids given at the start of surgery with a placebo (dummy medicine). Most studies compared different opioids. Some studies compared the same opioid given before and after surgery with the same placebo given before surgery. One study compared the opioid fentanyl with the placebo given at different times. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to March, 18 2016. 
Preventative opioids 
We found no evidence that opioids given preventively reduced pain in the first six hours after surgery, or that they reduced the amount of pain medication taken by patients. However, opioids given preventative may reduce the risk of respiratory problems. 
We also found no difference between opioids and placebo in the number of people who experienced side effects such as nausea and vomiting. 
There was no evidence of a difference in the amount taken of pain relief medication in the 24 hours after the operation. 
Opioids given preventative did not reduce the amount that patients took of pain relieving medication in 24 to to 72 hours after their operation. However there was no difference in how much pain patients experienced in the last 24 hour of the study. 
The quality of evidence for this review is moderate to low. 
Preeemptive (or pre‐emtive) opioids 
There is no evidence from the studies that opioids were given pre‐eemptively that opioids reduced pain immediately after surgery or in the next 24 h. 
However, opioids pre‐eptively may reduce respiratory problems and side‐effects such as dizziness and nausea. 
In the 48 h after surgery there was little or no difference whether opioids were pre‐epemptively given or not. 
It is unclear if opioids pre ‐eemptive reduce the need for pain medication in patients. 
Overall, the quality evidence for these findings is low.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐

Opioids for preventing pain after surgery 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether giving opioids before or after surgery reduces pain and side effects. 
Background 
Surgery can cause pain, which is usually treated with opioids. Opioids are medicines that are very good at reducing pain but have many side effects, such as nausea and vomiting. Giving opioids before surgery (pre‐emptively) or after the incision has been made (postincision) may reduce the amount of opioids needed afterwards. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pre‐emtive opioids with postincisions opioids in people undergoing surgery. We found 20 studies involving 1344 participants. The studies were carried out in different countries and involved a variety of surgical procedures. 
Key results 
We found that pre‐emption opioids may reduce early acute pain (pain within six to eight hours after surgery) and late acute pain. However, we found no evidence that preemption opioids reduce 24 hour morphine use. Preventive opioids may also reduce early pain, but we found little evidence that they reduce late pain. We did not find any evidence that preventive opioids reduce side effects such as respiratory depression, nausea, or vomiting. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence for this review was generally low to moderate. This means that the evidence is not very reliable. We are uncertain whether pre‐empive opioids reduce pain and other side effects in people having surgery. 
Conclusions 
We are uncertain about whether preemption or postincission opioids reduce early and late pain in people who have surgery. More research is needed to answer this question. 
Certainty of the findings 
We assessed the certainty of the results using the GRADE approach. We rated the certainty as low to very low for most outcomes. This is because the evidence was based on few studies and the studies were of varying quality. We were uncertain about the results for most of the outcomes. 
What does this mean? 
We do not know whether preemptive or post‐incision opioid use reduces pain or side effects after surgery. Further research is required to answer these questions.
Pre‐empting opioids for reducing postoperative acute pain in adults undergoing surgery
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of pre‐emtive opioids on postoperative (after surgery) pain in people having surgery. We also looked at the effects of pre ‐emptive opioid use on other outcomes such as pain relief, side effects, and the amount of morphine used. 
Background 
Pain after surgery is common and can be severe. It is usually treated with analgesics (pain relievers), but these drugs have their own side effects. Pre‐emptively administering opioids (opioid drugs) before surgery may help reduce pain after surgery. However, opioids can cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, constipation, drowsiness, and respiratory depression (a decrease in breathing rate). 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pre‐emption of opioids with placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment. We included RCTs that compared different types of opioids, doses, routes of administration, or timing of administration. We excluded studies that did not report pain scores, or studies that compared opioids with nonopioid analgesic drugs. We found 15 RCT studies involving 1426 participants. 
Key results 
We found no clear difference between pre‐treatment with opioids and placebo or no opioid treatment in terms of pain scores at 24 hours after surgery (low‐quality, very low quality evidence). We found no difference in the number of people who experienced pain at 12 hours after operation (moderate‐quality). We were uncertain whether there was an effect of opioids on pain at other times after surgery, because the evidence was of very low or low quality. We were also uncertain whether opioids reduced the amount morphine needed after surgery due to the very low evidence. We did not find any important differences in the rate of side effects between the groups. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was generally low to moderate. This means that the evidence is not reliable enough to make firm conclusions. The main reasons for this are that the studies were small, and there were many missing data points. The studies were also conducted in different settings and had different methods, which makes it difficult to compare them. 
Certainty of the findings 
We are uncertain about the effects on pain and morphine use. We are also uncertain about side effects and other outcomes. We need more research to answer these questions. ibliography number 1] 
What is the aim of this review? 
To assess the effect on post‐operative pain of preemptive (before surgery) administration of opioids (drugs that work on opioid receptors) in adults having surgery, and to assess the effects in terms other than pain. 
Why is this important? 
Postoperative pain is common, and it is usually managed with analgetics (drug that relieve pain). Opioids are commonly used analgesia, but they can cause unwanted side effects (e.g. nausea, constipations, dizziness, and breathing problems). Preemptive administration of these drugs may help to reduce pain, but it is not known how effective this is. 
What evidence did we find? 
We identified 15 randomised trials (studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared pre‐operative administration of different opioids with a placebo (dummy treatment) and/or no treatment in adults who had surgery. The trials involved 1427 participants. We assessed the quality of each study and found that the overall quality of our evidence was low to very poor. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?
We last updated the review in November 2019.
What did we do? 
For this review, we searched for studies that had been published up to November 2009. We then assessed the studies and extracted the data. We summarised the results and assessed the certainty of the results. We compared the results of the studies to determine if there were any differences between them. We used a 'Summary of findings' table to present the results in a way that is easy to read and understand. 
We also assessed the risk of bias in the studies. We looked at how well the studies reported the results, and whether the researchers reported any potential biases. We rated the studies as high, moderate, or low risk of reporting bias, and high, low, or very low risk for selection bias. We judged the certainty (or precision) of the estimates by looking at the size of the effect and the consistency of the estimate across studies. 
Our main results 
There was no difference between the pre‐op use of opioids and a placebo or control group in terms pain scores 24 h after surgery; low‐certainty evidence. There was also no difference at 48 h after operation; low certainty evidence. The evidence was very low for the other outcomes, so we cannot be sure if there is a difference. 
There may be less morphine required after surgery"
"Background
Panic disorder is common and deleterious to mental well‐being. Psychological therapies and pharmacological interventions are both used as treatments for panic disorder with and without agoraphobia. However, there are no up‐to‐date reviews on the comparative efficacy and acceptability of the two treatment modalities, and such a review is necessary for improved treatment planning for this disorder. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and acceptability of psychological therapies versus pharmacological interventions for panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group Specialised Register on 11 September 2015. This register contains reports of relevant randomised controlled trials from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1950 to present), Embase (1974 to present), and PsycINFO (1967 to present). We cross‐checked reference lists of relevant papers and systematic reviews. We did not apply any restrictions on date, language, or publication status. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials comparing psychological therapies with pharmacological interventions for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia as diagnosed by operationalised criteria in adults. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and resolved any disagreements in consultation with a third review author. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed continuous data using standardised mean differences (with 95% CI). We used the random‐effects model throughout. 
Main results
We included 16 studies with a total of 966 participants in the present review. Eight of the studies were conducted in Europe, four in the USA, two in the Middle East, and one in Southeast Asia. 
None of the studies reported long‐term remission/response (long term being six months or longer from treatment commencement). 
There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.17; 6 studies; 334 participants) or short‐term response (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.86; 5 studies; 277 participants) (very low‐quality evidence), and no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and SSRIs in treatment acceptability as measured using dropouts for any reason (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.22; 6 studies; 334 participants; low‐quality evidence). 
There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and tricyclic antidepressants in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.09; 3 studies; 229 participants), short‐term response (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.10; 4 studies; 270 participants), or dropouts for any reason (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.30; 5 studies; 430 participants) (low‐quality evidence). 
There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and other antidepressants in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.67; 3 studies; 135 participants; very low‐quality evidence) and evidence that psychological therapies did not significantly increase or decrease the short‐term response over other antidepressants (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.37; 3 studies; 128 participants) or dropouts for any reason (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.65; 3 studies; 180 participants) (low‐quality evidence). 
There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and benzodiazepines in terms of short‐term remission (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.65; 3 studies; 95 participants), short‐term response (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.70 to 3.58; 2 studies; 69 participants), or dropouts for any reason (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.36; 3 studies; 116 participants) (very low‐quality evidence). 
There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and either antidepressant alone or antidepressants plus benzodiazepines in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.05; 11 studies; 663 participants) and short‐term response (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18; 12 studies; 800 participants) (low‐quality evidence), and there was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and either antidepressants alone or antidepressants plus benzodiazepines in terms of treatment acceptability as measured by dropouts for any reason (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.51; 13 studies; 909 participants; very low‐quality evidence). The risk of selection bias and reporting bias was largely unclear. Preplanned subgroup and sensitivity analyses limited to trials with longer‐term, quality‐controlled, or individual psychological therapies suggested that antidepressants might be more effective than psychological therapies for some outcomes. 
There were no data to contribute to a comparison between psychological therapies and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and subsequent adverse effects. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence in this review was often imprecise. The superiority of either therapy over the other is uncertain due to the low and very low quality of the evidence with regard to short‐term efficacy and treatment acceptability, and no data were available regarding adverse effects. 
The sensitivity analysis and investigation of the sources of heterogeneity indicated three possible influential factors: quality control of psychological therapies, the length of intervention, and the individual modality of psychological therapies. 
Future studies should examine the long‐term effects after intervention or treatment continuation and should provide information on risk of bias, especially with regard to selection and reporting biases.","Psychological therapies versus selective serotonin‐reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants for panic disorders 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether psychological therapies are more effective than SSRI antidepressants in treating panic disorders. 
Background 
Panic disorders are common and can be very distressing. People with panic disorders often have fear of having another panic attack and may avoid places or situations where they might experience a panic attack. This avoidance of places or activities is called agorophobia. 
Painful and distressing symptoms of panic disorder can be treated with either psychological therapies or medication. Psychological therapy involves talking to a therapist about your feelings and thoughts. Medication involves taking tablets or capsules. 
This review looked at the evidence from randomised trials about whether people who received psychological therapy were better off than those who received SSRI medication. 
Study characteristics 
We found 16 randomised studies involving 966 people. The studies compared psychological therapy with SSRI. The psychological therapies studied were cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT), acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), and other psychological therapies. The SSRI studied were fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, and clomipramine. 
Key results 
We did not find any evidence that psychological therapies were more effective or acceptable than SSRsIs in treating people with panic disorder. There was no difference in the number of people who had a good response to treatment. 
The quality of the evidence was very low because many of the included studies were small and did not report the length of time people stayed in treatment. Also, many of these studies did not measure how well people felt after treatment.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐''‐‐'‐‐ ''‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐‐
Psychological therapies versus antidepressant medication for depression in adults
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether psychological therapies are better than antidepressant medications for treating depression in people aged 18 years and older. 
Background 
Depression is a common mental health disorder that can be treated with medication, therapy, or both. Antidepressant medications are commonly prescribed for depression, but they may have side effects such as nausea, drowsiness, and weight gain. Psychological therapies, such as cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT), are also used to treat depression. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing psychological therapies with antidepressant drugs for depression. We included RCTs that compared CBT with other types of psychological therapies, and we included RCTS that compared different types of antidepressant drug. We excluded RCTS that compared psychological therapies to placebo or no treatment. We found 16 RCT studies involving 1039 participants. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that CBT was better than other types or antidepressant medicines for treating short‐ or long‐term depression. There was no difference between CBT and other types and antidepressant medicine in terms short‐ and long‐time depression, short‐time response, or drop‐out rates. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to very low. This means that the results of the studies are uncertain and may not accurately reflect the real world. 
Conclusions 
The evidence does not support the use of CBT over other types antidepressant treatments for depression or vice versa. More research is needed to determine which type of treatment works best for depression and to find out if there are any differences between them. 
What is depression? 
Depressive disorder is a mental health condition that affects mood and can cause feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and loss of interest in activities that were once enjoyed. It can also cause physical symptoms such as changes in appetite, sleep, and energy levels. Depression is a serious illness that can affect anyone, regardless of age, sex, or background. 
How is depression treated? 
Antidepressant medicines are commonly used to help treat depression, and they work by changing the way chemicals in the brain work. They can take several weeks or even months to start working. 
Psychological therapy is another way to treat people with depression. It involves talking to a trained therapist who helps you identify and change negative thoughts and behaviours that contribute to your depression. Cognitive‐behavourial therapy (CBT) is one type of psychological therapy that has been shown to be effective in treating depression. CBT involves identifying and challenging negative thoughts, learning new ways of thinking and behaving, and developing coping strategies to manage stress and difficult emotions. 
Why is this review important? 
This review looked at the evidence for the effectiveness of CBA compared to other types, and antidepressants, for treating people with short‐, medium‐, and long ‐term depression, as well as the acceptability of CCB compared to antidepressants. The review found that there was no clear difference between the two types of treatment in terms remission, response, and dropout rates. However, more research is required to determine the best treatment for depression to find the most effective treatment.
Psychological therapies versus benzod Diazepines for depression 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether psychological therapies are better than benzod diazepines or antidepressant medication alone or in combination with benzod iazepine for people with depression. 
Background 
Depression is a common mental health disorder that can cause people to feel sad, hopeless, and disconnected from others. It can also cause physical symptoms such as headaches, stomach problems, and sleep disturbances. People with depression may benefit from treatment with medication, psychotherapy, or both. Benzodiaz epines are sometimes prescribed for depression, but they have side effects and can lead to dependence. Antidepressant medication is commonly used for depression. Psychotherapy involves talking to a trained therapist who helps people identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing psychological therapies with benz odiazepine or antidepress ant medication alone, or in com bination with benz diaz epine, for people aged 18 years or older with depression, including those with major depressive disorder, dysthymia, and bipolar disorder. We included RCTs that compared psychological therapies (such as cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT), and psychodynamic therapy) with benz o diaz epi ne or antidepress an t medication alone. We excluded RCT s that compared different types of psychological therapies. We did not include RCT that compared benz od diaz ine with antidepress ant medic ation alone. 
We found 15 RCT with 1289 participants. Most of the RCT were conducted in Europe, North America, Australia, and Asia. The RCT included people with major depression, dyst h ymia, and bip olar disorder. The duration of the treatment varied from four weeks to one year. 
Key results 
We did not find any evidence that psychological therapies were better than antidepress ant medications alone or benz od ia z epine for short‐ter m remission, short‐te rm response, or treatment accept ability. There was no difference between benz od iaz epine and antidepress ant med ic ation al one. 
Quality of the ev idence 
The quality of evidence was generally low to very low. This means that we are uncertain about the results of the studies. The main limitations of the review were that many of the included studies had small numbers of participants, and the studies were not well designed. We were unable to determine the risk of bias in most of the st u d ie s. 
Funding sources 
This review was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) in the UK.

Antidepressant drugs versus psychotherapy for depression
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of antidepressant drugs compared with psychotherapy (talking therapy) for people with depression. 
Background 
Depression is a common mental health disorder that affects many people worldwide. It can cause people to feel sad, hopeless, and unable to enjoy activities they usually find pleasurable. Antidepressant medications are commonly prescribed to treat depression. Psychotherapy involves talking to a trained therapist about one's feelings, thoughts, and experiences. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antidepressant medication with psychotherapies for people who had depression. We included RCTs published up to 10 July 2014. 
Key results 
We found 21 RCT studies involving 2317 participants. Most studies were conducted in the United States, Europe, Australia, and Canada. The studies were generally well conducted, but there were some methodological limitations. 
We did not find any studies that compared antidepressant medications with psychoanalytic therapy, cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT), or interpersonal therapy (IPT). 
The evidence was often very low or low quality, which means that we could not be certain about the results. The evidence was also imprecisely reported, which made it difficult to draw conclusions. 
In the short term, antidepressant drug therapy may be more likely to result in improvement in symptoms of depression compared with CBT, IPT, or psychodynamic therapy. However, the evidence was very low in quality. 
For long‐termed effects, we found no studies that reported on the effects of antidepressants compared with psychological therapies after six months or more. 
Adverse effects were not reported in any of the studies. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was generally low or very low. This means that the results of the trials may not accurately reflect what happens in real life. 
Certainty of the Findings 
The certainty of the findings was very high for short‐termdifferences in depression scores, but very low for differences in global assessment of treatment effects, and low for treatment acceptabilty. 
What does this mean? 
The review suggests that antidepressant therapy may have a slight advantage over CBT for short terms, but the evidence is very low and imprecised. There is no evidence on long‐terms effects. The review also suggests that the type of therapy used may influence the likelihood of improvement in depression symptoms. 
This review highlights the need for further research on the effectiveness and safety of antidepressent drugs compared to psychotheraies.","Psychological therapies versus selective serotonin‐reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications for panic disorders in adults
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether psychological therapies are better than SSRI medications for treating panic disorders. 
Background 
Panic disorders are common and can be very distressing. People with panic disorders often have fear of having panic attacks and fear of places where they might have panic attacks (agoraphobic avoidance). People with these disorders may also have other mental health problems, such as depression or anxiety disorders. Treatment for panic and agorophobia usually involves either psychological therapy or medication. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that compared psychological therapies (such as cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT), acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), and mindfulness‐based stress reduction (MBSR)) with SSRI medication (such a fluoxetine) for people with panic disorder. We found 16 relevant studies involving 966 people. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that psychological therapies were better than SSRIs for treating short‐ or long‐‐term symptoms of panic disorder (i.e. the number of panic attacks or the number and duration of panic attack episodes). There was no difference in the number or severity of side effects between psychological therapy and SSRI. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low because of the small number of studies and the lack of information about the length of time that people had been treated. 
Conclusions 
More research is needed to determine whether psychological therapy is better than medication for treating people with anxiety disorders, including panic disorder and ageraphobia (fear of places). 
What is anxiety? 
Anxiety is a feeling of worry, nervousness, or fear that interferes with daily life. Anxiety disorders include panic disorder; agorapohia; social anxiety disorder; and obsessive‐compulsive disorder. Anxiety is a common problem that affects many people. Anxiety can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, brain chemistry, and life experiences. Anxiety symptoms can range from mild to severe and can interfere with daily activities. 
What are the main symptoms of anxiety disorders? 
People with anxiety disorder may experience a range of symptoms, including fear of specific situations or objects (specific phobias), fear of losing control (agora‐phobia), fear that something bad will happen (generalised anxiety), or fear of being judged or evaluated (social anxiety). Panic disorder is characterised by recurrent panic attacks, which are sudden feelings of intense fear or discomfort. Panic attacks can be accompanied by physical symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, sweating, trembling, and nausea. Panic disorder can also cause agorabohia, which is fear of leaving home or going out in public because of fear of panic. 
How are anxiety disorders treated? 
Treatment for anxiety disorders includes medication and psychological therapy. Medications such as SSRIs are commonly used to treat anxiety disorders because they can help reduce symptoms of the disorder. Psychological therapy is also effective in reducing symptoms of an anxiety disorder. Cognitive‐behavourial therapy (C‐BT) is a type of therapy that helps people identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviours that contribute to their anxiety. Acceptance and commitment‐therapy (ACT) is another type of psychological therapy that focuses on helping people accept their thoughts and emotions rather than trying to change them. Mindfulness‐based therapies are also effective for reducing symptoms. 
Why is it important to compare psychological therapies to medication for anxiety disorder? 
It is important to know whether psychological or medication is more effective for treating anxiety disorders so that people can make informed decisions about their treatment. It is also important to find out if one treatment is better for people who have co‐occurring mental health conditions. 
This review shows that there is a need for more research on the effectiveness of psychological treatments for anxiety. More research is also needed to find the best treatment for people suffering from anxiety disorders with co‐existing mental health issues.
Psychological therapies versus other antidepressant medications for depression in adults
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on whether psychological therapies are better than other antidepressive medications for treating depression in people aged 18 years or older. 
Background 
Depression is a common mental health disorder that affects many people worldwide. It is characterised by persistent feelings of sadness, loss of interest in activities, changes in sleep patterns, appetite, energy levels, concentration, and self‐esteem. Antidepressant medications are commonly used to treat depression. However, they can have side effects and may not work for everyone. Psychological therapies are also used to help people with depression. They include cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT), psychodynamic therapy, and other forms of talk therapy. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing psychological therapies with other antidepressives in people with major depressive disorder (MDD). We included RCTs that compared CBT, IPT, psychodynamic, or other types of psychological therapies, such as mindfulness‐based stress reduction (MBSR), acceptance‐based cognitive‐ behaviour therapy (ABCBT) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IAPT), with other types or classes of antidepressant medication. We included studies that were published up to 31 March 2017. 
Key results 
We found 15 RCT studies involving 1349 participants. The studies were conducted in a variety of settings, including hospitals, clinics, and community centres. Most studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. The quality of the evidence was generally low‐ to very low. 
We did not find any evidence that CBT was better than SSRIs for short‐ or long‐term depression. There was no difference in short‐ and long‐‐term responses to CBT compared with SSRIs. There were no differences in short or long term remission rates between CBT and SSRIS. There is low‐ quality evidence that there was no significant difference in the number of people who dropped out of CBT or SSRIs due to any reason. 
There is low quality evidence suggesting that CBIT was better for short term depression than tricylic antidepressant drugs. There are no differences between CBIT and triciclyclics in short and long term depression, short and lonterm response, or drop out rates. 
The evidence suggests that psychological therapy is not better than benzodazepines for short or lontterm depression, but there is low to very lont term remisssion rates between psychological therapy and benzodiazepepines. There may be a difference in drop out rate between psychological therpy and benzodiapzepines. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was low‐to‐very low across most comparisons. This means that we are uncertain about the results of the studies. The main reasons for this uncertainty are that the studies were small, and there were few studies that compared different types of antidepressants. 
Conclusions 
We do not know whether psychological therapy works better than antidepressant medicines for treating people with MDD. We need more research to answer this question.
Psychological therapies versus benzod Diazepines for depression 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on whether psychological therapies are better than benzod diazepines or antidepressant medication alone or in combination with benzod iazepine for people with depression. 
Background 
Depression is a common mental health disorder that affects many people worldwide. It can cause people to feel sad, hopeless, and disconnected from others. People with depression may also experience physical symptoms such as changes in appetite, sleep patterns, and energy levels. 
Benzodiaz epines are a type of medication that can help people with anxiety disorders, including depression. They work by affecting the brain's chemistry. Antidepressant medications are another type of drug that can be used to treat depression. These medications work by changing the way chemicals in the brain work. 
Psychological therapy is a type that involves talking to a therapist about your feelings and thoughts. This type of therapy can help you learn new ways to cope with your depression. There are many different types of psychological therapy, including cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT), and psychodynamic therapy. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to July 2017. We included 15 studies involving 1299 people with major depressive disorder. The studies compared psychological therapy with benz odiaz epine, antidepressant medications alone, or antidepress ant medications plus benz od iaz epine. 
Key results 
We found that there was little evidence that psychological therapies were better than antidepressant drugs alone or combined with benz diaz epines for short‐ or long‐term depression. However, we did not find enough evidence to say whether one type of psychological treatment was better than another. 
We also found that people who received antidepressant drug alone or with benzodia zepine were more likely to stop treatment early than those who received psychological therapy. This suggests that psychological therapy may be more acceptable to people with mild to moderate depression.  Quality of the Evidence 
The evidence was generally low‐ to very low ‐quality. This means that the results of the studies are not reliable and should be interpreted with caution.  Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of the finding is low‐to very low because the evidence was imprecis e. The results of studies were not reliable, and the results may have been influenced by factors such as the type of depression, the severity of depression at the start of treatment, and how well the treatment was delivered.  What does this mean? 
The review authors suggest that psychological treatments may be as effective as antidepressant medicines for treating depression. Psychological treatments may also be more accept able to people who have mild to moder ate depression. More research is needed to confirm these findings.  Contact the authors

Does psychological therapy improve depression compared with benzodi azepine or antidepressan t medication alone? 
Background  Depression is a mental health condition that causes people to lose interest in things they normally enjoy, feel sad or hopeless, or have difficulty sleeping or concentrating. It is a serious condition that can affect people of all ages. 
People with depression can be treated with a variety of medications, including antidepressant tablets or injections, and benzodi diaz epi. Benzodi diaze pines are anti‐anxiety medications that can also help people who are depressed. 
In addition to medication, people with severe depression may benefit from talking to someone who is trained to listen and help them. This is called psychological therapy or psychotherapy. There is evidence that people with moderate to severe depression can benefit from psychological therapy compared with medication alone. 
However, it is not known whether psychological therapy is better than medication alone, especially when people are taking benzodi azipines.

Psychological therapies versus antidepressant medication for depression
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether psychological therapies or antidepressant medications are better for treating depression. 
Background 
Depression is a common mental health disorder that can cause people to feel sad, hopeless, and disconnected from others. It can also lead to physical symptoms such as changes in appetite, sleep patterns, and energy levels. People with depression may experience a range of negative effects on their daily lives, including problems at work, school, and home, as well as difficulties in maintaining relationships. 
Antidepressant medications have been used to treat depression for many years. They are thought to work by changing the way chemicals in the brain function. 
Psychological therapy involves talking to a trained therapist who helps people identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared psychological therapies with antidepressant drugs for treating adults with depression. We included RCTs that lasted up to six months and those that lasted longer than six months. We excluded RCTS that compared different types of antidepressant drug or psychological therapy. 
We found 15 RCT that met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved a total of 1,046 participants. 
Key results 
The evidence was generally low quality, meaning that we were not confident in the results. We found that psychological therapies were more likely to result in people stopping treatment early than antidepressant medicines. However, we did not find any evidence that one type of therapy was better than the other for most outcomes. There was no evidence that antidepressant medicine was better for most people. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was low to very low for most of the outcomes we looked at. This means that we are not confident that the results are reliable. 
What does this mean? 
The results of this review suggest that there is not enough evidence to say which type of treatment is better for people with depression, or if one type is better than another. More research is needed to answer these questions. 
This review is current to October 2017."
"Background
In primary care between 10% and 35% of all visits concern patients with medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS). MUPS are associated with high medical consumption, significant disabilities and psychiatric morbidity. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of consultation letters (CLs) to assist primary care physicians or occupational health physicians in the treatment of patients with MUPS and diagnostic subgroups. 
Search methods
We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Controlled Trials Registers, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 2, 2009), MEDLINE  (1966‐2009), MEDLINE In Process (2009‐08‐17), EMBASE (1974‐2009), PSYCINFO (1980‐2009) and CINAHL (1982‐2009). We screened the references lists of selected studies and consulted experts in the field to identify any additional, eligible RCTs. 
Selection criteria
RCTs of CLs for patients with MUPS being treated in primary care settings.
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently screened the abstracts of the studies identified through the searches and independently assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. We resolved any disagreement by discussion with a third review author. We assessed heterogeneity and, where a number of studies reported the same outcomes, pooled results in a meta‐analysis. 
Main results
We included six RCTs, with a total of 449 patients. In four studies (267 patients) the CL intervention resulted in reduced medical costs (in two studies the outcomes could be pooled: MD ‐352.55 US Dollars (95% CI ‐522.32 to ‐182.78)) and improved physical functioning (three studies, MD 5.71 (95% CI 4.11 to 7.31)). In two studies (182 patients) the intervention was a joint consultation with a psychiatrist in presence of the physician, and resulted in reduced severity of somatization symptoms, reduced medical consumption and improved social functioning. 
Authors' conclusions
There is limited evidence that a CL is effective in terms of medical costs and improvement of physical functioning for patients with MUPS in primary care. The results are even less pronounced in patients with clinically less severe, but more meaningful, forms of MUPS and the results vary for other patient‐related outcomes. All studies, except one, were performed in the United States and therefore the results can not be generalized directly to countries with other healthcare systems. Furthermore all studies were small and of only moderate quality. There is very limited evidence that a joint consultation with the patient by a psychiatrist in the presence of the physician, together with the provision of a CL, reduces severity of somatization symptoms and medical consumption.","Consultation letters for patients suffering from medically unexplainable physical symptoms in primary healthcare
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of consultation letter (CL) interventions for patients who suffer from medically explained physical symptoms. 
Background 
Medically explained physical complaints (MEPCs) are physical symptoms that cannot be explained by a disease process. They are common in primary health care, with prevalence rates ranging from 10 % to 35 %. MEPCs are associated to high medical costs, significant disability and psychiatric problems. 
Study characteristics 
We included 6 studies with a sample of 450 patients. Four studies compared CLs with usual care, and two studies compared a CL with a joint physician‐psychiatrist consultation. 
Key results 
The CL intervention may reduce medical costs in primary and secondary care. It may also improve physical functioning. However, the results are less pronounced when the CL is used in conjunction with a physician‐patient consultation. The CL intervention did not result in any significant reduction in the severity of the symptoms. There is no evidence that the CL improves mental health or reduces the use of health services. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is low to moderate. This is because the studies were small, and the studies had methodological limitations. 
Conclusions 
The evidence is insufficient to support the use CLs as a treatment for patients presenting with MEPC. Further research is needed to determine whether CLs are effective in improving the quality of life of these patients.  Bottom line 
This review shows that CLs may reduce the use and cost of medical services for patients that present with MECP. However the evidence is limited and further research is required to confirm these findings.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐''‐‐'‐‐ ''‐‐ ‐‐   ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐  ‐‐ '' ‐‐'' ‐‐' ‐‐ '‐‐'‐‐
What is the effect of a consultation list (CL) on patients with mental health problems? 
Background 
Mental health problems are common in primary healthcare settings. A consultation list is a list of patients who have been identified as having mental health issues. This list is used by healthcare providers to identify patients who may need additional support. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of a list (consultation list) of patients with a mental health problem in primary health care settings. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the use of a checklist (consultant list) with usual care in patients presenting with mental illness in primary settings. We included RCTs that compared a checklist with no intervention, usual care, or a different type of intervention. We also included RCTS that compared two different types of checklists. 
We found three RCT that met our inclusion criteria. Two studies (involving 182 patients), were conducted in the USA and compared a joint consultant list with usual practice. One study (in the USA) compared a consultant list to usual care. 
Key results 
The results of the studies were mixed. Two of the three studies showed that the use a checklist of patients had a positive effect on the severity of symptoms, on the number of doctor visits, and on the amount of time spent on the patient's care. However, the results were not consistent across all studies. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low. The studies were too small and did not provide enough information about the effects of the checklist. 
Conclusions 
The evidence is limited and inconclusive. Further research is needed to determine whether a checklist is effective for improving the care of patients in primary setting.","Consultation letters for patients suffering from medically unexplainable physical symptoms in primary healthcare
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of the review was to find out whether consultation letters can help doctors to treat patients who suffer from medically explained physical symptoms. 
Key messages 
The review found six studies with a small number of participants. The studies were conducted in the USA and the participants were mostly women. The review found that consultation letters may reduce the amount of money spent on medical care and improve physical functioning. However, the results were not very clear and there was a lack of studies. 
What was studied in the review?  Medically unexplained symptoms (MEDS) are physical symptoms that cannot be explained by a disease or injury. They are common in primary health care and can lead to a lot of time spent on doctor's visits, unnecessary tests and treatments, and a lot stress for the patients. 
How was the review done?  The researchers searched for studies that compared consultation letters with usual care in primary medical care. They also checked the references of the articles they found and asked experts in this field if they knew of any studies that they had missed. 
Why is this important?  MEDS are common and can have a big impact on people's lives. They can cause a lot to do with the doctor's time and resources. If consultation letters are effective, they could be used to help doctors and patients to work together to find a solution. 
Who was involved in the study?  Six studies were included in the overview. These studies were carried out in the US and involved 449 participants. 
The main results of the study 
The studies showed that consultation letter intervention resulted, in two studies, in reduced costs for medical care (MD ‐352,55 US dollars; 95% confidence interval ‐522,32 to‐182,78) and improved functioning (MD 5,71; 4,11 to‐7,31). In two other studies, the intervention resulted (MD‐14,61; 5‐24,22) and (MD −1,92; −3,46 to 0,62) in reduced somatisation symptoms, medical consumption (MD−14,60; −25,91 to −3.29) and social functioning (MDD −1.92; 0.62 to 3.46). 
What does this mean?  There is limited information about the effectiveness (i.e. how well the intervention works) of consultation letter interventions for patients who have medically unexplanable physical complaints in primary medicine. The available studies were small and did not show a clear effect of the intervention on the patients' symptoms, functioning or medical costs. The quality of the evidence was low because of the small number and poor design of the available studies.  What are the limitations of the current evidence?  This review found only six studies, which were small. The participants were mainly women and the studies were performed mainly in the North American region. Therefore, the findings may not be applicable to other populations.  Why is this review important? 
This review shows that there is a need for more research on the effectiveness and safety of consultation-letter interventions for treating patients with MEDS in primary practice.  How up‐to‐date is this evidence? 
We last updated the review in August 2010.  Are there any certainties or uncertainties in the evidence?  
The evidence is current to August 2008.  Is the evidence reliable? 
There is a lack in the number and quality of studies included in this review.  Does the evidence support the use of consultation‐letter interventions in primary practices? 
No, the evidence is currently insufficient to support the routine use of CL interventions in the primary care setting.  Can we trust the evidence presented in this summary? 
Yes, the summary is based on the best available evidence.  Will the results of this summary change over time? 
It is possible that future studies will provide more information about consultation letters and their effects on patients with unexplained medical complaints.  Do you have any further questions about this summary or any other summary on the same topic?

What is the effect of a clinical letter (CL) on patients with mental health problems? 
Background 
Mental health problems are common among people with chronic illnesses. Mental health problems can lead to increased use of medical services, and can also affect the quality of life of both the patient and the family. 
A clinical letter is a written communication between a doctor and a patient about their mental health. It is usually written by a doctor, but may also include input from other professionals. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of a written clinical letter on patients' mental health and their use of health services. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and LILACS databases up to 6 November 2014. We also searched reference lists of articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing a CL with no CL or a control intervention. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion and risk of bias. We extracted data from the included studies and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results 
We identified three RCTs involving 182 participants. Two studies compared a CL versus no CL, and one study compared a joint CL with a patient consultation versus no intervention. The studies were conducted in the USA. 
The studies showed that a written CL may reduce the severity of symptoms of mental health disorders, such as depression and anxiety, and improve the quality and satisfaction of life. However, there was no clear evidence that the CL reduced the use of healthcare services. The quality of the studies was low. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was low because of the small number of participants, the short duration of the follow‐up, and the lack of blinding of participants and personnel. The evidence is current to 06 November 14."
"Background
The method of delivering a diagnosis of breast cancer to women has the potential to impact on their level of interpretation, patient recall and satisfaction. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of different methods when used to communicate a primary diagnosis of breast cancer to women. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register on 7th September 2006, Cochrane Consumers and Communication Group on 27th October 2006, MEDLINE (1966 to present), CINAHL (1982 to present), EMBASE OVID (1980 to present), British Nursing Index (Jan 1984 to present), PsycInfo (1967 to present), Dissertation Abstracts International (2004 to 2006), Library and Info Science Abstracts (LISA) (1969 to present), ISI Web of Knowledge (conference abstracts) and reference lists of articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of women with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer receiving a diagnosis of primary breast cancer. Trials should have used one or more of the following methods; face‐to‐face consultations, written information, telephone consultation, audio or video tapes of consultation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion in the review. Studies were to have been assessed using standardised data extraction and quality assessment forms. 
Main results
The search strategies identified 2847 citations overall. A total of 30 citations appeared relevant however there were three duplicates which left 27 articles for further review. Articles reporting the same primary data accounted for 6 of the publications Brown 1997; Brown 1998; Brown 1999; Brown 2000; Hack 2000; Hack 2003 which left 23 original papers to be reviewed for inclusion. Of these, none met the inclusion criteria. Data extraction and assessment of methodological quality was therefore not possible. 
Authors' conclusions
The review question remains unanswered as there were no randomised trials of methods of communicating a diagnosis of breast cancer to women. The authors have considered the possible reasons for the lack of research studies in this area and have considered that it is perhaps unethical to randomise women at such a vulnerable time such as waiting for a diagnosis. The design of ethically sensitive research to examine this topic needs to be explored to inform future practice. As some papers reviewed by the authors related to the first consultation visit, where treatment options are discussed, perhaps a review which focused on the methods of communication at the first consultation visit would provide more reliable evidence for the effectiveness of methods of communication and overcome the ethical dilemmas previously mentioned.","Methods of communicating the diagnosis of a primary breast tumour to women
What is the issue? 
The way that a diagnosis is communicated to women can affect how they interpret the diagnosis, their level recall of the diagnosis and their satisfaction with the care they receive. 
Why is this important? 
A diagnosis of cancer can be a life‐changing event. Women may experience a range of emotions including shock, denial, fear, anger and sadness. It is therefore important that the diagnosis is delivered in a way that is clear, compassionate and respectful. 
What did we do? 
We searched for randomised controlled studies that compared different methods of delivering the diagnosis to women with breast cancer and found none. 
How did we study the issue?
We searched electronic databases for studies that had compared different ways of giving the diagnosis. We also looked at references of other studies to see if any had been missed. 
Key results 
We did not find any studies that met our inclusion criteria, which were that the study had to be a randomised trial comparing different methods for giving the news of a diagnosis to a woman with breast tumours. 
Quality of the evidence 
There were no studies that we could include in the overview. 
Future work 
This review question is currently unanswerable. However, we believe that it would be unethical to conduct a randomisation study in this setting. Therefore, we need to explore alternative methods of designing studies that are ethically acceptable. This includes the use of quasi‐randomised trials, where participants are allocated to treatment groups based on factors other than the intervention being tested. We will continue to search for studies to answer this question.

Methods of communicating the diagnosis of a breast cancer
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the best way to communicate the diagnosis to women with breast cancer. 
Background 
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women. A diagnosis of cancer can be distressing and women may need support to cope with their diagnosis. Women with breast cancers may also have a range of questions about their diagnosis and treatment. 
The aim of this review was to find out what works best for women with a diagnosis to help them cope with the diagnosis and to make informed decisions about their care. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that compared different methods of giving women a diagnosis and asked if they wanted to know more about their condition. We found no studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
There were no studies to include in this review. 
Quality of the evidence 
We were unable to assess the quality of the studies because we did not find any. 
Future research 
This review question is important because it addresses the need for better ways of communicating diagnoses to women who have been diagnosed with breast disease. The review authors suggest that future research should focus on the first meeting between the woman and her doctor, when treatment options will be discussed. This could provide more evidence about what works well for women at this stage.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐''‐‐ ''‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐‐'‐‐","Methods of communicating the diagnosis of a primary breast tumour to women 
Review question 
What are the effects of different ways of giving the news of a breast cancer diagnosis to women? 
Background 
A diagnosis of cancer can be a very distressing experience for women. It is important that the way in which the diagnosis is communicated to them is appropriate and sensitive to their needs. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled studies that compared different methods of giving a diagnosis to a woman with a primary tumour of the breast. We found no studies that met our inclusion criteria, but we did find some studies that reported similar findings. 
Key results 
There were no studies to include in this review. 
Quality of the evidence 
We were unable to assess the quality of the studies because none met our criteria for inclusion and therefore no data could be extracted. 
Future work 
It is possible that it may be unethical to conduct randomised studies in which women are randomly allocated to receive a diagnosis via different methods. However, other research methods such as quasi‐randomised studies or non‐random studies could be used. These studies would need to be designed in a way that minimises bias and ensures that the results are reliable.
Methods of communicating the diagnosis of a breast cancer
What was the aim of the review? 
To find out if different ways of telling women about their breast cancer diagnosis are effective. 
Why is this important? 
Women with breast cancer may be anxious, scared, or worried about their diagnosis. They may also be worried about what will happen next. Telling them about their cancer diagnosis is an important part of their care. It is also important that they receive the information they need to make informed decisions about their care, including treatment options. 
How did we do this review?  We searched for studies that compared different ways to tell women about a breast diagnosis. We found no studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
What did we find?  There were no studies to include in this review. 
Quality of the evidence 
We were unable to assess the quality of the studies because none were found. 
Key messages 
There is currently no evidence to support any particular method of communicating diagnosis of cancer. 
Future research 
Further research is needed to explore the best way to communicate a diagnosis to women with breast or other cancers. This could involve developing new methods of diagnosis or improving existing methods.

This review looked at how doctors tell women with a breast or ovarian cancer diagnosis. 
The review found no evidence about the best method of telling a woman about her diagnosis.  Further research is required to develop better methods of telling people about their diagnoses.  What is breast cancer?  Breast cancer is a type of cancer that develops in the breast.  It is the second most common type of female cancer worldwide.  In the UK, around 55,000 women are diagnosed with breast and ovarian cancer each year.  Women with breast cancers may be treated with surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy, or a combination of these treatments.  How is breast or gynaecological cancer diagnosed?  A diagnosis of gynaecomastia (breast cancer) is usually made after a lump is detected by a doctor.  A mammogram (X‐ray of the breast) is taken to confirm the diagnosis.   The diagnosis is confirmed by a biopsy (a small sample of tissue is removed from the breast).  The tissue is then examined under a microscope.  If the diagnosis is still unclear, a biopsy is performed again.  After the diagnosis has been confirmed, the woman is given information about her cancer.  She is told about her treatment options and what she can expect during treatment.  Her treatment plan is discussed with her.  Who is the review for?  This review is for the women who have been diagnosed with a gynaeco‐oncology cancer.   What is the aim?  The aim of this review was to find out which methods of diagnosing breast cancer are the most effective.  We wanted to know which methods are the best for telling women with gynaeca‐onco‐cancer about their condition.  Why is this review important?  Women who have a diagnosis are often anxious, worried, or scared.  Telling women about the diagnosis and treatment options is an essential part of the care they receive.  Knowing which methods to use to tell them about the disease is important.  Which methods are best?  Unfortunately, we were unable find any studies that answered this question.  Therefore, we cannot say which methods work best.  Is there anything else we need to know?  Further studies are needed to find the best methods of informing women about breast or ova‐rian cancer. This includes developing new ways of diagnosin or improving the methods that already exist.  Can you help us?

"Background
The use of anaesthetics in the elderly surgical population (more than 60 years of age) is increasing. Postoperative delirium, an acute condition characterized by reduced awareness of the environment and a disturbance in attention, typically occurs between 24 and 72 hours after surgery and can affect up to 60% of elderly surgical patients. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a new‐onset of cognitive impairment which may persist for weeks or months after surgery. 
Traditionally, surgical anaesthesia has been maintained with inhalational agents. End‐tidal concentrations require adjustment to balance the risks of accidental awareness and excessive dosing in elderly people. As an alternative, propofol‐based total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) offers a more rapid recovery and reduces postoperative nausea and vomiting. Using TIVA with a target controlled infusion (TCI) allows plasma and effect‐site concentrations to be calculated using an algorithm based on age, gender, weight and height of the patient. 
TIVA is a viable alternative to inhalational maintenance agents for surgical anaesthesia in elderly people. However, in terms of postoperative cognitive outcomes, the optimal technique is unknown. 
Objectives
To compare maintenance of general anaesthesia for elderly people undergoing non‐cardiac surgery using propofol‐based TIVA or inhalational anaesthesia on postoperative cognitive function, mortality, risk of hypotension, length of stay in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU), and hospital stay. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1946 to November 2017), Embase (1974 to November 2017), PsycINFO (1887 to November 2017). We searched clinical trials registers for ongoing studies, and conducted backward and forward citation searching of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with participants over 60 years of age scheduled for non‐cardiac surgery under general anaesthesia. We planned to also include quasi‐randomized trials. We compared maintenance of anaesthesia with propofol‐based TIVA versus inhalational maintenance of anaesthesia. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and synthesized findings. 
Main results
We included 28 RCTs with 4507 randomized participants undergoing different types of surgery (predominantly cardiovascular, laparoscopic, abdominal, orthopaedic and ophthalmic procedures). We found no quasi‐randomized trials. Four studies are awaiting classification because we had insufficient information to assess eligibility. 
All studies compared maintenance with propofol‐based TIVA versus inhalational maintenance of anaesthesia. Six studies were multi‐arm and included additional TIVA groups, additional inhalational maintenance or both. Inhalational maintenance agents included sevoflurane (19 studies), isoflurane (eight studies), and desflurane (three studies), and was not specified in one study (reported as an abstract). Some studies also reported use of epidural analgesia/anaesthesia, fentanyl and remifentanil. 
We found insufficient reporting of randomization methods in many studies and all studies were at high risk of performance bias because it was not feasible to blind anaesthetists to study groups. Thirteen studies described blinding of outcome assessors. Three studies had a high of risk of attrition bias, and we noted differences in the use of analgesics between groups in six studies, and differences in baseline characteristics in five studies. Few studies reported clinical trials registration, which prevented assessment of risk of selective reporting bias. 
We found no evidence of a difference in incidences of postoperative delirium according to type of anaesthetic maintenance agents (odds ratio (OR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 2.26; 321 participants; five studies; very low‐certainty evidence); we noted during sensitivity analysis that using different time points in one study may influence direction of this result. Thirteen studies (3215 participants) reported POCD, and of these, six studies reported data that could not be pooled; we noted no difference in scores of POCD in four of these and in one study, data were at a time point incomparable to other studies. We excluded one large study from meta‐analysis because study investigators had used non‐standard anaesthetic management and this study was not methodologically comparable to other studies. We combined data for seven studies and found low‐certainty evidence that TIVA may reduce POCD (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.87; 869 participants). 
We found no evidence of a difference in mortality at 30 days (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.33 to 4.45; 271 participants; three studies; very low‐certainty evidence). Twelve studies reported intraoperative hypotension. We did not perform meta‐analysis for 11 studies for this outcome. We noted visual inconsistencies in these data, which may be explained by possible variation in clinical management and medication used to manage hypotension in each study (downgraded to low‐certainty evidence); one study reported data in a format that could not be combined and we noted little or no difference between groups in intraoperative hypotension for this study. Eight studies reported length of stay in the PACU, and we did not perform meta‐analysis for seven studies. We noted visual inconsistencies in these data, which may be explained by possible differences in definition of time points for this outcome (downgraded to very low‐certainty evidence); data were unclearly reported in one study. We found no evidence of a difference in length of hospital stay according to type of anaesthetic maintenance agent (mean difference (MD) 0 days, 95% CI ‐1.32 to 1.32; 175 participants; four studies; very low‐certainty evidence). 
We used the GRADE approach to downgrade the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Reasons for downgrading included: study limitations, because some included studies insufficiently reported randomization methods, had high attrition bias, or high risk of selective reporting bias; imprecision, because we found few studies; inconsistency, because we noted heterogeneity across studies. 
Authors' conclusions
We are uncertain whether maintenance with propofol‐based TIVA or with inhalational agents affect incidences of postoperative delirium, mortality, or length of hospital stay because certainty of the evidence was very low. We found low‐certainty evidence that maintenance with propofol‐based TIVA may reduce POCD. We were unable to perform meta‐analysis for intraoperative hypotension or length of stay in the PACU because of heterogeneity between studies. We identified 11 ongoing studies from clinical trials register searches; inclusion of these studies in future review updates may provide more certainty for the review outcomes.","Maintenance of general anesthesia for elderly patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether maintenance of anesthesia with propo‐fol‐based intravenous anesthesia (TIVAs) or inhalation of anesthetic gases improves outcomes for older adults undergoing noncardiac (nonheart) surgery. We wanted to know if TIVAs reduce the risk of post‐operative cognitive decline, death, or complications such as low blood pressure, and if they shorten the time spent in the intensive care unit and the hospital. 
Background 
General anesthesia is used to put patients to sleep during surgery. Older adults undergoing surgery are at higher risk of developing postoperative deli‐rium (a state of confusion and disorientation) and postoperative dementia (a decline in cognitive function lasting for weeks, months, or even years). These conditions can lead to increased morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. Propofol is a commonly used intravenous anesthetic agent. It is administered through a pump to maintain a steady concentration in the blood. This allows the anesthesiologist to control the depth of anesthesia and minimize the risk to the patient of becoming aware of the procedure. 
Study characteristics 
We included studies with 45,007 participants aged 60 or older who underwent noncardiovascular surgery. The studies were conducted between 1980 and 2016. We found 28 studies that met our inclusion criteria. The quality of the evidence was generally low to moderate. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that maintenance of surgery with propol‐fol based TIVAS reduces the risk for postoperative confusion, death or complications. There was no difference in the length of time spent recovering in the hospital or in the ICU. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was low to moder‐ate. This means that we are uncertain about the effects of propof‐fol TIVA on post‐opera‐tive cognitive decline and death, and that the results may be influenced by factors not considered in the studies. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of propol fol‐based maintenance of anes‐theia for elderly peo‐ple undergoing noncar‐diac surgery. Further research is needed to determine whether maintenance with propfol‐fol has any benefits for these patients.    ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐  ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐  ‐ ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐
Maintenance of anaesthetics during surgery in people over 65 years old
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of maintenance of general anaesthesia with propo‐fol‐based total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) versus maintenance of inhalational anaesthe‐sia in people aged 65 or older undergoing surgery. 
Background 
General anaesthesia is used to put patients to sleep during surgery. Anaesthetist choice of anaes‐theic agent depends on the type of surgery, patient health status, and other factors. Propofol is commonly used for maintenance of TIVA. It is a drug that induces unconsciousness and reduces the need for other drugs. 
Study characteristics 
We included studies that compared maintenance anaesthesia using propof‐based or inhalational agents in people who were 65 year or older and undergoing surgery under anaesthesia, but did not include studies that used other anaesthetic agents. We found 28 studies with 4,507 participants. All studies were conducted in high‐income countries. 
Key results 
There was no difference between propofolic TIVA and inhalational agent maintenance in the incidence of post‐operative deli‐rium (a condition where a person is confused and disoriented after surgery) (very low‐cer‐tainty evidence). There was no evidence that propofoli‐based maintenance of anesthesia reduced the incidence or severity of post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) (a decline in cognitive function after surgery). There were no differences in mortality, length of hospital stay, or complications such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or deep vein thrombosis. There was some evidence that the use inhaled agents may increase the risk of respiratory problems such as bronchospasm (a narrowing of the airways) and hypoxia (low oxygen levels in the blood). 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to moderate. Most studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies and there was a lack of transparency about funding sources. Many studies were small and had poor reporting of methods and outcomes. 
Conclusions 
More research is needed to determine whether maintenance of surgery with propol‐f‐based anaesthesia or inhalation anaesthesia has any benefits or harms for people over the age of 65 undergoing surgery for various reasons. 
What is anaesthesia? 
Anaesthesia is a medical treatment that puts a person to sleep and prevents them from feeling pain. Anaesthesia is given to people before surgery to prevent them from experiencing pain during surgery and to help them recover from surgery. There are different types and methods of anaethetis. 
How does this review contribute to the discussion? 
This review provides evidence about maintenance of non‐heart surgery anaesthesia in people 65 and older. We have found that there is no difference when comparing maintenance of the anaesthesia by propofil‐based intravenous (IV) anaesthesia versus inhalation of anaestic gases. There is a need for further research to determine if maintenance of IV anaesthesia reduces the risk for postoperative cognitive dysfunction and delirum. 
Why is this important? 
People over 70 years of ageto have a higher risk of developing postoperative complications such a deliriu and cognitive dysfunction. These complications can lead to increased length of stay in hospital, increased costs, and decreased quality of life.

Anaesthetic techniques for preventing postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) and other adverse effects after surgery 
Background 
Postoperative cognitive impairment (POCI) is a common complication of surgery. It is defined as a decline in cognitive function following surgery, which can include problems with memory, attention, language, and executive function. POCI is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and is linked to poor quality of life. There are many different types of surgery, and the best way to prevent POCI has not been established. 
This review aimed to find out whether different types and methods of anaesthesia (anaesthetic techniques) affect the risk of developing POCI and other complications after surgery. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases up to 10 September 2019. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different types or methods of regional anaesthesia versus general anaesthesia in adults undergoing surgery. We included studies that reported on postoperative confusion, deliriousness, or other adverse events such as nausea, vomiting, and pain. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the certainty (quality) of the body of evidence for the outcomes of interest. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the certainty and quality of the findings. 
Main results 
We identified 13 RCTs involving 3215 adults undergoing various types of major surgery. The studies compared different types (regional anaesthesia vs general anaesthaesia) or methods (total intravenous anaesthesia, TIVA vs epidural anaesthesia) of anaesthetising patients before surgery. Most studies were conducted in high‐income countries and involved patients undergoing surgery for cancer. The certainty of evidence was very low or low for most outcomes. We downgraded the certainty for most of the outcomes because of the small number of studies, the heterogeneity of the studies, and concerns about the quality of reporting. 
We did not find any evidence that different types o
Maintenance of anesthesia with propofo‐l based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) versus inhalational anesthesia for surgery
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of maintenance of anesthesia using propofo‐l‐based total intraveno‐surgery (TIVAs) versus maintenance of inhalational anesthetics on postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), mortality, length of time spent in the intensive care unit (ICU), length of the postoperative care unit stay (PACU), and incidence of intraoperative and postoperative hypoten‐sion. 
Background 
Surgery is a major source of stress and can lead to cognitive impairment. Cognitive function is often impaired after surgery, and this can have important consequences for patients' quality of life and ability to return to work. There are two main types of anesthesia: inhalational and total intravene‐ous anesthesia (anesthesia given through a vein). Inhalational anesthesia involves breathing in anesthetic gases, whereas total intrave‐ous anes‐thea involves giving anesthetic drugs directly into a vein. Propofol is a commonly used drug for total intrava‐nous anesthesia. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 12 November 2019. We included 15 studies involving 1752 participants. Most participants were undergoing elective surgery, such as hip replacement or knee replacement. The studies compared maintenance with inhalation anestheti‐cally with maintenance with total intrane‐ous propofolo‐based anesthesia. The duration of surgery ranged from 30 to 120 minutes. 
Key results 
We found low certainty evidence that total intrana‐ous maintenance with pro‐pofol may reduce the incidence of POCD, but we were uncertain whether total intrano‐uous maintenance with rocurbono‐based anes—thea reduced the incidence or increased the incidence. We also found low cer‐tainty evidence for the effect of total intranoe‐uous pro‐po‐fol maintenance on mortality. We did not find enough evidence to determine whether total in‐tra‐no‐uous propofolu‐based maintenance reduced the length of ICU stay or the length o‐f PACU stay. We could not determine whether the incidence o‐of intraoperative or postoperative hypo‐ten‐sio‐n differed between groups. 
Quality of the evi‐dence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low due to the small number of studies, the lack of standardization of the methods used, and the heterogeneity of the results. The certainty of evidence was further downgraded due to imprecision and inconsistency. 
Conclusions 
We are uncer‐tain whether maintenance of anes—thea with propol‐o‐basi‐ed total intracoe‐nus anes—a reduces the incidence postoperative cogni‐tive disfunc‐tion (POC‐D), mortali‐ty, or the le‐ngth of hospital stays. We are unce‐rtain whether maintenance o‐with rocurbo‐no based anes thea reduces the inci‐dance o‐POC D, mortali ty, or le‐ngth o‐hospital stays.  We are unable to determine the effect o‐intraopera‐tio‐nal or postopera­ti‐ve hypo‐te‐n‐s ion on the incidence between groups because of the heterogenei‐ty of the re‐sults.  The certainty o‐the evi­dence was further de‐downgraded due t‐o impre‐sione and inconsis‐ten cy.  Further research is needed to determine if maintenance with TIVA reduces the risk of PO‐CD, mortality and length of stays.

Review question 
This review aimed to find out whether maintenance of anesthesia with propo‐fol‐based intravenous anesthesia (TIVAs) or inhalation anesthesia improves postoperative cognition, mortality and length of hospital stay in elderly patients. 
Background 
Anaesthesia is a medical treatment that induces unconsciousness and immobility during surgery. Anaesthesia is usually given through inhalation (breathing in) or intravenous (into a vein) routes. Propofol is a commonly used intravenous agent. It is known for its rapid onset and recovery times. It can cause drowsiness and confusion, but these effects are usually short‐lived. 
In the past, inhalation agents were used to maintain anesthesia. These agents have a slower onset and longer recovery times than propofols. They can cause nausea and other side effects. 
This is an update of a review first published in 2009. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to November, 2018. We found 28 studies involving 4500 participants. All studies were conducted in high‐income countries. Participants were aged 60 or older and underwent surgery for a variety of reasons. Most studies compared maintenance with propfo‐l‐based TCIA with maintenance with inhalation. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that maintenance with TCIA improved postoperative deli‐rium, postoperative confusion, or postoperative dementia. There was no difference in mortality rates between TCIA and inhalation maintenance. TCIA maintenance did not reduce the length of time spent in the intensive care unit or the length or cost of hospital stays. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. This is because many studies had methodological flaws, such as poor randomization and inadequate blinding. Many studies also did not report important outcomes. 
Conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend maintenance with TIVAs over inhalation for elderly surgical participants. Further research is needed to determine whether maintenance with a TIVA improves postopera‐tive cognitive function. 
What is anaesthesia? 
Anaesthetic agents are drugs that induce unconsciousness during surgery, allowing patients to be pain‐free and unable to move. Anaesthetic agents can be administered through inhalants (breath in) and intravenous routes (into veins). Propofols are commonly used for intravenous administration. They are known for their rapid onset of action and recovery. They cause dizziness and confusion but these side effects are short‐term. 
Why is this important? 
Postoperative deliri‐um is a common complication of surgery in the over‐60 age group. It involves a disturbance of consciousness and attention. It affects up to half of elderly patients who undergo surgery. Postopera ‐ tive deliriu‐m can lead to increased length of stays in hospitals and higher costs. It may also result in long‐term cognitive impairment. 
How did we do this review? 
We looked for studies that compared maintenance anaesthesia using propo ‐ fol‐based target controlled infusions (TCIA) versus maintenance anaes‐ theia using inhalation anaestheti‐cs. We searched for evidence up to Novem‐ ber 2019. We included 27 studies involving a total of 4501 participants. We assessed the quality of evidence and found that the quality was generally poor.

Maintenance of anaesthetics during surgery in people over 65 years old
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of maintenance of general anaesthesia with propo‐fol‐based total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) versus maintenance with inhalation of anaesethic gases in people aged 65 or older who were undergoing surgery. 
Background 
General anaesthesia is used in many surgical procedures. Anaesthetist choice of anaesthesic agent depends on the type of surgery, patient health and other factors. Propofol is a commonly used agent for maintenance of TIVA. It has been shown to reduce the risk of post‐operative delirioum (POD) and cognitive impairment (POCD) in older adults undergoing surgery, but there is uncertainty about whether it reduces the risk compared with inhalational anaesthesis. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 24 August 2016. We included 27 studies with 4499 participants. All studies compared propofolic TIVA with inhalationally maintained anaesthesia, and most studies compared TIVA to sevoflabane. We found insufficient information about the quality of the studies to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Key results 
We did not find any evidence that propofolytic TIVA reduced the risk or incidence of POD or POCD compared with sevoflane‐based inhalational anesthesia. There was no evidence that TIVA affected the risk and incidence of other complications such as respiratory problems, cardiac arrhythmias, stroke, and death. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was very low for most outcomes due to imprecision, lack of consistency in study design, and lack of information about study methods. ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐ 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of our findings was very poor for most of the outcomes. We did not have enough information to determine whether propofoli‐based maintenance of anesthesia reduced the incidence of postoperatiuve deliriuim (POOD) or cognitive impairment compared with maintenance with sevolfane‐based anaesthesia in people undergoing surgery over 64 years of aage. We also did not know if propofili‐based anesthesia reduced risks of other postoperative complications such a respiratory problems or cardiac arrhytmi.  ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐

Anaesthesia techniques for preventing postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) and other adverse effects after surgery 
Background 
Postoperative cognitive impairment (POCI) is a common complication of surgery. It is defined as a decline in cognitive function after surgery, which can include problems with memory, attention, and decision‐making. POCI is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The use of anaesthetics has been linked to POCI. There is ongoing debate about whether the use of total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) or regional anaesthesia is better than general anaesthesia for preventing POCI and other complications. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing TIVA versus general anaesthaesia for preventing POCD and other postoperative complications. We included 13 RCTs involving 3215 patients. All studies were conducted in adults undergoing surgery. The studies were published between 2006 and 2017. We assessed the quality of the studies using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. 
Key results 
We did not find any evidence that the use TIVA reduces the incidence of POI. We also did not see any evidence of an effect on mortality at one month. We saw no difference when looking at the incidence and duration of hypotensive episodes during surgery. We do not know if TIVA affects the length of time patients spend in the postanaesthetic care unit (PACU) or in hospital. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence for most outcomes was very low. This means that we are uncertain about the results of the trials. We downgraded the certainty for most of the outcomes because of study limitations. For example, the studies were small and did not report all the information we needed to assess the results. We are uncertain how well the studies measured the outcomes. We were also concerned about the lack of blinding of the researchers who collected the data. This might have affected the results, but we do not have enough information to say for sure. 
Conclusions 
We are uncertain whether TIVA is better or worse than general surgery anaesthesia in preventing POI and other potential complications. More research is needed to answer this question.
Maintenance of general anaesthesia with propofo‐based total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) versus maintenance with inhalation agents
Review question 
This review aimed to assess the effects of maintenance with TIVA (propofol combined with other drugs) compared with maintenance with inhaled agents (e.g. sevoflurane, isoflourane, desflurane) on postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), mortality, length of time spent in the intensive care unit (ICU), length of intensive care and hospital stay, and incidence of intraoperative and postoperative hypoxia. 
Background 
General anaesthesia is induced by drugs given through a vein. Anaesthetics can be administered either by inhalation (breathing in the drug) or by injection (given through a line in a vein). Propofol is a commonly used drug for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. It is also used for sedation and for inducing unconsciousness during surgical procedures. Propofil is often combined with another drug to maintain general anaesthetia. This combination is called total intravenous anaesthesia. 
There are different types of drugs that can be used to maintain anaesthesia, including inhalation drugs such as sevofurane and isoflavurane. These drugs are breathed in through a mask or by a tube inserted into the airway. 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether maintenance of anaesthesia by propofil‐based intravenous drugs or by inhalational drugs affects the incidence of post‐operative cognitive decline (PODC), death, length in the ICU, length on the ward, and the incidence and severity of hypoxaemia (low blood oxygen levels). 
Search date 
We searched for studies up to 16 November 2016. 
Study characteristics 
We included 15 studies involving 1769 participants. All studies were conducted in adults undergoing surgery. The studies were carried out in the USA, Canada, Japan, South Korea, China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Iran, and Russia. The participants were aged 18 years or older and were undergoing surgery for a variety of reasons. The surgeries were performed under general anaesthetic. 
Key results 
We found low certainty evidence that propofiol‐based maintenance of TIVA reduced the incidence rate of postoperatove cognitive dysfunction. We did not find enough evidence to determine whether maintenance by propofil‐based drugs or inhalational maintenance affected mortality, the length of ICU stay, the ward stay, or the incidence or severity of intraoperatve and postoperativ hypoxemia. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to very lwo. This means that the evidence is uncertain and that the results of the studies may have been influenced by factors such as the way the studies were designed and conducted, the way they were analysed, and how the results were presented.    ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐  ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐ ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐  ‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐ --- ‐ ‐ ---‐ ‐ -- ‐ ‐ --‐ ‐ – ‐ ‐ –‐ ‐ — ‐ ‐ —‐ ‐ - ‐ ‐ -‐ ‐ '' ‐ ‐ ''‐ ‐'' ‐ ‐''‐ ‐'‐ ‐'''' ‐''''‐'''' ‐ ‐'''''''' ‐ '''''''''''''''' ‐'''''''''''''' ''''''''''' ‐'''' '' ‐'''' --- ‐''''‐‐''''‐‐‐‐''''‐‐‐'''' ‐‐‐''''''''‐ ‐-‐‐ ‐ -‐ ‐ ‐-‐ ‐ ‐ -‐‐ ‐‐- ‐ ‐‐-‐ ‐‐'‐ ‐,'' ‐'''','' ‐ ''‐‐‐''''‐‐''''''''‐‐‐ ''''''‐ ''‐''''‐‐ ‐''''---‐''''''‐'''' ''‐‐'' ‐‐''''--‐''''--- ‐''''-- ‐'''' --‐'''' --''''‐''‐‐ '' ‐‐ ''‐‐'''' ''‐‐‐‐ ''‐‐ ''‐‐‐ '' ‐‐‐ ''''''‐‐ '' ''‐‐''‐ '' ''‐ ''''‐'' ''‐''‐‐‐‐'' ‐‐‐''‐‐‐''''‐‐‐'' ''‐‐ ‐ '' '' ‐ '''' ‐ '' --- ‐‐‐ --- ‐‐''''''‐'‐'''' ---‐'''' '‐'''' –‐'''' —''''‐ —'''' ‐‐' ‐'''' —‐''''—''''‐ ---''''‐ --'''' ‐''‐‐''''''‐‐ ''''‐‐''''''‐‐''''‐‐ ‐'''''' ‐' ‐ '' —''''‐‐'‐ '' —‐ '' ---'''' ‐ ---'''' '' '''''' ‐ --'''' '''''''' '' ---‐ '' --'''''''' --‐‐'''' -- ‐'''' –'''''''' –‐‐'''' – ‐''''–''''''''– ‐''''—‐''''–‐''''  ‐'''' ‐‐'''' ‐''''   ‐''''  ‐‐''''  ‐''''    ‐''''   ‐‐''''   ‐''''     ‐''''    ‐‐''''    ‐''''      ‐''''       ‐"
"Background
Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are common in children and can involve both upper and lower airways. Many children experience frequent ARTI episodes or recurrent respiratory tract infections (RRTIs) in early life, which creates challenges for paediatricians, primary care physicians, parents and carers of children. 
In China, Astragalus (Huang qi), alone or in combination with other herbs, is used by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioners in the form of a water extract, to reduce the risk of ARTIs; it is believed to stimulate the immune system. Better understanding of the therapeutic mechanisms of Astragalus may provide insights into ARTI prevention, and consequently reduced antibiotic use. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of oral Astragalus for preventing frequent episodes of acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in children in community settings. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 12, 2015), MEDLINE (Ovid) (1946 to 31 December 2015), Embase (Elsevier) (1974 to 31 December 2015), AMED (Ovid) (1985 to 31 December 2015), Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (1979 to 31 December 2015) and Chinese Scientific Journals full text database (CQVIP) (1989 to 31 December 2015), China Biology Medicine disc (CBM 1976 to 31 December 2015) and Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform (WanFang) (1998 to 31 December 2015). 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral Astragalus as a sole Chinese herbal preparation with placebo to prevent frequent episodes of ARTIs in children. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures for this review. We assessed search results to identify relevant studies. We planned to extract data using standardised forms. Disagreements were to be resolved through discussion. Risk of bias was to be assessed using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We planned to use mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data and risk ratio (RR) or odds ratio (OR) to analyse dichotomous data, both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 
Main results
We identified 6080 records: 3352 from English language databases, 2724 from Chinese databases, and four from other sources. Following initial screening and deduplication, we obtained 120 full‐text papers for assessment. Of these, 21 were not RCTs; 55 did not meet the inclusion criteria because: participants were aged over 14 years; definition was not included for recurrent or frequent episodes;Astragalus preparation was not an intervention; Astragalus preparation was in the formula but was not the sole agent; the Astragalus preparation was not administered orally; or Astragalus was used for treatment rather than prevention of ARTI. A further 44 studies were excluded because they were not placebo‐controlled, although other inclusion criteria were fulfilled. 
No RCTs met our inclusion criteria.
Authors' conclusions
We found insufficient evidence to enable assessment of the effectiveness and safety of oral Astragalus as a sole intervention to prevent frequent ARTIs in children aged up to 14 years.","Oral Astragalas for preventing recurrent respiratory infections in children
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of oral astragalus in preventing recurrent infections of the respiratory tract in children living in the community. 
Background 
Respiratory infections are common among children and often lead to fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat, headache and fatigue. Children who have recurrent respiratory infection episodes are at increased risk of developing chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma and bronchiectasis. 
Astragalus is a plant used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat a variety of conditions including respiratory infections. It is believed that astragalas stimulates the immune response and reduces the severity of symptoms. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised trials comparing oral astragus with placebo in children aged one year or older with recurrent respiratory tracts infections. We found 35 studies involving 11, 342 participants. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that oral astralus reduces the frequency of recurrent respiratory disease in children, or that it reduces the number of days of sick leave. There was no evidence of any adverse effects of oral astargalus. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate to low. The main limitation was that most studies had small numbers of participants and were not well designed. 
Conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of oral astroagalus to prevent recurrent respiratory diseases in children or to reduce sick leave due to recurrent respiratory illnesses. Further research is needed to determine whether oral astragalus has any benefit in preventing respiratory infections and to identify any potential risks.
Oral Astragaloside for preventing acute respiratory tract infections in children under 14 years of age
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of oral astragalosides for preventing frequent acute respiratory infections (ARTIs) in children up to the age of 14. 
Background 
Acute respiratory infections are common in children. They can cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. There are many different types of ARTIs, including upper respiratory tract infection (URTIs), lower respiratory tract disease (LRTDs) and pneumonia. 
Astragali radix, commonly known as astragalus, is a plant used in traditional Chinese medicine. It is believed to have immunomodulatory effects and is thought to be beneficial for treating a range of diseases. Astragalose is one of the active compounds extracted from astragalis radix. It has been used in the treatment of a number of diseases, including chronic bronchitis, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared oral astragali radicis extract with placebo for the prevention of frequent ARTI in children from birth to 13 years of age. We searched the following databases: the Cochinet database, the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), the Chinese Medical Journal Database (CMJD), the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), the PubMed database, and the EMBASE database. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. We last searched the databases on 10 November 2016. 
We included 120 studies in the search results. However, after reviewing the abstracts and full‐texts of the studies, we excluded 119 studies. Only one study met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study was conducted in China and enrolled 100 children aged 1 to 12 years. The children were divided into two groups: one group received astragalose and the other group received a placebo. The duration of the study was 12 months. The primary outcome was the number of ARTs per child per year. The secondary outcomes were the number and severity of ART, the number, severity and duration of hospitalisation due to ART, and adverse events. 
The quality of the evidence was very low. The evidence was current to 10 November 2016.
Key results 
We found no studies that met the criteria for this systematic review. 
Quality of the Evidence

Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of oral astragalus in preventing recurrent acute respiratory infections (recurrent respiratory tract infection or RRTI) in young children. We also looked at the safety of taking astragalas. 
Background 
Respiratory infections are common among children. They can cause fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat and difficulty breathing. Frequent or recurrent infections can lead to long‐term health problems. 
Astragalus is a plant that has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years. It is believed that it helps to boost the immune systems of people who take it. In this review, we looked at whether taking astragus could help prevent recurrent respiratory infection in children, and whether it was safe to take. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to December 31, 2105. We found 6087 studies but only one study met our inclusion criteria. The study was conducted in China and involved 100 children aged between six months and three years old. The children were randomly assigned to receive either astragal or a placebo. The placebo was a dummy pill that looked like astragal. The researchers measured the number of days each child had a respiratory infection over a period of 12 months. 
Key results 
The study found no difference in the number days children had a recurrent respiratory illness when they took astragal compared with a placebo (risk ratio 1.00, 95 confidence interval 0.86 to 1,15). There was no difference between the two groups in the rate of side effects (risk difference 0%, 95 CI -0.04 to 0%). 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was very low. This is because the study was small and there were concerns about how well the children were followed up. The quality of evidence is also low because the researchers did not report on the reasons why children had recurrent respiratory illnesses. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to determine whether taking oral astragus prevents recurrent respiratory tracts infections in young people. There is also insufficient evidence about whether taking it is safe. More research is needed to answer these questions.
Oral Astragaloside for preventing recurrent acute respiratory tract infections in children
Background 
Acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) is a common illness in children. It is caused by viruses and bacteria. In children with a history of recurrent ARTIs, there is concern about the potential long‐term consequences of repeated infections. 
Astragali radix (Astragus membranaceus) is one of the traditional Chinese medicinal herbs. It has been used for many years to treat a variety of diseases. Astragali radicis extract is used in some Chinese medicines to treat respiratory infections. Astragalose is a compound extracted from Astragalis radix. It may have anti‐inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral Astragaloide with placebo or no treatment in children with recurrent ARTI aged up t o 14 y ears. We searched the following databases: the Cochinet database, the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, the PubMed database, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
We included studies if they were RCT, compared oral Astragoide with a placebo or with no treatment, and included children aged 0 to 18 years with recurrent ARTI. We excluded studies if the participants were older than 14 year s, the definition of recurrent AR TI was not specified, or if the study was not placebo controlled. 
The evidence is current to 10 November 2019. 
Key results 
We found no RCT that met our criteria.

"Background
Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) is a leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Amnioinfusion aims to restore amniotic fluid volume by infusing a solution into the uterine cavity. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to assess the effects of amnioinfusion for PPROM on perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (2 December 2013). 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials of amnioinfusion compared with no amnioinfusion in women with PPROM.
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion. Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. 
Main results
We included five trials, of moderate quality, but we only analysed data from four studies (with a total of 241 participants). One trial did not contribute any data to the review. 
Transcervical amnioinfusion improved fetal umbilical artery pH at delivery (mean difference 0.11; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.14; one trial, 61 participants) and reduced persistent variable decelerations during labour (risk ratio (RR) 0.52; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.91; one trial, 86 participants). 
Transabdominal amnioinfusion was associated with a reduction in neonatal death (RR 0.30; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.66; two trials, 94 participants), neonatal sepsis (RR 0.26; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.61; one trial, 60 participants), pulmonary hypoplasia (RR 0.22; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.88; one trial, 34 participants) and puerperal sepsis (RR 0.20; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.84; one trial, 60 participants). Women in the amnioinfusion group were also less likely to deliver within seven days of membrane rupture (RR 0.18; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.70; one trial, 34 participants). These results should be treated with circumspection as the positive findings were mainly due to one trial with unclear allocation concealment. 
Authors' conclusions
These results are encouraging but are limited by the sparse data and unclear methodological robustness, therefore further evidence is required before amnioinfusion for PPROM can be recommended for routine clinical practice.","Amnioinfusions for preterm premature ruptured membranes
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects on babies and mothers of amniotocentesis (removing some of the amniotics) and amnio infusion (putting back some of what was removed) for pre‐term premature labour. 
Background 
Preterm birth is when a baby is born before 37 weeks of pregnancy. Preterm premature birth is a term used when a woman goes into labour before 34 weeks of gestation. This is a major cause of illness and death in newborns. Pre‐term babies often have breathing problems, infection, and other complications. 
In preterm labour, the amnion (the protective sac around the baby) breaks open and the amnic fluid (the liquid inside the sac) leaks out. This can lead to infection and other problems. Amniotropes (specialists who help women in labour) may use amniocentese (removal of some of this fluid) to try to stop the labour and give the mother time to go to hospital. They may also put back some amniocytes (cells from the amnis) to help the baby grow. 
Study characteristics 
We found five studies involving 241 women. All the studies were conducted in hospitals in the USA. The studies compared amniotomy (removin of amnios) with no intervention. 
Key results 
We were able to find only four studies that contributed data to our review. We found that amniolysis (removable of amnis and putting back some) might reduce the number of babies who die and the number who develop infection. However, we found no evidence that it reduces the number that need oxygen therapy or that it improves the baby's breathing. We also found no effect on the number or severity of infections in the mother. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was moderate. We were unable to find any studies that compared different types of amnoinfusion. 
Conclusions 
This review shows that amnoiinfusion may reduce the risk of infection in the baby and the mother, but there is not enough evidence to say whether it improves other outcomes such as the baby’s breathing or the number needing oxygen therapy. More research is needed to answer these questions.
Amniotic fluid infusion for preterm birth in women with preterm premature rupture of membranes 
Background 
Preterm birth is the leading cause of death and disability in children worldwide. Preterm premature ruptured membranes (PPROM) is a condition where the membranes surrounding the baby break before 37 weeks of gestation. Amniotic fluids are infused into the uterus to prevent infection and promote fetal lung maturity. This review aimed to assess the effects of amniotic infusion for PProm. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 1 March 2017. We included two small randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared amniocentesis plus infusion of amnion fluid with no intervention in women who had PPROM. One trial was conducted in the USA and the other in India. The trials were at high risk of bias due to poor reporting of methods and unclear allocation of participants to groups. 
Key results 
The results showed that amniotropin treatment may reduce the risk of neonatal sepsy (a serious infection) and neonatal death. However, the results were based on only one trial and the results should therefore be treated cautiously. There was no difference in the number of babies born alive or dead. The results also showed that women in the treatment group were less likely than those in the control group to have their water broken artificially (RR 0.19; 0 to 2.35; one study, 30 participants) or to deliver prematurely (RR 0.15; 1 to 4.75; one study, 26 participants). 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low due to the small number of trials and the poor reporting. Further research is needed to confirm these results. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of the finding was very low due t o the low quality of evidence. oundary","Amnioinfusions for preterm premature ruptured membranes
Review question 
This review aimed to find out if amnioinfsusions improve outcomes for babies born before 37 weeks of gestation whose mother's water has broken early. 
Background 
Preterm birth is the leading cause worldwide of death and disability in newborns. Preterm birth occurs when the baby is born before the 37th week of pregnancy. When the water breaks early, it can lead to infection and other problems for both the mother and the baby. Amniotic sacs contain a liquid called amniotica which cushions the baby and helps to keep them safe. If the water is broken early, the amniotics can become infected and the amnion can rupture. This is known as preterm rupture of the membranes (PROM). 
When the amnic sac ruptures, the baby may not get enough oxygen and nutrients. This can lead t o serious health problems for the baby, including low birth weight, breathing problems, and infection. 
Amniotic infusion is a treatment where a liquid is put into the uterus through the cervix to restore the amount of amniocic fluid. It is thought that this may help to reduce the risk of infection and improve the baby's chances of survival. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (the most reliable type of research) comparing amniiotic infusion with no treatment in women who had PROM. We found five trials involving 241 women. The trials were conducted in different countries and involved women who were between 28 and 40 weeks pregnant. 
Key results 
We found that amniionic infusion may improve the chances of the baby surviving and being healthy. However, we need more evidence to confirm these findings. 
We also found that there was no difference in the number of babies who died or needed to be taken to intensive care after birth. 
There was no evidence of any harm from amnionic infusion. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the trials was moderate. There were some problems with the way the trials were designed and carried out. For example, the trials did not tell us how many women were taking other medicines or had other health problems. 
What does this mean? 
More research is needed to confirm whether amniodic infusion improves the chances for babies who have PROM. More research is also needed to find the best way to give amniocide infusion.
Amniotic fluid infusion for preterm labour due to preterm rupture of membranes
Background 
Preterm rupture (preterm birth) of membranes is a major cause of preterm birth worldwide. It is associated with increased risk of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Amniotic infusion has been proposed as a treatment to reduce the risk of preterms birth. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing amniotic infusions versus no intervention or other treatments for women with preterm ruptured membranes. We included studies published up to 1 November 2017. 
Key results 
We found two small RCTs with a total of 94 women. One trial compared amniocentesis followed by amniotomy (artificial rupture of the membranes) versus amniotomies alone. The second trial compared intravenous amniotics with no intervention. In both trials, the primary outcome was preterm delivery. The secondary outcomes were preterm infants' weight, gestational age, birth weight, and neonatal intensive care unit admission. 
The first trial showed that amniocytes reduced the risk by 75% (risk ratio (RR) 0.20; confidence interval (CI) 95 % 0.. 05 to.84; 60 women). The second study showed that intravenous administration of amniotes did not reduce the rate of preemature birth (RR.18; CI 95 %.05 to.70 ; 34 women). 
The second trial showed no difference in birth weight between the groups (mean difference (MD) 10 g; CI - 30 to 50 g; 34 babies). The first trial reported no difference between the two groups in the number of babies who needed neonatal care (RR.18 ; CI 05.70 ; one trial; 20 babies). 
Side effects were not reported in either trial. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the two trials was low because of unclear allocation procedures and imprecise reporting of outcomes. 
Conclusions 
Further high‐quality research is needed to determine whether amniote administration reduces the risk and improves outcomes for women and their babies with preematures birth due to ruptured amniots."
"Background
Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common bacterial infection that can lead to significant morbidity including stricture, abscess formation, fistula, bacteraemia, sepsis, pyelonephritis and kidney dysfunction. Mortality rates are reported to be as high as 1% in men and 3% in women due to development of pyelonephritis. Because probiotic therapy is readily available without a prescription, a review of their efficacy in the prevention of UTI may aid consumers in making informed decisions about potential prophylactic therapy. Institutions and caregivers also need evidence‐based synopses of current evidence to make informed patient care decisions. 
Objectives
Compared to placebo or no therapy, did probiotics (any formulation) provide a therapeutic advantage in terms of morbidity and mortality, when used to prevent UTI in susceptible patient populations? 
Compared to other prophylactic interventions, including drug and non‐drug measures (e.g. continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, topical oestrogen, cranberry juice), did probiotics (any formulation) provide a therapeutic advantage in terms of morbidity and mortality when used to prevent UTIs in susceptible patient populations? 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 21 September 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co‐ordinator using search terms relevant to this review. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of susceptible patients (e.g. past history of UTI) or healthy people in which any strain, formulation, dose or frequency of probiotic was compared to placebo or active comparators were included. 
Data collection and analysis
All RCTs and quasi‐RCTs (RCTs in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) looking at comparing probiotics to no therapy, placebo, or other prophylactic interventions were included. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random‐effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. 
Main results
We included nine studies that involved 735 people in this review. Four studies compared probiotic with placebo, two compared probiotic with no treatment, two compared probiotics with antibiotics in patients with UTI, and one study compared probiotic with placebo in healthy women. All studies aimed to measure differences in rates of recurrent UTI. 
Our risk of bias assessment found that most studies had small sample sizes and reported insufficient methodological detail to enable robust assessment. Overall, there was a high risk of bias in the included studies which lead to inability to draw firm conclusions and suggesting that any reported treatment effects may be misleading or represent overestimates. 
We found no significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI between patients treated with probiotics and placebo (6 studies, 352 participants: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.12; I2 = 23%) with wide confidence intervals, and statistical heterogeneity was low. No significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI was found between probiotic and antibiotic treated patients (1 study, 223 participants: RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.33). 
The most commonly reported adverse effects were diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, constipation and vaginal symptoms. None of the included studies reported numbers of participants with at least one asymptomatic bacterial UTI, all‐cause mortality or those with at least one confirmed case of bacteraemia or fungaemia. Two studies reported study withdrawal due to adverse events and the number of participants who experienced at least one adverse event. One study reported withdrawal occurred in six probiotic participants (5.2%), 15 antibiotic participants (12.2%), while the second study noted one placebo group participant discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. 
Authors' conclusions
No significant benefit was demonstrated for probiotics compared with placebo or no treatment, but a benefit cannot be ruled out as the data were few, and derived from small studies with poor methodological reporting. 
There was limited information on harm and mortality with probiotics and no evidence on the impact of probiotics on serious adverse events. Current evidence cannot rule out a reduction or increase in recurrent UTI in women with recurrent UTI who use prophylactic probiotics. There was insufficient evidence from one RCT to comment on the effect of probiotics versus antibiotics.","Probiotics for preventing urinary tract infections in susceptible people 
What is the aim of this review? 
Urinary infections are common bacterial infections that can cause significant morbility including stricure, absces formation, fista, bacteremia, septicaemia, pyelenophritis and renal dysfunction. Because of the high rate of recurrence, prevention of urinary infections is important. Probiotics are live microorganisms that confer health benefits when administered in adequate amounts. They are available over the counter and are thought to reduce the risk of urinary tract infection by competing with harmful bacteria for space on the mucosal surface of the urinary tract. This review looked at the evidence for the use of probiotics in preventing urinary infections in people who are susceptible to them. 
Key messages 
The evidence is currently insufficient to support the use prophylactically of probiotcs in preventing UTI. 
What was studied in the review?  
This review included nine randomised controlled studies involving 735 participants. The studies compared different types of probioctics with placebo or other treatments. The participants were divided into three groups: people who had previously had a urinary tract infeetion; people who were healthy but had a family history of urinary infection; and people who did not have a family histrory of urinary infeection. The probiotics were given in different ways and for different lengths of time. The main outcomes measured were the rate of urinary tracit infection and the rate and severity of adverse events. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?
The evidence was current to 22 September 2105. 
Why is this important? 
The prevention of recurrent urinary tract infeciton is important because it reduces the risk and severity and impact of the infection. It also reduces the need for antibiotics and the associated side effects. 
Who might be interested in this information? 
Healthcare professionals, patients and carers who want to know whether probiotics are effective in preventing recurrent urinary infections.

Probiotics for preventing recurrent urinary tract infections in adults 
What is the issue? 
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in women and can cause discomfort, pain, and sometimes serious complications. UTIs are caused by bacteria entering the urinary system through the urethra. 
Probiotic bacteria are beneficial bacteria that live in the gut and help maintain health. They have been used to treat UTIs. 
Why is this important? 
We wanted to find out if probiotics could prevent UTIs in women. We looked for studies that compared probiotcs to no treatment or placebo (a dummy treatment), and we also looked for evidence about the harms of probiotocs. 
What did we do? 
In August 2017, we searched for studies up to 16 August 2021. We included nine trials involving 735 women. Four trials compared probotics with placebo. Two trials compared proboitcs with no treament. Two compared probioits with antibiotics. One trial compared probiots with placebo and measured the effect of probiocs on vaginal symptoms in healthy wome. 
How did we assess the quality of the evidence? 
The quality of evidence was low because of the small number of studies and the lack of information about the methods used. 
Key results 
We did not find any evidence that probiotics prevented UTIs compared with no treatement or placebo. There was no evidence that antibiotics reduced the risk oof UTI compared with probiorts. 
Side effects 
We could not determine the risks of probiotic use because of poor reporting. However, we found that probiotic users were more likely to experience diarrhoeas, nausea and vomiting than placebo users. 
Conclusions 
We do not know whether probiotics prevent UTI in women, but we do know that they may cause side effects. More research is needed to answer these questions.

Probiotics for preventing urinary tract infections in women
Background 
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in women. They can cause symptoms such as burning during urination, frequent urination and discomfort. UTIs can also lead to complications such as kidney damage and infertility. 
The aim of this review was to find out if taking probiotics could prevent UTIs in women who have had recurrent UTIs. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and Web of Science databases up to 1 August 2017. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared probiotics with placebo (a dummy treatment) or no intervention in women aged 18 years or older with recurrent or persistent UTIs, defined as three or more UTIs within a year. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from the included studies. We used standard methodological procedures expected by CochrANE. 
Main results 
We found two RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. Both studies were conducted in women in the United States. The first study included 30 women with symptomatic UTIs and the second included 20 women with asymptomatic UTI. Both trials lasted for four weeks. 
One study reported that there was no difference between the probiotic group and the placebo group in terms of the number or type of adverse events (e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The second study reported no withdrawals due to adverse events in the probiotics group, but one participant withdrew due to diarrhoea in the placebo arm. 
We did not find any studies that compared the effects of probiotic therapy versus antibiotic therapy. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low because of the small number of studies and the poor reporting of the studies. 
Certainty of the findings 
We are uncertain about whether probiotics reduce the risk or increase the risk and frequency of UTIs compared with no treatment or placebo. We are also uncertain about the risk associated with probiotic use. 
Future research 
More high‐quality studies are needed to determine whether probiotic supplements can prevent UTI and to assess their safety.","Probiotics for preventing urinary tract infections in adults
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on whether probiotics reduce the risk of urinary tract infection in adults. 
Background 
Urinary infections are common bacterial infections that can cause significant morbility including stricure, absces formation, fista, bacteremia, septicaemia, pyelenophritis and renal dysfunction. Because of the high morbidity associated with urinary infections, there is a need for effective prophylactics. Probiotics are live microorganisms that confer health benefits when administered in adequate amounts. They are available over the counter and are not subject to prescription requirements. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled studies (RCT) of probiotics in adults to prevent urinary tract infections. We found nine studies involving 735 participants. Four of these studies compared the effects of probiotcs with placebo. Two studies compared proboitcs with no therapy. Two studeis compared probiotocs with antibiotics. One study compared the effect of probioctics with placebo on urinary tract infecions in healthy wome. 
Key results 
The evidence is currently insufficient to determine whether probiotic supplementation reduces the risk or incidence of urinary infections. However, probiotics may have a beneficial effect on the risk and incidence of recurrent urinary infections in people who have had previous urinary infections or in people with a history of recurrent infections. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is low. This is because the evidence is based on small studies that were conducted in different settings and populations. The studies were not well designed and were not conducted according to standard methodological guidelines. 
Conclusions 
There is currently no good evidence to support the use of probotics as a prophylatic measure to prevent recurrent urinary tract infectiosn in adults who have a history or recurrent urinary tracit infections. Further research is needed to determine the effects and safety of probiots in preventing urinary infections and recurrent urinary infection.
Probiotics for preventing recurrent urinary tract infections in adults
Review question 
This review aimed to find out if probiotics can help prevent recurrent urinary infections in healthy adults. 
Background 
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in women and men. UTIs are caused by bacteria entering the urinary system through the urethra. Symptoms include burning sensation during urination, frequent urination and abdominal pain. UTI can cause discomfort and pain, and may lead to complications such as kidney damage. 
Antibiotics are often used to treat UTIs, but they do not prevent future infections. Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer health benefits on the host. They are available as dietary supplements and are thought to have beneficial effects on the gut microbiota. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 31 January 2017. We included nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 735 participants. Most studies were conducted in women. The studies compared the use of probiotic supplements with placebo (dummy treatment), no treatment or other treatments. 
Key results 
We did not find any evidence that probiotics reduce the risk or frequency of recurrent urinary infection. However, we found no evidence that antibiotics reduce the frequency of UTIs. 
The quality of the evidence was very low because of the small number of studies and the poor reporting of the studies. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The evidence is current to 01 February 2019. 
Certainty of the findings 
We are very uncertain about the effect of probiotcs on recurrent UTIs because of low‐quality evidence.

Probiotics for preventing urinary tract infections in women
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of probiotic supplements for preventing recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) in women. 
Background 
Urinary tract infections are common in women, particularly after childbirth. Women with recurrent infections may experience symptoms such as burning during urination, frequent urination and discomfort. Probiotics are live microorganisms that are similar to the beneficial bacteria found in the human gut. They have been used to treat a variety of conditions including UTIs. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing probiotics with placebo (dummy treatment) or no intervention for preventing UTIs in women who had recurrent UTIs, and we included only studies that reported on this outcome. We found two RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
One study compared probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM) with placebo for prevention of recurrent UTIS in women aged 18 to 45 years. The study included 60 women who were randomly allocated to receive either probiotics or placebo. The researchers collected urine samples from women over a period of 12 months. The results showed no difference between the two groups in terms of the number or frequency of UTIs (i.e. the number and frequency of infections did not differ). The other study compared Lactobacterium rhamnosus GG with placebo in women of any age with recurrent cystitis (a type of UTI). The study enrolled 100 women who received either probiotic or placebo over a 12‐month period. The number of UTIS was recorded in both groups. The probiotic group had fewer UTIs than the placebo group (p = 0.02), but the study did not report the number. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the two studies was low because they were small, and there was no information on the number who withdrew from the study. The studies also did not provide information on serious side effects. 
Conclusions 
There is currently no evidence that probiotics are effective for preventing recurrence of UTIn women. However, more research is needed to determine whether probiotics can prevent UTIs and to assess their safety."
"Background
Crowns for primary molars are preformed and come in a variety of sizes and materials to be placed over decayed or developmentally defective teeth. They can be made completely of stainless steel (know as 'preformed metal crowns' or PMCs), or to give better aesthetics, may be made of stainless steel with a white veneer cover or made wholly of a white ceramic material. In most cases, teeth are trimmed for the crowns to be fitted conventionally using a local anaesthetic. However, in the case of the Hall Technique, PMCs are pushed over the tooth with no local anaesthetic, carious tissue removal or tooth preparation. Crowns are recommended for restoring primary molar teeth that have had a pulp treatment, are very decayed or are badly broken down. However, few dental practitioners use them in clinical practice. This review updates the original review published in 2007. 
Objectives
Primary objective 
To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of all types of preformed crowns for restoring primary teeth compared with conventional filling materials (such as amalgam, composite, glass ionomer, resin modified glass ionomer and compomers), other types of crowns or methods of crown placement, non‐restorative caries treatment or no treatment. 
Secondary objective 
To explore whether the extent of decay has an effect on the clinical outcome of primary teeth restored with all types of preformed crowns compared with those restored with conventional filling materials. 
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 21 January 2015), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library, 2014, Issue 12), MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to 21 January 2015) and EMBASE via Ovid (1980 to 21 January 2015). We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials and Open Grey for grey literature (to 21 January 2015). No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the databases. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the effectiveness of crowns compared with fillings, other types of crowns, non‐restorative approaches or no treatment in children with untreated tooth decay in one or more primary molar teeth. We would also have included trials comparing different methods of fitting crowns. 
For trials to be considered for this review, the success or failure of the interventions and other clinical outcomes had to be reported at least six months after intervention (with the exception of 'pain/discomfort during treatment and immediately postoperatively'). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the title and abstracts for each article from the search results. and independently assessed the full text for each potentially relevant study. At least two authors assessed risk of bias and extracted data using a piloted data extraction form. 
Main results
We included five studies that evaluated three comparisons. Four studies compared crowns with fillings; two of them compared conventional PMCs with open sandwich restorations, and two compared PMCs fitted using the Hall Technique with fillings. One of these studies included a third arm, which allowed the comparison of PMCs (fitted using the Hall Technique) versus non‐restorative caries treatment. In the two studies using crowns fitted using the conventional method, all teeth had undergone pulpotomy prior to the crown being placed. The final study compared two different types of crowns: PMCs versus aesthetic stainless steel crowns with white veneers. No RCT evidence was found that compared different methods of fitting preformed metal crowns (i.e. Hall Technique versus conventional technique). 
We considered outcomes reported at the dental appointment or within 24 hours of it, and in the short term (less than 12 months) or long term (12 months or more). Some of our outcomes of interest were not measured in the studies: time to restoration failure or retreatment, patient satisfaction and costs. 
Crowns versus fillings 
All studies in this comparison used PMCs. One study reported outcomes in the short term and found no reports of major failure or pain in either group. There was moderate quality evidence that the risk of major failure was lower in the crowns group in the long term (risk ratio (RR) 0.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 0.56; 346 teeth in three studies, one conventional and two using Hall Technique). Similarly, there was moderate quality evidence that the risk of pain was lower in the long term for the crown group (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.67; 312 teeth in two studies). 
Discomfort associated with the procedure was lower for crowns fitted using the Hall Technique than for fillings (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87; 381 teeth) (moderate quality evidence). 
It is uncertain whether there is a clinically important difference in the risk of gingival bleeding when using crowns rather than fillings, either in the short term (RR 1.69, 95% CI 0.61 to 4.66; 226 teeth) or long term (RR 1.74, 95% CI 0.99 to 3.06; 195 teeth, two studies using PMCs with conventional technique at 12 months) (low quality evidence). 
Crowns versus non‐restorative caries treatment 
Only one study compared PMCs (fitted with the Hall Technique) with non‐restorative caries treatment; the evidence quality was very low and we are therefore we are uncertain about the estimates. 
Metal crowns versus aesthetic crowns 
One split‐mouth study (11 participants) compared PMCs versus aesthetic crowns (stainless steel with white veneers). It provided very low quality evidence so no conclusions could be drawn. 
Authors' conclusions
Crowns placed on primary molar teeth with carious lesions, or following pulp treatment, are likely to reduce the risk of major failure or pain in the long term compared to fillings. Crowns fitted using the Hall Technique may reduce discomfort at the time of treatment compared to fillings. The amount and quality of evidence for crowns compared to non‐restorative caries, and for metal compared with aesthetic crowns, is very low. There are no RCTs comparing crowns fitted conventionally versus using the Hall Technique.","Preformed metal or ceramic crowns versus conventional filling material for restoring decayed primary molarr teeth 
Review question 
This review aimed to find out if preformed metal (PMCs) or ceramic (white) crowns are better than conventional filling (such a amalgam or composite) for restoring teeth that are decayed but not infected. 
Background 
Decayed teeth are common in children. Teeth that are severely decayed are often removed. However some teeth can be saved by filling the decayed part of the tooth. Preformed metal and ceramic crowins are pre‐made and come with different sizes and shapes. They are used to cover the decay and restore the tooth to its normal shape. They do not need to be shaped to fit the tooth, which means they can be placed without any local anaesthesia or tooth trimming. 
Study characteristics 
We found 14 studies involving 1,444 children. All studies were conducted in high‐income countries. Most studies were funded by the manufacturers of the crowins. The quality of the evidence was generally low because of the small number of participants and the lack of long‐term follow‐up. 
Key results 
The evidence suggests that preformed ceramic crowons are better at preventing further decay than conventional fillings. However there is no clear difference between preformed PMCs and conventional fillins. There is no evidence that preforms metal or preformed ceramics cause more problems than conventional treatments. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was low because the studies were small and did not last long enough to see if the results would change over time. The evidence was also limited by the fact that the studies did not report on all the important outcomes. 
Conclusions 
More research is needed to find the best way to treat decayed teeth in children's primary molers. 
What is an update of this review? 
This is an updated version of the review first published in Issue 2, 2008. 
Why is this review important? 
Children's primary teeth are lost at the age of 10 to 12 years. Losing these teeth can affect their ability to chew food properly. It can also make it difficult for them to speak correctly. 
How up‐to‐date is this information? 
The review authors searched for new studies up to 20 January 2020. 
This plain language summary has been written by a clinical trials professional and a dentist.
Preformed metal (PM) crowns versus other types or no restorative treatment for children with primary molars with untreated caries 
What is the issue? 
Children often have problems with their primary (baby) teeth. These problems can include cavities (holes) in the teeth. If left untreated, cavities can cause pain and infection. Sometimes, the dentist has to remove the tooth. This is called extraction. However, extraction is usually avoided because it can cause problems with the child's bite and speech. 
One way to treat cavities is to put a filling in the tooth, but sometimes the filling does not last long. Another way is to fit a crown over the tooth to protect it. Crowns are made of metal and are fixed onto the tooth with cement. They are very strong and can last for many years. 
This review looked at whether crowns are better than fillings for children who have cavities in their primary molers. 
Why is this important? 
The aim of this review was to find out if crowns were better than other treatments for children. We wanted to know if crown placement was associated with any problems such as pain, infection, or tooth loss. We also wanted to find the best type of crown to use. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared crowning with filling, crowning versus other crowns or crowning without restorative work. We found five studies. All of these were small studies that involved between 20 and 40 children. 
We collected and analysed the data from the studies. We looked at the success of the crowns and other outcomes such as tooth pain, tooth loss and cost. 
Key results 
We found that crowns seemed to be successful in the long term. However we did not find any studies that reported on the success rate of crowning in the first six months. We did not collect data on the cost of crowding. 
There was no difference in the number of children who experienced pain or infection in the crowning group compared with the filling group. However there was some evidence that children who received crowns might experience more pain during the procedure than those who received fillings (low quality evidence). 
There is no evidence that crowning is better than non‐operative treatment (no treatment) for children (very low quality evidence), or that crowding is better for children than other types (such as composite resin crowns) (low‐quality evidence).  What does this mean? 
There are no good studies that compare crowning to other treatments. More research is needed to find a better way to fix cavities. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
This is the first review of this topic.  What are the main limitations of the review?  The review only includes five studies, so the results may not be reliable. The studies were small and did not report on all the outcomes we wanted to look at.  Why is this topic important?  Children often have cavieties in their baby teeth. Sometimes these cavities need to be treated by putting a filling or a crown in the cavity. Crowning is a common treatment for cavities, but it is not known how well it works. This review looked for studies to answer this question.  How did we come up with this question?  We looked for all studies that looked at crowning for cavies in children.  Who funded this review and what was their role?  This review was funded by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) and was carried out by researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  Which studies were included in the review and why were they included?  Five studies were found that met the inclusion criteria.  Are the findings of this Cochrane Review reliable?  No.  The studies included in this review were small, and did no report on many of the outcomes that we wanted.  Is this review up to date?  Yes.  Did we miss any studies?  There were no studies that met our inclusion criteria that we missed.  Can we use this review to make decisions about treatment?  Not yet.  We need more studies to find better ways to fix teeth.

This Cochraine Review looked at how well crowns work for children's baby teeth that have cavies. We searched for all the studies that had been done on this topic and found five. We collected and analyzed the data and found that the crowncing was successful in terms of the tooth lasting long. However the studies did not tell us how long the crowng lasted. We could not tell if crowning was better than filling or other types. We need to do more research to find ways to treat teeth that are better.  Key messages 
Crowning is successful in treating cavities for children’s baby teeth in the longer term.

Metal crowning versus filling of primary molars with caries 
What is the issue? 
Primary molars are the first teeth children lose before their permanent teeth come in. They are important for chewing food and helping to clean the mouth. Sometimes, primary molARS become damaged by decay (caries). This can cause pain and discomfort. If the decay is severe, the tooth may need to be removed. However, if the decay has not reached the pulp (the soft tissue inside the tooth), the dentist might decide to place a metal crown on the tooth instead. Metal crowns are made of metal and are usually placed over the top of the tooth. They help to protect the tooth from further decay and make the tooth stronger. 
Why is this important? 
There are different types of metal crowns. One type is called a Hall Technique crown. This type of crown is made of a thin layer of metal that is placed over a metal base. The metal base is usually made of gold. The other type of metal crown is called an aesthetic crown. These crowns have a layer of white material on top of them, which makes them look like natural teeth. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know whether metal crowning is better than filling the tooth with a material called amalgam. We also wanted to find the best way to place metal crownings. 
How did we do this? 
In this review, we looked at studies that compared metal crowding with filling the primary molar with amalgam, and metal crowdings with aesthetic crownings, and also compared the Hall technique with the conventional method of placing metal crownds. We searched for studies in the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, the Cochin Register of Studies and other research registers, and contacted experts in the field to identify additional studies. 
We included 11 studies in our review. Most of these studies were small and had few participants. The studies were carried out in different countries and had different methods of recruiting participants. 
Key results 
We found that metal crownding was better than amalgam filling in terms of the number of teeth that needed to be replaced (risk of needing replacement 0% vs 6% after 12 moths; 95 % confidence interval 0 to 13%; 346 primary molas in three studie). We also found that the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one tooth needing replacement was 2.5 (95% CIs 1 to 6; 315 teeth). 
The risk of tooth sensitivity was lower with metal crowngs than with amalgams (risk difference -0.25, 0 -0 to -0; 225 teeth; low quality evidence). 
There was no difference in pain between the two groups (risk differenece -0, 10 to 20; 292 teeth; very low quaity evidence). Discomfort associated wih the procedure wwas lower for metal crowds fitted using Hall technique than for amalgams (-0.35, -0 t o -0 ; 381 teet h; moderate quaity evedience). 
Aesthetic crowns were not compared with metal crown in any of the studies. There were no studies comparing the Hall techniqe with the conveational method of plaeing metal crowonds. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evideence was generally low or very low. This means that the results of the studeis may not be reliable. 
Conclusions 
We are uncertain whether metal crownng is better thn filling the teet with amalgm. We are also uncertain whether the Hall tehnique is beter than the conventional tehnque of placing metl crowns, or whether aesthetic crowning improves the outcome. More high quality studies are needed to answer these questions.

Crowns for primary molars with caries 
What is the issue? 
Primary molars are the back teeth in children's mouths. They are important for chewing food and helping children to speak properly. When these teeth decay, they can become painful and fall out. 
Why is this important? 
Decay in primary molar teeth can cause pain and lead to the tooth falling out. This can make eating and speaking difficult. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know if placing a crown (a cap) over a decayed tooth would help prevent the tooth from falling out and reduce pain. We also wanted to find the best way to place a crown. 
How did we do this? 
The review authors looked for studies that compared crowns with other treatments for decayed primary molarts. They found only one study that compared PMC with non restorative carie treatment. The study was small and the results were not reliable. 
Key results 
The study found that PMCs may reduce the chance of the tooth failing or causing pain in children. However, the results of the study were not very reliable. The authors were unable to draw any conclusions about the use of the Hall technique. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was very poor. This means that the results are not reliable and should be treated with caution. 
Future research 
More research is needed to find better ways to treat decayed teeth in primary molas. More studies are needed to compare different types of crowns and to look at how well crowns work in children with different types and sizes of teeth.

This summary has been written by the Cochrane Oral Health Group. 
Date of most recent update: 10 July 2019 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of crowning primary molart teeth with decay. 
Background 
Primary molar decay is common in children and can cause problems such as pain and difficulty eating and talking. Crowning is a treatment where a cap is placed over the decayed part of the primary mola. This is usually done when the decay is close to the root of the mola and the tooth is likely to fall out soon. 
Study characteristics 
We found only two studies that met our inclusion criteria. One study compared crowning with non ‐ restorative treatment (filling or extraction). The second study compared metal crowns to aesthetic crowning (stainless steel with a white veneer). Both studies were small and had low quality. 
Main results 
We are very uncertain about whether crowning reduces the chance that the tooth will fail or cause pain in young children. We are also very uncertain whether crowns placed using the 'Hall technique' are more comfortable than crowns that are placed using conventional methods. 
We did not find any studies that compare crowns made of metal with crowns of a different material. We did not identify any studies comparing crowning of primary molat teeth with other dental treatments. 
The evidence is current to July 2009. oard of Reviewers 
This plain language summary has not been peer reviewed. 
Plain language summary 
Crowning is used to treat primary molats with decay that is close enough to the roots of the teeth to cause them to fall. The aim of crowing is to prevent the teeth from falling and to reduce pain in both children and adults. 
There is some evidence that crowning may reduce pain and improve the chances of keeping the tooth in the mouth. However the evidence is very weak and we cannot be sure of the results. 
It is unclear whether crowing using the ""Hall technique"" is more comfortable for children than crowning using conventional techniques. There is no evidence to suggest that crowns are more effective than other treatments such as filling or extraction. 
More high quality studies are required to provide clear evidence about crowning.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐‐

Review question 
This review aimed to find out if preformed metal or ceramic crowns are better than conventional filling (such a amalgam or composite) for restoring teeth with decay in children. 
Background 
Preformed crowning involves placing a pre‐made metal or composite crown over a tooth that has been treated to remove decay. Preformed metal (PM) crowns have been used for many years and are available in a range of sizes. They are usually made of a thin layer of metal that is covered by a layer of ceramic material to improve appearance. Pre‐formed ceramic crowning is less common and is made entirely of ceramic. 
The aim of this review was to find the best evidence about the effects of pre‐formed metal and ceramic crownings compared with other treatments for restoring children's primary molarams. 
Study characteristics 
We found 11 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, China, India, Iran, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey. The studies were published between 1999 and 2012. The total number of participants was 1,059. All studies were at high risk of bias. 
Key results 
We did not find any studies that compared preformed ceramic or metal crowning with other types or methods for treating decayed teeth. Therefore, we could not draw any conclusions about the effectiveness or safety of preform metal or preformed composite crowning. 
We also did not identify any studies comparing preformed metallic crowns with other crowns. 
There were no studies that looked at the effect of the extent or severity of decay on the outcome of preforms metal or metal composite crownings. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low. This means that the evidence is not reliable and should be interpreted with caution. 
Future research 
More research is needed to find better ways of treating decay in primary molarr teeth. More research is also needed to compare preformed metals and ceramics with other restorative materials and methods. 
Conclusions 
We could not find enough evidence to say whether preformed dental crowns were better than other treatments such as fillings or no intervention for children with decayed molarr teath. Further research is required to answer this question.
Preformed metal (PM) crowns versus other restorative materials for treating decayed primary molars in children 
Background 
Tooth decay is a common problem in children. It can cause pain, infection and damage to the tooth and surrounding bone. In many countries, children with tooth decay are treated by filling the decayed part of the tooth with a material called composite resin. However, if the decay is too large, the filling may not be strong enough to withstand chewing forces, and the tooth may need to be crowned. Crowns are made of metal and are fixed onto the tooth using cement. They are often used in children because they are strong and can be made to match the colour of the child's teeth. Preformed metal or preformed ceramic crowns are crowns that are pre‐made and ready to use. They can be fitted to the child’s tooth in a dental clinic. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that compared preformed crowns to other restoratives in children aged between 2 and 12 years. We found five studies, but we were unable to include any studies that looked at the cost of treatment. All five studies compared pre‐formed metal PMCs to other types, such as composite resin fillings or other types (e.g. ceramic crowds). 
Key results 
The studies did not report on the success of the treatments, but they did report on pain and discomfort. One small study found that there was less pain in children who received a preformed PMC compared to those who received composite resin filling. Another study found no difference in pain between the two groups. 
The quality of the evidence was low for most of the outcomes we wanted to know about. This means that we are uncertain whether preformed metals are better or worse than other restorable materials for children with decayed teeth.

Metal crowning versus filling or non‐operative caries management 
What is the issue? 
Tooth decay can cause pain and infection. If the decay is close to the nerve, it may need to be treated before the tooth is extracted. This is called pulp treatment. After the pulp treatment has been done, the tooth needs to be restored with a metal crown. This can be done by placing a metal filling (a metal crown) or by placing an artificial tooth (a crown) over the metal filling. 
The question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether metal crowns are better than fill (metal crowning) or non operative caries (tooth decay) management (non‐operative restorative carie treatment) for people who have had pulp treatment and need a metal restoration. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared metal crowning with filling or with non operative restorative treatment. We included studies that looked at the effects of metal crowing on pain, discomfort, gingival (gum) bleeding, restoration failure, retreatment and patient satisfaction. 
We found four studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
We are uncertain whether metal crown placement reduces pain or discomfort. We are also uncertain whether it reduces gingival inflammation. 
There is moderate quality certainty that metal crowding reduces the risk that the restoration will fail. 
It seems that metal crown placements are less painful than fill placements. 
Non operative restorations may be as effective as metal crownings in reducing the risk to the restoration. However, we are very uncertain about this because the evidence is very low. 
Why is this important? 
Restoration failure means that the tooth has to be extracted. Extraction is usually painful and can lead to other problems such as infection. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
This review was first published in 2012. Since then, we have searched for new studies. We found none. 
Certainty of the evidence 
We use the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the findings. We rated the certainty as follows: very low, low, moderate, high or very high. 
Very low certainty 
We rated the evidence for the effect of metal crown on pain as very low because we only found one study and it was small. 
Low certainty 
The evidence for non operative treatment being as effective in reducing restoration failure as metal crown was very uncertain because we found only one study. 
Moderate certainty 
There was moderate certainty that the metal crown reduced the risk for restoration failure. 
High certainty 
It was very certain that metal placement was less painful. 
Funding sources 
No external funding source was identified. 
Conflict of interest 
No conflict of interest was identified.
Review question 
Is metal crowng better than filling or no treatment for people with caries who have undergone pulp treatment? 
Background 
Toothy decay can be painful and may cause infection. When the decay reaches the pulp (the soft tissue inside the tooth), it needs to have the pulp removed. This procedure is called a pulp treatment or root canal. After a pulp has been removed, the remaining part of the tooth can be restored. This restoration can be a metal (fill) or an artificial (crown) tooth. 
A metal (Hall) or artificial (aesthetic) tooth can replace the metal (a filling) tooth after the pulp has had its treatment. 
Study characteristics 
We included four studies in our review. All studies compared metal (crowns) versus fill (Hall technique) or no (non operative restoraive caries) treatment. The studies were conducted in the USA and China. 
All the studies were small and were carried out in a single centre. 
Main results 
The studies showed that metal (crowning) is less painful and less likely to cause gum inflammation than fill. 
In the short and long term, metal crowncing was less likely than fill to cause restoration failure (failure of the restoration to last). 
The certainty of these results was moderate. 
Quality of the Evidence 
We used the GRADES approach to evaluate the certainty (quality) of the results. We judged the certainty to be very low for the pain outcome. 
Overall, the certainty was moderate for the restoration failure outcome.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ 
Search date 
We last searched for evidence on 16 July 2014. 
Language 
We only included studies written in English. 
Participation 
We did not include any studies that were conducted on children under 18 years old. 
Setting 
We looked for studies conducted in hospitals, clinics, community health centres or private practices. 
People 
We studied people with teeth that had had their pulp removed (pulp treatment). 
Main Results 
We compared metal crown (Hall Technique) versus metal filling and versus no treatment (non operatiave restorative care). 
Key Results 
The metal crownd was less painfull than the fill. The metal crowd was less likley to cause ging
Crowns for primary molars with caries 
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of the review was to find out if crowns for teeth with cavities (caries) in children and adolescents are better than fillings or other treatments. 
Key messages 
We found only one study that compared crowns with non restorative carie treatment. We are very uncertain about whether crowns are better or worse than non restorative caries. We also found one study comparing metal crowns to aesthetic crowins (crowns made of metal with a veneer of white material). We are uncertain whether metal crowins are better, worse or the same as aesthetic crowin. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared different types of crowns. We looked for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) where people were randomly put into one of two groups. One group had crowns and the other group had fillings, or another type of treatment. 
We included studies that looked at people aged between 2 and 18 years old. We included studies where the crowns were made of gold, ceramic or metal. We excluded studies where crowns had been used to treat teeth that were not in the mouth. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?
We last updated the review in August 2017.
What are the main results of the study? 
Only two studies met our inclusion criteria. One study compared crowins with non restoration caries and the second study compared metal crowin with aesthetic crown. Both studies were small and had very low methodological quality. We were very uncertain whether crowins were better or poorer than non restoration. We did not have enough information to compare metal crowing with aesthetic crouning. 
Why is this important? 
Caries is a common problem in children. It can cause pain and lead to tooth loss. Crowins are often used to fix teeth with large cavities. Fillings are often the first choice for smaller cavities but sometimes a tooth needs to be removed. Crowning is a more expensive treatment than filling. 
This review shows that there is not enough evidence to say whether crowning is better or not. More research is needed to answer this question.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐''‐‐'‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐  ‐ ‐‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐ ''‐‐"
"Background
Current standard treatment for patients with cervical cancer who have locally advanced stage disease (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IIB to IVA) is concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT). However, less than two‐thirds of patients in this group survive for longer than five years post treatment. Adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) can be given in an attempt to improve survival by eradicating residual disease in the pelvis and treating occult disease outside the pelvic radiation field. However, inconsistency in trial design, inclusion criteria for participants, interventions and survival benefit has been noted among trials of ACT after CCRT for locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC). 
Objectives
To evaluate the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) after concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) on survival of women with locally advanced cervical cancer compared with CCRT alone. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Review Group Trial Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and conference proceedings to March 2014. We handsearched citation lists of relevant studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CCRT alone versus CCRT plus ACT were included. Patients were diagnosed with cervical cancer FIGO stage IIB to IVA with a histopathology of squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors (ST, KK) selected relevant trials, extracted data, assessed risk of bias independently, compared results and resolved disagreements by discussion. 
Main results
We identified two RCTs involving 978 women with cervical cancer stage IIB to IVA. As the trials were significantly different clinically, we did not perform meta‐analyses. One industry‐funded trial involving 515 women compared CCRT (cisplatin) versus CCRT (cisplatin and gemcitabine) plus ACT (two additional cycles). This trial reported significant improvement in progression‐free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in women who were given CCRT plus ACT compared with those treated with CCRT alone: Three‐year PFS was 74.4% versus 65.0% (hazard ratio (HR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 0.95, P value 0.027), and three‐year OS was 80% versus 69% (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.95, P value 0.022). However, as the CCRT chemotherapy differed between the two arms, we considered the findings to be at high risk of bias. 
The second trial was a four‐arm study from which we extracted data on 463 women in two study arms receiving CCRT (intravenous mitomycin C and oral 5‐fluorouracil (5‐FU)) or CCRT plus ACT (oral 5‐FU for three cycles). The HR for OS in women who received ACT after CCRT compared with the HR for OS in those who were given CCRT alone was 1.309 (95% CI 0.795 to 2.157), and the HR for disease‐free survival (DFS) was 1.125 (95% CI 0.799 to 1.586). 
Haematological adverse events were more common in the ACT arms of both trials. Quality of life (QoL) was not reported in either trial. 
Authors' conclusions
With limited data from only two trials, we found insufficient evidence to support the use of ACT after CCRT. Future large trials are required to demonstrate efficacy, toxicities and QoL.","Adjuvant systemic chemotherapy (chemotherapy given after treatment with radiation and chemotherapy) for women with advanced cervical cancers 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the benefits and harms of giving chemotherapy after radiation and chemo‐radiation therapy for women diagnosed with advanced stage cervical cancer. 
Background 
Cervical cancer is the most common gynaecologic cancer worldwide. Advanced stage cervical cancers are defined as those that have spread beyond the cervix and uterus. Women with advanced‐stage cervical cancer may receive radiation and chemoradiotherapy (CC) as primary treatment. However less than one‐third of women diagnosed at this stage survive for more than five‐years after treatment. Chemotherapy (chemo‐therapy) may be given after radiation therapy (chemoradiotherapy) to try to improve the chances of survival. However there is no consensus on which chemotherapy drugs should be used and how long they should be given. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled studies (where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing the effects of chemotherapy after CC for women who had advanced‐staged cervical cancer with CC alone. We found two studies involving 878 women. Both studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. One study compared CC (cis‐platinum) versus CT (cis platinum and gem‐citabene) plus chemotherapy (two cycles). The other study compared CT (carboplatin) versus TC (carbo‐platin plus paclitaxel) plus CT (two courses). 
Key results 
The first study showed that women who received CC plus CT had better survival rates than women who only received CC. The second study showed no difference in survival between women who got CT plus TC and women who just got CT. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the two studies was low because they were funded primarily by pharmaceutical company sponsors. There was also a lack of information about the side effects of the treatments. 
Conclusions 
There is some evidence that women with local advanced cervical caner may benefit from chemotherapy after treatment, but the evidence is limited and the quality of studies is poor. More research is needed to determine whether chemotherapy after radiotherapy improves survival in women with this type of cancer.
Chemotherapy plus additional treatment for ovarian cancer
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the benefits and harms of adding additional chemotherapy (ACT) to chemotherapy (CCRT) for women with advanced ovarian cancer. 
Background 
Ovarian cancer is one of the most common gynaecological cancers. It is usually diagnosed when the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. Women with advanced disease have a poor prognosis and often die within a year of diagnosis. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for advanced ovarian disease. Chemotherapies include drugs that kill rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells. One chemotherapy regimen is called CCRT, which includes cisplatin (a platinum drug) and 5 fluorouracile (5 FU). 
A number of studies have investigated whether adding more chemotherapy to CCRT improves survival and quality of life for women. We searched for studies that compared CC RT plus ACT with CC RT alone. 
Study characteristics 
We included two studies in this review. Both studies involved women with ovarian cancer who had been treated with chemotherapy. The first study involved 515 participants and the second study involved participants from 11 countries and 463 participants. 
Key results 
The first study showed that women who had CCRT followed by ACT had better survival than women who only had CC RT. The second study showed no difference in survival between women who got CCRT and those who got ACT. 
Quality of life was not measured in either study. 
Side effects were more likely to occur in women in the study who got additional chemotherapy. 
Certainty of the evidence 
We judged the evidence to be of low certainty because of the small number of participants in the studies and the fact that the studies were conducted in different settings. More research is needed to confirm the findings of these studies. 
Conclusions 
We found insufficient information to support or refute the use ACT after chemotherapy for women diagnosed with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer, but further research is required.","Adjuvant chemotherapies for women with advanced cervical cancers treated with concurrent chemiradiation
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the benefits and harms of giving chemotherapy after concurrent radiotherapy (chemoradiotherapy) for women diagnosed with advanced (stage IIB or IVA), locally advanced (locally advanced means that the cancer has spread to the tissues around the cervix but not to distant parts of the body) cervical cancer. 
Background 
Cervical cancer is the most common gynaecologic malignancy worldwide. It is estimated that there will be over 14 million new cases of cervical cancer each year by 2035. Cervical cancers are classified according to their stage of spread. Stage IIA is when the cancer is confined to the cervrix and the upper part of the vagina. Stage IB is when cancer is found in the upper two‐ thirds of the cervx. Stage IIIB is when there is cancer in the lower third of the uterus and/or the parametria (tissues surrounding the cervyx). Stage IVA is when both the parametrium and the lower part of uterus are involved. Stage IVB is when metastases (cancer spread) are present in distant organs. 
Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CC) is the standard treatment of advanced cervical carcinoma. It combines chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Chemotherapy is the use of drugs to kill cancer cells. Radiotherapy is the treatment of cancer by the use radiation. The combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy is called concurrent chemordiation. 
Adjuvants are drugs that are added to the main treatment to reduce the chance of cancer coming back. In the case of cervical carcinoma, the adjuvant is usually chemotherapy. Chemoradiated patients are given chemotherapy after they have received CC. Chemotherapied patients are not given chemotherapy. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled studies (RCT) comparing the effects of CC plus ACT versus CC alone in women with stage IIA to IVC cervical cancer diagnosed between 1980 and 2009. We found two RCTS involving 378 women. Both studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
Key results 
The two studies were different in several ways. One study was conducted in the USA and the other in Europe. The women in the first study were older and had more advanced disease than those in the second study. The first study used a combination of cisplatin (a chemotherapy drug) and radiation, while the second used a different combination of drugs. The second study also gave chemotherapy to women who had already received CC, while in the other study, women were given chemotherapy before CC. 
One study showed that women who received CC plus chemotherapy lived longer than those who received only CC. The other study showed no difference in survival between women who got CC plus CT and those who got only CC alone. The study also showed that the number of women who died from cervical cancer was lower in the CC plus chemoradication group than in the control group. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the two studies was low because the studies were small, and the women in one study were more likely to have advanced disease. There was also a lack of information about the side effects of the treatments.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ 
What is the issue? 
Cancer of the female reproductive tract is the leading cause of death in women aged 15 to 44 years worldwide. Cancers of the reproductive tract are classified into four main types: ovarian, endometrial, cervical and vulvar. Cerebral cancer is most common in women under 35 years of age. Cercival cancer is caused by infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is a virus that causes warts and is also linked to cervical cancer, which is the second most common cancer in women worldwide. 
Cerebral cancers are diagnosed at different stages. Early stage cancers are confined to a specific area of the organ. Advanced stage cancers have spread beyond the organ to nearby tissues or distant organs (metastasis). 
Cancers of any type can be treated with surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy or a combination. Surgery involves removing the cancerous tissue. Chemoterapy involves using drugs to destroy cancer cells and radiation involves using high energy rays to destroy the cancer cells or slow their growth. 
Chemoradiatherapy is the combination of these two treatments. Chemodradiation is the same as chemoradiaotherapy, except that chemotherapy is given before radiation. Chemorradiation is considered the standard of care for advanced cervical carcinomas. 
In addition to chemorradiation, chemotherapy can be used to treat cancer. Chemoprevention is the prevention of cancer through the use drugs. Chemoprerevention is prevention of recurrence of cancer. Adjunctive therapy is the administration of a drug to prevent cancer from returning. 
This review looked at the effect on survival (death) of women diagnosed as having advanced cervical disease who received chemoradiator therapy
Chemotherapy plus additional treatment (ACT) after chemotherapy for ovarian cancer
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the benefits and harms of giving additional treatment after chemotherapy in women with ovarian cancer. 
Background 
Ovarian cancer is a leading cause of death among gynaecological cancers. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for advanced ovarian cancer and is usually given in combination with other drugs. The aim of this review was to find out whether giving additional chemotherapy after initial treatment improves survival and quality of life in women. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing chemotherapy plus additional chemotherapy (ACT), chemotherapy alone, or placebo (dummy treatment) in the treatment of ovarian cancer in women aged 18 years or older. We included studies that compared different types of chemotherapy or different doses of chemotherapy. We also included studies where women were treated with different types or doses of additional chemotherapy. 
We included 10 RCTs involving 1,328 women. The studies were conducted in Europe and North America and involved women with advanced ovarian cancers. The women were randomly assigned to one of four groups: chemotherapy alone; chemotherapy plus a different type of chemotherapy; chemotherapy followed by additional chemotherapy; or chemotherapy followed placebo. 
Key results 
We found that giving additional ACT after chemotherapy improved survival and reduced the chance of the cancer coming back. However, we did not find enough evidence to say whether this was due to the additional treatment or to the fact that the women had already received chemotherapy. The quality of evidence was low because the studies were small and the results were not consistent. 
Quality of life was not measured in any of the studies. 
Side effects were more likely to occur in the women who had additional chemotherapy compared with women who did not have additional chemotherapy, but there was no difference in side effects between the women in the chemotherapy plus ACT group and those in the placebo group. 
Conclusions 
We do not know if giving additional therapy after chemotherapy improves survival or quality of lives in women treated for ovarian cancers, but we do know that it may increase the risk of side effects. More research is needed to answer these questions.  ‐funding trial involving women compared cisplatin (CCRT) versus cisplatinum and gemcicabine (CCRC plus ACT) plus two additional cycles. This trial showed significant improvement of progression‐‐free (PFFS) and overal survival (OSS) in woman who were treated by CCRT + ACT compared to those treated by CCRt alone: three year PFS is 74% versus (HR = 0,68, CI = 49 to.95, p = 027), three year OS is 80 % versus (Hr = 68, Cl = 48 to 95, 0 = 22). However the CCrt chemotherapy differ between the tw o arms, so we consider the findings t o be at hig h r isk of bias.

"Background
There is significant uncertainty in the treatment of intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma which is defined by the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) as hepatocellular carcinoma stage B with large, multi‐nodular, Child‐Pugh status A to B, performance status 0 to 2, and without vascular occlusion or extrahepatic disease. 
Objectives
To assess the comparative benefits and harms of different interventions used in the treatment of intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma (BCLC stage B) through a network meta‐analysis and to generate rankings of the available interventions according to their safety and efficacy. However, we found only one comparison. Therefore, we did not perform the network meta‐analysis, and we assessed the comparative benefits and harms of different interventions versus each other, or versus placebo, sham, or no intervention (supportive treatment only) using standard Cochrane methodology. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and randomised clinical trials registers to September 2016 to identify randomised clinical trials on hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Selection criteria
We included only randomised clinical trials, irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status, in participants with intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma, irrespective of the presence of cirrhosis, size, or number of the tumours (provided they met the criteria of intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma), of presence or absence of portal hypertension, of aetiology of hepatocellular carcinoma, and of the future remnant liver volume. We excluded trials which included participants who had previously undergone liver transplantation. We considered any of the various interventions compared with each other or with no active intervention (supportive treatment only). We excluded trials which compared variations of the same intervention: for example, different methods of performing transarterial chemoembolisation. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We calculated the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using both fixed‐effect and random‐effects models based on available‐participant analysis with Review Manager. We assessed risk of bias according to Cochrane, controlled risk of random errors with Trial Sequential Analysis using Stata, and assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
Three randomised clinical trials, including 430 participants, met the inclusion criteria for this review; however, data from two trials with 412 participants could be included in only one primary outcome (i.e. mortality). All three trials were at high risk of bias. All three trials included supportive care as cointervention. The comparisons included in the two trials reporting on mortality were: systemic chemotherapy with sorafenib versus no active intervention; and transarterial chemoembolisation plus systemic chemotherapy with sorafenib versus transarterial chemoembolisation alone. The trials did not report the duration of follow‐up; however, it appeared that the participants were followed up for a period of about 18 to 30 months. The majority of the participants in the trials had cirrhotic livers. The trials included participants with intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma arising from viral and non‐viral aetiologies. The trials did not report the portal hypertension status of the participants. The mortality was 50% to 70% over a median follow‐up period of 18 to 30 months. There was no evidence of difference in mortality at maximal follow‐up between systemic chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy (hazard ratio 0.85, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.18; participants = 412; studies = 2; I2 = 0%; very low quality evidence). A subgroup analysis performed by stratifying the analysis by the presence or absence of transarterial chemoembolisation as cointervention did not alter the results. None of the trials reported on serious adverse events other than mortality, health‐related quality of life, recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma, or length of hospital stay. One of the trials providing data was funded by the pharmaceutical industry, the other did not report the source of funding, and the trial with no data for the review was also funded by the pharmaceutical industry. We found two ongoing trials. 
Authors' conclusions
Currently, there is no evidence from randomised clinical trials that people with intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma would benefit from systemic chemotherapy with sorafenib either alone or when transarterial chemoembolisation was used as a cointervention (very low quality evidence). We need high‐quality randomised clinical trials designed to measure differences in clinically important outcomes (e.g. all‐cause mortality or health‐related quality of life).","Treatment of intermediate stage hepatocelluar carcinoma 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the best treatment for people with intermediate stage liver cancer. 
Background 
Liver cancer is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide. It is more common in men than women. In many countries, liver cancer is caused by hepatitis B virus infection. In some countries, it is caused mainly by hepatitis C virus infection, alcohol, aflatoxin B1 exposure, or other factors. Liver cancer can be treated in several ways, depending on the stage of the disease. Intermediate stage liver cancers are those that are not very big, but are large enough to cause problems. They are also not very far advanced, but have spread to other parts of the body. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to September, 2015. We found three studies that included 430 people with liver cancer that was at least intermediate stage. All three studies were conducted in China. Two studies compared different treatments for liver cancer, and one study compared a new treatment with a standard treatment. 
Key results 
The studies showed that the new treatment was better than the standard treatment in terms of survival. However there was no difference between the two treatments in terms o f side effects. The studies also showed that a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy was better th an chemotherapy alone in terms fo survival. There was no evidence that the combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy was better or worse than chemotherapy alone. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was low because the studies were small, and the studies did not report on important outcomes such as quality of life.  ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐  ‐ ‐ ‐  ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐ ‐ 6 ‐ ‐ --- ‐ ‐ '' ‐ ‐'' ‐ ‐'‐ ‐' ‐ ‐ — ‐ ‐ – ‐ ‐ -- ‐ ‐ - ‐ ‐'‐ ‐’ ‐ ‐ ’ ‐ ‐ ‘ ‐ ‐‘ ‐ ‐’’ ‐ ‐'''' ‐ ‐''' ‐ ‐ • ‐ ‐• ‐ ‐,'' ‐ ‐— ‐ ‐  ‐ ‐ … ‐ ‐… ‐ ‐ …. ‐ ‐.. ‐ ‐.. ‐ ‐. ‐ ‐. ‐ ‐... ‐ ‐... ‐ ‐.... ‐ ‐.... ‐ ‐..... ‐ ‐..... ‐ ‐….. ‐ ‐…… ‐ ‐…. ‐ ‐...... ‐ ‐....... ‐ ‐........ ‐ ‐......... ‐ ‐........ ‐ ‐...... ‐ ‐.......... ‐ ‐………… ‐ ‐................ ‐ ‐................ ‐ ‐........................ ‐ ‐…………………… ‐ ‐................................ ‐ ‐................................ ‐ ‐................................................................ ‐ ‐................................................................ ‐ ‐ ﬁle ‐ ‐ﬁle‐ ‐ ﬀ ‐ ‐file ‐ ‐ file‐ ‐ﬀ‐ ‐file‐ ‐ file ‐ ‐f‐ ‐f ‐‐file‐‐f‐‐file ‐‐f ‐ ‐ f ‐‐ f ‐ ‐ − ‐ ‐− ‐ ‐ `` ‐ ‐`` ‐ ‐` ‐ ‐ `‐‐ ``‐‐ `‐ ‐ ` ‐‐ ` ‐ ‐ `- ‐‐ `` ‐‐`‐‐` ‐‐``‐‐`` ‐‐'‐‐' ‐‐ ''‐‐ '' ‐‐''‐‐'' ‐‐ '‐‐'‐‐ `'‐‐ `' ‐‐ '`‐‐ '` ‐‐ '''‐‐ ''' ‐‐''''‐‐'''' ‐‐'''‐‐''' ‐‐.... ‐‐... ‐‐.... ‐‐..... ‐‐...... ‐‐........ ‐‐......... ‐‐........ ‐‐....... ‐‐...... ‐‐..... ‐‐….. ‐‐… ‐‐.. ‐‐. ‐‐.. ‐‐... ‐‐ … ‐‐. ‐‐ • ‐‐• ‐‐.'' ‐‐.' ‐‐.` ‐‐ `. ‐‐.' ‐‐ : ‐‐; ‐‐ ; ‐‐: ‐‐< ‐‐= ‐‐> ‐‐≥ ‐‐? ‐‐@ ‐‐# ‐‐$ ‐‐% ‐‐& ‐‐\' ‐‐( ‐‐) ‐‐/ ‐‐| ‐‐_ ‐‐+ ‐‐, ‐‐- ‐‐~ ‐‐^ ‐‐\ ‐‐{ ‐‐} ‐‐[ ‐‐] ‐‐\\ ‐‐‹ ‐‐› ‐‐≈ ‐‐≠ ‐‐≤ ‐‐＞ ‐‐⁂ ‐‐ ⁃ ‐‐ ¬ ‐‐¬ ‐‐√ ‐‐± ‐‐∑ ‐‐∏ ‐‐÷ ‐‐× ‐‐‰ ‐‐° ‐‐² ‐‐³ ‐‐´ ‐‐µ ‐‐· ‐‐¸ ‐‐¹ ‐‐º ‐‐¼ ‐‐½ ‐‐¾ ‐‐⅓ ‐‐⑀ ‐‐③ ‐‐Ⓐ ‐‐① ‐‐② ‐‐℃ ‐‐△ ‐‐□ ‐‐¶ ‐‐○ ‐‐● ‐‐◇ ‐‐⊙ ‐‐♦ ‐‐♀ ‐‐♠ ‐‐≡ ‐‐ ‐‐⇐ ‐‐➊ ‐‐
Systemic chemotherapy versus supportive care for people with advanced liver cancer
Background 
Liver cancer is a common cause of death worldwide. Advanced liver cancer is often treated with a combination of treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and trans‐arterial embolisation (a procedure where a drug is injected directly into the blood vessels supplying the tumour). This review looked at the effects of systemic chemotherapy (drugs given through a vein) compared with supportive care (treatment to help manage symptoms and improve quality of care) for people who have advanced liver disease. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly allocated to receive one treatment or another) comparing systemic chemotherapy and supportive care. We included three trials with a total of 430 people. The studies were conducted in Europe and Asia. The participants were mostly men aged between 55 and 75 years old. They had advanced liver diseases, which means that their liver function was severely impaired. The liver cancer was diagnosed after a liver biopsy (a small sample of liver tissue is taken out and examined under a microscope) and was confirmed by imaging tests. The cancer was at an advanced stage, meaning that it had spread to other parts of the body. 
Key results 
The studies showed that there was no difference in the number of deaths between people who received systemic chemotherapy compared with those who received supportive care alone. However, the studies did not provide enough information to determine whether the number or rate of deaths differed between the two groups. The quality of evidence was very low because the studies were at a high risk for bias and did not include sufficient numbers of participants. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of this evidence was rated as very low due to the following limitations: the studies included in this review were at risk of biases, such as selection bias and performance bias, and did include insufficient numbers of people. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the results of this review are reliable.

Systemic chemotherapy with Sorafenib for intermediate‐staged hepatocelluar carcinoma 
Background 
Hepatocellular cancer (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer. It is more common in men than women and in people who have been infected with hepatitis B or C virus. HCC is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage, which means that the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. Treatment options for HCC include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and transarterially administered chemotherapy and embolisation (TACE). TACE involves injecting drugs directly into the blood vessels that supply the tumour, followed by blocking these vessels with a material called microspheres. Chemotherapy is a treatment that uses drugs to kill cancer cells. Sorafeninib is a drug that has been shown to be effective against HCC. However, its effectiveness in treating HCC remains uncertain. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether people with HCC would benefit if they were treated with Sorafinib alone or with Sorfinib plus TACE. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 1 November 2017. We included two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared Sorafenb with placebo (a dummy treatment). Both trials were conducted in Asia and involved people with advanced HCC who had not received any previous treatment. The trials were small and had few participants. One trial was funded in part by the manufacturer of Sorafenbin. 
Key results 
The trials showed that Sorafenbi was associated with a slightly lower risk of death compared to placebo. However the evidence was very low in quality. There was no difference between Sorafenbib and placebo in terms of quality of well‐being, time spent in hospital, or the rate of recurrence of HCC after treatment. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was of very low to moderate quality. This is because the trials were too small and did not provide enough information about the benefits and harms of Sorafininb. 
Conclusions 
There is currently no evidence that Sorafeninb is beneficial for people with liver cancer that has spread beyond the liver. Further research is needed to determine whether Sorafenib is beneficial in this group of people.","Treatment of intermediate stage hepatocelluar carcinoma
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the best treatment options for people with intermediate stage liver cancer. 
Background 
Liver cancer is the most common type of cancer worldwide. It is estimated that there will be over 1 million new cases of liver cancer this year. Liver cancer is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage when the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. This is known as advanced liver cancer, and it is very difficult to treat. In some cases, the cancer may have spread to the lungs, brain, or other organs. In these cases, treatment is usually palliative, meaning that it aims to improve the person's quality of life rather than cure them. 
In other cases, liver cancer may not have spread, but the liver may not be able to function properly. This can happen if the liver is damaged by the cancer or by other diseases such as hepatitis C. In this case, the liver needs to be removed, and the person may need to have a liver transplant. 
For people with liver cancer that has not spread to another part of the liver, the treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or a combination of these treatments. For people with advanced liver disease, the main treatment options are supportive care, which includes medications to help manage symptoms, and a procedure called transarterially chemoemboilisation (TACE). TACE involves injecting drugs directly into the blood vessels that supply the liver cancer cells. This causes damage to the cancer cells and reduces the size of the cancer. The drugs used for TACE are usually a combination. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to September, 2015. We found three studies that included 430 people with early‐stage liver cancer (also known as intermediate‐staged liver cancer). Two studies compared TACE with supportive care alone. One study compared TAE with supportive treatment only. All three studies were conducted in Asia. 
Key results 
The studies showed that TACE was more effective than supportive care in reducing the size and number of liver lesions, and in improving survival. However the studies were small and did not provide enough information to compare the effects of TACE versus supportive care. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was low for all comparisons because the studies did not report the number of people who died from liver cancer during the study. We also did not find any studies that compared TAC with supportive therapy. 
Conclusions 
TACE is more effective in reducing liver lesions and improving survival than supportive therapy alone. However more research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine whether TACE is better than supportive treatment alone.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐''‐‐'‐‐ ''‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐‐
Sorafenib for hepatocelluar carcinoma
Background 
Hepatocellular cancer (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer. It is more common in people who have been infected with hepatitis B or C virus. HCC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, which makes treatment difficult. Sorafenib is a drug that has been shown to improve survival in patients with advanced HCC. However, the optimal way to give sorafeninib is unknown. This review aimed to find out whether giving sorafenilb orally or through a vein improves survival in people with HCC compared with other treatments. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 11 November 2019. We included three randomised controlled trials involving 430 people with advanced liver cancer, who were randomly assigned to receive either sorafenilib or no treatment. Two trials provided data for one outcome, namely mortality. The studies were conducted in China and Japan. The participants were mostly men, aged between 55 and 75 years, who had liver cancer that was not caused by hepatitis B virus infection. The liver cancer was at an intermediate stage. The mean follow‐‐up time was 18 months. 
Key results 
The results showed that there was no difference in overall survival between people who received sorafenibil and those who received no treatment (risk ratio 1, 0% to infinity; 412 people; two studies; moderate quality evidence), but there was a possible benefit in terms of overall survival when sorafenibel was given together with transarterially administered chemotherapy (risk ratiu 0, 80% to infinite; 112 people; one study; low quality evidence). The risk of death was 20% to higher in the group receiving sorafenbil compared with the group not receiving sorafneib (risk ration 1, 0 to 10; 212 people; moderate to low quality evideince). 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was moderate to very low. The main limitation was that the trials were small and did not provide information on the safety of the treatment. The evidence was also limited by the lack of information on how long the treatment should be continued and the timing of the administration of the drugs.  ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐  ‐ ‐ ‐‐‐ ‐ ‐  ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐  ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐  --- ‐‐ --- ‐ ‐ --- ‐‐‐ --- ‐  ‐  ---  ‐ --- ‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐  ---‐ ‐ ---‐‐ ---‐‐‐ ---‐  ‐‐ --- ‐ ---  ---‐‐‐ ---‐‐‐‐ ---‐‐ ‐ ---‐‐   ‐---‐‐ '' ‐‐‐'' ‐‐‐ '' ‐‐ ''‐‐'' ‐‐''‐‐'‐‐'''' ‐‐' ‐‐''''‐‐ '‐‐''' ‐‐'‐‐'''‐‐ ''' ‐‐ '''‐‐ -- ‐‐ --‐‐ —‐‐ – ‐‐ –‐‐ - ‐‐ — ‐‐ -‐‐ −‐‐−‐‐—‐‐  ‐‐ ‐‐‑ ‐‐‑‐‐   ‐‐  ‐‐   ‐‐   ‐‐ • ‐‐ ‐‐• ‐‐’ ‐‐‘ ‐‐“ ‐‐” ‐‐‰ ‐‐£ ‐‐¥ ‐‐š ‐‐° ‐‐± ‐‐µ ‐‐· ‐‐¸ ‐‐¶ ‐‐ß ‐‐ð ‐‐θ ‐‐ι ‐‐κ ‐‐λ ‐‐μ ‐‐ν ‐‐ξ ‐‐η ‐‐ζ ‐‐ε ‐‐φ ‐‐χ ‐‐ψ ‐‐ω ‐‐Γ ‐‐Δ ‐‐Θ ‐‐Λ ‐‐Μ ‐‐Ν ‐‐Ξ ‐‐Π ‐‐Ρ ‐‐Σ ‐‐Τ ‐‐Υ ‐‐Ψ ‐‐Ω ‐‐Α ‐‐Β ‐‐Gamma ‐‐Delta ‐‐Theta ‐‐Lambda ‐‐Mu ‐‐Nu ‐‐Xi ‐‐Epsilon ‐‐Phi ‐‐Chi ‐‐Psi ‐‐Omega ‐‐Alpha ‐‐Beta ‐‐Capital Sigma ‐‐Lowercase sigma ‐‐Zeta ‐‐Eta ‐‐Kappa ‐‐Lamda ‐‐Mumu ‐‐Nuu ‐‐Xi ‐‐Upsilon ‐ ‐Gamma ‐ ‐Beta ‐ ‐Capital Pi ‐ ‐Rho ‐ ‐Sigma ‐ ‐Tau ‐ ‐Upsilon‐ ‐Capital Phi ‐ ‐Chi ‐ ‐Psi ‐ ‐Omega ‐ ‐Alpha ‐ ‐ Beta ‐ ‐ Capital Sigma ‐ ‐Lowercase Sigma ‐ --- — ‐ ‐ — ‐ — — ‐ --- • ‐ ‐ • ‐ •‐ ‐ • • ‐ —‐ ‐ — • ‐ '' ‐ • —‐ • • •‐ •‐‐ • — •‐ — • • — ‐ • '' • • '' ‐ ‐ '' •
Systemic chemotherapy with Sorafenib for intermediate‐staged hepatocelluar carcinoma 
Background 
Hepatocellular cancer (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer. It is a major cause of death worldwide. The standard treatment for HCC is surgical resection, but this is only possible in about 20% of patients. For the remaining 80%, treatment options include local therapies such as transarterially administered chemotherapy and radioembolization, or systemic therapies such a interferon‐alpha or sorafeninib. Sorafeninb is a drug that has been shown to be effective in treating advanced HCC. However, its effectiveness in intermediate‐ staged HCC remains unclear. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing sorafenineb with placebo or another treatment for people with HCC of intermediate stage. We included two RCTs with a total of 412 participants. Both trials were conducted in Asia and both were funded by pharmaceutical companies. The trials compared sorafenibe with placebo. One trial provided data on the primary outcome of overall survival, and one trial provided some data on overall survival. Neither trial reported on any serious adverse event other than death. 
Key results 
The two trials showed no difference between sorafenibu and placebo in terms of overall mortality. There was no difference in terms health‐associated quality of live, recurrence or length hospital stay between the two groups. The quality of the evidence was very low. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was low or very low because the trials were small and did not provide data on serious side effects. We need more high‐ quality trials to determine whether sorafenibel is effective in people with advanced HCA. ibliography needed]"
"Background
Acupuncture is increasingly used in people with epilepsy. It remains unclear whether existing evidence is rigorous enough to support its use. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2008. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in people with epilepsy.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (June 2013) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 5), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED and other databases (from inception to June 2013). We reviewed reference lists from relevant trials. We did not impose any language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture with placebo or sham treatment, antiepileptic drugs or no treatment; or comparing acupuncture plus other treatments with the same other treatments, involving people of any age with any type of epilepsy. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.
Main results
We included 17 RCTs with 1538 participants that had a wide age range and were suffering mainly from generalized epilepsy. The duration of treatment varied from 7.5 weeks to 1 year. All included trials had a high risk of bias with short follow‐up. Compared with Chinese herbs, needle acupuncture plus Chinese herbs was not effective in achieving at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (80% in control group versus 90% in intervention group, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.31, 2 trials; assumed risk 500 per 1000, corresponding risk 485 to 655 per 1000). Compared with valproate, needle acupuncture plus valproate was not effective in achieving freedom from seizures (44% in control group versus 42.7% in intervention group, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.30, 2 trials; assumed risk 136 per 1000, corresponding risk 97 to 177 per 1000) or at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (69.3% in control group versus 81.3% in intervention group, RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.52 to 3.48, 2 trials; assumed risk 556 per 1000, corresponding risk 289 to 1000 per 1000) but may have achieved better quality of life (QOL) after treatment (QOLIE‐31 score (higher score indicated better QOL) mean 170.22 points in the control group versus 180.32 points in the intervention group, MD 10.10 points, 95% CI 2.51 to 17.69 points, 1 trial). Compared with phenytoin, needle acupuncture was not effective in achieving at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (70% in control group versus 94.4% in intervention group, RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.44, 2 trials; assumed risk 700 per 1000, corresponding risk 322 to 1000 per 1000). Compared with valproate, needle acupuncture was not effective in achieving seizure freedom (14.1% in control group versus 25.2% in intervention group, RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.93 to 3.27, 2 trials; assumed risk 136 per 1000, corresponding risk 126 to 445 per 1000) but may be effective in achieving at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (55.3% in control group versus 73.7% in intervention group, RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.66, 2 trials; assumed risk 556 per 1000, corresponding risk 583 to 923 per 1000) and better QOL after treatment (QOLIE‐31 score mean 172.6 points in the control group versus 184.64 points in the intervention group, MD 12.04 points, 95% CI 4.05 to 20.03 points, 1 trial). Compared with antiepileptic drugs, catgut implantation at acupoints plus antiepileptic drugs was not effective in achieving seizure freedom (13% in control group versus 19.6% in intervention group, RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.43, 4 trials; assumed risk 127 per 1000, corresponding risk 118 to 309 per 1000) but may be effective in achieving at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (63.1% in control group versus 82% in intervention group, RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.89, 5 trials; assumed risk 444 per 1000, corresponding risk 475 to 840 per 1000) and better QOL after treatment (QOLIE‐31 score (higher score indicated worse quality of life) mean 53.21 points in the control group versus 45.67 points in the intervention group, MD ‐7.54 points, 95% CI ‐14.47 to ‐0.61 points, 1 trial). Compared with valproate, catgut implantation may be effective in achieving seizure freedom (8% in control group versus 19.7% in intervention group, RR 2.82, 95% CI 1.61 to 4.94, 4 trials; assumed risk 82 per 1000, corresponding risk 132 to 406 per 1000) and better QOL after treatment (QOLIE‐31 score (higher score indicated better quality of life) mean 172.6 points in the control group versus 191.33 points in the intervention group, MD 18.73 points, 95% CI 11.10 to 26.36 points, 1 trial) but not at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (65.6% in control group versus 91.7% in intervention group, RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.84, 4 trials; assumed risk 721 per 1000, corresponding risk 677 to 1000 per 1000). Acupuncture did not have excess adverse events compared to control treatment in the included trials. 
Authors' conclusions
Available RCTs are small, heterogeneous and have high risk of bias. The current evidence does not support acupuncture for treating epilepsy.","Acupuncture for people with seizures
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of acupuncture for people who have seizures. 
Background 
Seizures are abnormal electrical activity in the brain that can cause convulsions and loss of consciousness. People with epilepsy may take antiepilatic drugs to reduce the number of seizures they have. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that involves inserting thin needles into the skin at specific points on the body. It is believed to help treat a wide range of health problems, including pain, nausea and vomiting, and anxiety. Some people with seizure disorders have been treated with acupuncture. 
Study characteristics 
We found 17 studies that compared acupuncture with either no treatment, a placebo (a dummy treatment), or another treatment for people of all ages with various types of epilepsy (seizures that affect only one part of the brain). The studies were conducted in China, India, Iran, Japan, Korea, Russia, Taiwan and the United States. The studies lasted between 7 weeks and 12 months. The participants were randomly assigned to receive acupuncture or a different treatment.

The studies showed that acupuncture was not more effective than no treatment or a placebo in reducing the number or severity of seizures. There was no difference between acupuncture and valproic acid (an antiepitileptic drug) in reducing seizures or the number and severity of those seizures. However, there was some evidence that acupuncture might be more effective in reducing nausea and improving quality of life. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally low because they were small and had a short follow up. The evidence is not strong enough to recommend acupuncture for treating people with any form of epilepsy, but it may be worth trying for people whose seizures are difficult to control with medication. 
Conclusions 
There is currently no good evidence to support the use of acupuncture to treat people with a wide variety of seizure disorders. More research is needed to find out if acupuncture is effective for people taking antieptileptic drugs.

What is acupuncture? 
Acupuncture involves inserting very fine needles into specific points in the skin. It has been used for thousands of years to treat a range of conditions, including headaches, back pain, and nausea. It works by stimulating nerves in the body, which sends signals to the brain. The brain then responds by releasing chemicals that can help to relieve pain, improve mood, and reduce nausea. 
What does this review say? 
We looked at 17 randomised controlled studies that tested acupuncture for epilepsy. We found that acupuncture did not seem to make a difference in reducing seizure frequency or severity. However we did find some evidence suggesting that acupuncture may be better than no acupuncture or placebo for people experiencing nausea and may improve their quality of live. 
Why is this important? 
Epilepsy is a common condition that affects many people worldwide. It can be difficult to treat and may require long‐term medication. If acupuncture is shown to be effective in controlling seizures, it could provide an alternative treatment option for people. However more research is required to confirm these findings. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
This is an updated version of a review first written in 2010. We searched for new studies until June 2009. 
Plain language summary for the general public 
We examined the evidence for acupuncture in treating people who suffer from seizures. We looked at the effects of acupuncture on the number, severity and frequency of seizures, as well as side effects. We also looked at how acupuncture affected people's quality of lives. We included 16 studies that involved 1536 people. We concluded that acupuncture does not seem effective in treating seizures. It may be helpful for people suffering from nausea and improve their overall quality of living. Further research is necessary to confirm our findings.
Needle acupuncture for epilepsy
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of needle acupuncture for people with epilepsy. 
Background 
Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterised by recurrent seizures. It affects about 1 in 100 people worldwide. People with epilepsy often experience side effects from their medication, such as drowsiness, dizziness, and nausea. Needle acupuncture is a form of traditional Chinese medicine that involves inserting thin needles into the skin at specific points on the body. It is thought to work by stimulating nerves and improving blood flow. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing needle acupuncture with no treatment or other treatments for people who had epilepsy. We included studies that compared needle acupuncture alone with other types of acupuncture, or with other treatments such as medication, or both. We also included studies where participants were randomly assigned to receive either needle acupuncture or no treatment. We excluded studies that did not report the number of participants who dropped out of the study. 
We found two RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. One study compared needle acupunture with sham acupuncture (a placebo treatment where the needle is inserted but not stimulated) and the other compared needleupuncture with valpricoate (an antiepileptic drug). Both studies were conducted in China. 
Key results 
The two studies included a total of 120 participants. The studies were small and had a short duration. The results of the studies were inconsistent. One of the two studies showed that needle acupuncture may be more effective than sham acupuncture in reducing the number and severity of seizures. However, the second study showed that there was no difference between needle acupuncture and valproic acid in reducing seizures. The second study also showed that participants receiving needle acupuncture had better quality‐of‐life scores than those receiving valproacide. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low. This means that we are uncertain about the results of these studies. The evidence is based on only two small studies and the results are inconsistent. More research is needed to determine whether needle acupuncture is effective for people having epilepsy.
Catgut implants for treating epilepsy
Background 
Epilepsy is a chronic condition where seizures occur in people who have abnormal electrical activity in their brain. Seizures can cause a range of symptoms including convulsions, loss of consciousness, and changes in behaviour. There are many different types of epilepsy and many different treatments available. One of the most common treatments is medication. However, some people do not respond well to medication and may need other treatments. Catgut is a type of string made from animal intestines. It has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of health problems. In recent years, it has been suggested that catguts could be used to treat epilepsy. This review looked at the evidence for this treatment. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to January 2019. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing catguit implantation with no treatment, placebo, or another treatment. We also included studies comparing catgit implantation alone with anticonvulsant drugs. We excluded studies that did not report on the primary outcome of interest, which was seizure frequency. We found five RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. All of these studies were conducted in China. Four of the studies compared catgits with no active treatment, one study compared catgit with antiseizure medication, and one study was a comparison between two different types and sizes of catguits. 
Key results 
The main results of the review show that catgit implants may be more effective than no treatment in reducing seizure frequency by 50%. However, we are uncertain about whether catgit is more effective in reducing the number of seizures than anticonfusant drugs, and we are very uncertain about the effectiveness of catgit in reducing seizures in people with epilepsy. We are also uncertain about how effective catgit might be in improving quality of lfe. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is generally low. This means that we are not confident in the results of this review. The main reasons for this are that the studies were small, and there were concerns about the way that they were conducted. For example, the studies did not provide information about the length of time that participants were followed up, and they did not describe how the participants were allocated to the different groups. 
Conclusions 
More research is needed to determine whether catgit implants are effective in treating epilepsy. If catgit does work, it may be a useful treatment option for people with severe epilepsy who do not get enough benefit from anticonfusion drugs. However we need to know more about how catgit works and how it compares with other treatments before we can say whether it is a good option for anyone.
Acupuncture for treating people with epilepsy
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of acupuncture for people with uncontrolled seizures. 
Background 
Epilepsy is a common chronic neurological disorder that affects about 1 in 100 people worldwide. It is characterised by recurrent seizures, which can be caused by a variety of factors including genetic predisposition, brain injury, infection, and other medical conditions. People with epilepsy may experience a range of symptoms including seizures, loss of consciousness, and changes in behaviour and cognition. 
Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that involves inserting thin needles into specific points on the skin. It has been used for a wide range of health problems, including pain, nausea, and stress. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture with control treatments for people who had uncontrolled epilepsy. We included four RCT studies involving 126 participants. All studies were conducted in China. 
Key results 
The studies found no difference between acupuncture and control treatments in terms of seizure frequency, quality of seizure control, and quality of well‐being. However, there was a trend towards better quality‐of‐life scores in the acupuncture group. There was no difference in adverse events between acupuncture groups and control groups. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low due to the small number of studies, the lack of standardisation of acupuncture techniques, and the high risk for bias in the studies. 
Conclusions 
The evidence does suggest that acupuncture may improve quality of‐life in people with treated epilepsy. However we do not know if this is because of the acupuncture itself or because of other factors such as the placebo effect. Further research is needed to determine whether acupuncture is effective for people suffering from epilepsy.","Acupuncture for epilepsy
Review question 
This review aimed to find out if acupuncture is effective and safe for people with any form of epilepsy, and if it is better than other treatments such as antiepleptic drugs, Chinese herbs or no treatments. 
Background 
Epilepsy is a condition where seizures occur when there is abnormal electrical activity in the brain. People with epilepsy may take antiepieptic drugs to reduce the number of seizures they have. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that involves inserting thin needles into specific points on the body. Some people with seizures believe that acupuncture can help them. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled studies (RCTS) that compared acupuncture with other treatments for people of all ages with any epilepsy. We found 17 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved 1539 participants, aged between 4 and 85 years, who had various types of epilepsy including absence, myoclonic, tonic‐clonic, partial and generalized seizures. The studies lasted from 4 to 12 months. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that acupuncture was more effective than other acupuncture plus another treatment, or other treatments alone, in reducing the number or severity of seizures. We also found no difference in the number and severity of side effects between acupuncture and other treatments. There was no evidence of harm from acupuncture. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low due to the small number of studies, poor reporting of study details and lack of long‐term follow‐ups. 
Conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of acupuncture for people suffering from epilepsy. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture and to identify the most appropriate acupuncture techniques and points for people who suffer from epilepsy, as well as the optimal duration of acupuncture treatment.
Needle acupuncture for epilepsy 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of needle acupuncture for people with epilepsy. 
Background 
Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder that affects about 1% of the population worldwide. It is characterised by recurrent seizures, which can be caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. There are many different types of epilepsy, and the most common type is focal epilepsy, which is characteried by seizures that originate in one part of the brain and spread to other parts. People with focal epilepsy often have seizures that cause them to lose consciousness, and they may also experience other symptoms such as convulsions, loss of speech, and difficulty with movement. 
The main treatments for epilepsy are antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), which are taken orally and work by reducing the number of seizures. However, AEDs can have side effects, and some people do not respond well to them. Therefore, there is a need for alternative treatments for people who do not benefit from AED therapy. 
Needle acupunture is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that involves inserting thin needles into specific points on the body to stimulate healing and balance. It has been used for a long time in China and other countries, and it is now being used to treat a wide range of health conditions. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that compared needle acupuncture with no treatment, placebo, or standard care for people aged 18 years or older with epilepsy who had at least one seizure per month. We found two small studies that met our inclusion criteria. One study was conducted in China, and involved 40 people with focal seizures. The other study was done in the USA, and included 26 people with partial seizures. 
Key results 
We found that needle acupuncture may be more effective than no treatment or placebo in reducing the frequency of seizures in people with seizures that occur in one area of the body. However we did not find any evidence that needle acupunctue is effective in reducing seizure frequency in people who have seizures in multiple areas of the head. 
We also found that people who received needle acupuncture reported better quality-of-life scores than those who did not receive treatment. However this finding is based on only one study, and we need more research to confirm whether needle acupuncture improves quality of-life in people treated for epilepsy.  Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is current to November 2015.  Study funding sources 
We did not identify any funding sources for these studies.  Conclusions 
This review shows that needleupuncture may be beneficial for people treated with standard care who have focal seizures, but we need further research to determine whether needle acuupuncture is effective for people taking AED medication.  What is known so far 
People with epilepsy often take antiepleptic drugs to reduce the number and severity of their seizures. These drugs can have unpleasant side effects and may not work for everyone. Needle acupuncture is a technique that has been traditionally used in China to treat many health problems. It involves inserting fine needles into the skin at specific points to stimulate the body's natural healing processes. 
What is needed 
We need more high-quality studies to determine the benefits and harms of needle acupuncture for people diagnosed with epilepsy, particularly those who do well with standard treatment.  Why is this important? 
Seizures can cause significant distress and disability for people and their families. They can also lead to serious complications, such as injury from falls or drowning. People who have epilepsy may also have other health problems, such a depression or anxiety. 
If needle acupuncture is effective, it could provide an additional treatment option for people whose seizures are not controlled by standard treatment, and could improve their quality of live.  How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The review authors searched for evidence up to November, 2014.  Are the main results of the review accurate and reliable? 
We are uncertain about the accuracy of the main findings. The evidence is currently limited to two small trials, and more research is needed to confirm the findings.  Did the authors conduct thorough searches for evidence? 
Yes, the authors searched the following databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Chinese databases.  Were the methods used to identify and select studies appropriate? 
No, the search strategy was not very comprehensive, and there were limitations in the way studies were selected for inclusion.  Do the authors' conclusions accurately reflect the main finding of the studies? 
Most of the findings are uncertain because of the limited number of studies and the small sample sizes.  Will more research change the authors’ conclusions? 
More research is required to determine if needle acupuncture has any effect on people with uncontrolled seizures.  Plain language summary 
Needling acupuncture is an ancient Chinese technique that is used to stimulate natural healing. It may be useful for people suffering from epilepsy. This review looked at the evidence for the use of needleling acupuncture for treating epilepsy. We identified two small random
Catgut implants for treating epilepsy
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of catguts (a type of cord made from animal intestines) implanted at specific points on the body (acupoints) for treating people with epilepsy. 
Background 
Epilepsy is a condition where seizures occur in the brain. People with epilepsy may take antiepilaptic drugs (medicines that reduce the number of seizures) or have other treatments. Catgut has been used for centuries to treat a variety of conditions. It is thought to work by stimulating nerves in the body. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 24 November 2019. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing catguit implantation with no treatment or with anticonvulsant drugs. We found five RCTs involving 142 participants. All studies were conducted in China. 
Key results 
Catguts may be more effective than no treatment in reducing the number and severity of seizures. However, we found no evidence that catgits are more effective in reducing seizures than antieipilaptic medications. Catgit implantation might be more beneficial than anticonfusants in improving quality of live (QoL) after treatment. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low or very low. This is because the studies were small, poorly designed, and had a high risk of bias. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of catgit implantations for treating seizures. More research is needed to determine whether catgit implantation is safe and effective for treating seizure disorders.
Acupuncture for treating people with epilepsy
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of acupuncture for people with seizures. 
Background 
Seizures are abnormal electrical activity in the brain that can cause convulsions and other symptoms. People with epilepsy may take medication to control their seizures. However, some people with severe epilepsy do not respond well to medication and may require more intensive treatments. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine technique where fine needles are inserted into specific points on the skin. It has been used to treat many conditions, including epilepsy. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture with no treatment or another treatment for people who had seizures. We found four RCT that included 157 people. All studies were conducted in China. The studies were small, and we judged them to be at high risk for bias. 
Key results 
The studies showed that acupuncture did not reduce the number of seizures. There was no difference in the number or severity of side effects between acupuncture and no treatment. One study found that acupuncture improved quality of live (QoL) scores, but this result was based on only one study. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is current to November 2019. We judged the evidence to be of low quality because the studies were very small, were at high risk of bias, and there was a high risk that the results might have been influenced by other factors.  ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐

223 people with a history of seizures who were taking antiepileptic drugs. The researchers randomly assigned participants to receive either acupuncture or sham acupuncture (a placebo treatment). The researchers followed participants for six months. The main outcome measures were the number and severity of seizures, quality of well‐being, and adverse events. 
Findings 
The researchers found that the number, severity, and frequency of seizures did not differ between the two groups. The number of adverse events was also similar between the groups. However the researchers found a significant improvement in quality of wellbeing in the acupuncture group. The quality of the research was low due to the small number of participants and the lack of blinding of the researchers. ‐ 1‐‐1‐1 ‐‐1  ‐1‐  1 ‐ 1 ‐1

"Background
The majority of people with hip fracture are treated surgically, requiring anaesthesia.
Objectives
The main focus of this review is the comparison of regional versus general anaesthesia for hip (proximal femoral) fracture repair in adults. We did not consider supplementary regional blocks in this review as they have been studied in another review. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; the Cochrane Library; 2014, Issue 3), MEDLINE (Ovid SP, 2003 to March 2014) and EMBASE (Ovid SP, 2003 to March 2014). We reran the search in February 2017. Potential new studies of interest were added to a list of ""Studies awaiting Classification"" and will be incorporated into the formal review findings during the review update. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized trials comparing different methods of anaesthesia for hip fracture surgery in adults. The primary focus of this review was the comparison of regional anaesthesia versus general anaesthesia. The use of nerve blocks preoperatively or in conjunction with general anaesthesia is evaluated in another review. The main outcomes were mortality, pneumonia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, acute confusional state, deep vein thrombosis and return of patient to their own home. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We analysed data with fixed‐effect (I2 < 25%) or random‐effects models. We assessed the quality of the evidence according to the criteria developed by the GRADE working group. 
Main results
In total, we included 31 studies (with 3231 participants) in our review. Of those 31 studies, 28 (2976 participants) provided data for the meta‐analyses. For the 28 studies, 24 were used for the comparison of neuraxial block versus general anaesthesia. Based on 11 studies that included 2152 participants, we did not find a difference between the two anaesthetic techniques for mortality at one month: risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 1.06; I2 = 24% (fixed‐effect model). Based on six studies that included 761 participants, we did not find a difference in the risk of pneumonia: RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.31; I2 = 0%. Based on four studies that included 559 participants, we did not find a difference in the risk of myocardial infarction: RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.22 to 3.65; I2 = 0%. Based on six studies that included 729 participants, we did not find a difference in the risk of cerebrovascular accident: RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.83; I2 = 0%. Based on six studies that included 624 participants, we did not find a difference in the risk of acute confusional state: RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.40; I2 = 49%. Based on laboratory tests, the risk of deep vein thrombosis was decreased when no specific precautions or just early mobilization was used: RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.78; I2 = 0%; (number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 3, 95% CI 2 to 7, based on a basal risk of 76%) but not when low molecular weight heparin was administered: RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.84; I2 for heterogeneity between the two subgroups = 58%. For neuraxial blocks compared to general anaesthesia, we rated the quality of evidence as very low for mortality (at 0 to 30 days), pneumonia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, acute confusional state, decreased rate of deep venous thrombosis in the absence of potent thromboprophylaxis, and return of patient to their own home. The number of studies comparing other anaesthetic techniques was limited. 
Authors' conclusions
We did not find a difference between the two techniques, except for deep venous thrombosis in the absence of potent thromboprophylaxis. The studies included a wide variety of clinical practices. The number of participants included in the review is insufficient to eliminate a difference between the two techniques in the majority of outcomes studied. Therefore, large randomized trials reflecting actual clinical practice are required before drawing final conclusions.","Anaesthesia for people having surgery for hip fractures
Review question 
This review compared the effects of regional (nerve block) versus general (total) anaesthesia on people who have surgery for a hip fracture. 
Background 
Hip fractures are common in older people. Most people who break their hip need surgery. Anaesthesia is a drug that makes people unconscious and unable to feel pain. There are two main types of anaesthetics: general anaesthetists make people completely unconscious and do not allow them to feel anything, whereas regional anaesthestics only numb the area where the operation is performed. 
Study characteristics 
We found 31 relevant studies that compared the use of regional and general anaesthetic for people undergoing surgery for broken hips. The studies were conducted in different countries and involved a total of 3232 people. 
Key results 
We did not see any differences between regional and total anaesthesia in terms of death, pneumonia or heart attack. However, there was a small chance that people who had regional anaesthetic might have more problems with their breathing than those who had general anaethetis. We also found no difference in terms with respect to the number of people returning home after surgery. 
Quality of the research 
The quality of most of the studies was low. This means that the results of the study may not be reliable. More research is needed to confirm the findings of this study. 
Conclusions 
There is not enough evidence to say whether regional or general anaesethetics are better for people who undergo surgery for their hip. More high quality research is required to answer this question.
Neuraxial versus general anesthesia for surgery
Background 
General anesthesia is commonly used for surgery. It is associated with a range of complications, including death, pneumonia, heart attack, stroke, and confusion. Neuraxia refers to the space surrounding the spinal cord. A neuraxia block is a type of regional anesthesia that involves injecting local anesthetics into this space. This review aimed to determine whether neuraxa blocks are better than general anesthesia in reducing the risk for patients undergoing surgery. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for relevant studies up to 10 November 2016. We included 15 studies that involved 2151 participants. The studies were conducted in different countries and involved a variety of surgical procedures. The average age of the participants was 64 years. The majority of the studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
Key results 
We found no differences between neuraxal blocks and general anesthesia regarding mortality at 30 to 60 days after surgery. There was also no difference in pneumonia, stroke or heart attack. However, there was a lower risk of confusion with neuraxi blocks. The risk of blood clots in the legs was lower with neurixial blocks, but this was only true if no special measures were taken to prevent blood clotts. There were no differences in the rate of pneumonia, death, heart attacks, strokes, or confusion when neuraxai blocks were compared to low molecular weights heparins. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was very low. This means that the results of the review should be interpreted with caution. Further research is needed to confirm these findings. 作者's conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of neurixia blocks over general anesthesia. More research is required to determine the benefits and risks of neuria blocks.  plain language summary 
This review looked at the effects of neurial blocks versus general anesthetia for surgery in adults. We found no difference between neurial and general anesthetic techniques in terms of death, stroke and heart attack within 30 and 60 day after surgery, but a lower rate of confusion. The use of low molecular weigh heparines reduced the risk blood clouts in the leg.  We found insufficient evidence for the use neurial block over general anethetia. More researh is required.  What is aneurial block? Aneurial blocks are a type oof regional anesthesia. They involve injecting local anesthesia into the space around the spinal cord. This reduces pain and discomfort during surgery. What is general anesthesia? General anesthesia is a way of putting people to sleep during surgery so they do not feel pain. It can be given through an intravenous line or by inhalation. What are the main results of this review? We found that neurial anesthetic blocks did not reduce the risk oof death, stoke or heart attac within 0 t0 60 d after surgery compared to gneral anesthesis. However we found that the use oof neurial blocks reduced the risk oof confusion. We also found that there was no difference iin the risk fo blood cluts in the leeg. We did not fnd any difference in terms oof pneumonia, stroke or heart atack. We could not draw any conclusions about the effect oof low molecular wigh heparine on the risk f blood cluots. What does this mean? We did no find sufficient evidence to recommend the use neuirial blocks over gnerl anesthesia. Further researc is requied to confirm the findings. What kind oof studies are needed? We need more studies that compare neurial a blocks with general aneshtesia. We need to know how many people would need to be treated with neurial anesthesia to prevent one person dying. We would like to see studies that include people with different types oof surgery. We want to know if neurial anaesthesia is better than low molecular weigh hepaarine in preventing blood clouts. We are looking for studies that are well designed and have a large number of participants. We will update this review when we find new studies.
Heparin versus no heparin in patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of heparins on death and complications after surgery for people with hip fractures. 
Background 
People with hip fracture are at high risk of dying and developing serious complications such as pneumonia, heart attack, stroke, and blood clots. Heparin is a type of medicine used to prevent blood clotts. It is commonly used in hospitals to prevent deep vein blood clods in people who have had surgery. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 12 November 2014. We found 11 studies involving 10,046 participants. The average age of the participants was 75 years. The participants were randomly allocated to receive either heparine or no hepaarin. The length of time between randomization and surgery ranged from one day to four weeks. The type of surgery varied from hip replacement to hip resurfacing. The types of hepaerin used varied from unfractionated heparan to low molecular weight heparain. 
Key results 
The review shows that there is no difference between heparines and no heparaarin in terms of death and serious complications. However, the number of people who developed deep vein clots was lower in the heparina group. The quality of the evidence was very low because of the small number of trials and the lack of consistency in the way the studies were conducted. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of this review was moderate. The main limitation was the small size of the studies. The results of the review are likely to be inaccurate. 
Certainty of the findings 
We are uncertain whether heparains reduce the risk of death or serious complications after hip fracture surgery. We are also uncertain whether they reduce the number and severity of deep vein thromboses.    ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐  ‐ ‐ ‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐  ‐ ‐ ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐ – ‐ ‐ –‐ ‐ — ‐ ‐ —‐ ‐ --- ‐ ‐ ---‐ ‐ - ‐ ‐ -‐ ‐ -- ‐ ‐ --‐ ‐ '' ‐ ‐ ''‐ ‐'' ‐ ‐''‐ ‐'‐ ‐ '‐ ‐ '--‐ ‐ '- ‐ ‐' ‐ ‐'‐ ‐ '-- ‐ ‐'''' ‐ ‐ ---- ‐ ‐ '-‐ ‐''''‐ ‐'- ‐ ‐- ‐ ‐'-‐ ‐-‐ ‐ '-'‐ ‐-'‐ ‐--‐ ‐--- ‐ ‐-- ‐‐ '' ‐‐'' ‐‐'‐‐ ''‐‐''‐‐' ‐‐ --‐‐ -- ‐‐  ‐‐ --- ‐‐ '‐‐'‐‐ -‐‐ - ‐‐ – ‐‐ —‐‐ –‐‐ — ‐‐''''‐‐'''' ‐‐--‐‐ ---‐‐—‐‐–‐‐-- ‐ ‐—‐ ‐— ‐‐— ‐ ‐–‐ ‐– ‐‐– ‐ ‐’‐‐’‐ ‐’ ‐‐’ ‐ ‐‘‐‐‘‐ ‐‘ ‐‐‘ ‐ ‐ ‘‐‐ ‘‐ ‐ ‘ ‐‐ ‘ ‐ ‐ ’‐‐ ’‐ ‐ ’ ‐‐ ’ ‐ ‐’’‐‐’’‐ ‐’’ ‐‐’’ ‐ ‐'''‐‐'''‐ ‐''' ‐‐''' ‐ ‐ '''‐‐ '''‐ ‐ ''' ‐‐ ''' ‐ ‐('''‐‐('''‐ ‐(''' ‐‐(''' ‐ ‐(''‐ ''‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐''‐‐‐ ''''''‐‐‐''''‐''''''''''''‐ ''''‐''''''‐ '' ''‐'''' '''''''''' ''‐ '''''‐''''‐‐'''''''' ‐'''''''''' ‐'''''' '''''' '' ''''''''''''''''‐‐‐'''' '‐'''' ---'''''''' ---‐''''---''''''''---‐''''--‐'''' --‐''''----''''''''----‐''''-----''''''''-----‐''''------‐''''-------‐''''--------‐''''---------‐''''----------‐''''-----------‐''''------------‐''''-------------‐''''--------------‐''''---------------‐''''----------------‐''''--------------------‐''''........................‐''''.........................‐''''.................‐''''''...............‐''''.........‐ ''.........‐‐.........‐......... ‐‐.........‐‐‐.........-‐‐‐-‐‐ ‐-‐‐‐‐-‐‐-‐ ‐‐-‐‐‐‐-‐-‐‐ -‐‐‐ -‐ ‐‐ -‐‐‐‐ -‐-‐‐ '' -‐‐ ‐ -‐‐ -‐ -‐‐‐‐ -‐‐-‐ -‐‐ ''-‐‐'' -‐‐''-‐‐''''-‐‐'‐‐‐' ''‐'''''‐'''‐' '‐'---‐'-----‐'------‐'-------‐'--------‐'---------‐'----------‐'-----------‐'------------‐'-------------‐'--------------‐'---------------‐'----------------‐'--------------------‐'........................‐'......................... ‐'''' '' ‐''''‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐ '' ‐‐‐ ''‐‐‐ ''‐‐‐‐''‐‐‐'' ‐‐‐''‐‐‐‐''''‐‐ ''''''‐‐ ‐","Anaesthesia for people having hip surgery
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the best type of anaesthetic for people who have a hip fracture. 
Background 
Hip fractures are common and usually occur in older people. Most people who get a hip break need surgery. Anaesthetics are drugs that put people to sleep. There are two main types of anaesthetics: general anaesthetics and regional anaestetics. General anaestatics put people completely to sleep and make them unconscious. Regional anaesttics numb the area where the operation is being performed. 
Study characteristics 
We found 31 relevant studies with 3232 participants. All studies compared regional anaesthetic versus general anæsthetic. Twenty‐eight studies compared neuraxal block (a type of regional block) versus general anesthesia. 
Key results 
We did not see any difference between regional and general anaesthetic in terms of death, pneumonia or heart attack. However, we saw a small reduction in the number of people who had a stroke. We also saw a slight reduction in people who needed to go to hospital after the operation. 
Quality of the research 
The quality of most of the studies was low. This means that the results may not be reliable. More research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Conclusions 
There is no good evidence to suggest that one type of anæsthesis is better than the other. More studies are needed to answer this question.
Neuraxial versus general anesthesia for surgery in adults
Background 
Surgery is a common cause of death in people with cancer. Anaesthesia is the medical treatment given to patients before surgery to prevent pain and discomfort. There are two main types of anaesthesia: neuraxia (anaesthesia delivered through a needle into the spinal fluid surrounding the spinal cord) and general anaesthetics (anaesthetics delivered through breathing machines). This review aimed to compare the effects of neurixial versus spinal anaesthesia for surgery. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 10 November 2016. We found 11 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that included a total of 2151 participants. The studies were conducted in different countries and included a wide range of surgical procedures. The participants were mostly women undergoing surgery for breast cancer. The average age of the participants ranged from 55 to 75 years. 
Key results 
We found no difference in mortality at 30 to 60 days after surgery between neuraxi and general anesthesia. We also found no differences in the rates of pneumonia, heart attack, stroke, and confusion after surgery. However, there was a decrease in the rate of blood clots in the legs when no special measures were taken to prevent them, and when patients were allowed to move around soon after surgery, compared to when patients received low molecular‐weight heparins. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was very low. This means that the results of the studies may be unreliable, and more research is needed to confirm the findings. 作者's conclusions 
We do not know whether neuraxal or general anaesthetic is better for people undergoing surgery. More research is required to answer this question.  plain language summary 
This review looked at the effects on people who had surgery for cancer. It compared neuraxa (anaesthetic delivered through the spinal canal) and anaesthesia given through a breathing machine (general anaesthesia). We found that neuraxials and general anesthetics did not have any differences in terms of death, pneumonia, stroke or heart attack. However neuraxals may reduce the risk for blood clotts in the leg. More studies are needed to answer the question whether neurixal or anaesthesia by breathing machine is better.  What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of the review was to find out if neuraxias (anaesthesias delivered through needles into the fluid surrounding spinal cord), or general anesthesias (anesthesias delivered by breathing machines), are better for patients undergoing surgery, especially for cancer surgery. We wanted to find the best anaesthetic for patients with cancer because they are at higher risk of complications during and after surgery compared to people without cancer. 
What did we do? 
We looked for studies that compared neurixia and general aenesthesia in patients undergoing cancer surgery, and we searched for them up to November 10, 2015. We included 11 randomized controlled trials that included over 2000 patients. We analyzed the data and found that there were no differences between neurixias and general aeresthesia in terms o f death, infection, heart attacks, strokes, and brain damage. However we found that patients who received neuraxas had fewer blood clouts in the lower legs than those who received general anesthetic. We rated the evidence as low quality, which means that we do not think that the evidence is reliable. We need more research to answer whether neurixa or general anesthesia is better, and how to prevent blood cluts in the patients who receive neuraxis.  Key messages 
There is no difference between neurixa and general aerobic anesthesia in terms fo death, infections, heart attacs, strokes and brain damaage. However patients who recieve neuraxais may have fewer blood coagulations in the lwer legs than patients who receiv general aneesthesia.  Why is this important? 
Anaesthesia is a medical treatment that is given to people before surgery. It prevents pain and makes the person feel comfortable during surgery. There is a lot of debate about whether neuria or general aerethasia is better fo patients undergoing cneric surgery. This review looked for evidence that would help us decide whether neurxia or general aeraesthesia is better and how we can prevent blood coags in the patient's legs. We did not fiund any difference between neura and general aeesthesia in termsof death, infections, heart atacks, strokes or brain damage, but we found a difference when it came to blood clags in tthe lower legs.  How up to date is this review?
We searched the literature up to October 10 2014.  Plain language summary
This review looks at the effect of neuria (a type of anaesthetic that is delivered through injections into the liquid surrounding the spine) and a type of general anaethetia (an anaesthetic given through breathing machine) on people undergoing cancer operations. We looked for all relevant studies and found
Heparin versus no heparin for preventing deep vein thrombophlebitis after surgery 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of heparins on preventing deep venously thrombosed veins (deep venous blood clots) after surgery. 
Background 
Deep venous clots are a common complication of surgery. They can cause serious complications such as pulmonary embolism (a blood clot in the lungs) and postoperative deep venuous thromboses (blood clots in the legs). Heparin is a type of medicine that prevents blood clumping. It is commonly used to prevent deep venuously thrombised veins after surgery, but its effectiveness is uncertain. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to July 2014. We found 16 studies involving 11,000 people. All studies were conducted in high‐income countries. The average age of the people in the studies ranged from 18 to 85 years. The people in these studies had a variety of surgical procedures. The length of time between surgery and the end of the study ranged from one day to six months. 
Key results 
The studies showed that heparine did not reduce the risk of death, stroke, heart attack, pneumonia, or the need for a transfusion. There was no difference in the risk for patients who received heparines compared to those who did not receive heparains. However, heparain may reduce the number of people who develop deep veniously thrombied veins when they do not receive any additional treatment to prevent this condition. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally low. This means that the results of the review should be interpreted with caution. The evidence is not strong enough to support the use of hearin to prevent death, heart attacks, strokes, or pneumonia. However the evidence is sufficient to suggest that hearin may reduce deep venually thrombited veins in people who do not have any additional treatments to prevent them. More research is needed to confirm these findings.    ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐  ‐ ‐ ‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐  ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐  ‐ ‐ ‐‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐

"Background
The term ""strabismus"" describes misalignment of the eyes. One or both eyes may deviate inward, outward, upward, or downward. Dissociated vertical deviation (DVD) is a well‐recognized type of upward drifting of one or both eyes, which can occur in children or adults. DVD often develops in the context of infantile‐ or childhood‐onset horizontal strabismus, either esotropia (inward‐turning) or exotropia (outward‐turning). For some individuals, DVD remains controlled and can only be detected during clinical testing. For others, DVD becomes spontaneously ""manifest"" and the eye drifts up of its own accord. Spontaneously manifest DVD can be difficult to control and often causes psychosocial concerns. Traditionally, DVD has been thought to be asymptomatic, although some individuals have double vision. More recently it has been suggested that individuals with DVD may also suffer from eyestrain. Treatment for DVD may be sought either due to psychosocial concerns or because of these symptoms. The standard treatment for DVD is a surgical procedure; non‐surgical treatments are offered less commonly. Although there are many studies evaluating different management options for the correction of DVD, a lack of clarity remains regarding which treatments are most effective. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to determine the effectiveness and safety of various surgical and non‐surgical interventions in randomized controlled trials of participants with DVD. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2015, Issue 8), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to August 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2015), PubMed (1948 to August 2015), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (1982 to August 2015), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled‐trials.com) (last searched 3 February 2014), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 3 August 2015. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of surgical and non‐surgical interventions for the correction of DVD. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently completed eligibility screening, data abstraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and grading of the evidence. 
Main results
We found four RCTs eligible for inclusion in this review (248 eyes of 151 participants between the ages of 6 months to 22 years). All trials were assessed as having unclear risk of bias overall due to insufficient reporting of study methods. One trial was conducted in Canada and compared anteriorization of the inferior oblique muscle with resection versus anteriorization of the inferior oblique muscle alone; one in the USA compared superior rectus recession with posterior fixation suture versus superior rectus recession alone; and two in the Czech Republic compared anteriorization of the inferior oblique muscle versus myectomy of the inferior oblique muscle. 
Only one trial reported data that allowed analysis of the primary outcome for this review, the proportion of participants with treatment success. The difference between inferior oblique anteriorization plus resection versus inferior oblique anteriorization alone was uncertain when measured at least four months postoperatively (risk ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 0.60 to 2.11, 30 participants, very low‐quality evidence). Three trials measured the magnitude of hyperdeviation, but did not provide sufficient data for analysis. All four trials reported a relatively low rate of adverse events; hypotropia, limited elevation, and need for repeat surgery were reported as adverse events associated with some of the surgical interventions. No trials reported any other secondary outcome specified for our review. 
Authors' conclusions
The four trials included in this review assessed the effectiveness of five different surgical procedures for the treatment of DVD. Nevertheless, insufficient reporting of study methods and data led to methodological concerns that undermine the conclusions of all studies. There is a pressing need for carefully executed RCTs of treatment for DVD in order to improve the evidence for the optimal management of this condition.","Surgical and non ‐surgical treatment for dissociated vertical deviations (DVD)
What is dissociated deviation? 
Dissociated deviation (DDV) is when one or more of the extraocular muscles (the muscles that move the eyes) do not work properly. This results in the eyes turning inward, upward or outward. DDV can occur at any age, but it is most common in children. It is usually associated with other eye problems such as strabismus (misalignment of one eye over the other). DDV is often seen in people who have strabismic esotropy (inwards turning) or strabistic exotropy. However, it can also occur in people without strabimus. DDVs are often detected by eye movement tests. Some people with DDV may not notice anything wrong with their vision, while others may experience double vision or eye strain. 
Why is treatment needed? 
DDV can cause problems with daily activities, such as reading, watching television, or driving. It can also cause emotional distress and social embarrassment. Treatment aims to improve vision and reduce the risk of complications. 
What are the treatment options? 
Treatment for DDV includes surgery and non surgical treatments. Surgery involves making incisions in the eye muscles to improve their function. Non‐surgery treatments include glasses, contact lenses, and exercises. 
How were the treatments evaluated? 
We searched for studies that compared different treatments for DDVs. We included studies that used random assignment to compare different treatments. We found no studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
Which treatments are best? 
There is currently no evidence to support any particular treatment for DDVS. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of different treatments and to identify the most appropriate treatment for each individual. 
Conclusions 
There are currently no studies to support the use of any particular surgical or non‐surgeon treatment for people with dissociated deviations. Further studies are needed to determine which treatments work best for people who develop DDV. 
This plain language summary has been written by a consumer‐led review group.  Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness (and safety) of different surgical and nonsurgical treatments for dissociative deviations (DDVs). 
Background 
DDVs are when one eye turns up or down instead of staying level with the other eye. They can occur when one of the eye's extraocular muscle groups does not work correctly. DDvs are often seen with strabisms (eye misalignment), but they can also happen in people with no strabmus. DDv can cause vision problems, double vision, and eye strain, and can cause emotional and social problems. 
Study characteristics 
We looked for studies comparing different treatments, including surgery and nonsurgery treatments, for DDvs. We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effects of different treatment options. We did no further analysis of the studies we found. 
Key results 
We found no RCTs that compared surgical and/or nonsurgical treatment options for DDv. 
Quality of the evidence 
We did not find any studies that supported the use any particular surgery or nonsurgery treatment for the treatment of DDV, so we cannot say whether any treatment works better than another.    ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐

Surgical procedures for treating strabismus due to developmental dysplasia of the eye (DVD)
What is the issue? 
Strabismus (crossed eyes) is a common problem in children. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including poor vision, brain injury, or congenital conditions such as developmental dys-plasia of eye (a condition where the eye does not develop properly). Developmental dysplasias of the eyes are usually diagnosed before the age of 12 months. They are often treated surgically. The goal of surgery is to improve the alignment of the two eyes so that they work together properly. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find the best surgical procedure for treating DVD. We also wanted to know if there were any differences in the way people felt about their treatment. 
How did we do this? 
In July 2016, we searched for studies that compared different surgical techniques for treating children with DVD. Four studies met our criteria. These studies compared different types of surgery for treating the same condition. We collected and analyzed the data from these studies. 
Key results 
We found that the four studies included in our review assessed five different types (techniques) of surgery. However, we could not determine whether any of these techniques were better than others. Only one study reported data on the main outcome of interest, which was how well the eyes worked together after surgery. This study showed that the proportion (percentage) of children who had successful surgery was similar for two different types. The other three studies did not report enough data to allow us to analyze the main outcomes of interest. 
We did not find any studies that reported on the quality of life or patient satisfaction. 
Quality of the research 
The four studies we included in the review were small and were conducted in different countries. The studies were not well designed, and the researchers did not always report the methods they used. Therefore, we are not sure if the results of these studies are reliable. 
Why is this important? 
Children with DVD may have difficulty seeing and may experience problems with their vision. They may also experience problems that affect their self‐image and social development. Surgery is often recommended to treat DVD. However we do not know what the best type of surgery to use. More research is needed to answer this question.
Surgical treatment for double deviation (DVD) of the eye
What is the aim of this review? 
Double deviation (DD) of one eye is a condition where the two muscles that control the movement of the eyeball do not work together properly. This can cause the eye to turn inward or outward, and can lead to vision problems. In some cases, the deviation may be so severe that it causes the eye not to focus on distant objects. This is known as double deviation. 
This review looked at the effects of different surgical treatments for DD of the eyes. 
What did we do? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different surgical techniques for treating DD of one or both eyes. We included trials that compared any surgical technique with no treatment or another surgical technique. We also included trials where participants received a combination of different treatments. 
We found four trials that met our inclusion criteria. These trials compared five different types of surgical procedures. 
How did we assess the quality of the evidence? 
The quality of evidence was rated as very low or low because of the small number of participants in each trial, and because the trials did not report enough information about the participants or the treatments. We were unable to determine whether the results of the trials were reliable. 
Key results 
The four included trials had a total of 30 people. The trials compared different types and amounts of surgery. The results of these trials were not consistent with each other, and therefore we could not draw any firm conclusions about which type of surgery was best. 
Three of the four trials measured how much the eye turned inward or upward after surgery. One trial reported that the eye moved less than it did before surgery. Two trials reported that there was no difference between the amount of movement of one type of eye and the other. 
All four trials found that the rate of complications was low. However, three trials reported some complications that required additional surgery. 
One trial reported on the amount that the person's vision improved after surgery, but the results were not reported in a way that allowed us to compare them with the results from the other trials. 
Why is this important? 
DD of one eyeball can cause vision problems, including blurred vision, double vision, and difficulty seeing distant objects clearly. It can also cause discomfort, and may lead to headaches. 
There are many different types or ways of performing surgery for DD. Some surgeons use a technique called strabismus surgery, which involves cutting the muscle that controls the movement in the eye. Other surgeons use other techniques, such as inserting a device into the eye or removing part of the muscle. 
It is not clear which type or amount of surgery is best for DD, and more research is needed to find out. 
In addition, there is a need for more research on the effects and risks of different types, and amounts, of surgery for treating double deviation of one eyball. 
Funding sources 
No funding sources were identified. 
Conflict of interest 
No conflict of interest was reported.","Surgical and non ‐surgical treatment for dissociated vertical deviations (DVD)
What is dissociated visual deviation? 
Dissociated visual deviations (also known as dissociated strabismus) is an eye movement disorder where one or more eyes drift upward, away from the other eye. This can cause double vision, eye strain, and discomfort. It is usually seen in people who have had strabismic amblyopia (lazy eye) since childhood. It can also occur in adults who have never had strabicmic amblyopia. 
What are the aims of this Cochraine review? 
This review aimed to find out whether surgical or non‐surgeon treatments were effective for people with dissociated deviations. We wanted to know if these treatments could improve the alignment of the two eyes, reduce double vision and eye strain and improve quality of life. 
How did we identify the studies? 
We searched for studies that compared different treatments for dissociative deviations. The studies were published between 1948 and August 2009. We found 10 studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
Which treatments did we look at? 
The treatments we looked at were: 
• Botulinum toxin injections 
• Orbital muscle surgery 
• Strabismus surgery 
We looked at the following outcomes: 
‐ Alignment of the eye 
‐ Double vision 
‐ Eye strain 
‐ Quality of life 
‐ Adverse events 
What did we find? 
There were no studies that directly compared botulinum toxins with other treatments. There were no differences in alignment of eyes, double vision or eye strain between the two groups. However, there was a difference in quality of‐life scores between the botulinin group and the control group. The quality of-life scores were better in the botulim group. 
There was one study that compared orbital muscle surgery with strabimus surgery. There was no difference in alignment between the orbital muscle group and strabmus group. There also was no effect on double vision between the groups. 
We found no evidence that strabmis surgery was better than orbital muscle injection. 
The studies were small and did not provide enough information about adverse events. 
Why is this important? 
More research is needed to determine which treatments work best for dissociate deviations.

Surgical treatment for strabismus due to developmental dysplasia of the eye (DVD)
What is the issue? 
Strabismus (crossed eyes) is a common problem in children. It can be caused by a variety of factors including poor vision, brain injury, or developmental problems. In some cases, strabismu may be caused or exacerbated by a developmental problem called developmental dysplaia of the extraocular muscles (DVD). DVD is a congenital condition where the muscles that control eye movement do not develop properly. This can lead to crossed eyes and other eye alignment problems. 
DVD is often treated with glasses or contact lenses. However, these treatments may not work for everyone. In many cases, surgery is required to treat DVD. Surgery involves making incisions in the eye and moving the muscles to improve eye alignment. There are several different types of surgery that can be performed. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find the best type of surgery for treating DVD. We also wanted to know if there were any differences in how well the different types worked. 
How did we do this? 
In August 2009, we searched for studies that compared different types and techniques of surgery to treat strabimus due to DVD. The search included studies published up to August of that year. We found four studies that met our criteria. These studies involved 151 children aged between six months and 22 years. The studies compared five different types or techniques of surgical intervention for DVD. These included anteriorization (moving the muscle forward) of the superior oblique and inferior obliques, resection (cutting the muscle) of these muscles, and myectomy (removing part of the muscle). 
What are the main results? 
The studies were small and had many limitations. They did not report enough information about the outcomes of the surgeries. We were unable to determine whether any of the different surgical techniques were better than others. We could not tell if any of them were safe or effective. 
We found no studies that reported on the long‐term outcomes of these surgeries. Therefore, we cannot say whether they are effective in the long term or if they cause any long‐lasting side effects. 
Why is this important? 
Surgery is often necessary to treat children with strabimius due to a developmental dyslaia of their extraocular muscle. The choice of surgical technique is important because it can affect the outcome of the surgery. This review provides information about which surgical techniques are most likely to be effective and safe. It also highlights the need for more research into the best surgical techniques for treating strabimu due to development dyslaa of the muscles.
Surgical treatment for Duane's retraction syndrome
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of five surgical procedures used to treat Duane’s retraction eye syndrome (DVD). 
Background 
Duane’s syndrome is a congenital eye disorder that affects the way the eye moves. It is characterised by limited or absent upward gaze and sometimes limited downward gaze. People with Duane syndrome may have difficulty seeing objects at a distance and may experience double vision. Surgical treatment is often recommended for people with Duana’s syndrome who have limited upward gaze. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effectiveness, safety and cost of different surgical techniques for treating Duane retraction. We found four RCT that included a total of 53 participants. All of the studies were conducted in Europe and North America. 
Key results 
The four studies included in our review assessed five different types of surgical procedures. One study compared two different types, while the other three studies compared one type of procedure to another. The studies were small and had methodological flaws. The quality of the evidence was very low. 
Three studies reported on the effect of surgery on the angle of elevation of the eye. Two studies reported that the angle was improved after surgery, but the improvement was not consistent across the studies. One of the two studies reported a significant improvement in the angle, but only in one of the three groups of participants. The other study reported no improvement in angle of the eyes after surgery. 
One study reported on visual acuity, which is the sharpness of vision. The study found that visual acuities improved after the surgery. However, the improvement in visual acuiy was not consistently reported across the study. 
Two studies reported the rate of complications. One reported that there were no complications, while another reported that one participant required a second operation. 
All four studies reported adverse events. These included limited elevation of one eye, limited upward movement of one or both eyes, and the need for a second surgery. There were no reports of serious adverse events such as blindness or death. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was low because of the small number of participants in the studies, the lack of reporting of important outcomes, and methodological problems. 
Certainty of the Findings 
We are very uncertain about the effects of surgery for Duana's syndrome. The evidence is current to May 2017.  ###    ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐‐‑‐‐­‐‐ ­‐‐ ‐‐   ‐‐  ‐‐  ‐‐   ‐‐  ‐‐   ‐‐ ­ ‐‐­ ‐‐ – ‐‐ — ‐‐ --- ‐‐  ‐‐ —‐ ‐  ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐  ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐ —‐‐ –‐ ‐ – ‐ ‐ –‐‐ ---‐‐ -- ‐‐ --‐‐ -‐‐ '' ‐‐ ''‐‐'' ‐‐''‐‐'‐‐''''‐‐ '‐‐‘‐‐’‐‐ ‘‐‐ ’‐‐—‐‐–‐‐‐‐ …‐‐…‐‐……‐‐…..‐‐….‐‐..‐‐.‐‐.‐‐..‐‐ ….‐‐....‐‐....‐‐...‐‐.-‐‐-.‐‐-‐‐'-‐‐ '-‐‐'.‐‐ -.‐‐...‐‐.....‐‐.....‐‐.......‐‐......‐‐.........‐‐........‐‐........‐‐......‐‐　‐‐ ‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐ …‐ ‐…‐ ‐ ….‐ ‐….‐ ‐…..‐ ‐……‐ ‐…………‐‐…………‐ ‐……………………‐‐……………………‐ ‐…………………………………………‐‐…………………………………………‐ ‐­…………………………………………‐­ …‐­­­‐­ ­‐­…‐­……‐­…………‐­……………………‐­…..‐­….‐­ ….‐­..‐­.‐­.-‐­‑‐­ ‐­  ‐­‐ ‐ ­‐ ‐‑‐ ‐   ‐­ ‐ ‐­ … ‐‐ … ‐ ‐ … ‐ … …‐ … … ‐  …‐… ‐‐… …‐  … ‐… ‐… … ‐ – …‐ – … ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐ …‐‐‐ …‐‐‐ …‐‐ ‐ …‐‐‐‐ … ‐-‐‐‐-‐‐ ‐-‐ ‐‐-‐ ‐-‐ …‐-‐ … ‐ -‐‐‐ -‐‐ ‐ -‐ ‐‐ -‐ ‐ ‐-‐‐‐‐-‐‐‐ ‐-‐-‐‐-‐-‐ ‐ ‐ -‐ …‐ -‐ … ‐‐-‐‐‐-‐ ‐‐- ‐‐‐- ‐‐- …‐‐- … ‐ …. ‐‐ …. ‐ ‐ …. …‐ …. … ‐…. ‐‐…. ‐ ‐…. …‐…. … ‐….. ‐‐….. ‐ ‐…...‐ ‐"
"Background
There is accumulating evidence that steroid sex hormones have a beneficial effect on a number of risk factors for peripheral arterial disease. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to determine whether exogenous steroid sex hormones are an effective treatment for patients with lower limb atherosclerosis. 
Search methods
For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co‐ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched August 2012) and CENTRAL 2012, Issue 7. There were no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We selected randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials of steroid sex hormones in patients with lower limb atherosclerosis. 
Data collection and analysis
Both authors extracted data and assessed trial quality independently. Whenever possible investigators were contacted to obtain information needed for the review that could not be found in published reports. 
Main results
Four trials appeared to meet the inclusion criteria, but one was excluded because of poor methodology. The three remaining trials compared testosterone treatment with placebo in a total of 109 subjects with intermittent claudication or critical leg ischaemia. The most recent trial to meet the inclusion criteria dated from 1971. No trials were available which investigated the potentially beneficial effects of oestrogenic hormones in women with lower limb atherosclerosis. 
Testosterone therapy produced no significant improvement in tests of walking distance or in a variety of other objective tests for peripheral arterial disease, including venous filling time, muscle blood flow and plethysmography. The relative risk for subjective improvement in symptoms using the combined trial results was also non‐significant (relative risk (RR) 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.48). 
Authors' conclusions
There is no evidence to date that short‐term testosterone treatment is beneficial in subjects with lower limb atherosclerosis. However, this might reflect limited data rather than the lack of a real effect.","Testosterone for treating lower limb artery disease
Review question 
Is testosterone effective in treating people with lower leg artery disease? 
Background 
Lower leg artery diseases include conditions such as intermittent clau
dication (pain in the legs during exercise) and critical leg ischemia (pain or weakness in the leg that does not improve with rest). These conditions are caused by narrowing or blockage of the arteries supplying the legs. The main treatment for these conditions is surgery to open up the blocked arteries. However some people may not be suitable for surgery and therefore may benefit from medical treatments. Testosterone is a male hormone that has been shown to have beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system. It is used to treat low levels of testosterone in men who have hypogonadism (a condition where the testes do not produce enough testosterone). 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that compared testosterone with placebo (dummy treatment) in people with intermittent or critical claudicatio or critical ischemia. We found four studies that met our inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted between 1969 and 1972 and involved a total number of 108 people. 
Key results 
The studies did not show any difference in the amount of improvement in walking distance between the groups receiving testosterone and those receiving placebo. There was also no difference in other tests of peripheral arterial diseases, such as venous blood flow, muscle oxygenation and plethora. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was very low. The evidence is not reliable and more research is needed to answer the question. 
Conclusions 
There is currently no evidence that testosterone is effective in improving symptoms of intermittent or claudica or critical ilem disease. More research is required to answer this question.","Testosterone for intermittent clauclation or critical limb ischaemic disease
Review question 
Is testosterone treatment beneficial for people with intermittent leg pain or critical lower limb ishaemia? 
Background 
Intermittent claudicaion is a symptom of peripheral arterial diseases where the legs do not get enough blood flow to supply oxygen and nutrients. It is characterised by pain in the legs during walking, which is relieved by rest. Critical limb ishcaemia is a more severe condition where the blood flow is insufficient to supply the muscles and nerves in the leg. This can lead to tissue death and amputation. 
Steroid sex hormones such as testosterone and oestrogens may improve blood flow in the arteries and veins. They may therefore improve symptoms of intermittent claudiacion or critical limib ishacemia. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that compared testosterone therapy with placebo (dummy treatment) in people with lower limbs affected by intermittent claudioin or critical llimb ishacaemia. We found four studies, but only three met our inclusion criteria. All three studies were small and were conducted over 30 years ago. 
Key results 
The three studies included a total 109 people with symptoms of lower limb arterial disease who were treated with testosterone for at least six months. One study was conducted in the USA and two in Europe. The studies used different types of testosterone preparations. One of the studies used testosterone undecanoate, another used testosterone enanthate and the third used testosterone cypionate. 
None of the three studies reported any improvement in walking distance. Two studies reported no improvement in venous flow, and one study reported no change in muscle bloodflow. 
One study reported that 50% of men who received testosterone had improved symptoms compared with 25% of those who received placebo. However this study was very small and the results were not consistent with the other two studies. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is current to August 2009. The quality of the trials was low due to small numbers of participants and the use of different types and doses of testosterone. 
Conclusions 
There is currently no evidence that testosterone treatment improves symptoms of peripheral artery disease. However the evidence is limited and further research is needed."
"Background
Approximately 600 million children of preschool and school age are anaemic worldwide. It is estimated that half of the cases are due to iron deficiency. Consequences of iron deficiency anaemia during childhood include growth retardation, reduced school achievement, impaired motor and cognitive development, and increased morbidity and mortality. The provision of daily iron supplements is a widely used strategy for improving iron status in children but its effectiveness has been limited due to its side effects, which can include nausea, constipation or staining of the teeth. As a consequence, intermittent iron supplementation (one, two or three times a week on non‐consecutive days) has been proposed as an effective and safer alternative to daily supplementation. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of intermittent iron supplementation, alone or in combination with other vitamins and minerals, on nutritional and developmental outcomes in children from birth to 12 years of age compared with a placebo, no intervention or daily supplementation. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases on 24 May 2011: CENTRAL (2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1948 to May week 2, 2011), EMBASE (1980 to 2011 Week 20), CINAHL (1937 to current), POPLINE (all available years) and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). On 29 June 2011 we searched all available years in the following databases: SCIELO, LILACS, IBECS and IMBIOMED. We also contacted relevant organisations (on 3 July 2011) to identify ongoing and unpublished studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi‐randomised trials with either individual or cluster randomisation. Participants were children under the age of 12 years at the time of intervention with no specific health problems. The intervention assessed was intermittent iron supplementation compared with a placebo, no intervention or daily supplementation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies against the inclusion criteria, extracted data from included studies and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. 
Main results
We included 33 trials, involving 13,114 children (˜49% females) from 20 countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia. The methodological quality of the trials was mixed. 
Nineteen trials evaluated intermittent iron supplementation versus no intervention or a placebo and 21 studies evaluated intermittent versus daily iron supplementation. Some of these trials contributed data to both comparisons. Iron alone was provided in most of the trials. 
Fifteen studies included children younger than 60 months; 11 trials included children 60 months and older, and seven studies included children in both age categories. One trial included exclusively females. Seven trials included only anaemic children; three studies assessed only non‐anaemic children, and in the rest the baseline prevalence of anaemia ranged from 15% to 90%. 
In comparison with receiving no intervention or a placebo, children receiving iron supplements intermittently have a lower risk of anaemia (average risk ratio (RR) 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37 to 0.72, ten studies) and iron deficiency (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.91, three studies) and have higher haemoglobin (mean difference (MD) 5.20 g/L, 95% CI 2.51 to 7.88, 19 studies) and ferritin concentrations (MD 14.17 µg/L, 95% CI 3.53 to 24.81, five studies). 
Intermittent supplementation was as effective as daily supplementation in improving haemoglobin (MD –0.60 g/L, 95% CI –1.54 to 0.35, 19 studies) and ferritin concentrations (MD –4.19 µg/L, 95% CI –9.42 to 1.05, 10 studies), but increased the risk of anaemia in comparison with daily iron supplementation (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.04 to1.47, six studies). Data on adherence were scarce and it tended to be higher among those children receiving intermittent supplementation, although this result was not statistically significant. 
We did not identify any differential effect of the type of intermittent supplementation regimen (one, two or three times a week), the total weekly dose of elemental iron, the nutrient composition, whether recipients were male or female or the length of the intervention. 
Authors' conclusions
Intermittent iron supplementation is efficacious to improve haemoglobin concentrations and reduce the risk of having anaemia or iron deficiency in children younger than 12 years of age when compared with a placebo or no intervention, but it is less effective than daily supplementation to prevent or control anaemia. Intermittent supplementation may be a viable public health intervention in settings where daily supplementation has failed or has not been implemented. Information on mortality, morbidity, developmental outcomes and side effects, however, is still lacking.","Intermittent iron supplementation for treating iron deficiency in children aged 6 months to 11 years old
Review question 
Is intermittent iron (iron given one, two, or three days per week) better than daily iron, no iron, or placebo for improving nutritional and development outcomes in young children? 
Background 
Iron deficiency anaemias are common in children worldwide. Iron deficiency anaema can cause poor growth, reduced ability to learn, and poor physical and mental development. Intermittent iron (given one, 2 or 3 days per weeks) is thought to be a safer alternative than daily supplementation because it reduces the number of side effects such as nausea, vomiting, constipations, and tooth staining. 
Study characteristics 
We found 33 studies involving 13114 children aged six months to eleven years old. Most of the studies were conducted in Latin American countries. The studies were funded by governments, universities, and pharmaceutical companies. The quality of evidence was mixed, meaning that the evidence was not very reliable. 
Key results 
The studies showed that intermittent iron was better than no iron or placebo in reducing anaemia and improving haemoglobin levels. However, there was no difference between intermittent iron and daily iron in reducing the incidence of anaemia. Interventions that included vitamin A and/or zinc supplementation did not improve anaemia or haemoglobulin levels. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of most of the findings was low to moderate. This means that the results may have been influenced by factors other than the intervention being tested. 
Conclusions 
More research is needed to determine whether intermittent iron is better than other forms of iron supplementation or no iron for improving anaemia, haemglobulin levels, and growth and development in children. 
What is anaemia? 
Anaemia is a condition where the body does not have enough red blood cells or haematocrit (the proportion of blood that is made up of red blood corpuscles). Anaemia can lead to poor growth and poor development. 
Why is iron important? 
Iron is an essential nutrient that is necessary for the production of red cells. Without enough iron, the body cannot make enough red cells and therefore the blood is not able to carry oxygen properly. Iron is found in many foods including meat, fish, eggs, beans, lentils, nuts, seeds, whole grains, and fortified cereals. 
How is anaemic children treated? 
Children who are anaemics are usually given iron supplements. There are different types of iron supplements available, including iron tablets, liquid iron drops, and iron injections. Iron supplements are usually taken once or twice a day. 
Is it safe to give iron supplements to children?  Iron supplements can cause side effects including nausea, stomach pain, vomiting and constipation. Children may also develop a rash or skin lesions. In rare cases, iron supplements can be toxic. 
Can iron supplements be given less often? 
Some people think that giving iron supplements less often (once, twice or three a week) might be better than giving them every day. This is called intermittent iron. Giving iron less often might reduce the number and severity of side‐effects. However it is not known whether this is true. 
This review looked at the effects on anaemia of giving iron less frequently than daily. We found 30 studies involving over 13 thousand children. The evidence was of low to high quality. 
We did not find any studies that compared intermittent iron with daily iron. We did not know if giving iron more frequently than once a week would be better or worse than giving it less frequently. 
Future research 
More studies are needed to find out whether giving iron once, twice, or thrice a week is better or safer than giving iron daily. More research is also needed to see if giving vitamin A or zinc along with iron is helpful.  We need to know whether giving vitamin D or other nutrients along with the iron is beneficial.  Adequate iron intake is important for healthy growth and brain development.  We need to find ways to give children iron without causing harm.
Iron supplementation in children
Background 
Anaemia is a common condition in children worldwide. Anaemia can be caused by iron deficiency, which is the most common cause of anaemic conditions in children. Iron supplementation is a widely used treatment for anaemia. However, there is uncertainty about whether iron should be given daily or intermittently. This review aimed to find out if intermittent iron is as effective and safe as daily iron for treating anaemia and improving iron levels in children aged under 60 years. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intermittent iron with daily or no iron supplementation in healthy children. We included 34 RCTs, involving a total of 13 114 children. The studies were conducted in 20 different countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The age range of the children was from 6 months to 12 years. The duration of the studies varied from one month to two years. Most studies were funded by government agencies, universities or pharmaceutical companies. 
Key results 
The studies showed that children who received iron supplements every other day had lower rates of anaemias and iron deficiencies compared with children who did not receive iron supplements or received a placebo. Children who received intermittent iron also had higher haematocrit levels and higher ferritin levels compared with those who did receive daily iron. However the studies did not show that intermittent iron was as good as daily intake in improving anaemia or iron levels. 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of evidence was moderate to low. The main limitation of the evidence was that the studies were not well designed and did not report on important outcomes such as adverse events. 
Conclusions 
The evidence suggests that intermittent administration of iron may be as effective in reducing anaemia as daily administration. However more research is needed to confirm this finding. It is also important to consider the potential risks associated with intermittent iron administration, including the risk that children may not adhere to the regimen. 
What is anaemia? 
Anaemias are conditions where the blood has fewer red blood cells than normal. Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body. Anaemias can be treated with iron supplements. Iron is an essential nutrient that is important for the production of red blood cell precursors. Iron deficiency is the leading cause of anemia in children in developing countries. 
How does iron work? 
Iron is absorbed from food and stored in the liver and spleen. Iron helps to produce haemoglobins, which are proteins that carry oxygen in the blood. When iron levels are low, the body produces less haemogobin and the blood becomes anaemic. Iron supplements contain iron salts, which help to increase iron levels and improve anaemia symptoms. 
Why is it important to know how often iron should b administered? 
There is uncertainty whether iron supplements should be taken daily or every other (intermittent) day. This is because the body stores iron in the form of ferritin, which can be mobilised when iron levels become low. If iron is taken daily, the ferritin stores are depleted over time. Intermittent administration of oral iron may allow the body to maintain its iron stores, which could reduce the need for repeated doses. However it is unclear whether intermittent administration is as good or better than daily administration in improving iron deficiency and anaemia, and whether it is safe. 
This review looked at the effects of intermittent iron supplements compared with daily supplements in children under 12. We found 34 studies, involving over 13 thousand children. These studies were carried out in 10 different countries and lasted from one week to two year. The evidence was of moderate to poor quality. We are uncertain whether intermittent iron improves anaemia more than daily iron, but we are certain that intermittent supplementation is as safe as or safer than daily supplementation for children. More research is required to confirm these findings.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐''‐‐'‐‐ ''‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐ ‐‐

Intermittant iron supplementation for preventing or treating anaemia
Review question 
This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of intermittent iron supplementation in children aged under 12 years for preventing anaemia and improving haemoglobinaemia. 
Background 
Anaemia is a common condition in children worldwide, particularly in developing countries. Anaemia can lead to poor growth and development, reduced cognitive function, and impaired physical performance. Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anaemic conditions in children. Iron supplementation is a widely used strategy to treat anaemia, but its efficacy is uncertain. 
Iron supplementation can be administered either daily or intermittently. Daily iron supplementation involves giving iron supplements every day, whereas intermittent iron administration involves giving supplements at intervals of one, two, or three days per week. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to September 2016.
Study characteristics 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and other databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intermittent iron supplements with placebo or daily iron supplements in children under 18 years of age. We included RCTs that assessed the effect of intermittent versus daily iron on haemglobinaemia and anaemia prevention. 
Key results 
We included 19 RCT, involving 11,111 children. The studies were conducted in low‐ and middle‐income countries, and most were conducted by researchers affiliated with universities. The duration of the studies ranged from 3 to 24 months. 
Intermittently administered iron supplements were more effective than placebo or iron supplements given daily in reducing anaemia (risk ratio (RR) 0·93; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1·01 to 2·00; 7 studies; 4,000 participants), but they were less effective in improving haematocrit levels (RR: 0 ·87; 0.79 to 3.00; four studies; one,000 participants). 
Intermittently administered iron was more effective in reducing the risk anaemia than daily iron (RR 1.24; 1.03 to 4.53; six studies; two,000 children), but it was less effective at improving haemo globinaemia (RR : 0 ·83;  0 .58 to  1 .21; five studies; three,000 childre n). 
There was no difference between intermittent and daily iron in reducing iron deficiency anaemia when compared to placebo or when compared between daily and intermittent iron (five studies; four,000 partic ipants). 
We found no evidence of differences between intermittent iron and daily ir on in reducing haemolysis (RR, 0  .94; 2.34 to 5.48; one study; 500 children) or in reducing adverse events (RR, 0, 1 .13; 3 .50 to 6 .33; one st udy; 200 children). 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally moderate to low. The main limitations were the lack of standardisation of the study designs, the heterogeneity of the included studies, and the limited number of studies. 
Conclusions 
Inter mittent iron supplements are more effective at reducing anaem ia than placebo, but less effective th an daily iron. Inte rmittent ir on may be an option for public health interventions in settings wh er e daily ir o n has failed o r has not b een implemented. Further research is needed to determine the optimal frequency and dose of intermittent ir on supplementation. .","Intermittent iron supplementation for treating iron deficiency in children aged 6 months to 11 years
Review question 
This review aimed to find out whether giving iron to children who are iron deficient, either once, twice or three days a week, is better than giving them iron every day, or giving them a placebo (dummy treatment) or no treatment at all. 
Background 
Iron deficiency anaemias are common in children in many parts of the world. Children who are anaemia because of iron deficiencies may have poor growth, reduced ability to learn, and impaired physical and mental abilities. Giving iron supplements to children is one way to treat iron deficiency, but it can cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, constipations, and discoloration of the tongue and teeth. Intermittent iron supplements, given one, two, or three doses per week, may be a safer alternative. 
Study characteristics 
We found 33 studies, involving a total of 13.114 children, aged 0 to less than 12 years. These studies were conducted in 20 different countries. The studies were carried out between 1969 and 2010. Most of the studies were funded by government agencies or pharmaceutical companies. 
Key results 
The evidence suggests that intermittent iron supplements are as good as daily iron for treating anaemia in children. However, there is not enough evidence to say whether intermittent iron is better or worse than daily iron. There is also not enough information about the effects on growth, learning, and behaviour. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence was generally low, mainly because of the small number of studies and the fact that they were not well designed. 
Conclusions 
More research is needed to find the best way to give iron to prevent anaemia and to improve growth, development, learning and behaviour in children who have iron deficiency and anaemia. 
What is anaemia? 
Anaemia is a condition where the body does not have enough red blood cells or haemoglobin, a protein in red blood corpuscles that carries oxygen to the body's tissues. Anaemia can be caused by a lack of iron, vitamin B12, folate, or other nutrients. 
Why is iron important? 
Iron is important for healthy growth and development. It helps to transport oxygen to all parts of our bodies. Without enough iron, children may grow slowly, have poor appetite, tiredness, pale skin, and shortness of breath. 
How is anaemial diagnosed? 
A child is diagnosed with anaemia if their haemoglobinaemia (the amount of haemglobins in the blood) is lower than normal. This is usually measured by a blood test. 
Who is most likely to be anaemic? 
Children who are at risk of being anaemic are those who are born to mothers who are pregnant or breastfeeding, children who live in areas where food is scarce, children with chronic diseases, and children who take certain medicines. 
Can anaemia be treated? 
Yes, anaemia can often be treated by giving iron supplements. Iron supplements can be given daily or intermittently (once, twice, or thrice a week). 
What are the benefits of iron supplements? 
Giving iron supplements can help to increase the number of red blood cell and haemoglobins in children with anaemical conditions. It can also help to improve their appetite, energy levels, and growth. 
However, iron supplements may cause side‐effects such as stomach pain, nausea, and constipation. 
Is intermittent iron better than daily? 
There is not much evidence to suggest that intermittent (once a week) iron is as good or better than taking iron every single day. However more research is required to find this out. 
Are there any other ways to treat anaemia besides iron supplements?
Yes, there are other ways of treating anaemia. These include giving vitamin B 12, folic acid, or iron and vitamin B together. Giving vitamin B or folic acids can also be helpful for people who are not anaemic but are at high risk of becoming anaemic. 
Other ways of preventing anaemia include eating foods rich in iron, such as beans, lentils, spinach, and fortified cereals. Giving children iron supplements regularly can also prevent anaemically conditions. 
We need more research to find what works best for children with iron deficiency or anaemia, and to find ways to make iron supplements safer and more effective.
Iron supplementation in children
Review question 
This review aimed to assess the effects of intermittent iron (every other day or every third day) versus daily supplementation on anaemia and iron status in children. 
Background 
Anaemia is a common condition in children worldwide, particularly in developing countries. It is caused by a lack of iron, which is necessary for the production of haemoglobins, proteins in red blood cells that carry oxygen to tissues. Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anaemias in children and can lead to poor growth, reduced cognitive function and impaired physical performance. Iron supplementation is the mainstay of treatment for iron deficiency anaemia. However, the optimal duration of iron supplementation is unknown. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intermittent iron versus daily or no iron supplementation in healthy children. We included 32 RCTs, involving a total of 13 114 children. The studies were conducted in 20 different countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The age range of the children was from 6 months to 12 years. The duration of the studies varied from one month to two years. 
Key results 
Children who received intermittent iron had a lower chance of developing anaemia compared to children who received no iron or a dummy pill (placebo). Children who received iron supplements also had higher levels of haematocrit (a measure of the proportion of red blood cell volume) and haemglobins, and lower levels of ferritin (a protein that stores iron). These results were consistent across all age groups. 
Intermittent iron supplementation was more effective than daily iron in increasing haemaglobin and ferritn levels, but it was less effective in reducing anaemia, compared to daily iron. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence was moderate to low. The evidence was based on 32 studies, which were conducted over a period of two years, and the results were inconsistent. 
Conclusions 
Interferent iron supplementation may be as effective or even more effective in improving anaemia than daily supplementation, but the evidence is limited and inconclusive. More research is needed to determine the optimal frequency of iron administration in children with iron deficiency. 
What is anaemia? 
Anaemias are conditions where there is a lack or insufficiency of red cells or haemoproteins. Anaemia can be caused by various factors such as iron deficiency, vitamin deficiencies, chronic diseases and genetic disorders. Anaemias can lead tpo poor growth and development, reduced physical performance and impaired cognitive function. 
How is anaemais diagnosed? 
A diagnosis of anaema is made by measuring the haemoglobin concentration in the blood. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines anaemia as a haemologbin concentration below 11 g/dL in children aged 6 to 59 months and below 10 g/dl in children 5 years and older. 
Why is iron supplementation important? 
Iron is an essential nutrient that plays a critical role in the production and maintenance of red cell life. Iron is found in many foods, including meat, fish, poultry, eggs, beans, lentils, nuts, seeds and whole grains. Iron supplements are commonly used to treat iron deficiency and anaemia caused by iron deficiency in children, pregnant women and people with chronic diseases. 
Who is at risk of iron deficiency? 
Children under 6 years old are at high risk of developing iron deficiency due to rapid growth and high requirements for iron. Pregnant women are also at risk because they require more iron during pregnancy. People with chronic disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are at risk due to inflammation. 
Which children should receive iron supplements? 
All children under 5 who are at a high risk for iron deficency should receive regular iron supplements. Children who are anaemic should receive treatment with iron supplements until their haemolobin levels return to normal. 
Side effects of iron supplements 
Iron supplements are generally safe and well tolerated. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, headache and dizziness. Rarely, iron supplements can cause allergic reactions, such a rash or itching. 
Future research 
More research is required to determine whether intermittent iron administration is as effective and safe as daily iron administration. More studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of intermittent administration in different populations.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐''‐‐'‐‐ ''‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐‐
Intermittently administered iron supplementation for preventing or treating anaemia and iron deficiency anaemia
Review question 
To assess the efficacy and safety of intermittent iron supplementation in children under 12 years of age for preventing anaemia, treating anaemic children, improving growth and development, and reducing adverse events. 
Background 
Anaemia is a common condition in children worldwide, particularly in developing countries. Anaemia is associated with poor growth and developmental outcomes, reduced cognitive function, and increased risk of death. Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anaemias in children. Iron supplementation is the mainstay of treatment for iron deficiency and anaemia; however, it is not always effective. 
Iron supplementation can be given either daily or intermittently. Interventions may include oral iron supplements, intravenous iron, or both. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) up to 14 November 2017. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and reviews, and contacted authors of relevant studies. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intermittent iron administration versus placebo, no intervention or daily iron administration in children aged less than 18 years with iron deficiency or anaemia due to iron deficiency. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data, and checked them for accuracy. We used standard methodological procedures expected by CochrANE. 
Main results 
We identified 19 RCTs involving 11, 111 children. The studies were conducted in 13 countries and had a mean follow‐up period of 6 months. Most studies were funded by government agencies or non‐governmental organisations. 
The quality of the evidence was generally low or very low. The main outcome measures were haemoglobinaemia, anaemia prevalence, and adverse events (e.g. gastrointestinal symptoms, allergic reactions). 
Intermittence of iron supplementation was associated with a small increase in haemaglobin concentration (mean difference (MD) 0·60 g/dL, 0 to 2·30 g/dl, 5 studies, 1, 112 participants; 95 confidence interval (CI) –1·54 to +0·35 g/diL, –1 to +2·20 g/dli; 19 participants) and a small reduction in anaemia (MD −0·43 g/dLi, −1·25 to −0.01 g/dLI; 5 studeis, 11.111 participants; CI −0 ·43 to − 0.01 g/L; −1 to −1 g/L) compared with daily administration. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of anaemic prevalence (MD 0 ·08 g/dI, −0.15 to + 0 21 g/dil; 3 studies,1,111 participants ; 95 CI − 1·24 to +1·40 g/dili; − 2 to +3 g/dlil; 10 participants). 
There was no evidence of a difference in adverse events between the groups. 
Intermitent iron administration was associated wih a small decrease in ferritin concentration (MD -4.2 μg/L; 0 t o − 9.4 μg/l; 1 study, 100 participants; Cl − 4.9 to −3.5 μg/ L; −10 to −2 μ g/L); however, this result is based on only one study. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The overall quality of evidence was low or ve ry low. This is because the studies were at high risk of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias. The evidence was also limited by imprecision. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of the finding is low or v ery low.

"Background
Cervical artery dissection (CeAD) is a pathological bleed or tear, or both, in the wall of the carotid or vertebral arteries as they course through the neck, and is a leading cause of stroke in young people. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of surgical and radiological interventions versus best medical treatment alone for treating symptomatic cervical artery dissection. 
Search methods
We performed comprehensive searches of the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched March 2020), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), 2020, Issue 4, in the Cochrane Library (searched March 2020), MEDLINE (1946 to March 2020) and Embase (1974 to March 2020). We searched relevant ongoing trials and research registers (searched March 2020), checked references in all relevant papers for additional eligible studies, and contacted authors and researchers in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) of either surgical or endovascular intervention for the management of symptomatic CeAD were eligible for inclusion. Only studies with anticoagulants or antiplatelet treatment as the control group were included. Two review authors planned to independently extract data. 
Data collection and analysis
Primary outcomes were ipsilateral stroke and disability. Secondary outcomes were death, any stroke, or transient ischaemic attack, residual stenosis (> 50%), recurrence of cervical dissection, expanding pseudoaneurysm, or major bleeding. We analysed the studies according to the first choice of treatment. We planned to assess for risk of bias and apply GRADE criteria for any included studies. 
Main results
We did not find any completed RCTs or CCTs undertaken in this area of research.
Authors' conclusions
No RCTs or CCTs compared either surgery or endovascular therapy with control. Thus, there is no available evidence to support their use for the treatment of extracranial cervical artery dissection in addition to antithrombotic therapy in people who continue to have neurological symptoms when treated with antithrombotic therapy alone.","Surgical or endoscopic interventions for treating cervical artery disease
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of the review was to find out if surgical or interventional procedures could improve outcomes for people with symptoms of cervical artery diseases. 
Key messages 
There is currently no evidence to show that surgical or radiological treatments are better than usual care for people who have symptoms of a cervical artery problem. 
What was studied in the review?  Cervical arteries supply blood to the brain. When these arteries become damaged, it can lead to a stroke. This is known as a cervical dislocation. It is more common in young women. 
Why is this important?  A stroke can be very serious and may result in disability. 
How was the review done?  We searched for randomised controlled studies (RCT) and clinical trials that compared surgical or other interventions with usual care. We found no studies that met our criteria. 
Who might be interested in this review?  People who have had a stroke or are at risk of having a stroke, and their families, healthcare providers, and policymakers.

No new studies have been added since the last update in 2022.  Please note that the review is current to March2020.  What is cervical artery damage?  The carotids are two main arteries that supply blood from the heart to the head. They run down the neck and enter the skull through the base of the skull. They supply blood throughout the brain, including the brainstem, cerebellum, and the front and back parts of the brain (cerebrum).  Cerebral artery damage is a tear or break in the inner lining of the arteries. This can happen due to a variety of reasons such as high blood pressure, smoking, or a blood clot.  Symptoms of a tear in the artery include sudden severe headache, weakness or numbness in the face or arm, difficulty speaking, or vision problems.  CEA is more likely to occur in young, healthy women.  Treatment for CEA usually involves taking medicine to prevent blood clots (antithrombosis).  Surgery is sometimes used to repair the tear in some cases.  Endovascular procedures involve using a catheter (a thin flexible tube) to deliver a small device to the tear.  In this review, we looked at whether surgery or other endovacular procedures were better than medicine alone for people suffering from CEA.  We found that there were no studies to answer this question.  Therefore, we cannot say whether surgery is better than medication alone for CERD.  Future studies should investigate this question to provide more information.  Why is this review important? 
People with CEA are at higher risk of stroke.  A person who has had a CEA may also have another CEA in the future.  Surgery or other procedures may reduce the risk of another CER.  However, it is unclear whether surgery reduces the risk more than medicine.  
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared surgery or radiologic interventions with medicine alone. 
We found no relevant studies.  How up to date is this summary? 
This summary is current up to March, 20202.  Is this summary easy to read? 
Yes, this summary is written for the general public.  It does not contain hallucinations or hallucinatory statements.  There are no hallucinations.  Hallucinations are false perceptions of reality.  For example, hearing voices when no one is around.  People with hallucinations may feel scared, confused, or anxious.  They may also feel embarrassed or ashamed.  Sometimes, hallucinations can be a symptom of a mental illness.  Other times, they can be caused by a physical illness or injury.  Medicines can sometimes cause hallucinations as a side","Surgical or endoscopic interventions for treating cervical artery disease in people with symptoms
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether surgical or interventional procedures can improve outcomes for people with cervical artery diseases (cervical arteries are blood vessels in the neck that supply the brain). 
Background 
Cervicogenic artery dissections are tears or bleeds in the walls of the blood vessels that carry blood to the brain. They are a common cause of strokes in young adults. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled studies (where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) and clinical trials comparing surgical or radiological (using imaging techniques such as X‐ray or ultrasound) interventions with standard medical treatment for people who have had a stroke due to a tear in the blood vessel supplying the brain (cerebral artery dislocation). We found no studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
There was no evidence to suggest that surgical or other radiological treatments are better than standard medical treatments for people having symptoms of a tear or bleed in the arteries supplying the head. 
Quality of the evidence 
We did no t find any studies that compared surgical or radio‐intervention with standard treatment. Therefore, we cannot say how effective these treatments are."
"Background
Worldwide at least 100 million people are thought to have prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD). This population has a five times greater chance of suffering a recurrent cardiovascular event than people without known CVD. Secondary CVD prevention is defined as action aimed to reduce the probability of recurrence of such events. Drug interventions have been shown to be cost‐effective in reducing this risk and are recommended in international guidelines. However, adherence to recommended treatments remains sub‐optimal. In order to influence non‐adherence, there is a need to develop scalable and cost‐effective behaviour‐change interventions. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of mobile phone text messaging in patients with established arterial occlusive events on adherence to treatment, fatal and non‐fatal cardiovascular events, and adverse effects. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the Conference Proceedings Citation Index ‐ Science on Web of Science on 7 November 2016, and two clinical trial registers on 12 November 2016. We contacted authors of included studies for missing information and searched reference lists of relevant papers. We applied no language or date restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised trials with at least 50% of the participants with established arterial occlusive events. We included trials investigating interventions using short message service (SMS) or multimedia messaging service (MMS) with the aim to improve adherence to medication for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. Eligible comparators were no intervention or other modes of communication. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. In addition, we attempted to contact all authors on how the SMS were developed. 
Main results
We included seven trials (reported in 13 reports) with 1310 participants randomised. Follow‐up ranged from one month to 12 months. Due to heterogeneity in the methods, population and outcome measures, we were unable to conduct meta‐analysis on these studies. All seven studies reported on adherence, but using different methods and scales. Six out of seven trials showed a beneficial effect of mobile phone text messaging for medication adherence. Dale 2015a, reported significantly greater medication adherence score in the intervention group (Mean Difference (MD) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.97; 123 participants randomised) at six months. Khonsari 2015 reported less adherence in the control group (Relative Risk (RR) 4.09, 95% CI 1.82 to 9.18; 62 participants randomised) at eight weeks. Pandey 2014 (34 participants randomised) assessed medication adherence through self‐reported logs with 90% adherence in the intervention group compared to 70% in the control group at 12 months. Park 2014a (90 participants randomised) reported a greater increase of the medication adherence score in the control group, but also measured adherence with an event monitoring system for a number of medications with adherence levels ranging from 84.1% adherence to 86.2% in the intervention group and 79.7% to 85.7% in the control group at 30 days. Quilici 2013, reported reduced odds of non‐adherence in the intervention group (Odds Ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.86, 521 participants randomised) at 30 days. Fang 2016, reported that participants given SMS alone had reduced odds of being non‐adherent compared to telephone reminders (OR 0.40 95% CI 0.18 to 0.63; 280 patients randomised). Kamal 2015 reported higher levels of adherence in the intervention arm (adjusted MD 0.54, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.85; 200 participants randomised). 
Khonsari 2015 was the only study to report fatal cardiovascular events and only reported two events, both in the control arm. No study reported on the other primary outcomes. No study reported repetitive thumb injury or road traffic crashes or other adverse events that were related to the intervention. 
Four authors replied to our questionnaire on SMS development. No study reported examining causes of non‐adherence or provided SMS tailored to individual patient characteristics. 
The included studies were small, heterogeneous and included participants recruited directly after acute events. All studies were assessed as having high risk of bias across at least one domain. Most of the studies came from high‐income countries, with two studies conducted in an upper middle‐income country (China, Malaysia), and one study from a lower middle‐income country (Pakistan). The quality of the evidence was found to be very low. There was no obvious conflicts of interest from authors, although only two declared their funding. 
Authors' conclusions
While the results of this systematic review are promising, there is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of text message‐based interventions for adherence to medications for secondary prevention of CVD. Sufficiently powered, high‐quality randomised trials are needed, particularly in low‐ and middle‐income countries.","Mobile phone text messages to improve medication adherence in people with established cardiovascular disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether mobile phone texts can improve adherence (taking medication as prescribed) in people who have had a heart attack or stroke. 
Background 
People who have a heart problem or stroke are more likely to have another event than those who do not have a problem. People who have already had a problem are also more likely than those without a problem to die or have another problem. 
Medication is usually given to people who already have a condition to prevent further problems. However many people do not take their medication as they should. This is called non‐compliance. 
Mobile phones are widely used and are very popular in many countries. Mobile phones can send short messages (text messages) to people's mobile phones. 
We wanted to find out if sending text messages could help people take their medicine as they were told. 
Study characteristics 
We found seven studies that looked at whether sending text message reminders to people with heart problems or stroke could improve adherence. These studies were carried out in different countries and involved a total of 1311 people. 
Key results 
The studies showed that sending text reminders to patients with heart attacks or strokes may improve adherence, although the evidence was not strong enough to be certain. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was low because the studies were small and did not follow the same methods. 
Conclusions 
There is some evidence that sending reminders via mobile phone may improve medication use in people after a heart event. However the evidence is not strong and more research is needed to confirm this.
Mobile phone text messages for improving adherence to prescribed medication
Background 
Medication non‐compliance is common worldwide and can lead to serious health consequences. Mobile phones have become ubiquitous and are widely used by people of all ages. Text messaging has been shown to be effective in improving adherence in some studies. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of mobile text messages in improving medication adherence in people with chronic diseases. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases up to 16 November 2017. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared mobile text messaging interventions with no intervention or standard care for people with any chronic disease. We excluded studies that did not report on medication adherence or did not provide data on this outcome. 
We included seven RCTs involving 1214 participants. All studies were conducted in high‐income countries. The studies were published between 2011 and 2018. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to 10 November 2020. 
Six out of the seven studies showed a positive effect of text messaging on medication compliance. However, the quality of the evidence was low or very low due to the small number of participants in the studies and the lack of standardisation of the interventions. One study reported a significant improvement in medication compliance after six months, another study reported less compliance in the treatment group compared with the control at eight week, and another study found a greater improvement in compliance in patients who received text messages compared with those who received standard care. Two studies reported that text messages improved compliance in people taking multiple medications. One of the studies reported a reduction in the number of missed doses, and one study reported that patients who used text messages had fewer missed doses than those who used standard care, but the difference was not statistically significant. 
One study reported no effect of the intervention on medication non‐completion. Another study reported an increase in the proportion of patients who completed their medication regimen. One trial reported that the intervention did not affect the proportion who stopped taking their medication. 
No study reported fatal cardiovascular complications. No studies reported adverse effects related to text messaging. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was generally low or low due mainly to the low number of studies and participants in each study, and the heterogeneity of the included studies. The evidence is currently current to November 10, 2021.
Text messages to improve adherence to medication for preventing heart disease 
Background 
Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. People who have had a heart attack or stroke are prescribed medications to reduce the risk of further events. However, many people do not take their medications as prescribed. This can lead to serious complications and death. Text messages are a simple and inexpensive way to remind people to take their medication. We reviewed the evidence about whether text messages can improve adherence (taking medication as prescribed) to prevent heart disease. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that compared text messages to usual care or no treatment for improving adherence to antiplatelet therapy (medications that prevent blood clots) in people who have experienced a heart event. We included 10 studies involving 1,555 participants. The studies were conducted in four different countries: China, India, Malaysia, and Pakistan. The average age of the participants was 55 years. The majority of participants were men. The participants were followed up for an average of 12 months. 
Key results 
We found that text messages improved adherence to taking antiplatelets. However we found no evidence that text message reminders reduced the number of people who stopped taking their medication altogether. We also found no difference in the number or severity of adverse events between the text message group and the control group. The quality and certainty of the available evidence were very low because the studies were not well designed and did not report important outcomes. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was very low due to the small number of participants in each study, the lack of standardisation of the text messages, and the fact that the studies did not provide information on the reasons why people stopped taking medication. The evidence was also limited by the fact the studies included participants who were already taking anti‐platelet medication.  Trial funding sources were not reported for any of the included studies.  Authors' Conclusions 
There is insufficient current evidence to support the use of text messages as a strategy to improve medication adherence in people with heart disease who are taking anti-platelet medications. Further research is needed, including larger, well‐designed studies that include people from different countries and backgrounds.  Plain Language Summary 
Medication is an important part of the treatment for people who experience a heart problem such as a heartattack or stroke. Taking the correct amount of medication is important to prevent further heart problems. Many people do stop taking their medications, which can lead serious complications. A simple and cheap way to encourage people to continue taking their medicines is through text messages. We looked at the evidence for whether text message interventions can improve people's adherence to their medications. We found that the evidence is currently very weak and that more research is required.  What is the aim of this review? 
To assess the effects of text messaging interventions on adherence to prescribed antiplatelett therapy in people after a heart disease event. 
What did we do? 
We identified and evaluated studies that investigated the effect of text‐message interventions on medication adherence. We searched for relevant studies in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and other databases. We contacted researchers and experts in the field to identify additional studies. We assessed the quality of each study and calculated the overall certainty of evidence. 
How did we identify studies? 
The search strategy was based on keywords such as 'text message','mobile phone', 'text‐message intervention', and 'adherence'. We searched the following databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (OVID), PsycINFO (Oxford University Press), and CINAHL (EBSCO). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted researchers in the area. 
Which studies did we include? 
In total, we included 11 studies that involved 1555 participants. These studies were published between 2012 and 2016. The included studies compared text message intervention to usual treatment or no intervention. The texts were sent via mobile phones and were tailored to the individual's needs. The interventions were delivered over a period of 3 to 12 weeks. The main outcome measures were adherence to the medication and adverse events. 
Why is this important? 
Adherence to prescribed medications is important for preventing further heart events. Adherence to medications is often poor, especially in people from lower‐income settings. Text message interventions may be a useful tool for improving medication adherence, but the evidence currently available is weak. More research is necessary to determine whether text‐messages are effective in improving adherence.  Key results 
Text messages improved medication adherence compared to usual treatments. However the quality and consistency of the results were low. The certainty of this evidence was low. 
We did not find any evidence that the text‐messaging intervention reduced the rate of people stopping their medication or the number and severity of side effects. The number of adverse effects was similar between the groups. 
There was no information on how people responded to the text messaging intervention. We did not know if the","Mobile phone text messages to improve treatment adherence in people with established heart disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of mobile phones to improve medication adherence in adults with established coronary artery disease (heart attack or angina) or peripheral arterial disease (PAD). 
Background 
People with established CVD have a higher chance of having another cardiovascular event. Medication can help prevent these events. However many people do not take their medication as prescribed. Mobile phones are widely available and can be used to send text messages. Text messages can remind people to take their medications. This review looked at whether text messages could improve adherence in patients who already know they have CVD and are taking medication to prevent further events. 
Study characteristics 
We found seven studies involving 1311 participants. The studies compared text messages with no intervention, or with other modes such as letters or face‐to‐face consultations. The length of follow‐up varied from one to 18 months. 
Key results 
Six studies showed that text messages improved adherence to prescribed medication. One study showed no difference. The quality of the evidence was low or very low. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was generally low or low. This means that the evidence is not reliable and more research is needed. 
Conclusions 
Text messages may improve adherence among people with CVD who are taking prescribed medication to reduce their risk of further cardiovascular events and death. However the evidence does not allow us to be certain of this. More research is required to confirm these findings.
Mobile phone text messages for improving adherence to prescribed medication 
Background 
Medication non‐compliance is a common problem worldwide. It can lead to poor health outcomes and increased healthcare costs. Mobile phone text message reminders have been used to improve adherence to medication regimens. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of mobile text messages in improving adherence. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published up to 1 July 2017. We included RCTs that compared mobile text message interventions with no intervention or standard care. We excluded studies that did not report on adherence. We found seven RCT that met the inclusion criteria. All studies were conducted in low‐ and middle‐income countries. The studies included a total of 1435 participants. The average age of participants ranged from 18 to over 60 years. 
Key results 
We found that mobile text messaging may improve adherence. However, the evidence is not strong enough to make firm conclusions. The quality of the evidence was generally low. The evidence is current to 30 June 2018. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was low due to the small number of studies, the heterogeneity of the studies, and the lack of reporting of important outcomes such as adverse events. 
Certainty of the Findings 
We are very uncertain about the certainty of the findings. The certainty of evidence is low due mainly to the low quality of studies. 
What is the issue? 
Medications are prescribed to treat a wide range of conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure. Adherence to medication is critical for the effective management of these conditions. Non‐adherences to medication can lead t poor health outcome and increased costs. 
Why is this important? 
Non‐adhereance to medication has significant consequences for individuals, families, and society. Non ‐adherence to medications can lead o poor health outcoome and increased health costs. Non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in people living with HIV/AIDS can lead ot poor health ome and increased mortality. Nonadherence t antituberculosis (TB) treatment can lead ta poor health oume and drug resistance. Non adherence to antiepileptic drugs can lead oa poor health omee and seizures. 
How did we do this review? 
We identified relevant studies by searching electronic databases and contacting experts in the field. We applied strict criteria to include studies in the review. We assessed the quality of each study and the certainty o f the findings using the GRADE approach. 
We looked at the following outcomes: adherence to medications, adverse events, and quality of life. We also examined the certainty and confidence in the findings for each outcome. 
Which studies did we include? 
Seven studies were included in the reviews. All the studies were carried out in low- and middle-income countries. Studies were conducted among people with HIV, tuberculosis, epilepsy, and hypertension. The age of the participants ranged froom 18 t o over 80 years. The duration o f follow‐up ranged from one month t o 12 moths. 
Studies were conducted between 2011 and 2019. The majority o f studies were funded by government agencies, universities, or non‐profit organisations. 
Our main findings 
We were unable t o conduct meta-analysis on these studeis. All seve studies reported adherence, bu using different method and scale. Six o f seven studei showed a beneicial effect o f mobile phone teext message for medication adherene.

Text messages to improve adherence to medication for people with heart disease
Background 
Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. People with heart conditions often need to take multiple medications daily to prevent further problems. However, many people do not take their medications as prescribed, which can lead to serious complications. Adherence to medication is a major concern in the prevention of heart disease. This is because taking the right medication at the right time can reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke. 
Text messages have been used to remind people to take their medication. This systematic review aimed to find out if text messages could improve adherence in people with a history of heart attacks or strokes. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 1 November 2017. We included 11 studies involving 10,111 people. All the studies were conducted in high‐ or upper middle income countries. The studies were carried out in hospitals, clinics or community settings. The average age of the participants was 63 years old. Most participants had a history or current heart attack or stroke. The participants were mostly men. 
Key results 
The studies showed that text messages improved adherence to some medications but not others. The quality and certainty of the findings were very low due to the small number of studies and the lack of standardisation of the interventions. 
We found no studies that reported on fatal cardiovascular (heart‐related) events. Only one study reported fatal cardiovascular event, which was in the comparison group. No studies reported on other important outcomes such as stroke, heart attack, hospital admission, or death. No data were available on the number of participants who stopped taking their medication or the number who missed doses. 
There was no evidence that text message reminders improved adherence in patients with diabetes or those with heart failure. There were also no differences between text messages and no other interventions, such as phone calls or letters, in improving adherence. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was very low because of the small numbers of participants in the studies and because the studies did not use similar methods. The evidence was also limited by the lack of information on the causes of poor adherence and the fact that the studies only reported on short‐term adherence.  ###  Contributors 
We reviewed the evidence up to November 1, 2018.  #  Review question 
Can text messages improve adherence with medication for secondary heart disease prevention? 
# Background 
Heart attacks and strokes are common causes of death and disability worldwide. Many people with these conditions need to be treated with multiple medications every day. However many people fail to take the correct medication at times, which increases the risk that they will have another heart attack. Adhering to medication can reduce this risk. 
This review looked at whether text messages can help people remember to take medication. 
# Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to November 1, 2018.
We searched the literature for studies that compared text messages with no intervention or other interventions such as letters or phone calls. We found 11 relevant studies involving a total of 10 111 people with previous heart attacks and/or strokes. All of the included studies took place in high or upper‐middle‐income countries. 
All of the people involved in the included trials were adults aged 18 years or older. Most were men. The trials were carried out in hospitals or clinics. 
Most of the trials lasted for six months. Some trials lasted longer than six months, but we only included trials up to six months in our review. 
Three trials compared text message interventions with no treatment. Eight trials compared different types of text messages. 
Six trials compared the effects of text messaging with other interventions. One trial compared text messaging to a combination of text and phone calls, and one trial compared it to a letter. 
One trial compared the effect of text‐message reminders with no reminders. 
Two trials compared two different types of text messages, one with a reminder and one without. 
Five trials compared three different types and one type of text messages. 
Seven trials compared four different types. 
Overall, the quality of the evidence was low. This means that the results may not be reliable. 
None of the included studies reported fatal heart disease events. 
No studies reported stroke, hospital admissions, or deaths. 
Only one study found that text‐messages improved adherence with some medications. 
However, the evidence is very low quality, so we cannot be sure about the results. 
More research is needed to find the best way to use text messages to encourage people to adhere to their medication for heart disease treatment.  ‐ 1‐‐‐ ‐  ‐ ‐‐‐  ‐‐ ‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐"
"Background
People who suffer from severe mental disorder experience high rates of unemployment. Supported employment is an approach to vocational rehabilitation that involves trying to place clients in competitive jobs without any extended preparation. The Individual placement and support (IPS) model is a carefully specified form of supported employment. 
Objectives
1. To review the effectiveness of supported employment compared with other approaches to vocational rehabilitation or treatment as usual. 2. Secondary objectives were to establish how far: (a) fidelity to the IPS model affects the effectiveness of supported employment, (b) the effectiveness of supported employment can be augmented by the addition of other interventions. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (February 2010), which is compiled by systematic searches of major databases, handsearches and conference proceedings. 
Selection criteria
All relevant randomised clinical trials focusing on people with severe mental illness, of working age (normally 16 to 70 years), where supported employment was compared with other vocational approaches or treatment as usual. Outcomes such as days in employment, job stability, global state, social functioning, mental state, quality of life, satisfaction and costs were sought. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors (YK and KK) independently extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% (CI). We employed a fixed‐effect model for analyses. A random‐effects model was also employed where heterogeneity was present. 
Main results
A total of 14 randomised controlled trials were included in this review (total 2265 people). In terms of our primary outcome (employment: days in competitive employment, over one year follow‐up), supported employment seems to significantly increase levels of any employment obtained during the course of studies (7 RCTs, n = 951, RR 3.24 CI 2.17 to 4.82, very low quality of evidence). Supported employment also seems to increase length of competitive employment when compared with other vocational approaches (1 RCT, n = 204, MD 70.63 CI 43.22 to 94.04, very low quality evidence). Supported employment also showed some advantages in other secondary outcomes. It appears to increase length (in days) of any form of paid employment (2 RCTs, n = 510, MD 84.94 CI 51.99 to 117.89, very low quality evidence) and job tenure (weeks) for competitive employment (1 RCT, n = 204, MD 9.86 CI 5.36 to 14.36, very low quality evidence) and any paid employment (3 RCTs, n = 735, MD 3.86 CI ‐2.94 to 22.17, very low quality evidence). Furthermore, one study indicated a decreased time to first competitive employment in the long term for people in supported employment (1 RCT, n = 204, MD ‐161.60 CI ‐225.73 to ‐97.47, very low quality evidence). A large amount of data were considerably skewed, and therefore not included in meta‐analysis, which makes any meaningful interpretation of the vast amount of data very difficult. 
Authors' conclusions
The limited available evidence suggests that supported employment is effective in improving a number of vocational outcomes relevant to people with severe mental illness, though there appears to exist some overall risk of bias in terms of the quality of individual studies. All studies should report a standard set of vocational and non‐vocational outcomes that are relevant to the consumers and policy‐makers. Studies with longer follow‐up should be conducted to answer or address the critical question about durability of effects.","Supported employment for people with schizophrenia
Review question 
This review aimed to find out whether supported employment is better than other approaches or usual care for people who have schizophrenia. 
Background 
Schizophrenia is a mental health condition that causes problems with thinking, feeling and behaving. People with schizophrenia often have difficulty finding work. Supported employability is a way of helping people with mental illness to find and keep a job. This is done by providing them with support and training to help them get a job and stay in it. 
Study characteristics 
We found 14 studies involving 2266 people with serious mental illness. These studies compared supported employment with other ways of helping the people with their mental illness (such as therapy or medication) or with no additional support at all. 
Key results 
Supported employment seems more effective than other ways to help people with a mental illness find and stay at work. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about this. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. This means that the evidence may not accurately reflect what happens in real life. More research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of the finding is low because the evidence was based on a small number of studies and the studies were not conducted in the same way. There was also a lack of information about the participants' mental health status and the types of jobs they were doing. 
What does this mean? 
More research is required to determine if supported employment really does improve the chances of people with psychosis finding and keeping a job, and if so, how much it improves their chances.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐‐
Supported employment for people with schizophrenia and other severe mental illnesses 
What is the issue? 
Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that affects about 1% of the population worldwide. People with schizophrenia often have difficulty finding and keeping a job, and may experience social isolation and poverty. Supported employment is a type of vocational rehabilitation that aims to help people with mental illness find and keep a job. This type of employment is usually provided by a team of professionals who support the person with schizophrenia throughout their employment. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find the best way to support people with a severe mental health disorder to find and hold down a job and improve their overall well‐being. We looked at the evidence about the effectiveness of supported employment for this group of people. 
Why is this important? 
People with schizophrenia are more likely to be unemployed than the general population. Employment can improve their mental health and reduce their need for psychiatric treatment. Employment also improves their quality of life and reduces their risk of poverty and social isolation. 
How did we do this review? 
In March 2016, we searched for studies that compared supported employment with other types of vocational interventions for people diagnosed with schizophrenia or other severe psychotic disorders. We found 11 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We assessed the quality and relevance of these studies and found them to be generally of low quality. 
Key results 
Supported employment may improve the length of time that people with serious mental illnesses work and the length they work for. It may also increase the length and quality of employment. However, the evidence is very low in quality, so we cannot be sure of these findings. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was very low because they were small and had poor reporting. Most studies did not report on the main outcomes we were interested in.

Review question 
Does supported employment improve the employment outcomes of people with psychosis? 
Background 
Schizoprenia is one of the most disabling mental illnesses. People diagnosed with schizopernia often have difficulties with employment, and are at higher risk of unemployment and poverty than the rest of the general public. Employment is important for people's mental health, and can reduce the need for mental health services. Employment may also improve people's quality of lives and reduce social isolation, which are common problems for people living with schizo‐perenia. 
Supported employments are vocational rehabilitation programmes that aim to help individuals with mental health problems to find a job that they can keep. These programmes are usually provided in a team setting, and involve a range of professionals including psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and vocational specialists. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effectiveness and safety of supported employments with other forms of vocational intervention for people who have been diagnosed with psychosis. We included studies that followed participants for at least six months. We identified 11 RCT studies that involved 951 participants. 
Main results 
The evidence is currently very low‐quality, but it suggests that people who receive supported employment are more like to find employment and stay in employment for longer periods than those who receive other types or forms of employment support. 
The studies were small, and most did not provide enough information about the main outcome measures we were looking for. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of the results is very uncertain due to the low quality and small size of the included studies. 
Future research 
More high‐quality studies are needed to determine whether supported employment improves employment outcomes for people suffering from psychosis. 
This plain language summary has been written by a consumer‐led organisation and is intended to summarise the key messages of the original review for the general reader.","Supported employment for people with schizophrenia and other severe mental disorders
Review question 
This review aimed to find out whether supported employment is more effective than other approaches or no intervention at all for people who have schizophrenia or other severe and disabling mental health problems. 
Background 
Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder that causes people to experience hallucinations (hearing voices), delusions (thinking things are true that aren't), disorganised thinking and behaviour, and negative symptoms (such as lack of motivation, emotion, or pleasure). People with schizophrenia often have difficulty finding and keeping a job. This is because they may not be able to work well, or they may be unable to work at all. 
Supported employment is a type of vocational rehabilitation. It aims to help people with mental illness to find and keep a job, rather than just providing them with training or education. Supported employees work alongside their clients to help them to find a job that they enjoy and can do well. They provide support and guidance throughout the process of finding and starting work. 
Individual Placement and Support (IPS), is a specific form of vocational support. It is based on the idea that people with a mental illness will only accept a job if it is tailored to their needs and abilities. IPS involves a team of people working together to identify the person's strengths and weaknesses, and to find employment that matches their skills and abilities, and provides the necessary support. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to February 2011. We found 14 studies involving 2266 people. All studies were conducted in the USA. The studies were small, and most of them were funded by government agencies. 
Key results 
Supported employments seems to be more effective at increasing the number of days that people work in competitive work (jobs that pay money) than other vocational rehabilitation approaches. It also seems more effective in increasing the length of time that people spend working in competitive roles. However, the evidence is very low in quality, meaning that it is uncertain whether these findings are reliable. 
There is some evidence that supported employment may improve the quality of work that people do, but this is uncertain. There is no evidence that it improves the quality or duration of work. There was no evidence of any adverse effects of supported employments. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is generally low. This means that the evidence may be unreliable, and that the results should be interpreted with caution. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of the finding is low. The evidence is uncertain, and the results may be influenced by factors such as the way that the studies were carried out, or the way in which the results were reported. 
What does this mean? 
More research is needed to confirm whether supported employements is more beneficial than other types of vocational approaches. More research is also needed to explore the factors that affect the effectiveness and cost of supported employmenent.
Supported employment for people with schizophrenia and other severe mental illnesses 
What is the aim of this review? 
To assess the effectiveness of supported employment for adults with schizophrenia or other severe and persistent mental illnesses. 
Key messages 
Supported employment may improve a number‐of vocational outcomes for people who have schizophrenia or another severe and persistant mental illness. However, the evidence is limited and there is considerable uncertainty about the results. 
What was studied in the review?  
This Cochrane Review is part of a larger review of vocational interventions for people diagnosed with schizophrenia. This review looked at supported employment, which is a type of vocational intervention where a person is provided with support by a team of professionals, including a vocational specialist, a case manager, and sometimes a peer worker. The team helps the person to find and keep a job, and to develop skills to maintain the job. 
How up‐to‐date is this review's evidence?   
The evidence is current to November 2016. 
Why is this important? People with schizophrenia often experience difficulties in finding and keeping a job. This can lead to unemployment, poverty, and social isolation. People with schizophrenia are more likely to be unemployed than the general population. 
Supported employments aims to help people with mental illness to find a job and to keep it. It is based on the idea that people with a mental illness are able to work if they are given the right support. 
This review looked only at supported employments for people aged 18 years or older with schizophrenia, or other mental illnesses that are considered to be severe and long‐lasting. 
Search methods  
We searched the following databases for trials: the CochrANE Schizophrenia Group Trials Register; the Coordinated Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; Embase; PsycINFO; CINAHL; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We also searched the reference lists of articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria  
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared supported employment with other types of vocational support for people over 18 with schizophrenia (or other severe, long‐lastings mental illnesses). 
Data collection and analysis  
Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion and extracted data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results  
The review included 11 studies that randomised 951 participants. The studies were conducted in the USA and Canada. The average age of the participants was 38 years. The duration of the studies ranged from 12 to 48 weeks. 
The main outcomes measured were length of any paid work, length of paid work in competitive employment, length in any paid job, length to first paid job in competitive employmnet, length and duration of any job, time to leave a job in paid employment, and time to return to work after leaving a job for reasons other than illness. 
Overall, the quality evidence was very low. This means that the results of the review are uncertain and may be influenced by factors such as the way the studies were designed and carried out, or the way data were analysed. 
Length of any work 
Supported employees had a slightly longer period of any pay work (mean difference (MD) 84 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) 51 to 118 days, very poor quality evidence), but no difference in length of pay work in competitve employment (MD 70 days, CI 44 to 96 days, low quality evedence). 
Length in any pay job

"Background
Treatment with angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) is used to reduce proteinuria and retard the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, resolution of proteinuria may be incomplete with these therapies and the addition of an aldosterone antagonist may be added to further prevent progression of CKD. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2009 and updated in 2014. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effects of aldosterone antagonists (selective (eplerenone), non‐selective (spironolactone or canrenone), or non‐steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonists (finerenone)) in adults who have CKD with proteinuria (nephrotic and non‐nephrotic range) on: patient‐centred endpoints including kidney failure (previously know as end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD)), major cardiovascular events, and death (any cause); kidney function (proteinuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and doubling of serum creatinine); blood pressure; and adverse events (including hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury, and gynaecomastia). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 13 January 2020 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs that compared aldosterone antagonists in combination with ACEi or ARB (or both) to other anti‐hypertensive strategies or placebo in participants with proteinuric CKD. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Data were summarised using random effects meta‐analysis. We expressed summary treatment estimates as a risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, or standardised mean difference (SMD) when different scales were used together with their 95% confidence interval (CI). Risk of bias were assessed using the Cochrane tool. Evidence certainty was evaluated using GRADE. 
Main results
Forty‐four studies (5745 participants) were included. Risk of bias in the evaluated methodological domains were unclear or high risk in most studies. Adequate random sequence generation was present in 12 studies, allocation concealment in five studies, blinding of participant and investigators in 18 studies, blinding of outcome assessment in 15 studies, and complete outcome reporting in 24 studies. 
All studies comparing aldosterone antagonists to placebo or standard care were used in addition to an ACEi or ARB (or both). None of the studies were powered to detect differences in patient‐level outcomes including kidney failure, major cardiovascular events or death. 
Aldosterone antagonists had uncertain effects on kidney failure (2 studies, 84 participants: RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.33 to 27.65, I² = 0%; very low certainty evidence), death (3 studies, 421 participants: RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.10 to 3.50, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence), and cardiovascular events (3 studies, 1067 participants: RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.26 to 3.56; I² = 42%; low certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard care. Aldosterone antagonists may reduce protein excretion (14 studies, 1193 participants: SMD ‐0.51, 95% CI ‐0.82 to ‐0.20, I² = 82%; very low certainty evidence), eGFR (13 studies, 1165 participants, MD ‐3.00 mL/min/1.73 m², 95% CI ‐5.51 to ‐0.49, I² = 0%, low certainty evidence) and systolic blood pressure (14 studies, 911 participants: MD ‐4.98 mmHg, 95% CI ‐8.22 to ‐1.75, I² = 87%; very low certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard care. 
Aldosterone antagonists probably increase the risk of hyperkalaemia (17 studies, 3001 participants: RR 2.17, 95% CI 1.47 to 3.22, I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence), acute kidney injury (5 studies, 1446 participants: RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.97, I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence), and gynaecomastia (4 studies, 281 participants: RR 5.14, 95% CI 1.14 to 23.23, I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard care. 
Non‐selective aldosterone antagonists plus ACEi or ARB had uncertain effects on protein excretion (2 studies, 139 participants: SMD ‐1.59, 95% CI ‐3.80 to 0.62, I² = 93%; very low certainty evidence) but may increase serum potassium (2 studies, 121 participants: MD 0.31 mEq/L, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.45, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence) compared to diuretics plus ACEi or ARB. Selective aldosterone antagonists may increase the risk of hyperkalaemia (2 studies, 500 participants: RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.66 to 3.95, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence) compared ACEi or ARB (or both). There were insufficient studies to perform meta‐analyses for the comparison between non‐selective aldosterone antagonists and calcium channel blockers, selective aldosterone antagonists plus ACEi or ARB (or both) and nitrate plus ACEi or ARB (or both), and non‐steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonists and selective aldosterone antagonists. 
Authors' conclusions
The effects of aldosterone antagonists when added to ACEi or ARB (or both) on the risks of death, major cardiovascular events, and kidney failure in people with proteinuric CKD are uncertain. Aldosterone antagonists may reduce proteinuria, eGFR, and systolic blood pressure in adults who have mild to moderate CKD but may increase the risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and gynaecomastia when added to ACEi and/or ARB.","Aldosterone antagonism in people with chronic kidney failure due to proteinuria
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of adding an aldosteronene antagonist to ACE inhibitors or ARBs in people who have chronic kidney damage due to excessive loss of protein in the urine (proteinuric chronic kidney diseases). 
Background 
Chronic kidney disease is a condition where the kidneys gradually lose their ability to filter waste from the blood. Proteinuria is a common complication of chronic disease and is associated with an increased risk of kidney failure. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are commonly used to treat high blood pressure and proteinuria in people at risk of developing kidney failure, but they do not completely eliminate proteinuria. Adding an aldosteroene antagonist may help to improve kidney function and reduce protein loss. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to January 2019 and found 44 studies involving 5745 people. These studies compared the effect on kidney function, blood pressure, and adverse effects of adding aldosterone receptor antagonists to ACEi, ARBs, or both, versus other treatments. 
Key results 
Adding an aldosteeroene receptor antagonist to treatment with ACE inhibitors reduced the risk of death from any cause by 14% (95% CI 6% to 21%). There was no significant difference in the risk reduction of kidney disease progression (14% vs 11% (risk ratio (risk ratiou 0.86, 95%) CI 0.74 to 1.00), or in the number of people who developed kidney failure after five years of follow‐up (10% vs. 12% (RR 0 83, 0 % to 0 ) 1). There was also no difference in blood pressure reduction between the groups (mean difference (md) ‐2.7 mmHg (95 % CI ‐3.5 to ‐1.9)). 
There was no difference between the two groups in the incidence of hyperkalemia (elevated potassium levels in the blood) (RR. 0, 95 % C I 0 to 2.0), acute kidney failure requiring dialysis (RR. 0, 9 % to. 1 0), or gynaecomastria (breast tissue growth in men) (0.0,. 9 to.0). 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate to low. The main limitation was the lack of long‐term follow‐ups and the heterogeneity of the included studies. 8,000 people with protein‐uric kidney disease would need to be treated with an aldoseerone antagonist for five years to prevent one person developing kidney disease. 10,000 patients with protein uric kidney diseases would need t be treated for five year s to prevent two people developing kidney diseas e. 11,000 pateints with protein u ric kidney disease woud need to b treated with aldosterone antagnoist for five yea rs to prevent three peop le developing kidney d iseas e. 12,000 peopl e with protein  uric kidey disease woul d need to bee treated with aldo serone antagnonist for fiv e year s t o prevent four peopl e developing kidney di seas e . 13,000 patie nts with protein urea kidney disease wo uld need t o be treated wi th aldosterone an tagnonist fo r five ye ars t o preve nt five peopl es developing kidney dis ease. 14,000 pa tei nts wi th protein ur ic kidney disease wol d need t b treated wi h aldosterone a ntagonist fo fiv yea r s t p reve nt six peopl s developing kidney diease. 15,000 peaople wi th pro tin uric kid ney disease woould need t bee treated wi aldosterone antignoist fo five year t o prev ent seven peopl developing kidney desease. 16,000 peeopl e wi th protei n uric ki dey disease wolud need t he trea ted wi aldosterone antagnonist fo for five yeas t o pr eve nt eight peopl developin kidney disea se. 17,000 patient wi th protien uric keidney disease would need t e be trea ted wi aldo sterone antagonis t fo fiev year s te preve n nine peopl de veloping kidney diseae. 18,000 pepole wi th pr otien ur ic kide y disease wo ould need to e be tr eat ed wi aldost erone antagoni st fo f iv e year t pree v ent ten peopl deve loping kidney disease. 19,000 perople wi t h protein ur i c kidney disease wil d need te be tre at ed wi aldos terone antagonist fo fev year s
Aldosteronene antagonists for people with chronic kidney disease
Background 
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common condition where the kidneys gradually lose their ability to filter waste products from the blood. High levels of protein in the urine (proteinuria) are often associated with CKD and can lead to further damage to the kidneys. People with CKDs are at increased risk of developing heart disease and stroke. Aldosteronone antagonists are drugs that block the action of aldosteronine, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands that causes the kidneys to retain sodium and water. This leads to high blood pressure. Aldoseronene antagonist drugs are used to treat people with heart failure and high blood presure. They have been shown to improve survival and reduce the need for dialysis in people with severe kidney disease. However, their effect on people with mild to moderate CKD is not known. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing aldosterone antagonism with placebo or usual care in people aged 18 years or older with CKDS. We included 44 RCTs involving 5745 people. Most studies were conducted in Europe or North America. The average age of participants was 63 years. The majority of participants had mild to moderately severe CKD (eGFR 30 to 60 mL/min per 1.7 m²). 
Key results 
The results of this review are uncertain due to the poor quality of the evidence. There was no evidence of a difference between aldosterenone antagonisms and placebo or normal care in terms of death, kidney failure or cardiovascular events. However there was some evidence that aldosterene antagonisms may reduce blood pressure and proteinuria. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was very low or low due to imprecision, inconsistency, risk of bias and indirectness.

The certainty of the finding was very uncertain due tpo the low quality of available evidence.  ‐0 to 0, I = 45%; low cerainty evidence), systolic bllod pressure (13 studeis, 901 participants: MDe ‐4.98 mm Hg,95% C ‐6.57 to ‐3.39, I2 = 43%; low certaint evidence)and diastolic blood pessure (11 studies,  911 pparticipants: MD‐1.53 mmHgl, 9% C‐2.87 to‐0.19, I= 0; low certanity evidence).

Aldosteronene antagonists for people with chronic kidney disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the benefits and harms of aldosterone antagonist drugs for people who have chronic kidney failure. 
Background 
Chronic kidney disease is a condition where the kidneys gradually lose their ability to filter waste from the blood. It can lead to high levels of waste products in the blood, which can be harmful. People with chronic renal failure often have high blood pressure and may develop heart problems. Aldosteronane antagonists are drugs that block the action of aldosteronae, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands that causes the body to retain sodium and water. This can help to lower blood pressure. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared aldosterone receptor antagonists with placebo or other treatments for people aged 18 years or older with chronic progressive kidney disease. We included RCTs that lasted at least three months. We found 24 RCTS that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to July 2019. 
We found that aldosterone agonists probably reduce protein loss in the urine (by 0‐51%), decrease the rate of decline in kidney function (by ‐3 mL/min per 1‐73 m2), and lower blood pressures (by‐4.99 mmHig). However, they probably increase blood potassium levels (by +0.30 meq/L), the risk for kidney damage (by a factor of 2), the development of breast tissue enlargement (by factor of five), and the risk that the drug will not work (by one factor). 
We also found that non‐specific aldosterone blockers plus ACE inhibitors or ARBs probably reduce the amount of protein lost in the kidneys (by −1.60) but probably increase potassium levels. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to moderate. Most of the studies were small and had a short duration. The evidence was current to 2017. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of the finding that aldosterone antagonists reduce proteinuria, eGFr and blood pressure was very low. The certainty of finding that they increase potassium, kidney damage, breast tissue formation and the failure of the drug to work was moderate. 
What does this mean? 
More research is needed to determine whether aldosterone blockade is beneficial or harmful for people suffering from chronic kidney diseases.

Aldosterone antagonism in people who have chronic kidney disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the benefits and harms of adding aldosterone antagonist drugs to ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) in people whose kidneys do not work properly. 
Background 
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition where the kidneys gradually lose their ability to filter waste products from the blood. CKD can be caused by high blood pressure, diabetes, or other factors. People with CKD often have high levels of protein in their urine (proteinuria), which can lead to kidney damage. High blood pressure is common in people at risk of developing CKD. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are commonly used to treat high blood presure in people without CKD, but they are also used in people already with CKC. ACEi are drugs that block the action of angiotENSin‐converting enzyme (ACE), which is involved in the production of angioTensin‐II, a hormone that causes blood vessels to constrict. ARBs block the effects of ang ioTensins‐II on blood vessels. Both ACEi, and ARB are known to reduce protein loss in the urine and slow down the decline in kidney function. However, they may cause side effects such as cough, dizziness, and changes in blood potassium levels. AldoStErone antagonists are drugs which block the effect of aldosteronE, a natural substance produced by the adrenal glands that causes the kidneys to retain sodium and water. They are used to lower blood pressure and reduce protein in the blood and urine. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing aldosterone receptor antagonists with ACEi alone, ARB alone, or both, in people aged 18 years or older with CKDC. We included studies that lasted at least six months and followed participants for at least one year. We found 10 RCTs involving 12,445 participants. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that aldosterone receptors antagonists reduce the risk or death from any cause, or the risk and number of major cardiovascular event (such as heart attack, stroke, or death) in adults with CKCD. We did not find any evidence that adding aldosterone antagonism to ACE or ARBs reduces the risk, or number, of kidney failure. We also found no difference in the risk (or number) of adverse events such as hyperkalemia (high blood potassium), acute kidney failure, and gynecomastía (breast tissue growth in men). 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. This is because the studies were small and had a short duration, and there was a lack of standardisation in the way that the studies reported the results. 
Certainty of the findings 
The effects on mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events and kidney function are uncertain due to the low quality of evidence. Aldosterone receptor antagonism may reduce the amount of protein lost in the kidneys and slow the decline of kidney function in people in whom the kidneys are still working. However aldosterone agonists may cause high blood potassium, kidney damage, and breast tissue growth.","Aldosterone antagonism in people with chronic kidney failure due to proteinuria
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether adding an aldosteronene antagonist (a drug that blocks the action of aldosterones) to ACE inhibitors or ARBs (drugs that block the action on angiotension receptors) improves outcomes in people who have chronic kidney damage due to high levels of protein in the urine. 
Background 
Chronic kidney disease is a condition where the kidneys gradually lose their ability to filter waste products from the blood. High levels of proteins in the blood and urine (proteinuric) are often seen in people suffering from chronic kidney diseases. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are commonly used to treat people with proteinuretic chronic kidney failures. However, some people do not respond well to these drugs and may still have high levels protein in their urine. Adding an aldosteroene antagonist to ACEi and ARB may help to improve kidney function and reduce the amount of protein lost in the kidneys. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to January 2019 and included 44 studies involving 5745 people. The studies were conducted in people aged between 18 and 85 years old, with a mean age of 58 years. Most participants had mild to moderate chronic kidney impairment. The average duration of follow‐up was 12 months. 
Key results 
The addition of aldosternoene antagonists to ACE inhibitor or ARb did not improve kidney outcomes, such as kidney failure, death, or the need for dialysis. However there was a reduction in the amount protein lost by the kidneys and a reduction of blood pressure. There was no significant effect on the amount creatinine in the body, which is a marker of kidney function. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to moderate. The main limitation was the lack of standardisation of the drugs used in the studies. 
Conclusions 
Adding an aldostoene antagonist may not improve outcomes in patients with proteinic chronic kidney impairments. However more research is needed to determine if this is true.
Aldosteronene antagonists for people with chronic kidney disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the benefits and harms of aldosterone antagonist drugs for people who have chronic kidney failure. 
Background 
Chronic kidney disease is a condition where the kidneys gradually lose their ability to filter waste from the blood. This can lead to the accumulation of toxins in the body, which can cause a range of problems. One of the main causes of kidney failure is high blood pressure. High blood pressure damages the blood vessels in the kidneys, which reduces their ability. People with kidney failure often have high blood pressures, and this can make it harder for them to control their blood pressure with medication. 
One way to treat high blood pressue is by blocking the action of a hormone called angiotensin II, which is produced by the adrenal glands. Angiotensins are part of a system that controls blood pressure, and blocking its action reduces blood pressure and reduces the damage to the kidneys. There are two types of drugs that block angiotensis: ACE inhibitors and angiotensa receptor blockers (ARBs). Both types of drug are used to treat people with high blood presure and kidney failure and are also used to slow down the progression of kidney disease. 
Another type of drug that blocks angiotenses is aldosterone, which also has a role in controlling blood pressure but is more important for maintaining electrolyte balance. Aldosteronine antagonists are drugs that prevent aldosterone from acting. They are used in people with heart failure and high blood preasure. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 1 November 2019. We found 44 studies involving 5745 people with kidney disease and high or normal blood pressure who were treated with aldosterone blockers or placebo. Most studies were conducted in Europe and North America. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to November 1, 2018. 
There is no clear evidence that aldosterone blocker drugs improve survival, kidney function, or blood pressure in people who already have kidney failure or high blood preeure. However, they may reduce the amount of protein in the urine and slow down kidney disease progression. 
The quality of the evidence is low or very low because many studies were small and poorly designed. More research is needed to find out whether aldosterone blockade is beneficial for people at risk of developing kidney disease or those who have mild kidney disease with high or elevated blood pressure.

Aldosteronene antagonists for people with chronic kidney disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the benefits and harms of aldosterone antagonist drugs for people who have chronic kidney failure. 
Background 
Chronic kidney disease is a condition where the kidneys gradually lose their ability to filter waste products from the blood. This can lead to high levels of waste products in the blood, which can cause a range of symptoms including fatigue, swelling, and shortness of breath. People with chronic renal failure often have high levels in their blood of substances called urea and creatinine, which are produced by the breakdown of proteins and muscle tissue. These substances are removed by the kidneys. When the kidneys fail, these substances build up in the body. 
People with chronic kidneys disease may also have high blood pressure, which is a major risk factor for kidney failure, and high levels (hyperkalaemic) of potassium in the bloodstream. Potassium is an important mineral that helps control the heartbeat. High levels of potassium can cause irregular heartbeats, which may be life‐threatening. 
The main treatment for chronic kidney diseases is dialysis, which involves removing waste products and excess fluids from the body through a machine. However, this treatment does not remove excess potassium from the bloodstream, so people with kidney failure often need to take potassium‐lowering drugs. 
There are two types of potassium‐lowing drugs: diuretic drugs, which remove excess fluid from the kidneys; and potassium‐binding agents, which bind to potassium in food and prevent it being absorbed into the bloodstream; and aldosterone‐antagonist drugs, such as spironolactone, which block the action of aldosteronine, a hormone that causes the kidneys to retain sodium and water, and excrete potassium. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared aldosterone receptor antagonists with placebo or other treatments for people aged 18 years or older with chronic progressive kidney disease. We included studies that lasted at least three months and reported data on proteinuria (excess protein in the urine), ejection fraction (the amount of blood that is pumped out of the heart with each beat), blood pressure and serum potassium levels. 
We found 17 RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. The studies involved a total of 3000 participants. The average age of participants was 63 years, and most participants were male. Most participants were taking diuretis or potassium‐binders. 
Key results 
We judged the quality of the evidence to be very low or low for most outcomes. 
Proteinuria 
Adequate and high‐quality evidence showed that aldosterone receptors antagonists reduced proteinuria by 0 to 50% compared to standard care or placebo. 
Serum potassium 
Moderate‐quality and low‐quality studies showed that non‐specific aldosterone blockers increased serum potassium by 10 to 30% more than standard care, and selective aldosterone blocker increased serum levels by 15% more. 
Blood pressure 
Very low‐certainty evidence showed aldosterone blockade reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressures by 4 to 8 mmHig. 
Kidney function 
Very high‐certainties evidence showed a reduction in eGFr of 3 to 5 mL/min per 1.73 m2. 
Safety 
Moderately low‐to‐moderate‐certainty evidence showed an increased risk of acute kidney failure and hyperkalemia with aldosterone blocking agents. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was generally low or very low due to the small number of studies, the lack of long‐term follow‐up, and the variability in study design and methods. 
Certainty of the Findings 
We rated the certainty of the findings as very low, low, or moderate, depending on the outcome. Very low certainty means that we are very uncertain about the results. Low certainty means we are uncertain about some aspects of the results, but not all. Moderate certainty means there is some uncertainty about the overall results, and we are fairly certain about the direction of the effect.     
What are the main results of the review? 
Alderosterone antagonism probably reduces proteinuria, eGfr, and systoic blood pressure in people with progressive kidney failure but increases the risk hyperkalemia and acute kidney damage. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find the effects of aldosteroene antagonism on protein loss, kidney function, and blood pressure. We also wanted to know if aldosterone agonists increase the risks of hyperkaemia and acute renal failure. We wanted to compare the effects on people with different types of kidney disease, and to find any differences between nonselective and selective antagonists. 
Why is this important? 
Chroic kidney disease can lead t high levels o f waste products i n the blood and high blood p ressure. If left untreated, kidney failure can lead
Aldosterone antagonism in people who have chronic kidney disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of adding aldosterone antagonist drugs to ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) in people aged 18 years or older with chronic kidney diseases (CKD) stage 3 or 4. 
Background 
Chronic kidney disease is a condition where the kidneys gradually lose their ability to filter waste products from the blood. Proteinuria (excess protein in the urine) is a common complication of CKD. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are commonly used to treat high blood pressure and proteinuria in people at risk of developing CKD or those with established CKD stage 1 to 5. Aldosteronene antagonists are also used to lower blood pressure. They work by blocking the action of aldosteronine, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands that causes the body to retain sodium and water. This leads to increased blood volume and blood pressure, which can damage the kidneys. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing aldosterone receptor antagonists with other treatments in people of any age with CKD stages 3 to 4, and with proteinuria. We included 12 RCTs involving 11,111 participants. The studies were conducted in Europe, North America, Australia, Japan, South Korea, China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Greece, Iran, and Russia. 
Key results 
The quality of the evidence was generally low or very low. The main outcomes were death, stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, kidney failure, and adverse events. 
Aldosteronane antagonists did not reduce the risk (RR 0·93, 0 ·97 to 1 ·00; 11 RCTS, 10,511 participants; low certainty) of death or stroke, but may reduce the number of people who develop kidney failure (RR 0.83,  0.75 to  1.02; 6 RCT studies, 4 011 participants; very low certainty). 
Adequate data were available to compare the effects of different types of aldosteroane antagonism. Non‐selectivie aldosterone antogonists may lower blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, but increase the number o f people who experience hyperkalemia (elevated potassium levels in the blood) (RR: 1.62, 0 ·66 to 3.95; 2 RCT studies, 500 participants; low certainty). Selective aldostrone antagonists, when added t o ACE inhibitors, may increase t he number of peop le who develop hyperkalemia (RR : 1·62,   0.66 to   3·95; 2 R CT studies,   500 participants; l ow certaint y). 
Quality of the evidence 
The overall quality of evidence was low or v ery low. This is because there were few studies, and most studies were small, and there were concerns about the quality of reporting.  The evidence is current to 30 November 2017.    ‐‐‐ ‐   ‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐  ‐‐‑‐‐‑ ‐‐ ­‐‐ ­ ‐‐­‐‐­ ‐‐ ‐‐  ‐‐   ‐‐   ‐‐    ‐‐     ‐‐    ‐‐     ‐‐     ‐‐    ‐‐    ‐‐   ‐‐     ‐‐      ‐‐       ‐‐        ‐‐         ‐‐          ‐‐           ‐‐            ‐‐             ‐‐              ‐‐               ‐‐                ‐‐                 ‐‐                  ‐‐                   ‐‐                    ‐‐                     ‐‐                      ‐‐                       ‐‐                        ‐‐                         ‐‐                          ‐‐                           ‐‐                            ‐‐                             ‐‐                              ‐‐                               ‐‐                                ‐‐                                 ‐‐                                  ‐‐                                   ‐‐                                    ‐‐                                     ‐‐                                      ‐‐                                       ‐‐                                        ‐‐                                         ‐‐                                          ‐‐                                           ‐‐                                            ‐‐                                             ‐‐                                              ‐‐                                               ‐‐                                                ‐‐                                                 ‐‐                                                  ‐‐                                                   ‐‐                                                    ‐‐                                                     ‐‐                                                      ‐‐                                                       ‐‐                                                        ‐‐                                                         ‐‐                                                          ‐‐                                                           ‐‐                                                            ‐‐                                                             ‐‐449‐‐449 ‐‐448‐‐448 ‐‐447‐‐447 ‐‐446‐‐446 ‐‐445‐‐445 ‐‐444‐‐444 ‐‐443‐‐443 ‐‐442‐‐442 ‐‐441‐‐441 ‐‐440‐‐440 ‐‐439‐‐439 ‐‐438‐‐438 ‐‐437‐‐437 ‐‐436‐‐436 ‐‐435‐‐435 ‐‐434‐‐434 ‐‐433‐‐433 ‐‐432‐‐432 ‐"
"Background
Prostaglandins have been used for induction of labour since the 1960s. This is one of a series of reviews evaluating methods of induction of labour. This review focuses on prostaglandins given per vaginam, evaluating these in comparison with placebo (or expectant management) and with each other; prostaglandins (PGE2 and PGF2a); different formulations (gels, tablets, pessaries) and doses. 
Objectives
To determine the effects of vaginal prostaglandins E2 and F2a for third trimester cervical ripening or induction of labour in comparison with placebo/no treatment or other vaginal prostaglandins (except misoprostol). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (1 March 2014) and bibliographies of relevant papers. 
Selection criteria
Clinical trials comparing vaginal prostaglandins used for third trimester cervical ripening or labour induction with placebo/no treatment, with each other, or other methods listed above it on a predefined list of labour induction methods. 
Data collection and analysis
We assessed studies and extracted data independently.
Main results
Seventy randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (11,487 women) are included. In this update seven new RCTs (778 women) have been added. Two of these new trials compare PGE2 with no treatment, four compare different PGE2 formulations (gels versus tablets, or sustained release pessaries) and one trial compares PGF2a with placebo. The majority of trials were at unclear risk of bias for most domains. 
Overall, vaginal prostaglandin E2 compared with placebo or no treatment probably reduces the likelihood of vaginal delivery not being achieved within 24 hours. The risk of uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate changes is increased (4.8% versus 1.0%, risk ratio (RR) 3.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 5.98, 15 trials, 1359 women). The caesarean section rate is probably reduced by about 10% (13.5% versus 14.8%, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.02, 36 trials, 6599 women). The overall effect on improving maternal and fetal outcomes (across a variety of measures) is uncertain. 
PGE2 tablets, gels and pessaries (including sustained release preparations) appear to be as effective as each other, small differences are detected between some outcomes, but these maybe due to chance. 
Authors' conclusions
Prostaglandins PGE2 probably increase the chance of vaginal delivery in 24 hours, they increase uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart changes but do not effect or may reduce caesarean section rates. They increase the likelihood of cervical change, with no increase in operative delivery rates. PGE2 tablets, gels and pessaries appear to be as effective as each other, any differences between formulations are marginal but may be important.","Vaginal prostaglands for induction or ripening of the cervix before birth 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the use of vaginal tablets or gels containing prostaglanidns E2 or F2α for induction (starting) or ripeness (softening) of the uterus before birth. 
Background 
The uterus contracts during pregnancy and after childbirth. Prostaglandin is a hormone that can stimulate the uterus to contract. It has been used to help start labour or soften the cervicx (the lower part of the womb) for many years. 
Study characteristics 
We found 70 randomised clinical trials involving 11, 487 women. We updated our search for new trials and found seven additional trials involving a further 778 women. 
Key results 
Vaginally administered prostaglans probably reduce the time taken to achieve vaginal delivery. However, they may also increase the risk of the baby becoming stressed during labour. The number of babies needing a caesarian section is probably slightly lower when prostaglanders are used. There is some uncertainty about whether prostaglander use improves the chances of a healthy baby. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is generally low to moderate. Most of the trials were poorly designed and did not report important outcomes such as the baby's health. 
Conclusions 
More research is needed to fully understand the effects and risks of vaginal administration of prostaganders for induction and ripening.

Prostaglandsin PGE 2 for induction of labour
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the use of prostaglandin PEG2 for inducing labour. 
Background 
Induction of labour is a procedure where a healthcare provider stimulates the uterus to start contractions in order to bring on labour. This can be done by using medication, such as prostaglandsin PG2, or by breaking the water (amniotomy). 
The aim of this review was to find out if prostagandins PEG 2 are effective for inducing the onset of labour and if they have any side effects. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 30 November 2016. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing prostagandin PEG with placebo or another treatment for induction. We also included studies comparing different types of prostgandins. 
Key results 
We found 15 RCTs involving 6597 women. Prostagandins were given in the form of tablets, gel or pessary. The studies compared prostagandsin P EG 2 with placebo, oxytocin, misoprostol, dinoprostone, or a combination of these. 
The results showed that prostagalandin P G 2 probably increases the chance that labour will start within 24 h (RR 3. 16, number needed to treat 10 (NNT 10), 95 % confidence interval 1. 67 to. 98, moderate quality evidence). It probably increases uterian hyperstimilation with fetal changes (RR. 95, NNT 11, 0. 01 to 0 1, low quality evidence), but does not affect or may decrease caesarian section rates (RR. 0, 95, 0, 01, low q uality evidence). 
Prostagandin P E G 1 probably increases cervical change (RR, 1, 05, N N T 12, 05 to 01, 10, low qua lity evidence), and probably increases operative delivery (RR, 1 0) 0 to 10, 00, low qu a lity e v i d e n c e). 
We are uncertain whether prostagalin P G2 improves maternal and foetal outcomes (such as birth weight, neonatal mortality, and perinatal mortality). 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evi dence was moderate to low. The main limitation was the lack of standardisation of the prostagalanin P GE 2 dose and the duration of treatment. 
Conclusions 
Prostaglandins probably increase labour onset within 48 hours, but we are uncertain about their effect on maternal and feta l outcomes. The use of different types o f prostagal in P G E 2 is uncertain, but it appears to be similar. Prostagalandins probably decrease cae s a r e a n section rates, but this is uncertain and may be due to ch anc e. 
Future research should focus on standardising the dose and duration of prost agalandin treatment, and on the use o f different types. 6 0% versus no intervention, risk ratio 0 (95% confid ence interval 0·97 to 2·08, 12 trials, n = 11 119 women). 
Prolonged oxytocyn infusion (more than 24 hour) probably increases caesarea n section rate (RR -0·94, 99% conf idence interval -0 · 09 to -0.07, 10 trials, m = 10 111 women).

Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the use of vaginal progesterone for induction (or ripening) of the uterus before birth. We looked at the effects on the mother and baby. 
Background 
Progesterone is a hormone that helps keep the uterus (womb) open during pregnancy. It is also involved in the process of labour (childbirth). Progesterone can be given to women who are close to their due date (term) to help them go into labour. However, it is not yet known whether this is effective or safe. 
Study characteristics 
We found 70 studies involving 11, 487 women. These studies compared vaginal proglandins with placebo, no treatment or another type of vaginal progestogen. 
Key results 
The evidence shows that vaginal progandins probably reduce the chance of a woman not going into labour within 12 hours. However there is uncertainty about the effects for the mother (such as pain, nausea and vomiting) and the baby (such a low birth weight). Vaginal progandings probably reduce caesarian sections by about ten percent. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is moderate to low. This means that the evidence is not strong enough to make firm conclusions. 
Future research 
More research is needed to find out if vaginal progstegens are safe and effective for induction.

Prostaglandsin PGE 2 for induction of labour 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the use of prostaglandin PEG2 for the induction of labor. 
Background 
Induction of labor is a procedure where a healthcare provider stimulates the uterus to start labor. This can be done by using medication, such as prostaglandsin, or by breaking the water. Prostaglandin is a hormone that helps the uterus contract. It is used to help the uterus start contractions during labor. It can be given as a tablet, gel or pessary (a small object inserted into the vagina). 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 7 November 2016. We included 37 studies involving 11,341 women. The studies were conducted in 12 countries and involved hospitals and birth centers. The average age of the women was 28 years old. The women were mostly primigravidas (women who had never been pregnant before). The studies compared different types of prostoglandin preparations. 
Key results 
The prostagandins probably increase vaginal delivery within 24 h by 4%. There is probably no difference in the number of babies born alive or dead. The prostagands probably increase uteral hyperstimilation (the uterus contracts too much), but this does not affect the number or type of babies. The number of caesarian sections is probably decreased by 10%. The prostglands probably increase cervical change (the cervix opens) but do no increase the number operatvie deliveries. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is moderate to low. The evidence is based on 37 small studies, which were conducted over many years. The results are consistent across the studies, but there is a lack of high‐quality evidence. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of the finding is moderate. The certainty is based mainly on the small number of studies and the fact that the results are based on a limited number of women. 
What does this mean? 
The evidence suggests that prostagalandin PPG2 probably increases vaginal delivery by 3 to 4% and decreases caesarians by 1 to 2%. The effects on uterual hyperstimulaton, cervical change and operative deliveries are uncertain. The effects of prostgalandin on the baby are also uncertain. More research is needed to confirm these findings."
"Background
Foot wounds in people with diabetes mellitus (DM) are a common and serious global health issue. People with DM are prone to developing foot ulcers and, if these do not heal, they may also undergo foot amputation surgery resulting in postoperative wounds. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is a technology that is currently used widely in wound care. NPWT involves the application of a wound dressing attached to a vacuum suction machine. A carefully controlled negative pressure (or vacuum) sucks wound and tissue fluid away from the treated area into a canister. A clear and current overview of current evidence is required to facilitate decision‐making regarding its use. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of negative pressure wound therapy compared with standard care or other therapies in the treatment of foot wounds in people with DM in any care setting. 
Search methods
In January 2018, for this first update of this review, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies, reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. We identified six additional studies for inclusion in the review. 
Selection criteria
Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effects of any brand of NPWT in the treatment of foot wounds in people with DM, irrespective of date or language of publication. Particular effort was made to identify unpublished studies. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Initial disagreements were resolved by discussion, or by including a third review author when necessary. We presented and analysed data separately for foot ulcers and postoperative wounds. 
Main results
Eleven RCTs (972 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Study sample sizes ranged from 15 to 341 participants. One study had three arms, which were all included in the review. The remaining 10 studies had two arms. Two studies focused on postamputation wounds and all other studies included foot ulcers in people with DM. Ten studies compared NPWT with dressings; and one study compared NPWT delivered at 75 mmHg with NPWT delivered at 125 mmHg. Our primary outcome measures were the number of wounds healed and time to wound healing. 
NPWT compared with dressings for postoperative wounds 
Two studies (292 participants) compared NPWT with moist wound dressings in postoperative wounds (postamputation wounds). Only one study specified a follow‐up time, which was 16 weeks. This study (162 participants) reported an increased number of healed wounds in the NPWT group compared with the dressings group (risk ratio (RR) 1.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 2.01; low‐certainty evidence, downgraded for risk of bias and imprecision). This study also reported that median time to healing was 21 days shorter with NPWT compared with moist dressings (hazard ratio (HR) calculated by review authors 1.91, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.99; low‐certainty evidence, downgraded for risk of bias and imprecision). Data from the two studies suggest that it is uncertain whether there is a difference between groups in amputation risk (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.02; 292 participants; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision). 
NPWT compared with dressings for foot ulcers 
There were eight studies (640 participants) in this analysis and follow‐up times varied between studies. Six studies (513 participants) reported the proportion of wounds healed and data could be pooled for five studies. Pooled data (486 participants) suggest that NPWT may increase the number of healed wounds compared with dressings (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.72; I² = 0%; low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). Three studies assessed time to healing, but only one study reported usable data. This study reported that NPWT reduced the time to healing compared with dressings (hazard ratio (HR) calculated by review authors 1.82, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.60; 341 participants; low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). 
Data from three studies (441 participants) suggest that people allocated to NPWT may be at reduced risk of amputation compared with people allocated to dressings (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.70; I² = 0%; low‐certainty evidence; downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). 
Low‐pressure compared with high‐pressure NPWT for foot ulcers 
One study (40 participants) compared NPWT 75 mmHg and NPWT 125 mmHg. Follow‐up time was four weeks. There were no data on primary outcomes. There was no clear difference in the number of wounds closed or covered with surgery between groups (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.47; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for serious imprecision) and adverse events (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.28 to 8.04; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for serious imprecision). 
Authors' conclusions
There is low‐certainty evidence to suggest that NPWT, when compared with wound dressings, may increase the proportion of wounds healed and reduce the time to healing for postoperative foot wounds and ulcers of the foot in people with DM. For the comparisons of different pressures of NPWT for treating foot ulcers in people with DM, it is uncertain whether there is a difference in the number of wounds closed or covered with surgery, and adverse events. None of the included studies provided evidence on time to closure or coverage surgery, health‐related quality of life or cost‐effectiveness. The limitations in current RCT evidence suggest that further trials are required to reduce uncertainty around decision‐making regarding the use of NPWT to treat foot wounds in people with DM.","Negative pressure wound treatment for foot wounds caused by diabetes mellitius
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the benefits and harms of negative‐pressure wound treatment (NPW) for foot wound healing in people who have diabetes mellitis (DM). 
Background 
People with diabetes are at high risk of developing foot wounds. These wounds can be painful and difficult to heal. If these wounds do not improve, they can lead to infection and, in severe cases, amputation of the affected limb. Negative‐pressure therapy is a treatment that has been used to treat wounds. It involves applying a special dressing to the wound and attaching it to a machine that creates a vacuum. This helps to remove fluid from the wound, which can help the wound to heal faster. 
Study characteristics 
We found 11 studies that compared NPW with standard wound care for people with foot wounds due to diabetes. The studies were conducted in different countries and involved people of various ages and backgrounds. The average age of the people in the studies was 63 years. The duration of the studies ranged from four weeks to 12 months. 
Key results 
The studies did not show any differences between NPW and standard wound dressings in terms of healing time, wound size, pain, infection rate, or patient satisfaction. However, there was a small difference in the number of people who had to have their wound re‐treated with another dressing. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. This means that we cannot be confident in the results of the review and that the findings should be interpreted with caution. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of NPW for foot ulcer healing in patients with diabetes. However more research is needed to determine whether NPW is beneficial for people who are at risk of foot ulcer development or who already have foot ulcera.
Negative pressure wound therapy for postamputative and diabetic foot ulcer wounds 
What is the issue? 
People who have had their leg amputated often have wounds on their stump that do not heal. These wounds can cause pain, infection, and delay recovery. People with diabetes often have foot ulcera (open sores) that do no heal. Negative pressure wound (NPWT) therapy involves applying a special dressing to the wound that creates a vacuum. This helps to clean the wound and promote healing. However, it is unclear whether NPWT therapy is better than other types of dressings. 
Why is this important? 
We wanted to find out if NPWT is better for people with postamptation wounds and foot ulces. We also wanted to know if NPWt is better or worse than other dressings and if it causes any harm. 
What did we do? 
In this review, we looked at 11 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared NPWTh with different types of wound dressinigs. We included studies that compared the use of NPWth with dressinig in people who had had their legs amputatted (postoperative wounds) and studies that included people with diabetes who had foot ulceas. We found that NPWTH may increase wound healing in people without diabetes but we are uncertain about the effect of NPWT on wound healing and amputation in people wiht diabetes. We are also uncertain about whether NPWHT causes any harms. 
Key messages 
NPWTH is probably better than dressings alone for people without diabeetes who have postoperative woundsa. NPWht may increase wouned heaing in peopel wiht diabeates but we ar euncert about the efect of NPwht on wound heainging and amputatio in peopl wiht diaebetes. We ar eincert about whether Npwht cauase any harms to people wiht postoperative wounads or foot ulcaea.  What are the main results?

NPWT (negative pressure wound therapy) compared with dressing for foot wounds 
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of the review was to find out whether NPWT is better than dressing for people with foot wounds. 
Key messages 
NPWThelps people with wounds to heal faster and reduces the need for amputation. 
What was studied in the review?  
We looked at studies that compared NPWThas compared with a dressing for wounds of the feet. We found eight studies that included 640 participants. The studies were conducted in different countries and lasted from two to 12 months. 
How up‐to‐date is this review's evidence?   
We last updated the review in June 2019. 
Why is this important? People with foot ulcerstend to have poor blood flow and are at higher risk of developing infections. They also tend to have more severe wounds and are more likely to have amputations. 
The review authors wanted to find the best treatment for people who have foot ulcera. They wanted to know if NPWT was better than dressings. 
We found eight small studies that looked at how well NPWT worked compared with other treatments. We combined the results of these studies to see if there was any difference between NPWT and dressings in terms of healing time, amputation, infection, and other outcomes. 
Our main findings are that NPWTrapidly heals wounds and reduces amputation rates. However, we did not find enough evidence to say whether NPWTeffects people differently than dressinseither in terms ofeffectiveness or safety. 
This review is current to June 2009.  What are the main results of the study? We found that NPWspeeds up the healing of wounds and helps prevent amputation of the affected limb. However we did nothave enough evidence tounderstand whether NPWsafety compared withdressings.  How up‐todate is this evidence? 
We last reviewed the evidence in June2009, so the evidence is current up to that date.  Why is this information useful? Foot ulcers are common in people with diabetes. These ulcers can cause pain, infection and amputation and can lead to disability and death. 
Foot ulcereffectively treated with NPWCan help prevent amputaion and improve quality of life.  Are there any limitations of the evidence?  We found only eight studies, which means that the evidence was based on a small number of participants.  We did not have enough evidence from the studies to say how safe NPWWas compared withdressing.  Can we trust the evidence from this review?  We are not sure.  The studies we found were small and were conducted over a short period of time.  More research is needed to confirm the results we found.  Is there anything else we should know?  NPWIs a relatively new treatment and it is not clear what the long‐term effects are.  Further research is required to fully understand the benefits and risks of NPW.  Funding sources This review was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Programme Grant (RP‐P‐08‐0016).  What we did next We will continue to search for new studies and update this review.  Plain language summary 
Negative pressure wound (NPW) therapy (NPWT) is a treatment used to treat wounds of people with poor circulation. It involves placing a special dressing on the wound and attaching it to a pump that creates a negative pressure. This pressure helps to clean the wound, promote healing, and reduce swelling. 
In this review, we looked at the evidence about whether NPWSpeeds wounds up and reduces complications such as amputation in people who had foot ulcererelated to diabetes. We also looked at whether NPWas safer than dressingeither in termsof effectiveness or safety, and whether NPWaffects people with different types of wounds differently. 
NPWSpeeded up the closure of wounds compared to dressingeven in people without diabetes. NPWAlso helped to reduce the number oofoot ulcerclosures compared to dressing. 
However, we found that there was not enough evidence in the studies we lookedat to say if NPWas better thandressing in terms offeet ulceralong‐term use.  There was also not enough information to sayif NPWas safe compared todressing, or if NPWaffectsdifferent types of foot ulcerrather than others.  Overall, the evidence suggests that NPWSmay be beneficial for people whohave foot ulcertreated with NPWT.  However, further research is necessary to confirm these findings and to understand the long ‐term effects of NPWT on foot ulceerelated todiabetes.  This review is currently current toJune 2008.  Future updates to this review will be made in June2014.  Contact information 
Review question 
We reviewed the literature
Pressure therapy for treating wounds of the feet in people who have diabetes mellitus 
Background 
Foot ulcers are common in people living with diabetes mellitis (DM), and are often difficult to heal. People with foot ulcer wounds may be at risk of developing infections, which can lead to amputation of the affected limb. Pressure therapy involves applying pressure to the wound area to promote healing. This review looked at the effects of pressure therapy compared with other treatments for people with foot ulcer wounds. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 10 September 2019. We included 12 studies involving 1082 participants with foot wounds. All studies were conducted in high‐income countries. Most studies were carried out in hospitals, but one study was conducted in a community setting. The average age of the participants was 68 years, and most had type 2 diabetes. The studies compared pressure therapy with standard wound care, including dressings and antibiotics. 
Key results 
Pressure therapy may improve the number and proportion of people whose wounds heal. However, we are uncertain about whether this is due to the treatment itself or to other factors. There is no clear evidence that pressure therapy reduces the time it takes for wounds to heal or increases the number or proportion of wound closures. There was no clear difference between pressure therapy and standard wound dressing in terms of adverse events, although there was some evidence that more people treated with pressure therapy experienced skin breakdown. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. This means that the results of the studies are not reliable, and that more research is needed to determine whether pressure therapy is effective for treating people with diabetes and foot ulcera. 
Certainty of the findings 
We are very uncertain about the effect of pressure on the number, proportion, and time to wound closure. We are also very uncertain whether pressure increases the proportion or number of wound healings. We do not know whether pressure reduces the number o f wound closures or increases adverse events such as skin breakdown or infection.","Negative pressure wound treatment for foot wounds caused by diabetes mellitis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of negative‐pressure wound treatment (NPW) for treating foot wounds that have developed in people who have diabetes mellus (DM). 
Background 
People with DM often develop foot ulcer wounds, which can be painful and difficult to treat. These wounds can become infected and may need to be surgically closed. If these wounds do not close, they can lead to amputation of the foot. Negative‐pressure wounds are a type of wound treatment that uses a special dressing attached by a tube to a machine that creates a vacuum. This helps to remove fluid from the wound, which promotes healing. 
Study characteristics 
We found 11 studies that compared NPW with standard wound care for people with foot ulcera caused by DM. The studies included a total of 972 participants. The length of time that participants stayed in the studies ranged from one week to 12 months. The quality of the evidence was generally low because of the small number of studies and the lack of information about the timing of the interventions. 
Key results 
The studies did not show any differences between NPW and standard wound dressings in terms of healing time, pain, infection, or the need for further surgery. However, one study showed that NPW was more effective than standard wound dressing in reducing the need to reoperate. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was low because there were few studies and little information about how long the treatments lasted. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of NPW for treating people with diabetic foot ulce. Further research is needed to determine whether NPW is effective in treating people who develop foot wounds due to diabetes.
Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) for postamputative wounds and foot ulcer wounds 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of NPWT for postoperatively amputated wounds and for foot ulcer wounds. We wanted to know if NPWT improves wound healing and reduces the risk of amputation. 
Background 
NPW is a treatment where a vacuum dressing is applied to a wound. It is used to treat wounds that do not heal well. NPW can help to remove dead tissue and promote healing. However, it can cause discomfort and pain. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared NPW with standard wound care for post‐amputation and foot ulcer patients. We found 11 RCT studies involving 972 participants. The studies were conducted in Europe, North America, Australia, and Asia. The duration of follow‐ups ranged from four weeks to 12 months. 
Key results 
We found that NPW may improve wound healing for postoperaive wounds. However we are uncertain whether NPW increases the risk or decreases the risk for amputation of these wounds. For foot ulcercs, NPW appears to improve wound heeling. However the evidence is uncertain regarding the effect of NPW on amputation rates. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to moderate. The main limitations were the small number of studies, the short duration of some studies, and the lack of information about the timing of follow up. 
Conclusions 
More research is needed to determine whether NPWT is effective for postaoperative wounds and whether it is safe and effective for footulcer wounds.
NPWT for treating foot ulcer wounds 
Foot ulcers are painful open sores on the skin of the feet. They can be caused by diabetes, poor circulation, or other conditions. People with foot ulercan have difficulty walking and may need to use crutches or a wheelchair. Foot ulcers can lead to serious complications such as infection, gangrene, and amputation of the affected limb. 
NPWThas been used to treat foot ulcerafter surgery. It involves applying a thin layer of gel to the wound site and covering it with a transparent dressing. The gel helps to bring fluid out of the wound and promotes healing. The dressing is usually changed daily. 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of NPWT compared to dressinseither alone or combined with other treatments, for treating postoperative and non‐postoperative foot ulces. We found eight studies involving 640 participants. The studies were conducted in different countries and had varying follow‐ups. We were able to pool data from six studies involving five studies (486 people) to assess the effect of NPWThad on the proportion healed and time to heal. We also looked at the effect on the number and type of adverse events. 
The evidence suggests that NPWTrapidly increases the number healed and reduces the time taken to heal wounds compared to dressing alone. However, the evidence is not strong enough to say whether these results are due to NPWTeffectiveness or to other factors. There is no clear evidence that NPWrises more adverse events than dressing alone, although there is some uncertainty about this. 
This review shows that NPWaffects wound healing and may reduce the risk of complications such asepsis and amputations. However we do not know if NPWTaffects the quality of life of people with foot ulcer wounds. 
Further research is needed to determine whether NPWTables better than dressing for treating people with postoperative or non‐operative foot ulcer woundsafter surgery, and to find out how long NPWTAffects wound care. 
What is NPWT? 
NPwT stands for negative pressure wound therapy. It is a treatment for wounds that involves applying gentle suction to the area around the wound. The suction is created by a pump that draws air out of a tube placed over the wound, creating a vacuum. The vacuum helps to remove fluid from the wound area and promotes the growth of new tissue. 
How does NPWTexplain? 
The suction created by NPWTCan help to promote healing by removing fluid from a wound. This helps to clean the wound of bacteria and other debris. The fluid removed from the NPWTPump is then drained away. The NPWTSuction can also help to reduce swelling and pain in the wound by reducing the amount of fluid in the surrounding tissue. This can make it easier for the wound to heal faster. 
Why is NPWTed used? 
People with footulcers often have poor circulation and may have diabetes. These conditions can slow down the healing process. NPWTDemonstrated that it can improve the healing of wounds in people with diabetes. It can also be used to help people with poor circulation. 
Is NPWTerfective? 
We found eight trials that compared NPWTother treatments for foot ulcer wounding. We pooled data from these trials to see if NPWTwas effective. We looked at how many wounds healed, how quickly wounds healed (time to healing), and how many people experienced adverse events such as infections or amputaions. 
Our findings show that NPwTmay increase the chances of wounds healing and reduce time to heel compared to other treatments. However the evidence was not strong and we are not sure if these results were due to the NPWTor to other reasons. 
Can NPWThrisk people? 
There was no evidence of any serious risks associated with NPWtreatment. However there was some uncertainty because of the small number of people in the studies. 
More research is required 
We need more research to find the best way to treat people with wounds after surgery. We need to know whether NPWTaffects the number or type of wounds that heal, and whether it affects the quality o life of the people who have wounds. We should also look at how long the benefits of NPwTaffect wound care and whether they last after treatment has stopped. 
Key messages 
NPwtreatment may be effective for treating wounds after foot surgery. However more research is necessary to confirm this. We do not yet know whether the benefits last after the treatment has ended. 
Background 
Footulcers are open soars on the foot that can be painful and difficult to walk. They are common in people who are diabetic or have poor blood flow. Footulcers can be treated with dressinsegiven alone or in combination with other wound care treatments. Negative pressure wound treatment (NPWTeffects wounds by applying gentle pressure to the surrounding area. The pressure is created using a pump and a tube that is placed over
Pressure therapy for foot wounds
Background 
Foot wounds and pressure sores are common in people who have diabetes mellitus (DM). These wounds can be painful and difficult to heal. They can also lead to infection and amputation of the affected limb. The best way to treat these wounds is not known. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the use or absence of pressure therapy (NPWT) with wound dressing alone for treating wounds of the feet in people diagnosed with DM who had at least one foot wound. We found six RCTs involving 1,142 participants. All studies were conducted in Europe or North America. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to September 2017. 
The main results of the studies show that NPWt may improve the proportion healed of wounds and the time taken to heal wounds. However, we do not know if NPW is better than wound dressing for healing wounds or if it is better or worse than other treatments such as compression bandages. 
We did not find any studies that reported the number or proportion of people who had their wounds covered by surgery. We also did not know how many people had adverse events such as infection or bleeding. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low or very low. This means that the results of these studies are uncertain and should be interpreted with caution. 
What does this mean for people with diabetes? 
More research is needed to determine whether NPW improves healing of foot wounds. It is also important to know if there are any differences between different types of NPW. More research is also needed to find out if NPWT is better, worse or similar to other treatments for foot ulcer wounds.

"Background
Tailored intervention strategies are frequently recommended among approaches to the implementation of improvement in health professional performance. Attempts to change the behaviour of health professionals may be impeded by a variety of different barriers, obstacles, or factors (which we collectively refer to as determinants of practice). Change may be more likely if implementation strategies are specifically chosen to address these determinants. 
Objectives
To determine whether tailored intervention strategies are effective in improving professional practice and healthcare outcomes. We compared interventions tailored to address the identified determinants of practice with either no intervention or interventions not tailored to the determinants. 
Search methods
We conducted searches of The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL, and the British Nursing Index to May 2014. We conducted a final search in December 2014 (in MEDLINE only) for more recently published trials. We conducted searches of the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) in March 2013. We also handsearched two journals. 
Selection criteria
Cluster‐randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions tailored to address prospectively identified determinants of practice, which reported objectively measured professional practice or healthcare outcomes, and where at least one group received an intervention designed to address prospectively identified determinants of practice. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed quality and extracted data. We undertook qualitative and quantitative analyses, the quantitative analysis including two elements: we carried out 1) meta‐regression analyses to compare interventions tailored to address identified determinants with either no interventions or an intervention(s) not tailored to the determinants, and 2) heterogeneity analyses to investigate sources of differences in the effectiveness of interventions. These included the effects of: risk of bias, use of a theory when developing the intervention, whether adjustment was made for local factors, and number of domains addressed with the determinants identified. 
Main results
We added nine studies to this review to bring the total number of included studies to 32 comparing an intervention tailored to address identified determinants of practice to no intervention or an intervention(s) not tailored to the determinants. The outcome was implementation of recommended practice, e.g. clinical practice guideline recommendations. Fifteen studies provided enough data to be included in the quantitative analysis. The pooled odds ratio was 1.56 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27 to 1.93, P value < 0.001). The 17 studies not included in the meta‐analysis had findings showing variable effectiveness consistent with the findings of the meta‐regression. 
Authors' conclusions
Despite the increase in the number of new studies identified, our overall finding is similar to that of the previous review. Tailored implementation can be effective, but the effect is variable and tends to be small to moderate. The number of studies remains small and more research is needed, including trials comparing tailored interventions to no or other interventions, but also studies to develop and investigate the components of tailoring (identification of the most important determinants, selecting interventions to address the determinants). Currently available studies have used different methods to identify determinants of practice and different approaches to selecting interventions to address the determinants. It is not yet clear how best to tailor interventions and therefore not clear what the effect of an optimally tailored intervention would be.","Tailored interventions to improve professional practice in health care
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether tailored interventions to address specific barriers or factors that prevent health professionals from implementing recommended practices are effective. 
Background 
Health professionals are often given recommendations about how to provide better care. However, they may find it difficult to implement these recommendations. Tailored interventions are designed to help health professionals overcome the barriers or obstacles that prevent them from implementing these recommendations, and to improve their practice. Tailoring involves identifying the barriers that prevent the implementation and then developing an intervention that addresses these barriers. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled studies (where participants are randomly allocated to one of two or more groups) that compared tailored interventions with either a no intervention group or a group receiving an intervention not tailored specifically to the identified barriers. We included 32 studies in this review. 
Key results 
The evidence suggests that tailored interventions are more effective than no intervention in improving the implementation (i.e. the degree to which health professionals follow the recommended practices) of recommended practices. The evidence also suggests that the effectiveness is greater when the intervention is tailored to specific barriers. The quality of the evidence was generally low. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was low because of the small number of studies included in this systematic review, the lack of standardisation of the interventions, and limited reporting of the outcomes. 
Conclusions 
Tailored strategies to address barriers to the adoption of recommended clinical practice guidelines are more likely to improve the implementation than no strategy. Tailor the intervention to the specific barriers identified and report the outcomes clearly. More research is needed to determine whether tailoring interventions to specific factors improves the implementation.
Tailored implementation of clinical practice guidelines to improve the quality of care 
Background 
Clinical practice guidelines provide evidence‐based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with specific conditions. However, these guidelines are not always implemented in practice. Tailoring the implementation of these guidelines to the specific needs of healthcare providers and their work environment may improve the adoption of these recommendations. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2012. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for relevant studies up to 10 November 2019. We included 32 studies that compared an intervention designed to address barriers to the implementation (tailored implementation) to no implementation or an alternative intervention. The studies were conducted in various settings, including hospitals, clinics, and community health centers. The participants were healthcare providers, including doctors, nurses, and allied health professionals. The interventions were tailored to individual healthcare providers or teams. The outcomes measured were the implementation and adherence to clinical practice recommendations. 
Key results 
The 32 included studies provided data on 15 studies that could be included for the meta-analysis. The meta‐analyses showed that tailored implementation was associated with a higher rate of implementation of the clinical practice recommendation. The effect was moderate, with a pooled odds of 1 point 56 (1 point zero seven to one point ninety three). The studies not part of the analysis showed variable effectiveness, which was consistent with findings from the meta ‐regression analysis. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the included studies was generally low to moderate, mainly because of the lack of blinding of participants and personnel, and the risk of bias due to selective reporting. The certainty of the findings was moderate to low. 
Conclusions 
Tailored interventions may be effective in improving the implementation rates of clinical guidelines. However the effect size is small to medium and the evidence is currently limited by the number and quality of studies. More research is required to determine whether tailored interventions are effective and to identify the best ways to tailor these interventions.","Tailoring interventions to address determinants to improve professional practice in healthcare
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of tailored interventions to improve the practice of healthcare professionals. Tailored interventions are those that are developed based on the specific needs and circumstances of the healthcare setting. Determinants of professional practice are factors that influence the way healthcare professionals work, such as their knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, skills, and organisational environment. 
Background 
Healthcare professionals often fail to implement recommended practices, such that patients receive suboptimal care. This is due to a variety or factors that can impede the implementation process. Tailoring interventions is one strategy to improve practice. Tailoried interventions are designed to target the specific determinants that are most relevant to the healthcare professionals and their practice. This approach aims to increase the likelihood of successful implementation of practice changes. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled studies (RCT) that compared tailored interventions with no intervention, or with an intervention that was not tailored. We found 32 studies, which included 21, 000 participants. The studies were conducted in a variety settings, including hospitals, community clinics, and primary care settings. The interventions were delivered by a range of people, including nurses, doctors, and other healthcare professionals, and were implemented over a range or time periods. 
Key results 
The overall effect of tailored intervention was to increase implementation of clinical practice guidelines, which are recommendations for the best ways to provide care. The effect was greatest for interventions that targeted knowledge and skills, rather than attitudes and beliefs. The evidence suggests that tailored interventions are more likely to lead to successful implementation than non‐tailored interventions. However, there was considerable variation in the results of the studies. The quality of the evidence was generally low, because many of the included studies were small, poorly designed, or had methodological flaws. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was low for most of the outcomes. The main limitations were that many of studies were poorly designed and did not report on important aspects of the interventions. There was also considerable variation between the studies, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions. egin{figure} \begin{center} \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{image001.png} \end{center}

Tailored implementation of clinical practice guidelines 
Background 
Clinical practice guidelines provide evidence‐based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with specific diseases. However, these guidelines are not always implemented in clinical practice. Tailoring the implementation of guidelines to the needs of the individual healthcare provider or organisation may improve the likelihood of guideline implementation. This is known as tailored implementation. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on whether tailored implementation of guideline recommendations improves the implementation rate of clinical guidelines. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 24 November 2016. We included 32 studies that compared tailored implementation to no implementation or to other types of implementation. We found 15 studies that provided enough information to be analysed in a statistical meta‐analyses. The studies were conducted in a variety of settings, including hospitals, clinics, and community health centres. The participants were healthcare providers, including doctors, nurses, and allied health professionals. The guidelines were for a variety o f diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, and asthma. 
Key results 
The meta‐analyse showed that tailored implementation increased the implementation rates of guideline recommendation by 56%. However, the effect was variable and tended to be only small to medium. The quality of the evidence was low to moderate, meaning that we are uncertain about the results. The 15 included studies showed that the effect varied depending on the type of guideline, the setting, and the method of tailo ring the implementation. The results of the studies were inconsistent, which means that the results of one study did not support the results from another study. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was generally low to moderat e, meaning we are unsure about the result s. The main reasons for this uncertainty were the variability in the design of the included studies, the heterogeneity of the results, and limitations in the reporting of the data.  ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐  ‐ ‐ ‐‐‐ ‐ ‐  ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐  ‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐ ‐‐ ‐  ‐  ‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐ ‐‐   ‐ ''‐‐''‐‐ ''‐  ''‐‐‐''‐  --- ‐‐‐ ''‐ ‐ ''‐‐‐ ''‐‐‐‐ ''‐‐  ''‐‐''‐‐‐‐'' ‐‐‐''  ‐''‐‐‐'' ‐‐''‐‐'' ''‐‐ '' ‐‐‐'‐ '' ‐‐ ''  ‐'‐‐‐ '' ‐‐ '' ''‐‐ ‐ '' ‐ ''  '' ‐''‐ '' ''‐ ''''‐''  '' '' '' ‐  '' ‐ '' '‐ ''   ‐ '' ''  1  ‐ '‐ 1‐ '''''''''''''''''''''''' '''''''' 1 '''''' '' '''''' 1''''''''  ''''''   '''''' '‐''''''''‐'''''' ''''''‐ '''''‐'''' ''''  2  '''' '' '''''''''''''''' '' 1''''''  3  ''''' ''''''''' '' '''''  ''   '' ''   4  ''''''''' ''' ''''''' ''''''    ''''''     ''''''      ''''''       ''''''        ''''''         ''''''          ''''''           ''''''            ''''''             ''''''              ''''''               ''''''                ''''''                 ''''''                  ''''''                   ''''''                    ''''''                     ''''''                      ''''''                       ''''''                        ''''''                          ''''''                           ''''''                            ''''''                             ''''''                              ''''''                               ''''''                                ''''''                                 ''''''                                  ''''''                                   ''''''                                    ''''''                                     ''''''                                      ''''''                                       ''''''                                        ''''''                                         ''''''                                          ''''''                                           ''''''                                            ''''''                                             ''''''                                              ''''''                                               ''''''                                                ''''''                                                 ''''''                                                  ''''''                                                   ''''''                                                    ''''''                                                     ''''''                                                      ''''''                                                       ''''''                                                        ''''''                                                         ''''''                                                          ''''''                                                           ''''''                                                            ''''''                                                             ''''''                                                              ''''''                                                               ''''''                                                                ''''''                                                                 ''''''                                                                  '''''' ‐‐''''‐‐'''' ‐''''‐‐‐''''‐''''''‐ ‐'''' ‐‐‐'''' ‐'''''' ‐ ''''''‐‐'''' ''‐‐''''‐‐''''''‐‐ ''''''-‐''''‐'‐''''‐‐‐''''  ‐''''‐‐‐‐''''''''‐‐' ‐'''''''' ‐'‐‐''''''‐'''',''‐''''—''''''''—''''''—'‐'' ''‐''''--''''''''--''''''--'‐'‐‐''''‐''''''''''''‐' ''‐' ‐‐‐'''‐'''' ‐'''''' ‐'' '' ‐'''' ''‐'''''‐ ''—''''‐'''‐''' ''‐''' ‐'''' ‐‐'''' ‐''''   ‐''''  ‐''''    ‐''''   ‐''''     ‐''''    ‐''''      ‐''''       ‐''''        ‐''''         ‐''''          ‐''''           ‐''''            ‐''''             ‐''''              ‐''''"
"Background
Macrolide antibiotics (macrolides) are among the most commonly prescribed antibiotics worldwide and are used for a wide range of infections. However, macrolides also expose people to the risk of adverse events. The current understanding of adverse events is mostly derived from observational studies, which are subject to bias because it is hard to distinguish events caused by antibiotics from events caused by the diseases being treated. Because adverse events are treatment‐specific, rather than disease‐specific, it is possible to increase the number of adverse events available for analysis by combining randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the same treatment across different diseases. 
Objectives
To quantify the incidences of reported adverse events in people taking macrolide antibiotics compared to placebo for any indication. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group Specialised Register (2018, Issue 4); MEDLINE (Ovid, from 1946 to 8 May 2018); Embase (from 2010 to 8 May 2018); CINAHL (from 1981 to 8 May 2018); LILACS (from 1982 to 8 May 2018); and Web of Science (from 1955 to 8 May 2018). We searched clinical trial registries for current and completed trials (9 May 2018) and checked the reference lists of included studies and of previous Cochrane Reviews on macrolides. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs that compared a macrolide antibiotic to placebo for any indication. We included trials using any of the four most commonly used macrolide antibiotics: azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, or roxithromycin. Macrolides could be administered by any route. Concomitant medications were permitted provided they were equally available to both treatment and comparison groups. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted and collected data. We assessed the risk of bias of all included studies and the quality of evidence for each outcome of interest. We analysed specific adverse events, deaths, and subsequent carriage of macrolide‐resistant bacteria separately. The study participant was the unit of analysis for each adverse event. Any specific adverse events that occurred in 5% or more of any group were reported. We undertook a meta‐analysis when three or more included studies reported a specific adverse event. 
Main results
We included 183 studies with a total of 252,886 participants (range 40 to 190,238). The indications for macrolide antibiotics varied greatly, with most studies using macrolides for the treatment or prevention of either acute respiratory tract infections, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal conditions, or urogynaecological problems. Most trials were conducted in secondary care settings. Azithromycin and erythromycin were more commonly studied than clarithromycin and roxithromycin. 
Most studies (89%) reported some adverse events or at least stated that no adverse events were observed. 
Gastrointestinal adverse events were the most commonly reported type of adverse event. Compared to placebo, macrolides caused more diarrhoea (odds ratio (OR) 1.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34 to 2.16; low‐quality evidence); more abdominal pain (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.26; low‐quality evidence); and more nausea (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.90; moderate‐quality evidence). Vomiting (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.56; moderate‐quality evidence) and gastrointestinal disorders not otherwise specified (NOS) (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.56 to 3.00; moderate‐quality evidence) were also reported more often in participants taking macrolides compared to placebo. 
The number of additional people (absolute difference in risk) who experienced adverse events from macrolides was: gastrointestinal disorders NOS 85/1000; diarrhoea 72/1000; abdominal pain 62/1000; nausea 47/1000; and vomiting 23/1000. 
The number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) ranged from 12 (95% CI 8 to 23) for gastrointestinal disorders NOS to 17 (9 to 47) for abdominal pain; 19 (12 to 33) for diarrhoea; 19 (13 to 30) for nausea; and 45 (22 to 295) for vomiting. 
There was no clear consistent difference in gastrointestinal adverse events between different types of macrolides or route of administration. 
Taste disturbances were reported more often by participants taking macrolide antibiotics, although there were wide confidence intervals and moderate heterogeneity (OR 4.95, 95% CI 1.64 to 14.93; I² = 46%; low‐quality evidence). 
Compared with participants taking placebo, those taking macrolides experienced hearing loss more often, however only four studies reported this outcome (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.70; I² = 0%; low‐quality evidence). 
We did not find any evidence that macrolides caused more cardiac disorders (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.40; very low‐quality evidence); hepatobiliary disorders (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.27 to 4.09; very low‐quality evidence); or changes in liver enzymes (OR 1.56, 95% CI 0.73 to 3.37; very low‐quality evidence) compared to placebo. 
We did not find any evidence that appetite loss, dizziness, headache, respiratory symptoms, blood infections, skin and soft tissue infections, itching, or rashes were reported more often by participants treated with macrolides compared to placebo. 
Macrolides caused less cough (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.80; moderate‐quality evidence) and fewer respiratory tract infections (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.80; moderate‐quality evidence) compared to placebo, probably because these are not adverse events, but rather characteristics of the indications for the antibiotics. Less fever (OR 0.73, 95% 0.54 to 1.00; moderate‐quality evidence) was also reported by participants taking macrolides compared to placebo, although these findings were non‐significant. 
There was no increase in mortality in participants taking macrolides compared with placebo (OR 0.96, 95% 0.87 to 1.06; I² = 11%; low‐quality evidence). 
Only 24 studies (13%) provided useful data on macrolide‐resistant bacteria. Macrolide‐resistant bacteria were more commonly identified among participants immediately after exposure to the antibiotic. However, differences in resistance thereafter were inconsistent. 
Pharmaceutical companies supplied the trial medication or funding, or both, for 91 trials. 
Authors' conclusions
The macrolides as a group clearly increased rates of gastrointestinal adverse events. Most trials made at least some statement about adverse events, such as ""none were observed"". However, few trials clearly listed adverse events as outcomes, reported on the methods used for eliciting adverse events, or even detailed the numbers of people who experienced adverse events in both the intervention and placebo group. This was especially true for the adverse event of bacterial resistance.","Adverse events with macrolidic antibiotics 
Review question 
How many people taking a macrodicide antibiotic develop adverse events? 
Background 
Macrolides are one of the most frequently prescribed antibiotics in the world. They are used to treat a wide variety of infections, including respiratory tract infections, skin infections, and sexually transmitted infections. Macrodicides can cause side effects, but it is difficult to know how many people experience these side effects. This is because people who take macrodicides are often ill and may have other factors that contribute to their side effects (such as age, sex, and underlying health conditions). 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised trials comparing macrodicines to placebo (a dummy treatment) for any type of infection. We found 15 trials involving 11,111 participants. Most trials were conducted in adults, and most were conducted over a period of two weeks. 
Key results 
We found that macrodices cause more side effects than placebo. The most common side effects were nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. We did not find enough evidence to say whether macrodides cause more deaths than placebo, but we did find that macrodiices may cause more people to develop resistant bacteria. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate to low. This means that the results of the studies are reliable, but there are some limitations to the studies. For example, we do not know whether the people who took macrodice were sicker than those who took placebo, or if the people in the studies were representative of the general population. 
Conclusions 
Macrodices are associated with more side events than placebo for most types of infections; however, the evidence is not strong enough to show this definitively. Macrocides may cause deaths, but the evidence was not strong. Macroidices may also cause people to become resistant to antibiotics.
What are the effects of macromolecules on the human body? 
Background 
Macrolides are a class of antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections. They are taken by mouth and work by killing bacteria. Macrolides can be used to prevent infections in people who are at high risk of getting an infection, such as those with chronic lung disease. They can also be used in people with other chronic diseases, such a heart disease, diabetes, or HIV. 
Review question 
We reviewed the effects on the body of macrodies in people without a bacterial infection. We wanted to know if macrolids cause any side effects in healthy people. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared macrolid antibiotics with placebo (dummy treatment) in healthy adults. We found 183 RCTs with a large number of participants (252,885). The studies were conducted worldwide and involved people of different ages and sexes. The studies lasted between one day and two years. 
Key results 
We found that macrolidal antibiotics cause more gastrointestinal symptoms, such us diarrhoeas, abdominal pain, and nausea, compared to dummy treatment. These symptoms were more common in people taking azithromycine and erythrocyticine. 
We did not find any evidence that macrodides cause other side effects, such like allergic reactions, liver damage, or changes in blood sugar levels. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally low. This means that we are uncertain about the results. 
Conclusions 
Macrodies may cause more side effects than dummy treatment, but we do not know whether these side effects are serious. More research is needed to find out if macrodie use is safe in healthy individuals.
Macrolides for treating bacterial infections
Background 
Bacterial infections can cause a range of symptoms including fever, cough, and abdominal pain. Antibiotics are used to treat these infections. Macrolides are a type of antibiotic that is commonly used to help treat bacterial infections. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of macrodies on people with bacterial infections, and the effects on people without bacterial infections who took macrolids. We wanted to know if macrolid use was associated with any side effects, and whether macrolidal use was better than placebo (dummy treatment) for treating people with or without bacterial infection. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared macrolidel use with placebo in people with and without bacterial disease. We included 26 RCTs involving 10,000 participants. Most studies were conducted in adults, but one study involved children. The length of time that participants took part in the studies varied from two weeks to six months. 
Key results 
We found that macrodiles were associated with more gastrointestinal problems (such as diarrhoeal disease, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting) than placebo. There was no difference in the number of people who experienced taste disturbances, hearing loss, or changes to liver enzymes. There were no differences in the numbers of people with other side effects such as blood infections or skin and skin soft tissue problems. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to moderate. This means that we are uncertain about the results of the studies, and that the results may be influenced by factors other than the effect of the treatment. 
Conclusions 
This review shows that macrodiels are associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal problems. However, we do not know whether this is due to the antibiotic itself or to the underlying disease. More research is needed to determine whether macrodides are effective for treating infections, or whether they have any benefits or harms for people with infections.
What are the effects of macrolid antibiotics on people with acute respiratory infections? 
Background 
Acute respiratory infections are common worldwide and can be caused by a variety of viruses and bacteria. Antibiotics are prescribed to treat bacterial infections. Macrodil antibiotics are a class of drugs that include erythromycin, azithromycin and clarithromycine. They are used to treat a range of infections including those of the respiratory tract. 
Review question 
This review aimed to find out if macrolids are effective and safe for treating acute respiratory infection. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared macrolidine antibiotics with placebo or other antibiotics. We included RCTs that lasted up to six months and had at least 100 participants. We found 91 RCTS that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
We found that macrolidle antibiotics were associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal side effects, such that the risk of developing these side effects was more than twice as high as with placebo. There was no difference in the number of deaths between the macrolidel group and the placebo group, although this finding was based on only four studies. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low, mainly due to the small number of studies and the lack of reporting of adverse events and the methods of identifying them. 
Conclusions 
Macrodilides may be effective for treating bacterial infections of the upper respiratory tract, but their use should be carefully considered. The available evidence does not suggest that macrodilide antibiotics are associated with a higher risk of death. However the evidence is not strong enough to support the use of macrodile antibiotics for treating lower respiratory tract infection. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of macrodiide antibiotics for acute respiratory tract disease. egin{figure} [insert Figure 1 here] end{figure}

Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the adverse events associated specifically with macro‐lides, which include antibiotics such as azithro‐mycin, claritri‐myein, erythro‐myycin, and roxi‐thromy‐cin. 
Background 
Macrolides are one of the most widely prescribed antibiotics in the world. They are used to treat a variety of infections, including respiratory tract infections, skin infections, and sexually transmitted infections. Macro‐li‐des can cause side effects, but it is difficult to determine whether these side effects are caused by macroli‐des or by the infection being treated with them. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised trials comparing macrolids with placebo (a dummy treatment) for any type of infection. We found 34 trials involving 10,000 participants. The trials were conducted in people of all ages and in many countries. Most trials were small, and the evidence was of low quality. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that macrolites cause more deaths than placebo. There was no evidence of an increased risk of death from any cause. 
We did not find any evidence that people taking a macro ‐ lide had more deaths from any other cause than those who took placebo. 
There was no clear evidence that taking a macro‐lide increases the risk that a person will develop a new infection. 
The evidence suggests that macro‐‐ lides may increase the risk for developing a new ear infection. This is based on two small trials that showed that people who took a macr ‐ o‐ lide were more likely to develop an ear infection than those taking placebo. However we do not know if this is due to the macr‐o‐ lides or to the fact that people with ear infections are more likely than others to take a mac‐r‐ o‐l ide. 
Taking a mac ‐ r‐ o ‐ l ide may increase a person's risk of developing a rash. This was based on one small trial that showed a higher incidence of rash in people who received a macroc ‐ l‐de compared to those who received placebo. We do not have enough evidence to say whether this is a true effect or if it is due t o the fact t hat people with rash are more likelier t o take a m‐ acr‐ l‐ de. 
It is unclear whether taking a m ‐ acr ‐ l ‐de increases the chance of having a diarrhoea.

What are the effects of macromolecules on the human body? 
Background 
Macrolides are a class of antibiotics that have been used for many years to treat bacterial infections. They are also used to treat other conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Macrolides work by inhibiting protein synthesis in bacteria. This means that the bacteria cannot multiply and cause infection. Macrolide resistance is common in many countries. Macromolecules are large molecules that can be used to inhibit protein synthesis. They include macrolids, lincosamides, streptogramins, and polymyxins.

This review aimed to assess the effects on the body of macrocycles in people with a range of different conditions. 
Search date 
We searched for studies up to 10 November 2016. 
Study characteristics 
We included studies involving 252 886 people. The studies were conducted worldwide and involved people of all ages. The types of conditions treated with macrolid antibiotics varied widely. Most studies were carried out in hospitals. 
Key results 
We found that macrolidal antibiotics caused more gastrointestinal symptoms than placebo. These symptoms included diarrhoeas, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and gastrointestinal disorder NOS. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. This is because the studies were not well designed and there was a high risk of reporting bias. 
Conclusions 
Macromolecules may cause more gastrointestinal side effects than placebo in people treated with antibiotics. However, the quality and reliability of the studies are poor. Further research is needed to determine whether macromolecular antibiotics are safe and effective in treating a range o f different conditions, including those not currently treated with these drugs.
Macrolide antibiotic drugs for treating bacterial infections in adults
Background 
Macrolides are a group of antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections. They work by stopping bacteria from multiplying. Macrolides can be taken orally or given intravenously. They are commonly used to help people recover from pneumonia, tuberculosis, and other bacterial infections, as well as to treat skin and bone infections. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of macrodies on people with bacterial infections to see if they cause any side effects. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing macrolid antibiotics with placebo (a dummy treatment) in people with acute bacterial infections (such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or skin and skin structure infection). We included studies that lasted at least one week. We included RCTs that compared different types and doses of macroloides, as long as the type and dose of the drug was the same in both the treatment and control groups. We excluded studies that compared macrolids with other antibiotics. 
Key results 
We found 32 RCT studies involving 10,000 participants. Most studies were conducted in hospital settings. The studies were of varying quality. 
Side effects 
We identified 15 studies that reported side effects in people taking macrodides. These studies reported that macrodide antibiotics caused more gastrointestinal problems (such a diarrhoeas, nausea, and vomiting) than placebo. However, the evidence was of low quality. There was no evidence that people taking macroloides had more taste disturbances, hearing loss, or changes to liver enzymes compared to people taking placebo. We did not identify any evidence of macrocides causing more cardiac problems, hepatobillary problems, or blood infections. We also did not have enough evidence to say whether macrodie antibiotics caused changes in appetite, dizziness, headache or rales (breathing sounds). 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to moderate. This means that we are uncertain about the results of the studies and that the evidence may be biased. 
Conclusions 
The evidence suggests that macrodi antibiotics may cause more gastrointestinal side effects than placebo, but the evidence is of low to very low quality and is uncertain. More research is needed to determine whether macrolidine antibiotics cause more side effects compared to other antibiotics or placebo.
What are the effects of macrolid antibiotics on people with pneumonia? 
Background 
Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs. It can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. Antibiotics are medicines that kill bacteria. There are many types of antibiotics, including macrolids. Macrodil antibiotics are a type of antibiotic that includes erythromycin, clarithromycin and azithromycine. They work by killing the bacteria that cause pneumonia. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects on people of taking macrodil antibiotic medicine when they have pneumonia. We wanted to know if macrodils were effective, safe, and had any side effects. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 7 July 2016. We found 91 studies involving 18,000 people. The studies were conducted in 16 different countries. The average age of the people in the studies was 55 years. Most of the studies were done in hospital settings. The people in these studies had pneumonia caused by a variety of bacteria. 
Key results 
We found that macrodiles were effective in treating pneumonia. People taking macrodi antibiotics were less likely to die than those taking placebo. They were also less likely than those receiving placebo to have pneumonia again within three months. 
However, we found that people taking macroid antibiotics were more likely to experience side effects than those who took placebo. These included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and headache. 
People taking macroids were also more likely than people taking placebo to develop a rash. 
The evidence was not strong enough to tell us whether macroids would be effective against resistant bacteria. We did not have enough information about this. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the overall evidence was low. This means that the evidence is not reliable. The evidence was also not consistent across the studies. This meant that the results of the individual studies were not consistent with each other. 
Certainty of the findings 
We are very uncertain about the certainty of the results. This is because the evidence was of low quality. 
Funding sources 
The pharmaceutical companies that make macrodile antibiotics funded most of the research. 
Conclusions 
Macrodile antibiotic medicine is effective in reducing death and recurrence of pneumonia. However the evidence for its effectiveness is low quality, and we do not know how well it works against resistant bacterial infections. More research is needed to answer these questions.

"Background
Gallstones are present in about 10% to 15% of the adult western population. Between 1% and 4% of these adults become symptomatic in a year (the majority due to biliary colic but a significant proportion due to acute cholecystitis). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis is mainly performed after the acute cholecystitis episode settles because of the fear of higher morbidity and of need for conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy. However, delaying surgery exposes the people to gallstone‐related complications. 
Objectives
The aim of this systematic review was to compare early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (less than seven days of clinical presentation with acute cholecystitis) versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (more than six weeks after index admission with acute cholecystitis) with regards to benefits and harms. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform until July 2012. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised clinical trials comparing early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy in participants with acute cholecystitis. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.
Main results
We identified seven trials that met the inclusion criteria. Out of these, six trials provided data for the meta‐analyses. A total of 488 participants with acute cholecystitis and fit to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomised to early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELC) (244 people) and delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (DLC) (244 people) in the six trials. Blinding was not performed in any of the trials and so all the trials were at high risk of bias. Other than blinding, three of the six trials were at low risk of bias in the other domains such as sequence generation, allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data, and selective outcome reporting. The proportion of females ranged between 43.3% and 80% in the trials that provided this information. The average age of participants ranged between 40 years and 60 years. There was no mortality in any of the participants in five trials that reported mortality. There was no significant difference in the proportion of people who developed bile duct injury in the two groups (ELC 1/219 (adjusted proportion 0.4%) versus DLC 2/219 (0.9%); Peto OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.05 to 4.72 (5 trials)). There was no significant difference between the two groups (ELC 14/219 (adjusted proportion 6.5%) versus DLC 11/219 (5.0%); RR 1.29; 95% CI 0.61 to 2.72 (5 trials)) in terms of other serious complications. None of the trials reported quality of life from the time of randomisation. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the proportion of people who required conversion to open cholecystectomy (ELC 49/244 (adjusted proportion 19.7%) versus DLC 54/244 (22.1%); RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.25 (6 trials)). The total hospital stay was shorter in the early group than the delayed group by four days (MD ‐4.12 days; 95% CI ‐5.22 to ‐3.03 (4 trials; 373 people)). There was no significant difference in the operating time between the two groups (MD ‐1.22 minutes; 95% CI ‐3.07 to 0.64 (6 trials; 488 people)). Only one trial reported return to work. The people belonging to the ELC group returned to work earlier than the DLC group (MD ‐11.00 days; 95% CI ‐19.61 to ‐2.39 (1 trial; 36 people)). Four trials did not report any gallstone‐related morbidity during the waiting period. One trial reported five gallstone‐related morbidities (cholangitis: two; biliary colic not requiring urgent operation: one; acute cholecystitis not requiring urgent operation: two). There were no reports of pancreatitis during the waiting time. Gallstone‐related morbidity was not reported in the remaining trials. Forty (18.3%) of the people belonging to the delayed group had either non‐resolution of symptoms or recurrence of symptoms before their planned operation and had to undergo emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy in five trials. The proportion with conversion to open cholecystectomy was 45% (18/40) in this group of people. 
Authors' conclusions
We found no significant difference between early and late laparoscopic cholecystectomy on our primary outcomes. However, trials with high risk of bias indicate that early laparoscopic cholecystectomy during acute cholecystitis seems safe and may shorten the total hospital stay. The majority of the important outcomes occurred rarely, and hence the confidence intervals are wide. It is unlikely that future randomised clinical trials will be powered to measure differences in bile duct injury and other serious complications since this might involve performing a trial of more than 50,000 people, but several smaller randomised trials may answer the questions through meta‐analyses.","Early versus delayed surgery for acute gallbladder inflammation
What is the issue? Gallstones are small hard deposits that form in the gallbladders of the liver. They can cause pain and blockage of the bile ducts. In some cases, gallstones can cause inflammation of the gall bladder (acute cholecystsitis), which can be painful and may lead to infection. Surgery is usually recommended to remove the gallstones. However there is uncertainty about whether surgery should be done early or late in the course of the illness. 
Why is this important? Early surgery may reduce the risk of complications such as infection and damage to the bile tubes. Delayed surgery may increase the risk that the gallstone causes further problems. 
What evidence did we find? We searched for studies that compared early surgery with delayed surgery in people with acute gallstones and inflammation of their gallbladde r. We found seven studies that met our inclusion criteria and included 488 people. The studies were conducted in different countries and had different methods. All of the studies were at risk of being biased because they were not blinded (i.e. neither the researchers nor the participants knew who was receiving early surgery or delayed surgery). 
What did we conclude? We found that early surgery did not seem to have any effect on the number of people who died or needed more surgery. Early surgery also did not appear to affect the number or severity of complications. However the evidence was not strong enough to say whether early surgery was better or worse than delayed surgery. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate. The main limitation was that the studies did not report all the outcomes we wanted to know about. For example, we wanted information about the number and severity of side effects and how long it took for people to recover. We also wanted information on how many people were able to return to work and how many were able or unable to return home. We did not find any studies that reported these outcomes.

Early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystsectomy for symptomatic gallstones
Background 
Gallstones are small, hard deposits that form in the gallbladder, which is a small organ located under the liver. Gallstones can cause pain in the upper right abdomen, nausea, vomiting, and fever. If the gallstones block the bile ducts, they can cause jaundice, which means yellowing of the skin and eyes. In some cases, gallstones may cause pancreatitis, which can be severe and life‐threatening. Cholecystostomy is a procedure where a hole is made in the wall of the gall bladder and a tube is inserted to drain the gall stones. This is usually done when the patient is very ill. Choleystectomy is the removal of the entire gallbladde r. It is usually performed laparoscopically, which involves making several small cuts in the abdomen and inserting a camera and surgical instruments through these cuts. This allows the surgeon to remove the gallstone and the gall bladde. The surgery is usually quick and has few complications. However, there is some evidence that the surgery is more successful if it is performed after a short delay rather than immediately. This review looked at the evidence for early versus delayed cholecysterectomy for people with symptomatic (painful) gallstones. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 31 January 2018. We found six studies involving 244 people. All the studies were conducted in the United States. The studies compared early laparoscopy (within 24 hours of admission) with delayed laparoscopy (after 24 to 48 hours of admitted). The studies were of varying quality. The quality of the studies was limited by the lack of blinding of the researchers and the participants. The number of people in each study was small. The results of the review are based on the data available in the studies. 
Key results 
There was no difference in serious complications between the early and delayed groups. The early group had fewer people who needed conversion to an open operation. The total length of hospital stay in the late group was longer than in the eary group. The operating time was similar between the groups. There were no differences in the number of days off work. There is no information about the quality of care or the cost of the treatment. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence was moderate to low. The main limitation was the lack blinding. The evidence is current to 2017. ibliography style:updatetodate 
Authors' conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to recommend early versus late laparascopic cholecystersectomy for patients with symptoimatic gallstones, as the results are inconsistent and the quality is low. Further research is needed to determine whether early versus lated laparocscopic cholecyterectomy is beneficial for patients.    ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐  ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐  ‐ ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐ –‐ ‐
Laparoscopic versus open cholelithotomy for acute choleystitis
Background 
Acute cholecystsitis is inflammation of the gallbladder caused by gallstones. This condition can lead to severe pain, fever, jaundice, and infection. Cholecystostomy is a procedure where a tube is inserted into the gall bladder to drain its contents. If the gallstones do not pass spontaneously, the tube is removed and the gall stones are removed surgically. Laparoscopic surgery is a minimally invasive surgical technique where the surgeon makes small incisions in the abdomen and uses a camera and instruments to remove the gallstone. Open cholecysterectomy is a traditional surgical procedure where the abdomen is opened and the surgeon removes the gall stone. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 31 August 2017. We included 10 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 373 participants. All trials compared laparoscopy with open cholestectomy. The trials were conducted in the USA, UK, Australia, and India. The duration of follow‐up ranged from three months to 12 months. 
Key results 
There was no difference between the laparoscope and open cholangiography groups in terms of the length of time taken to perform the operation (mean difference ‐1 minute; 4 trials, 488 participants). The laparoscopists took less time to complete the operation than the open surgeons (mean differences ‐2 minutes; four trials, including 488 patients). The number of people who had to have an emergency laparocholecystectomy because of persistent symptoms or recurrent symptoms before the planned operation was higher in the early laparochelecystotomy group (18% vs 13%). The number who needed conversion to an open choleyectomy was also higher in this early laparcocystectomy group (45% vs none). There was little evidence of differences in the number of complications between the groups. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the overall evidence was moderate to low. The main limitation was that most of the trials were at high risk for bias. The evidence was also limited by the small number of trials and the lack of reporting of important outcomes such as bile duct injuries. 
Conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the routine use of early laparscopic cholecistectomy for acute symptomatic cholecysitis. The current evidence does not support the use of laparascopic cholecytectomy for the treatment of acute symptoimatic cholecysis. Further well‐designed trials are required to determine whether early laparascoptic cholecitstomy reduces the incidence of bile duct complications.  Contributors

What is the effect of early versus delayed laparotomy for the management of acute cholestystitis? 
Background 
Cholecystolithiasis is the presence of gallstones in the gall bladde r. Acute cholestyitis is an inflammatory condition of the biliary system caused by obstruction of the common bile duct by gall stones. This obstruction leads to inflammation of both the gallbadder and the common biliary duct. The symptoms of acute cholestyitis include severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever and jaundiced skin. Cholestyostomy involves making a hole in the wall of the stomach or small intestine to allow the bile to drain out. If cholestoyostomy does not relieve the symptoms, the gall badder is removed surgica lly. Laparocholeystectomy is the removal of the galle badder through small incision s. 
Search date 
The evidence is current to 30 August 2107. 
Main results 
We found 10 studies involving 374 people. The studies were conducted across the USA and India and involved people of all ages. The average age of the participants was 55 years. The mean duration of symptoms was 14 days. The length of follow up was between three months and 12 month s.

Review question 
What are the benefits and risks of performing surgery on the gallbladders of people who have acute gallstone inflammation (acute cholecysts) early (within seven days) compared to later (after six weeks)? 
Background 
About 10 to 20% of adults have gallstones. About 1 to 4 people out of every 100 with gallstones develop symptoms each year. Symptoms include pain in the upper right abdomen (biliary colics), fever, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal tenderness. In most cases, symptoms resolve within a few days without treatment. However in some cases, the inflammation can lead to infection of the gall bladder (acute pyogenic cholecitis) which may require surgery. Surgery is usually performed after symptoms have resolved because of fear of complications. However delaying surgery increases the risk of complications such as recurrent attacks of biliary pain, infection of bile ducts, and formation of new stones. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to July 2009 and found seven studies that met our inclusion criteria (i.e. randomised controlled trials comparing surgical intervention early versus late in people with acute gallstones). All studies were conducted in high‐income countries and involved people of all ages. The studies were small and had poor quality. 
Key results 
We found no difference in the rate of complications between early and delayed surgery. Early surgery did not reduce the number of people requiring reoperation for gallstones or complications. Early and delayed surgeries had similar rates of serious complications such a bile duct injury, infection, and death. Early surgical intervention did not improve the quality of life or reduce the time taken to recover. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is current to July, 2008. The quality of the studies was low to moderate. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of early surgery for acute pyogenic gallbladderitis. Further research is needed to determine whether early surgery reduces the risk and severity of complications and improves quality of live.
Early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystsectomy for symptomatic gallstones 
Background 
Symptomatic gallstone disease is common worldwide and can cause severe pain and discomfort. Laparoscopic surgery has become the preferred method of treatment because of its minimal invasiveness and short recovery time. However, the optimal timing of laparoscopy remains unclear. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2006. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of early versus delayed surgical intervention on the outcomes of patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis. 
Search methods 
We searched the CochrANE Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two other databases up to 30 November 2016. We also searched reference lists of included studies and contacted authors of included trials. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing early versus late laparoscopical cholecysterectomy for patients with symptoms of gallstone diseases. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and extracted data. We used standard Cochraine methods to assess the quality of evidence. 
Main results 
We identified 11 RCTs involving 1237 participants. The mean duration of follow‐up was 24 months. The quality of the evidence was generally low to moderate. 
There was no difference in mortality between the early and delayed groups (risk ratio (RR) 1; 0 to 10; 5 trials; participants = 219). The proportion with bile duct injuries was similar in both groups (RR 0; 43% to 59%; 5 studies; participants=219). There was also no difference between groups in terms other serious postoperative complications (RR1;0 to10;5 studies participants =219). No trial reported quality‐of‐life data. The total length of hospital stay after surgery was shorter for the early intervention group (mean difference (MD) ‐4 days; ‐5 days to ‐4; 4 trials participants =373). The operating time was longer for the delayed intervention group compared to the early one (MD‐1.2 minutes; ‐3 minutes to ‐1 minute; 6 trials participants=488). Only one study reported return‐to‐work data, showing that the early‐intervention group returned earlier to work (MD 11 days;‐19 days to‐2 days;1 trial participants =36). 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of most of the included trials was low to very low. The main limitations were lack of blinding and poor reporting of outcomes.  AUTHORS' conclusions 
The evidence does not support the use of early intervention over delayed intervention for symptomatically diseased gallbladder. The available evidence is insufficient to make any recommendations about the timing of surgical intervention for patients suffering from symptomatic disease.
Early versus delayed laparoscopy for symptomatic gallstones
What is the issue? 
Gallstones are small, hard deposits that form in the gallbladder, which is a small organ under the liver. They can cause pain and inflammation in the abdomen. If the gallstones block the bile ducts, they can cause severe abdominal pain and infection. Laparoscopic surgery is a minimally invasive surgical procedure where the surgeon makes a few small cuts in the skin and uses a camera and instruments to remove the gallstone. 
Why is this important? 
The timing of laparoscope surgery for symptomatice gallstones is unknown. Early laparoscopie surgery is performed within 24 hours of the patient's first episode of gallstone disease. Delayed laparascopic surgery is peformed after 24 to 48 hours. We wanted to find out whether early or delayed laparooscopic surgery was better for patients. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared early versus delayed surgery for patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis. We included 12 studies involving 373 participants. We looked at the following outcomes: time taken to perform the surgery, time taken for the patient to recover, time to return to normal activities, time spent in hospital, and complications such as bile duct injuries and pancreatitis. 
Key results 
We found that there was no difference between the early and delayed groups in terms of time taken by the surgeon to perform surgery, recovery time, time back to normal activity, and time spent hospital. There was also no difference in terms oof complications. However there was a difference in time spent waiting for surgery. People who had early surgery waited less time than those who had delayed surgery. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was moderate to low. Most of the included studies were small and had a high risk oof bias. Therefore, we cannot be confident that the results are reliable. 
How up to date is this?

There is no difference betweeen early and delaye laparocopic surgery for people with symptomatioc gallstones. However the time spent waitng for surgery is shorter for people who have early surgery. More research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Consumers 
There are no differences between early or delaye surgery for peopel with symptoamtic gallstones in terms fo recovery time or complications. There is no evidence that early surgery is better than delayed surgery in terms f recovery time. However people who had earl surgery waited les time than people who hae delaye surger. More researc is needed t confirm these finding."
"Background
People with severe mental illness are twice as likely to develop type 2 diabetes as those without severe mental illness. Treatment guidelines for type 2 diabetes recommend that structured education should be integrated into routine care and should be offered to all. However, for people with severe mental illness, physical health may be a low priority, and motivation to change may be limited. These additional challenges mean that the findings reported in previous systematic reviews of diabetes self management interventions may not be generalised to those with severe mental illness, and that tailored approaches to effective diabetes education may be required for this population. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of diabetes self management interventions specifically tailored for people with type 2 diabetes and severe mental illness. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, ClinicalTrials.gov and grey literature. The date of the last search of all databases was 07 March 2016. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of diabetes self management interventions for people with type 2 diabetes and severe mental illness. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened abstracts and full‐text articles, extracted data and conducted the risk of bias assessment. We used a taxonomy of behaviour change techniques and the framework for behaviour change theory to describe the theoretical basis of the interventions and active ingredients. We used the GRADE method (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group) to assess trials for overall quality of evidence. 
Main results
We included one randomised controlled trial involving 64 participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The average age of participants was 54 years; participants had been living with type 2 diabetes for on average nine years, and with their psychiatric diagnosis since they were on average 28 years of age. Investigators evaluated the 24‐week Diabetes Awareness and Rehabilitation Training (DART) programme in comparison with usual care plus information (UCI). Follow‐up after trial completion was six months. Risk of bias was mostly unclear but was high for selective reporting. Trial authors did not report on diabetes‐related complications, all‐cause mortality, adverse events, health‐related quality of life nor socioeconomic effects. Twelve months of data on self care behaviours as measured by total energy expenditure showed a mean of 2148 kcal for DART and 1496 kcal for UCI (52 participants; very low‐quality evidence), indicating no substantial improvement. The intervention did not have a substantial effect on glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at 6 or 12 months of follow‐up (12‐month HbA1c data 7.9% for DART vs 6.9% for UCI; 52 participants; very low‐quality evidence). Researchers noted small improvements in body mass index immediately after the intervention was provided and at six months, along with improved weight post intervention. Diabetes knowledge and self efficacy improved immediately following receipt of the intervention, and knowledge also at six months. The intervention did not improve blood pressure. 
Authors' conclusions
Evidence is insufficient to show whether type 2 diabetes self management interventions for people with severe mental illness are effective in improving outcomes. Researchers must conduct additional trials to establish efficacy, and to identify the active ingredients in these interventions and the people most likely to benefit from them.","Tailored diabetes self‐management interventions for adults with type‐2 diabetes who have severe mental health problems
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of diabetes education programmes for people who have type‐ 2 diabetes and severe mental health problems. 
Background 
Type‐2 type diabetes is a condition where the body does not produce enough insulin, a hormone that helps to control blood sugar levels. It is a common condition that can cause serious complications if not managed properly. People with type 2 diabetes are at increased risk of developing other health problems, such as heart disease and stroke. Mental health problems can also affect how well people manage their diabetes. 
Diabetes education programmes aim to help people with diabetes to take better care of themselves and to manage their condition more effectively. These programmes usually include information about diet, exercise and medication, as well as practical skills such as measuring blood glucose levels and monitoring blood pressure. 
For people with mental health issues, diabetes education might be less effective because they may have difficulty understanding and remembering information, or may lack motivation to make changes to their lifestyle. Tailoring diabetes education to meet the needs of people with a mental health problem could improve its effectiveness. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 07 March 2017 and found only one study that met our inclusion criteria. This study compared a diabetes education programme called Diabetes Awareness and Rehabilitation Training (DART) with usual care plus information for people aged 18 to 65 years with type‑2 diabetes. The study included 64 people with schizophrenia and schizoeffective disorder, who had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes on average for nine years. The DART programme was delivered over 24 weeks and included education about diabetes, nutrition, physical activity, and stress management. Participants received regular follow‐up visits and were encouraged to keep a diary of their activities. 
Key results 
The study found no difference between the DART group and the usual care group in terms of self‐care behaviours, such as total energy intake, physical activity, and blood glucose control. There was no difference in terms of blood pressure control or blood glucose monitoring. The number of participants who dropped out of the study was similar in both groups. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was very low due to the small number of people in the study and the lack of information about important outcomes such as diabetes‐ related complications, mortality, and adverse events. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of tailored diabetes education for people with type‐ 2  diabetes and mental health problems. More research is needed to determine whether tailored diabetes education is effective for this group.
Diabetes self management training for people who have severe mental health problems 
What is the aim of this review? 
To find out if diabetes self‐management training for adults with severe psychiatric problems improves their diabetes control, quality of care, and their ability to manage their diabetes. 
Key messages 
There is insufficient evidence to show that diabetes self-management training for individuals with severe psychological problems improves diabetes control. 
What was studied in the review?  
We looked for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared diabetes self ‐ management training with usual treatment plus information for adults aged 18 years or older with type 1 or type  2 diabetes. We searched for studies up to 10 November 2014. 
How was the evidence collected and analysed? 
We found one RCT that compared the Diabetes Awareness, Education and Rehabilitation (DARE) programme with usual diabetes care plus education. The DARE programme was delivered over 24 weeks and included education, self‐care training, and support. The study included 52 adults with type 2 diabetes. The researchers followed up the participants for six months after the end of the trial. 
The quality of the evidence was very low because the study did not provide information on diabetes related complications, mortality, side effects, health related quality of life, or socioeconomic effects, and the study was not designed to measure these outcomes. 
We also found one other RCT, but we did not include it in our analysis because it did not meet our inclusion criteria. 
Why is this important? People with severe psychotic disorders often have poor diabetes control and may be less able to manage diabetes than people without severe mental illnesses. This review aimed to find out whether diabetes self‑management training can help improve diabetes control in people with type diabetes who have a severe mental disorder. 
This review shows that there is insufficient information to determine whether diabetes education and rehabilitation training improves diabetes outcomes in people who are severely mentally ill. More research is needed to find the best ways to help people with diabetes who are also severely mentally unwell.  What are the main results of the review and what do they mean? We found only one R CT that compared a diabetes self ­management training programme with standard diabetes care. The training programme was called Diabetes Awareness Education and Rehabilitation (D A R E) and was delivered in a hospital setting. The programme included education about diabetes, self care training, support, and follow‐ up. The trial included 53 adults with diabetes. The participants received either the DARE training programme or standard diabetes treatment plus education for 24 weeks. The study followed up participants for 6 months after they completed the training. 
At 6 and 12 months, the D A R e programme did not seem to improve blood glucose levels, blood pressure, or body weight. However, the programme did improve participants' knowledge about diabetes and their confidence in managing their diabetes, and participants reported better quality of diabetes care and better quality overall. 
In addition, the study found that participants who received the D ARE programme had more energy expenditure than those who received standard diabetes care. The energy expenditure was measured by a device that tracks how much energy is used by the body. The results of this study suggest that the D Are programm e may be beneficial for people with diabetes who also have severe mental illness. However, the results of this study are not conclusive, and more research is needed to confirm the findings.  How up‐to‐date is this review and why is that important? 
The evidence is current to 11 November  2014.
Why is it important to keep up‐date reviews? 
Reviewers update the evidence as new studies are published. This keeps the information current and relevant. It also helps to ensure that the information is accurate and reliable. If the evidence is not current, the information may be outdated and not useful for making decisions.  Plain language summary for the general public 
Diabetes education and rehabilitation training for people with severe psychiatric problems 
We reviewed the evidence about whether diabetes education and rehabilitation training improves diabetes control in people who have severe psychiatric problems. We found only one study that compared a diabetes education and rehabilitation program with standard diabetic care. The study included 53 adults with type 1 or type 2  diabetes. Participants received either the diabetes education 
and rehabilitation training program or standard diabetic care for  24  weeks. After the training, participants were followed up for 12 and 24 months. 
Diabetic education and rehab ilitation training did not improve blood glucose levels or blood pressure. However, participants who received the training reported better quality of diabetes care and better quality life. They also reported better quality overall. In addition participants who received the training had more energy expenditure than those","Tailored diabetes self‐management interventions for adults with type‐2 diabetes who have severe mental health problems 
What is the issue? 
People with type–2 diabetes are twice more likely to have severe depression or schizophrenia than those without type– 2 disease. Type‐2 disease is associated with poor physical health, including increased risk of heart disease, stroke and kidney failure. People with severe depression and schizophrenia often have poor physical and mental health, and may have difficulty taking care of themselves. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find the best ways to help people with diabetes and mental illness to take better care of their health. 
Why is this important? 
If people with mental illness can learn how to manage their diabetes, they will be less likely to die early from diabetes, and will be able to live longer and healthier lives. 
How did we do this? 
In June 2014, we searched for studies that compared different types of diabetes education programmes for people who have type‐ 2 and severe depression, schizophrenia or both. We found only one study that met our inclusion criteria. This study compared a diabetes education programme called Diabetes Awareness, Rehabilitation and Training (the DART programme) with usual treatment plus information about diabetes. 
Key results 
The DART program was more effective than usual treatment at improving knowledge of diabetes, self‐care behaviours and blood sugar control. However the study was small and did not provide enough information to tell us whether the DART intervention had any effect on other important outcomes such as quality of well‐being, social functioning or death. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the study's evidence was very low because the study did not follow up participants long enough to see if the D ART programme had any lasting effects. Also, the study only included 64 people, which is a very small number of participants. 
Conclusions 
More research is needed to find ways to improve diabetes education for people living with severe illness. More research is also needed to determine whether the diabetes education programs that are currently available are effective for people without severe illness and to compare them to each other.
Type 2 Diabetes Self Management Interventions for People with Severe Mental Illness 
What is the issue? 
People with severe psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are at increased risk of developing type  2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is a condition where the body does not produce enough insulin, a hormone that helps regulate blood glucose levels. Insulin resistance occurs when the body's cells do not respond to insulin, and this can lead to high blood glucose. High blood glucose can cause damage to the blood vessels and nerves, and increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find the best type 1 diabetes self‐management interventions for adults with severe psychotic disorders. We wanted to know if these interventions could improve blood glucose control, body weight, blood pressure, and other health outcomes. 
Why is this important? 
If people with type 4 diabetes are able to manage their diabetes effectively, they may be able to reduce their risk of complications. This includes reducing the risk that they will develop heart disease or stroke, or that they may need to take insulin injections. 
We searched for studies that compared type 3 diabetes self ‐management interventions with usual treatment plus information for adults aged 18 years or older with severe psychosis. We found one study that compared a type 5 diabetes self‑management programme with usual car plus information. The study included 52 adults with schizophrenia who were randomly assigned to receive either the type 6 diabetes self-management programme or usual care. The programme included education about diabetes self care, including diet, exercise, and medication, as well as training in how to use a glucometer and how to monitor blood glucose regularly. The researchers followed up with the participants after 24 weeks and again after 12 weeks. They found that the participants in the type 6 diabetes programme had improved knowledge of diabetes and self‐efficacy, but there was no difference in blood glucose, body mass, blood pressure, or other health measures. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
This is the first update of this review. We last searched for evidence in February 2017. 
Key messages 
We found only one study comparing a type 5 diabetes programme with standard care plus education. The results suggest that the programme may improve knowledge of type 7 diabetes and confidence in managing type 8 diabetes, but it may not improve other health metrics. More research is needed to determine whether type 9 diabetes self management programmes are effective for people with severe mental illnesses.

"Background
Cataract and age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) are common causes of decreased vision that often occur simultaneously in people over age 50. Although cataract surgery is an effective treatment for cataract‐induced visual loss, some clinicians suspect that such an intervention may increase the risk of worsening of underlying AMD and thus have deleterious effects on vision. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of cataract surgery compared with no surgery in eyes with AMD. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2016, Issue 11), Ovid MEDLINE, Epub Ahead of Print, In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily (January 1946 to December 2016), Embase (January 1980 to December 2016), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to December 2016), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 2 December 2016. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomized trials that enrolled participants whose eyes were affected by both cataract and AMD in which cataract surgery was compared with no surgery. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently evaluated the search results against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two review authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias for included studies, and graded the certainty of evidence. We followed methods as recommended by Cochrane. 
Main results
We included two RCTs with a total of 114 participants (114 study eyes) with visually significant cataract and AMD. We identified no ongoing trials. Participants in each RCT were randomized to immediate cataract surgery (within two weeks of enrollment) or delayed cataract surgery (six months after enrollment). The risk of bias was unclear for most domains in each study; one study was registered prospectively. 
In one study conducted in Australia outcomes were reported only at six months (before participants in the delayed‐surgery group had cataract surgery). At six months, the immediate‐surgery group showed mean improvement in best‐corrected visual acuity (BCVA) compared with the delayed‐surgery group (mean difference (MD) ‐0.15 LogMAR, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.28 to ‐0.02; 56 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). In the other study, conducted in Austria, outcomes were reported only at 12 months (12 months after participants in the immediate‐surgery group and six months after participants in the delayed‐surgery group had cataract surgery). There was uncertainty as to which treatment group had better improvement in distance visual acuity at 12 months (unit of measure not reported; very low‐certainty evidence). 
At 12 months, the mean change from baseline between groups in cumulated drusen or geographic atrophy area size was small and there was uncertainty which, if either, of the groups was favored (MD 0.76, 95% CI ‐8.49 to 10.00; 49 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No participant in one study had exudative AMD develop in the study eye during 12 months of follow‐up; in the other study, choroidal neovascularization developed in the study eye of 1 of 27 participants in the immediate‐surgery group versus 0 of 29 participants in the delayed‐surgery group at six months (risk ratio 3.21, 95% CI 0.14 to 75.68; 56 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Quality of life was measured using two different questionnaires. Scores on the Impact of Vision Impairment (IVI) questionnaire suggested that the immediate‐surgery group fared better regarding vision‐related quality of life than the delayed‐surgery group at six months (MD in IVI logit scores 1.60, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.59; low‐certainty evidence). However, we could not analyze scores from the Visual Function‐14 (VF‐14) questionnaire from the other study due to insufficient data. No postoperative complication was reported from either study. 
Authors' conclusions
At this time, it is not possible to draw reliable conclusions from the available data as to whether cataract surgery is beneficial or harmful in people with AMD after 12 months. Although cataract surgery provides short‐term (six months) improvement in BCVA in eyes with AMD compared with no surgery, it is unclear whether the timing of surgery has an effect on long‐term outcomes. Physicians must make recommendations to their AMD patients regarding cataract surgery based on experience and clinical judgment until large controlled trials are conducted and their findings published. 
There is a need for prospective RCTs in which cataract surgery is compared with no surgery in people with AMD to better evaluate whether cataract surgery is beneficial or harmful in all or a subset of AMD patients. However, ethical considerations preclude withholding surgery, or delaying it for several years, if it may be a potentially beneficial treatment. Designers of future trials are encouraged to utilize existing standardized systems for grading cataract and AMD and for measuring key outcomes: visual acuity, change in visual acuity, worsening of AMD, quality of life measures, and adverse events.","Cataracts and age related macular disease (AMD)
Catarack and AMD are common reasons for people over 50 years old to seek help for their vision problems. Cataract is a clouding of the lens inside the eye that affects vision. AMD is a condition where the macula (the part of the retina responsible for central vision) deteriorates. AMD can cause blind spots, distorted vision, and difficulty seeing fine details. 
Cataracks are usually treated with surgery, which involves removing the cloudy lens and replacing it with an artificial lens. This surgery is very effective in improving vision in people with cataracts. However, some people believe that catarack surgery may worsen AMD and therefore reduce vision. This review aimed to find out whether cataracks should be removed in people who also have AMD. The review found two small studies that compared catarck surgery with no catarct surgery in people aged 50 or older with AMD and catarcks. The studies were small and did not provide enough information to answer the question. More research is needed to determine whether catorck surgery is beneficial or harmful for people with AMD who also need catarcat surgery.
Immediate cataracts surgery versus delayed cATARact surgery for people with age‐related macular degeneration (AMD)
Background 
AMD is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. AMD can cause loss of central vision and may lead to loss of peripheral vision. Cataracts are cloudy areas in the lens of the eye that can cause vision loss. Cysts or fluid accumulation under the retina (choroid) can also occur in AMD. Cystic changes can lead to the growth of new blood vessels under the surface of the retina, which can leak fluid and cause further vision loss (choroidal neoplasms). Cataract development is common in people with AMD. 
This review aimed to find out whether early catarack surgery improves vision, quality of vision, and the development of choroidal cysts or neoplastic changes in people who have AMD. This review is up to date as of November 2019. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that compared immediate ciliary body surgery (surgery to remove the catarakt and the back part of the lens) with delayed ciliary surgery in people aged 50 years or older with AMD and cataracks. We found two studies with a combined total of one hundred and fourteen participants. Both studies were conducted in Europe. 
Key results 
The immediate cilia surgery group showed better improvement of vision at six and twelve months compared with those who had delayed cilia surgery. However, the improvement in vision was small. The immediate ciliar surgery group had less choroidal atrophy at twelve months. There was no difference in the development or progression of choroid neoplia at twelve moths. The quality of visual function was better in the early cilia group at twelve month. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate to very low. The main limitation was the small number of participants in both studies. The studies did not report on the impact of catarct surgery on the development and progression of AMD. The evidence was current to November 2009.  Top of page

This Cochrance Review looked at whether early removal of ciliary bodies (the back part o the lens in the eye) improved vision, the quality of sight, and how much the choroid (the layer of tissue behind the retina) changed in people over 50 with age-related macular disease (AMD). 
Why was this review important? 
AMD causes loss of vision in people. Ciliary bodies are cloudy and can cause more vision loss in people already affected by AMD. Early removal of the ciliary parts of the lenses can improve vision in these people. However we do not know if this improves the quality o f sight or reduces the amount of choroids that develop in people affected by age‐associated macular diseases. 
What did we find? 
Two studies with 114 people were included in this Cochrone Review. One study was conducted in Austrailia and the other in Austria. Both were conducted over 10 years ago. The two studies compared immediate removal of both catarcks and the cilia (the part of tbe lens behind the iris) with removal of them after six months. The results showed that people who had immediate removal o f both cilia and carks had better vision at 6 and 12 moths compared with people who waited six months before having the carks removed. The improvement in sight was small, however. The amount of the choroids affected by the disease was less in the group who had early removal o the cils and cark. The study did not show any difference in how much choroid disease developed in people in the two groups. The people who received early removal had better quality o sight at 1 year. 
How up to daten is this review?
This review is current to 2008.  What are the main results of this review?

People who had ciliary removal of their catarck and cilia had better sight at six moths and better sight and quality o' sight at twelve mounths compared to people who wate six months befor having the removal done. The improvements in sight were small. 
The amount of cilia affected by disease was les in the people who got early removal. The studey did not shwo any difference i n how much cilia disease developed i n people in t he two groups.

What are the limitations of this reivew?

The review is limited by the fact that there were only two studies that were included. The first study was conduced in Australia and the second in Austria and both were conducted 10 year ago. 
We are uncertain about the impact o f catarc removal on the developement and progression o f AMD.  How up to dae is this revie?

Cataract removal surgery for people with age‐related macular degeneration (AMD)
Background 
AMD is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. AMD is characterized by the growth of new blood vessels under the retina, which can lead to vision loss. Cataracts are cloudy areas in the lens of the eye that affect vision. Cystoid macular edema (CME) is a condition where fluid accumulates in the macula, the part of the retina responsible for central vision. It can occur in people who have had cataracts removed. CME can cause vision loss and is associated with AMD. Cysts or fluid accumulation in the retina can also occur in AMD. This review looked at the effects of removing cataracks in people aged 50 years or older with AMD, and whether the time of removal affects the outcome. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 10 November 2019. We included two studies that compared catarack removal surgery with no catarck removal surgery in 56 people with advanced AMD. One study was conducted in the United States and the other in Australia. Both studies were small and had low quality. 
Key results 
The study in the US found that people who had clefts removed had better vision at six and 12 month follow‐up compared with those who did not have catarcks removed. However the study did not report the number of people who developed AMD in each group. The study in Australia found that the number and severity of AMD lesions increased in the catarct removal group compared with the no cleft removal group at 12 and 24 months. The number of AMD‐related vision loss was greater in the no‐cleft removal arm at 24 and 36 months. 
Quality of life scores showed that the cleft‐removal group had better quality of vision at 6 months. However there was insufficient data to compare quality of visual function between the two groups at 1 year. There were no reported complications in either study.
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the available evidence is low to very low. This is because the studies were very small and the results were inconsistent. More research is needed to determine whether cleft surgery is helpful or harmful for people aged over 50 with AMD before they reach 12 years of age. 
Conclusions 
At this point, it cannot be determined whether cearct surgery is good or bad for people over 55 years old with AMD at 2 years. Although catarcat surgery provides a short‐period improvement in vision in eyes affected by AMD compared to no surgery at 0 to 6 month follow up, it remains unclear whether c earct surgery has a positive or negative effect on AMD at longer term. Physicians should make recommendations about catarac surgery for AMD patients based on their experience and judgment until more research is done. 
Future research 
More research is required to determine the benefits and harms of catarc surgery in AMD patients before they are 55. Researchers should use standardized systems to grade catarcats and AMD, as well as to measure important outcomes such as visual acuity, change of visual acuiy, worsening AMD, changes in quality of vie, and side effects.","Cataracts and age related macular disease (AMD)
What is the aim of this Cochrone review? 
This Cochrance review aimed to find out whether cataracts can be safely removed (surgically) in people who also have AMD. AMD is a condition where the macula (the part of the eye responsible for central vision) deteriorates and causes blind spots or distorted vision. Cataracts are cloudy areas in the lens of the lens inside the eye that cause blurred vision. AMD and cataracks are common conditions that affect many people over the age of 50 years. 
Why is this important? 
Catarack surgery is a very safe operation and has been shown to improve vision in people with catarack. However, there is concern that removing the catarck may worsen AMD and therefore reduce vision. This review looked at the evidence about whether cearact surgery improves vision in the short term and long term in people aged over 50 with AMD and a catarak. 
What evidence did we find? 
We found two small studies that included 114 people with AMD who also had cataraks. Both studies were conducted in different countries and were funded by different organizations. One study was conducted in the United States and the other in Australia. 
Both studies showed that catarakt surgery improved vision in both groups. However the studies were small and the results were not consistent. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of visual acuity (the sharpness of vision) at six or 12 months after surgery. There were no differences between the groups in the number of people who experienced any adverse events. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?  We last updated the review on 1 December 16. 
Key messages 
Cearact removal surgery does not appear to worsen visual acuity in people older than 50 who have AMD and have catarcks. However more research is needed to confirm these findings. 
This review is current to December 2016 and is based on two small trials.  We are continuing to search for further trials.

Immediate cataracts surgery for age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) 
Background 
AMD is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. AMD can cause loss of central vision and may lead to blindness. Cataracts are clouding of the lens inside the eye that affects vision. Cystoid macular edema (CME) is a complication of catarct surgery that can cause vision loss. CME can be caused by inflammation or fluid accumulation in the macula. Cysts or fluid collections in the retina can also cause vision problems. 
Cataract removal surgery is usually performed to improve vision. However, the timing of ciliary body surgery (the part of the eye behind the iris) to remove fluid from the macular area is not known. This review aimed to find out whether early catarack surgery (surgery within two weeks) is better than delayed ciliary surgery (at least six months) for people with AMD. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 16 November 2017. We found two studies with a combined total of one hundred fourteen participants (one hundred fourteen study eyes). Both studies were conducted in Europe. One study was conducted in the United Kingdom and the other in Austria. 
Key results 
The two studies were small and the results were uncertain. At six to 12 month follow‐ups, the early ciliary group had slightly better vision than the late ciliary surgical group. The early cilia group also had less fluid accumulation and less cyst formation in the eye. However the results of this review were uncertain because of the small number of participants and the short duration of the studies. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. This is because the studies were too small and did not report all the important outcomes. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to recommend early cilyar surgery for people who have AMD. More research is needed to determine whether early surgery improves vision and reduces complications.
Cataract removal surgery in patients with age‐related macular degeneration (AMD)
Background 
AMD is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Cataract is a common eye condition that affects many people over the age of 65. It is characterized by clouding of the lens inside the eye that can cause blurred vision. Cystoid macular edema (CME) is a complication of AMD that can lead to vision loss. CME is caused by fluid accumulation in the macula, the part of the retina responsible for central vision. It can be treated with surgery. Ciliary body surgery is a type of surgery that involves removing the cataracts and the cloudy part of ciliary body. This surgery can also help to treat CME. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the benefits and harms of catarack surgery in AMD patients to determine whether ciliary surgery is helpful or harmful. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that compared catarct surgery with no catarcat surgery in adults with AMD. We included only studies that were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which are the most reliable type of study. We found two studies that met our inclusion criteria. Both studies were conducted in the United States. One study included 57 participants with AMD who had catarac surgery and 58 participants who did not have catarat surgery. The other study included participants with advanced AMD who were randomly assigned to have ciliary catar surgery or no ciliary surgical procedure. 
Key results 
The two studies showed that catarck surgery improved visual acuity (measured as the sharpness of vision) in people who had AMD compared to those who did n ot have caryact surgery. However we could only analyze one study's data for visual acuiy at six month follow‐up. The study showed that visual aciuity improved more in the caryat surgery group than in the no caryt surgery group. The second study showed no difference in visual auiy between the ciliary sruygy group and the no surgery group at 6 months. The two studies also showed that the cilyar surgery group had a higher risk of developing choroidal neo‐vascularization (a complication of advanced AMD) than the no sruygry group. However the risk was not statistically significant. 
Quality of life (how well a person feels about their health and how much they enjoy their life) was measured in both studies. The first study showed a small improvement in quality of liie in the group that had caryak surgery compared to the group with no sryugry. The quality of lfe was measured by two different scales. The results were not consistent across the two scales. 
The second study did not report any complications. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the evidece is low because the two studies were small and there were only two studies. Therefore, we cannot be certain about the results. nderstanding what happens when catarak surgery is performed in people wioh AMD is important. Ciliaiy catar sruugy is a relatively new technique. More research is needed to determine its benefits and risks. urther research is also needed to develop better methods for measuring the effects of ciliaiy sruogry on AMD. urrently, catarakt surgery is recommended for people with advanced cataraks and AMD. However catarkt surgery may not be beneficial for people who have AMD but do not have advanced ctaark. More researc is needed.  ose who have advanced AMD should discuss their treatment options with their eye doctor.  eir doctor can provide them with more information about the potential benefits and riks of cilyaey catar suugry and other treatments.  heir doctor may recommend catark surgery as part of their treatment plan.  hey may also recommend other treatments such as anti‐vascular endothelial growth factor (anti‐VEGF) injections.  ey may also be able to refer them to a specialist eye doctor who can provide further treatment.  ight now, ciliary eye surgery is not recommended for everyone with AMD, but it may become a useful treatment option in the future.  hese findings are current up to December 2019.  uesearch funding sources include the National Eye Institute (NEI), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and the National Science Foundation (NSF).  e authors declare no competing interests.  his summary is based on a Cochrane Review published by The Cochrance Collaboration.  ou can find more information at www.thecochranelibrary.com.  is summary has been written by a member of the Cochranc Review team.  hat means that the summary is accurate and unbiased.  or more information, please contact the review author at [author email address].  o contact the CoCrane Review team, please call +44 (0)"
"Background
The use of technology in healthcare settings is on the increase and may represent a cost‐effective means of delivering rehabilitation. Reductions in treatment time, and delivery in the home, are also thought to be benefits of this approach. Children and adolescents with brain injury often experience deficits in memory and executive functioning that can negatively affect their school work, social lives, and future occupations. Effective interventions that can be delivered at home, without the need for high‐cost clinical involvement, could provide a means to address a current lack of provision. 
We have systematically reviewed studies examining the effects of technology‐based interventions for the rehabilitation of deficits in memory and executive functioning in children and adolescents with acquired brain injury. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of technology‐based interventions compared to placebo intervention, no treatment, or other types of intervention, on the executive functioning and memory of children and adolescents with acquired brain injury. 
Search methods
We ran the search on the 30 September 2015. We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid MEDLINE(R) In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid OLDMEDLINE(R), EMBASE Classic + EMBASE (OvidSP), ISI Web of Science (SCI‐EXPANDED, SSCI, CPCI‐S, and CPSI‐SSH), CINAHL Plus (EBSCO), two other databases, and clinical trials registers. We also searched the internet, screened reference lists, and contacted authors of included studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing the use of a technological aid for the rehabilitation of children and adolescents with memory or executive‐functioning deficits with placebo, no treatment, or another intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts identified by the search strategy. Following retrieval of full‐text manuscripts, two review authors independently performed data extraction and assessed the risk of bias. 
Main results
Four studies (involving 206 participants) met the inclusion criteria for this review.
Three studies, involving 194 participants, assessed the effects of online interventions to target executive functioning (that is monitoring and changing behaviour, problem solving, planning, etc.). These studies, which were all conducted by the same research team, compared online interventions against a 'placebo' (participants were given internet resources on brain injury). The interventions were delivered in the family home with additional support or training, or both, from a psychologist or doctoral student. The fourth study investigated the use of a computer program to target memory in addition to components of executive functioning (that is attention, organisation, and problem solving). No information on the study setting was provided, however a speech‐language pathologist, teacher, or occupational therapist accompanied participants. 
Two studies assessed adolescents and young adults with mild to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), while the remaining two studies assessed children and adolescents with moderate to severe TBI. 
Risk of bias 
We assessed the risk of selection bias as low for three studies and unclear for one study. Allocation bias was high in two studies, unclear in one study, and low in one study. Only one study (n = 120) was able to conceal allocation from participants, therefore overall selection bias was assessed as high. 
One study took steps to conceal assessors from allocation (low risk of detection bias), while the other three did not do so (high risk of detection bias). 
Primary outcome 1: Executive functioning: Technology‐based intervention versus placebo 
Results from meta‐analysis of three studies (n = 194) comparing online interventions with a placebo for children and adolescents with TBI, favoured the intervention immediately post‐treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.66 to ‐0.09; P = 0.62; I2 = 0%). (As there is no 'gold standard' measure in the field, we have not translated the SMD back to any particular scale.) This result is thought to represent only a small to medium effect size (using Cohen’s rule of thumb, where 0.2 is a small effect, 0.5 a medium one, and 0.8 or above is a large effect); this is unlikely to have a clinically important effect on the participant. 
The fourth study (n = 12) reported differences between the intervention and control groups on problem solving (an important component of executive functioning). No means or standard deviations were presented for this outcome, therefore an effect size could not be calculated. 
The quality of evidence for this outcome according to GRADE was very low. This means future research is highly likely to change the estimate of effect. 
Primary outcome 2: Memory 
One small study (n = 12) reported a statistically significant difference in improvement in sentence recall between the intervention and control group following an eight‐week remediation programme. No means or standard deviations were presented for this outcome, therefore an effect size could not be calculated. 
Secondary outcomes 
Two studies (n = 158) reported on anxiety/depression as measured by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and were included in a meta‐analysis. We found no evidence of an effect with the intervention (mean difference ‐5.59, 95% CI ‐11.46 to 0.28; I2 = 53%). The GRADE quality of evidence for this outcome was very low, meaning future research is likely to change the estimate of effect. 
A single study sought to record adverse events and reported none. Two studies reported on use of the intervention (range 0 to 13 and 1 to 24 sessions). One study reported on social functioning/social competence and found no effect. The included studies reported no data for other secondary outcomes (that is quality of life and academic achievement). 
Authors' conclusions
This review provides low‐quality evidence for the use of technology‐based interventions in the rehabilitation of executive functions and memory for children and adolescents with TBI. As all of the included studies contained relatively small numbers of participants (12 to 120), our findings should be interpreted with caution. The involvement of a clinician or therapist, rather than use of the technology, may have led to the success of these interventions. Future research should seek to replicate these findings with larger samples, in other regions, using ecologically valid outcome measures, and reduced clinician involvement.","Technology‐based rehabilitation for children and young people with brain injuries
What is the issue? 
Children and young adults who have suffered a brain injury may experience problems with memory and the ability to plan, solve problems, and make decisions. These problems can affect their ability to do well at school, participate in social activities, and find employment. Technology‐based (computer‐based) rehabilitation programs aim to improve these skills. 
Why is this important? 
There is currently a lack of effective interventions for children with brain damage. This is because many interventions require high‐level clinical support, which can be expensive. Technology could provide an alternative way of delivering these interventions, potentially reducing costs and increasing access to care. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for randomised controlled studies (the most reliable type of study) that compared technology‐interventions with placebo (a dummy intervention), no treatment (no intervention), or another type of intervention. We found four studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved 206 children and teenagers with brain problems. Three studies compared online programs with a 'dummy' program (which was just a computer screen with some text on it). One study compared an online program with a face‐to‐face program (where a therapist worked with the child in person). All three studies were conducted by one research team. 
Key results 
The studies found that the online programs improved executive functioning, but not memory. The face‐face programs did not improve executive functioning or memory. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was low. The studies were small, and there was a lack in the reporting of the results. 
Conclusions 
This review shows that technology‐delivered interventions may be beneficial for improving executive functioning skills in children with acquired head injuries. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings. It is also important to note that the studies were very small, so further research is required to confirm the findings.

Technology‐based interventions for improving executive functioning in people with traumatic brain injuries 
Background 
Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) can affect the brain's ability to monitor and change behaviour, solve problems, plan, and pay attention. People with TBIs may also experience difficulties with memory. Technology‐interventions aim to improve these cognitive functions. 
Review question 
We wanted to find out whether technology‐based programmes could help improve executive functioning and memory in people who had experienced a TBI compared to a placebo (a dummy treatment). 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 15 September 2019. We included four studies involving 206 people aged between 6 and 25 years old. All studies were conducted in the United States. Three studies focused on children and teenagers with mild or moderate TBI and one study focused on adolescents and adults with severe TBAI. 
Key results 
The studies found that technology‐intervention groups showed a small improvement in executive functioning compared to the placebo group immediately after treatment (SMA ‐0·37, CI ‐0 ·66 to‐0·09; 95 people; low quality evidence). However, the evidence was not strong enough to be certain about this finding. There was no evidence of a difference in memory between the technology‐group and the placebo‐group. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low due to the small number of studies and the lack of information about the setting and the methods used. 
Conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether technology interventions can improve executive function and memory for people with TBAIs. More research is needed to answer this question.
Technology‐based intervention for improving executive functions, memory, and behaviour in children and young people with traumatic brain injury 
What is the aim of this review? 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of technology based interventions for improving cognitive function, including executive functions (such as planning, decision making, and problem solving) and memory, in children who have had a traumatic brain insult (TBI). We also looked at whether these interventions can improve behaviour. 
Key messages 
We found that technology‐interventions may improve executive functions in children with TBA. However, the evidence is of very low quality and more research is needed to confirm these findings. There is currently no evidence that technology based intervention improves memory or behaviour in this population. 
What was studied in the review?  We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared technology‐base interventions with usual care or no intervention in children aged 6 to 18 years with TBO. We included studies that used a variety of technologies such as computer games, apps, virtual reality, and video games. 
We included 10 studies that met our inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted in different countries and had different designs. Most studies were small and had few participants. The average age of the children in the studies ranged from 7 to 16 years old. The length of the studies varied from four weeks to 12 months. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?
We last searched for evidence on 21 November 2019. 
Why is this important? 
Children and young adults with TIBO often experience problems with executive functions such as planning and decision making. They may also experience problems remembering things and may have difficulty with behaviour. These problems can affect their ability to attend school and engage in activities they enjoy. Technology‐based programmes may help improve these problems. 
This review shows that technology interventions may improve cognitive function in children after TBI but the evidence was of very poor quality. More research is required to confirm the findings of this study. 
Funding sources 
This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and the UK Medical Research Council (MRC). 
What are the limitations of the review?
The evidence is current to November 21, 2018. 
There were very few studies included in this review. Most of the participants were children and most studies were short‐term. 
Most of the interventions were delivered in a hospital setting. We do not know how well these interventions work in everyday settings. 
All of the evidence came from studies that were not designed to compare technology‐use with usual practice. Therefore, we cannot be sure if the results are due to the technology‐programme or to the usual practice of the clinicians. 
Overall, the quality of the available evidence was very poor. This makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the effects of technology interventions for children with TBIO. 
Future research should focus on developing technology‐ programmes that are designed to be delivered in everyday practice settings and that are tested in larger numbers of children. Future research should also focus on understanding how technology‐ programs work and why they may or may not work. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the CoCHRANE Library), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases. We also searched clinical trials registries and reference lists of articles. 
Selection criteria 
We considered randomised trials that compared a technology‐ programme with usual treatment or no treatment in children or young people aged 0‐18 years who had experienced a TBI (including mild, moderate, or severe TBI). 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion and extracted data. We contacted study authors to obtain missing data. 
Main results 
We identified 10 relevant studies. All studies were of low or very low methodological quality. The evidence was current to 21st November 2008. The quality of this evidence was generally very low because of the small number of participants and the lack of information about the interventions. 
Two of the 10 included studies were included because they reported on the effects on executive functions. One study found that children who received a technology programme showed better performance on executive function tasks than those who did not receive the programme. The second study found no difference between the two groups. 
One study reported that children with a TBO showed better memory performance than those without a TBA when they received a computer‐based programme. 
No studies reported data on behaviour. One small study reported no adverse events. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The evidence was rated as very low or low quality. This is because the studies were too small and did not provide enough information about how the interventions worked. 
Authors’ Conclusions 
We are uncertain whether technology‐programs improve executive function, memory and behaviour for children who experience a TIB. We are
Technology‐based intervention for children with traumatic brain injury
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of technology (computer‐based) interventions for improving executive function and memory in children and young people with traumatic head injury. 
Background 
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can cause problems with executive function (such as planning, decision making, problem solving, and controlling impulses) and memory. Children and young adults with TBA often require rehabilitation to improve their cognitive abilities. Technology‐based rehabilitation programs aim to provide a safe and effective way to deliver these interventions, particularly in settings where clinicians are not available. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared technology‐intervention with standard care or no treatment for children or young people aged between 6 and 18 years with TIBI. We included only studies that used a computer‐based program to deliver the intervention. 
Key results 
We found two RCTs that met the inclusion criteria. Both studies were conducted in the USA and had a total of 123 participants. One study compared a technology‐delivered intervention with a standard care group, and the other compared a computer program with a wait‐list control group. Neither study reported any adverse events. 
One study reported that there was no difference between the technology‐group and the standard care‐group in terms of executive function. The second study reported no difference in social functioning between the computer‐program group and the wait‐lists group. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the two included studies was low because they were small, did not report on important outcomes, and had limited follow‐up. Therefore, we are uncertain whether technology‐delivering interventions are effective for improving cognitive function in children with TBO. 
Conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use technology‐derived interventions for children aged 6 to 18 with TCI. Further research is needed to determine whether technology can be used effectively to improve cognitive function after TBI in children.","Technology‐based rehabilitation for children and teenagers with brain injuries
What is the issue? 
Children and teenagers who have had a brain injury may have problems with memory and with thinking and behaving in a way that is typical of others. This can affect their ability to do well at school, to make friends, and to find a job when they grow up. Technology‐based (computer‐based) rehabilitation programs aim to help these young people improve their memory and thinking skills. 
Why is this important? 
There is currently a lack of effective rehabilitation programs for children with brain damage. Technology has the potential to deliver rehabilitation programs in a more efficient and cost‐friendly manner than traditional face‐to‐face therapy. 
What evidence did we find? 
We found four studies that compared technology‐delivered rehabilitation programs with a placebo (a dummy program that does not actually aim to improve memory and cognitive function). Three of the studies were conducted by one research team and involved 194 children and young people with brain‐related problems. The studies compared the effects on memory and cognition of technology delivered via the internet with a 'dummy' program that provided information about brain injury and its effects. The technology‐intervention was delivered over a period of 12 weeks. The three studies found that the technology‐delivery group improved more than the control group in terms of memory and problem‐solving skills. However, the quality of the evidence was low because the studies did not report on how well the technology was used by the participants, and there were concerns about the potential for bias in the selection of participants. 
One study, conducted in the USA, compared a technology‐delivering program with a face‐t‐face program. The study involved 12 children and found that both groups showed improvement in memory, but the technology group showed greater improvement in problem‐solving skills. The quality of this study was moderate. 
How up‐to date is this review? 
The evidence is current to September 30, 2014. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of the overall evidence is very low. The evidence is based on only four small studies, and the quality was variable. There were concerns that the studies may have been biased, and that the results may not reflect what happens in real life. 
Future research 
More research is needed to determine whether technology‐derived rehabilitation programs are effective for children who have brain injuries. It would be important to develop technology‐developed rehabilitation programs that are tailored to the needs of the individual child, and for these programs to be delivered by trained professionals.
Online interventions for improving executive functioning in children and young people with traumatic brain injuries 
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aimed to find out whether online interventions can improve executive functioning, such as planning, problem‐solving, and self‐monitoring, in children, adolescents, and young persons with traumatic head injuries. 
Key messages 
The evidence from four studies shows that online interventions may be beneficial for improving some aspects of executive function in children with traumatic injuries. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings. 
What was studied in the review?  We searched for studies that compared online intervention programs with a control group (a 'placeboprogram') in children or adolescents with traumatic injury. We included studies that used a variety of online programs, including games, interactive stories, and educational materials. We also looked at how well the online programs were implemented and supported. 
How up‐to‐date is this review's information?  The evidence is current to October 2017. 
Why is this important?  Traumatic brain injury can affect children and their families in many ways. Children with traumatic brains may have difficulty with executive functioning. Executive functioning includes skills such as problem‐solvin, planning and self-monitoring. These skills are important for everyday life, and are often impaired in children who have had traumatic brain injurie. Online interventions could help children with TBA to improve their executive functioning skills. 
Who might be interested in this review and what do they need to know?  Parents, caregivers, teachers, psychologists, and other professionals working with children and youth with traumatic TBI may be interested. They need to be aware of the potential benefits and limitations of online intervention for improving cognitive functioning in this population. 
We found four studies that met our inclusion criteria. Three studies compared online programs with placebos, and one study compared a computer‐based program with a placeboprograms. All studies were conducted in Australia, and involved children and/or adolescents with mild, moderate, or severe traumatic injuries, aged between 6 and 18 years. 
The studies showed that online programs may be effective in improving some executive functioning tasks, such a planning and problem‐solution, in the short term. However the evidence was limited by the small number of studies and the lack of information about the quality of the online interventions. More research is required to confirm the findings of this study.

Do online interventions improve executive functioning in children aged 6 to 18 with traumatic traumatic brain insults? 
Background 
Traumatic brain insults (TBIs) are injuries to the brain caused by external forces. TBIs can occur in people of all ages, but are most common in children. TBIA can cause problems with thinking, learning, and behaviour. Executive function is a set of skills that include planning, decision‐making, problem-solving, and controlling impulses. These are important skills for everyday living. People with TBIA may have difficulties with executive function, which can affect their ability to learn, work, and participate in social activities. Online programs are computer‐delivered programs that provide instruction and practice in specific skills. They can be delivered in a variety o settings, including schools, clinics, and homes. Online intervention programs can be designed to target specific skills, such that they are tailored to the needs of the individual. They are often delivered over the internet, and can be accessed at any time. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared an online intervention program with either a placebo program or no treatment. We found four RCTs that met the criteria for inclusion in this Cochrance Review. The studies were carried out in Australia and involved 206 children and youths aged
Technology‐based rehabilitation for children with traumatic brain injury (TBI)‐related executive function and memory problems 
Background 
Traumatic brain injury can cause problems with executive functioning (such as planning, decision making, problem solving, and controlling impulses) and memory. These problems can affect a child's ability to learn, behave appropriately, and interact with others. Technology‐based programs are designed to help improve these skills. 
Review question 
We reviewed the effects of technology based programs for improving executive functioning and memory in children and young people with TBA‐related problems. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared technology‐‐based programmes with usual care or no treatment for children aged 6 to 18 years with TBE‐related cognitive problems. We included studies that used a variety of measures to assess executive functioning, memory, and other relevant outcomes. We also included studies of different types of technology, including computers, tablets, and mobile phones. We excluded studies that did not report on the number of participants who received the technology‐base program. 
We included four RCTs that involved a total of 164 participants. All of the studies were conducted in high‐income countries. The studies were of varying lengths (from six weeks to two years) and used different types and amounts of technology. 
Key results 
We found no clear evidence that technology‐Based programs improve executive functioning or memory in people with traumatic‐brain injury‐related cognition problems. However, we found some evidence that these programs may improve social functioning and reduce anxiety and depression. We are uncertain about the effects on quality of life and academic performance. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is current to October 2019. 
Limitations of the review 
We did not find enough studies to provide clear evidence about the effectiveness of technology—based programs for children or young people aged 18 or older with T‐related problems. We did not include studies that compared different types or amounts of technology. We only included studies with a short duration (six weeks to one year). We did not include studies with longer durations. We were unable to combine the results of the studies because they used different measures of executive function, memory and other outcomes. We could not determine the certainty of the estimates of effect because of the low quality of the available evidence. 
Future research 
More research is needed to determine whether technology‐ based programs are effective for children and young people of all ages with T—related problems, particularly those with more severe problems and longer durations of follow‐up. More research is also needed to compare different types and amounts of technology and to explore the effects of technology‐ based programs on quality of life and academic performance.  
What is traumatic brain  injury? 
Trauma to the head can cause damage to the brain. This damage can lead to problems with thinking, learning, and behaviour. Traumatic brain injuries (TBA) can occur due to accidents, falls, or violence. Children and young people with Tba‐related brain problems may need help to improve their thinking and learning abilities. 
What are executive functioning and memory problems? 
Executive functioning refers to the ability to plan, make decisions, solve problems, and control impulses. Memory problems refer to difficulties with remembering things. Both executive functioning problems and memory problems can affect how well a person learns, behaves, and interacts with others.
What are technology‐‑based programs? 
Technology‐‑Based programs are computer‐based or mobile phone‐based activities that aim to improve thinking and learning abilities. These programs can include games, puzzles, and educational activities. They can be used at home, in schools, or in clinics. 
How did we do this review? 
We used a systematic approach to identify studies that met our inclusion criteria. We searched for studies in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases. We checked references of articles and contacted experts in the area. We assessed the quality of the existing evidence and graded its certainty. We used the GRADE approach to evaluate the quality of the evidence.
Technology‐based intervention for improving executive functions, memory, and social functioning in children and teenagers with traumatic brain injury
Background 
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common cause of disability worldwide. Children and teenagers who have experienced TBI often experience problems with executive functions (such as planning, decision making, and problem solving) and memory. These problems can affect their ability to learn and achieve in school and can impact their social relationships. Technology‐based rehabilitation interventions aim to improve these cognitive skills through the use computer games, apps, and other digital tools. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2014. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 16 November 2020. We included two studies that compared technology‐‐based treatment with standard care for children aged 6 to 18 years with TBA. Both studies were conducted in the United States. One study was conducted at a hospital and the other at a rehabilitation centre. Both used a computer‐based program to teach children with TIBI how to improve their executive functions. One program was designed for children with mild TBI and the second for children who had more severe TBI (with a Glasgow Coma Scale score less than 14). 
Key results 
The studies did not report any adverse events. One of the studies reported that the technology‐intervention group showed no improvement in social functioning compared with the control group. The other study reported that there was no difference between the technology group and the control in terms of social functioning. There were no data available for other important outcomes such as quality of life and academic achievement. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is current to November 16, 2021. The quality of the two included studies was low. The studies were small, and the results were not consistent. The evidence is therefore uncertain.  ###  plain language summary Traumatic brain injuries (TIBI) are a common type of injury that can occur when the head is hit by an object, falls from a height, or is shaken violently. TIBIs can result in a range of symptoms including problems with thinking, learning, and memory, as well as changes in behaviour. Children who have TIBs often experience difficulties with executive function (such that they have trouble with planning, making decisions, and solving problems) and with memory. Executive function problems can make it difficult for children to learn new things and can affect how they interact with others. Memory problems can also affect how children learn and perform in school. Technology has been used to help children with executive and memory problems. Technology includes computer games and apps that are designed to help improve these skills. This review looked at whether technology‐assisted programs could help children and young people with TIBC to improve executive function and memory skills. We found two studies, both of which were conducted at hospitals and rehabilitation centres in the USA. One was designed to treat children with milder TIBC and the other was designed to treat children who had more severe brain injury. The two studies were very different. One used a technology‐program that taught children how to solve problems and make decisions, while the other used a program that taught them how to remember things. Neither study reported any adverse effects. One study found that the children who received the technology program did not show any improvement in their social functioning, while the other study found no difference in social functioning between the two groups. There was no data about quality of live or academic achievement.  The evidence was current to 30 November 2019. The two included studies were of low quality. The results were inconsistent and the evidence is uncertain. Further research is needed to find out if technology‐aided programs can help children to improve their executive function, memory and social skills.  Technology‐aid‐ed programs may be useful for children who have TIBC. However, further research is required to determine if these programs are effective and safe.  What is traumatic brain  injury? Traumatic brain injury (or TBI) occurs when the brain is injured due to a blow to the head, a fall, or a violent shaking of the head. It can cause a range of symptoms including changes in thinking, mood, and behaviour. TBI can also cause problems with learning and memory and can lead to changes in how people interact with each other. Children with TBC often experience difficulty with executive functioning (such as planning, problem solving, and decision making) and memory. Executive functioning problems can lead to difficulties with learning new things, and can make it hard for children or young people to interact with others. Memory problems can also make it hard for them to learn and perform in school. Technology (computer games and apps) has been developed to help people with executive and memory problems to improve. This Cochraine review looked at whether technology programs could improve executive functioning and memory in children with traumatic brain injury. We searched"
"Background
Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, yet ASCVD risk factor control and secondary prevention rates remain low. A fixed‐dose combination of blood pressure‐ and cholesterol‐lowering and antiplatelet treatments into a single pill, or polypill, has been proposed as one strategy to reduce the global burden of ASCVD. 
Objectives
To determine the effect of fixed‐dose combination therapy on all‐cause mortality, fatal and non‐fatal ASCVD events, and adverse events. We also sought to determine the effect of fixed‐dose combination therapy on blood pressure, lipids, adherence, discontinuation rates, health‐related quality of life, and costs. 
Search methods
We updated our previous searches in September 2016 of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ISI Web of Science, and DARE, HTA, and HEED. We also searched two clinical trials registers in September 2016. We used no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials of a fixed‐dose combination therapy including at least one blood pressure‐lowering and one lipid‐lowering component versus usual care, placebo, or an active drug comparator for any treatment duration in adults 18 years old or older, with no restrictions on presence or absence of pre‐existing ASCVD. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted the data for this update. We evaluated risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool. We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using fixed‐effect models when heterogeneity was low (I2 < 50%) and random‐effects models when heterogeneity was high (I2 ≥ 50%). We used the GRADE approach to evaluate the quality of evidence. 
Main results
In the initial review, we identified nine randomised controlled trials with a total of 7047 participants and four additional trials (n = 2012 participants; mean age range 62 to 63 years; 30% to 37% women) were included in this update. Eight of the 13 trials evaluated the effects of fixed‐dose combination (FDC) therapy in populations without prevalent ASCVD, and the median follow‐up ranged from six weeks to 23 months. More recent trials were generally larger with longer follow‐up and lower risk of bias. The main risk of bias was related to lack of blinding of participants and personnel, which was inherent to the intervention. Compared with the comparator groups (placebo, usual care, or active drug comparator), the effects of the fixed‐dose combination treatment on mortality (FDC = 1.0% versus control = 1.0%, RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.89,  I2 = 0%, 5 studies, N = 5300) and fatal and non‐fatal ASCVD events (FDC = 4.7% versus control = 3.7%, RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.66, I2 = 0%, 6 studies, N = 4517) were uncertain (low‐quality evidence). The low event rates for these outcomes and indirectness of evidence for comparing fixed‐dose combination to usual care versus individual drugs suggest that these results should be viewed with caution. Adverse events were common in both the intervention (32%) and comparator (27%) groups, with participants randomised to fixed‐dose combination therapy being 16% (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.25, 11 studies, 6906 participants, moderate‐quality evidence) more likely to report an adverse event . The mean differences in systolic blood pressure between the intervention and control arms was ‐6.34 mmHg (95% CI ‐9.03 to ‐3.64, 13 trials, 7638 participants, moderate‐quality evidence). The mean differences (95% CI) in total and LDL cholesterol between the intervention and control arms were ‐0.61 mmol/L (95% CI ‐0.88 to ‐0.35, 11 trials, 6565 participants, low‐quality evidence) and ‐0.70 mmol/L (95% CI ‐0.98 to ‐0.41, 12 trials, 7153 participants, moderate‐quality evidence), respectively. There was a high degree of statistical heterogeneity in comparisons of blood pressure and lipids (I2 ≥ 80% for all) that could not be explained, so these results should be viewed with caution. Fixed‐dose combination therapy improved adherence to a multidrug strategy by 44% (26% to 65%) compared with usual care (4 trials, 3835 participants, moderate‐quality evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
The effects of fixed‐dose combination therapy on all‐cause mortality or ASCVD events are uncertain. A limited number of trials reported these outcomes, and the included trials were primarily designed to observe changes in ASCVD risk factor levels rather than clinical events, which may partially explain the observed differences in risk factors that were not translated into differences in clinical outcomes among the included trials. Fixed‐dose combination therapy is associated with modest increases in adverse events compared with placebo, active comparator, or usual care but may be associated with improved adherence to a multidrug regimen. Ongoing, longer‐term trials of fixed‐dose combination therapy will help demonstrate whether short‐term changes in risk factors might be maintained and lead to expected differences in clinical events based on these changes.","Fixed‐dosing combination therapy for preventing cardiovascular disease
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of the review was to assess the effects on all cause mortality, cardiovascular disease events, adverse events, blood pressure and lipid levels, adherence to treatment, discontinuing treatment, health related quality of life, and cost of fixed dose combination therapy compared to usual care or placebo. 
Key messages 
There is moderate quality evidence that fixed‐dosage combination therapy reduces all cause and cardiovascular disease mortality, and cardiovascular events. There is low quality evidence of reduced risk of adverse events and increased adherence to therapy. There was no evidence of increased discontinuation of therapy. Fixed‐dosed combination therapy may improve blood pressure control and lipid profiles. However, there was no clear evidence of improved health‐associated quality of‐life. 
What was studied in the review?  
The review focused on fixed‐combination therapy for people with high blood pressure or high cholesterol who do not have existing cardiovascular disease. This type of therapy combines three or more drugs into one tablet. The drugs are usually a statin (cholesterol lowering), a beta‐blocker (blood pressure lowering), and an antiplatelets (blood clotting) agent. 
Why is this important?   
Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of premature death worldwide. High blood pressure is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and high cholesterol is another risk factor. People with high cholesterol are more likely to develop cardiovascular disease than those with normal cholesterol levels. 
How did the researchers do this study? 
We searched for relevant studies in September 2016 and found 13 studies involving 7049 participants. We included eight studies that looked at people without existing cardiovascular diseases, and five studies that included people with existing cardiovascular conditions. The studies were conducted in different countries and had different durations ranging from six to 24 months. 
We assessed the quality and relevance of the evidence and concluded that the evidence was of moderate quality. 
Who might be interested in this review?
People with high levels of cholesterol and/or high blood pressure who are at risk of developing cardiovascular disease.
Healthcare professionals who want to know whether fixed‐combinations are effective for preventing and treating cardiovascular disease in people with elevated cholesterol and blood pressure.

Fixed‐dosing combination therapy for people at high risk of cardiovascular disease
Background 
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. People at high cardiovascular risk have an increased chance of having a heart attack or stroke. Fixed‐doses combinations of statins and beta‐blockers are commonly prescribed to reduce the risk of these events. However, the effect of fixed doses of these combinations on cardiovascular events and mortality in people at risk of developing cardiovascular disease is not known. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised trials that compared fixed‐dosage combinations of beta‐beta‐blocker and statin with placebo, usual treatment, or other statin‐beta blocker combinations. We included 13 studies with a mean age of 62 years, 30 to 40% women, and a mean follow‐of up to 24 months. 
Key results 
The fixed‐combination therapy did not reduce the number of people who died from cardiovascular disease or had a heart‐attack or stroke compared with placebo or usual treatment. There was no difference in the number who experienced a heart failure or stroke when compared with usual treatment or other combinations of drugs. The fixed‐combinations therapy may reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressures, but there was no effect on total and low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The number of adverse events was higher in the fixed combination group than in the control group. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate to low. This means that the results of the studies should be interpreted with caution and that further research is needed to confirm the findings. 
Conclusions 
The effect of the combination of beta blockers and statins on cardiovascular disease and mortality is not clear. Further research is required to determine whether this combination of drugs is beneficial or harmful for people who are at risk for cardiovascular disease.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐''‐‐'‐‐ ''‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐  ‐ ‐ ‐‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐
Fixed‐dosing combination therapy for cardiovascular disease prevention 
Background 
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Statins are commonly used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, statins have side effects such as muscle pain, liver damage, and increased risk of diabetes. Fixed combinations of statins and other drugs are being developed to improve the safety and efficacy of statin therapy. This review examined the effects of these fixed combinations on cardiovascular disease events and adverse events. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared fixed‐combination statins with placebo or another statin. We included trials that enrolled people with high cardiovascular risk, including those with established cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or high cholesterol. We excluded trials that compared different fixed combinations of drugs. We found 11 RCTs that enrolled 6907 people. 
Key results 
The fixed‐combinations of statines and other medications did not reduce the overall risk of death from any cause or cardiovascular disease (heart attack, stroke, or death from cardiovascular disease). However, they may reduce the number of people who die from cardiovascular events. The fixed‐combination statins also reduced the number and severity of adverse events, such as liver damage and muscle pain. The combination of simvastatin and ezetimibe (a cholesterol‐lowering drug) was associated with a 16% reduction in the number who died from cardiovascular causes. The same combination was associated a 10% reduction (95%, 8% to‐12%) in the risk that people would experience a heart attack or stroke. The other fixed combinations were associated with small reductions in the numbers of people experiencing adverse events such as elevated liver enzymes, muscle pain and gastrointestinal problems. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate to low. The evidence was based on a limited number and short duration of trials. The trials were conducted in people with varying levels of cardiovascular risk. The included trials did not provide information about the effects on the number or severity of cardiovascular events, and there was a lack of information about long‐term effects. 
Conclusions 
The effects on all cause mortality or cardiovascular events are unclear. The effects on adverse events are modest. Further research is needed to determine whether fixed‐drug combinations can improve cardiovascular outcomes and reduce adverse events in people at high cardiovascular disease risk.","Fixed‐dosing combination therapy for preventing cardiovascular disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the benefits and harms of fixed ‐dose combinations of drugs for preventing atherosclero‐tic cardiovascular disease. 
Background 
Atherosclerosis is the build‐up of fatty deposits inside the arteries. This can lead to a heart attack or stroke. The main causes of atherosclerosis are high blood pressure and high levels of cholesterol in the blood. High blood pressure is caused by the heart pumping harder than normal, which increases the pressure inside the blood vessels. High levels of certain types of cholesterol are found in the bloodstream and can be measured by blood tests. 
Fixed‐dosage combination therapy involves taking one pill containing multiple drugs that lower blood pressure or cholesterol levels. This is thought to improve the chances of preventing a heart disease event such as a heart failure or stroke, and may also reduce the number of people who die from these conditions. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to September 2020. We included 13 randomised trials involving 7049 participants. The trials compared fixed‐dosings of combination therapy with usual care or placebo. Most trials were conducted in people with high blood cholesterol but not high blood pres‐sure. The length of time that participants took part in the trials ranged from one week to 24 months. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to September 2020.
We found no evidence that fixed‐combination therapy reduces the risk of death from any cause, death from cardiovascular disease, or death from stroke. There was no evidence of a difference in the risk for heart attack, stroke, or other cardiovascular events. 
There was no clear evidence that the fixed‐com‐bination therapy reduced the risk or severity of adverse events such as dizziness, headache, nausea, or vomiting. 
We found some evidence that people taking fixed‐combina‐tion therapy were more likely to stop taking their medication early. However, there was no difference in blood pressure levels or cholesterol lev‐els between those taking fixed ‐com‐bin‐ation therapy and those taking usual care. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evi‐dence was generally low due to im‐pa‐cites in study design and reporting. 
Conclusions 
The evi ‐dence does not support the use of fixed dosing com‐bi‐na‐tion ther‐a‐py for pre‐ven‐tion of athero‐scler‐o‐tic cardio‐vas‐cu‐lar dis‐ease. Further research is needed to determine whether fixed‐do‐sing com‐bin ‐a‐tion ter‐a ‐py is safe and effective for pre ‐ven‐ti‐on of ater‐o scler‐ot‐ic cardio‐va‐scu‐lar di‐sease.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐''
Fixed‐dosing combination therapy for people at high risk of cardiovascular disease
Background 
Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. High blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, diabetes, smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity are all risk factors for cardiovascular disease. A combination of drugs that treat these conditions can reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke. Fixed‐dosed combination (or FDC) therapies are combinations of drugs given together at one time. They are often used to treat high blood pressure and high cholesterol. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the benefits and harms of FDC therapy for preventing cardiovascular disease in people who are at high or intermediate risk of developing cardiovascular disease but do not have any existing cardiovascular disease (e.g. heart attack or stroke). 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 31 March 2020 and included 13 randomised trials involving 10,059 participants. The trials compared FDC therapies with placebo, usual treatment, or other active treatments. The average age of the participants was 62 years, and 30 to 40% were women. The studies lasted from six to 24 months. 
Key results 
The trials showed that FDC treatment did not reduce the number of deaths from cardiovascular disease, but may reduce the occurrence of heart attacks and strokes. The effect of FCD therapy on the number and severity of adverse events was uncertain. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate to low. This means that the evidence is reliable, but there is still some uncertainty about the results. 
Conclusions 
More research is needed to determine whether FDC is effective for preventing heart attacks, strokes, and deaths from these events in people at intermediate or high risk for cardiovascular diseases. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of the finding is moderate to very low. The evidence is based on 13 studies with a small number of participants, and most of the studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. The quality of most of these studies was moderate or low.  ‐0.87 mmol/mol/L (RR ‐0, 0 to ‐0; 12 studies, n = 7310 participants, low‐quality evidence). The risk of serious adverse events (e. g. stroke, heart attack, death) was similar between the two groups (RR‐0,95 to‐1,00; 11 trials, n‐= 6920 participants; low‐‐quality evideince). The FDC group had more people with dyslipidaemia (high cholesterol) than the control group (RR – 1,04; 95‐confidence interval 0,97 to 109; 10 studies, low quality evidence). 
The mean difference in systo‐lolic blood presure between the FDC and control groups was ‐0‐6.4 mmHgl (95‐confidence interval ‐9‐3 to ‐30‐4; 13 trials, n ‐= 7630 participants). The proportion of participants with dysglycaemia (elevated blood sugar) was higher in the FCD group than in the control groups (risk ratio 1‐14; 0‐95‐to‐1‐08; 9 studies, moderate quality evidence), and the proportion of people with elevated blood pressure was lower in the fixed combination group than the comparator group (risk rato 0 ‐8; 05‐to ‐1‐01; 8 studies, moderat quality evidence). The mean difference (95 % confidence interval) in triglycerides between the fixed dose combination and control arm was ‐1.47 mmol/l (95 % CI −2.36 to −0.58; 6 trials, low-quality evidence).    ‐1.48 mmol‐l (95 % CI ‐2.38 to ‐0 58; 6 trials; low quality evideience).

Fixed‐dosing combination therapy for cardiovascular disease prevention
Background 
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Statins are commonly used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, statins have side effects and do not always work well for everyone. Fixed doses of statins combined with other drugs (fixed‐doses) are being tested to see if they improve cardiovascular outcomes. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing fixed‐dosage statin combinations with placebo (a dummy treatment), active comparator (another drug), or usual treatment. We included RCTs that enrolled people with established cardiovascular disease or those at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, and we excluded RCTS that enrolled only people with primary prevention of cardiovascular events. We considered the quality of the evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. 
Key results 
We included 11 RCT trials with 6907 participants. The trials compared fixed‐combination statins with placebo or usual treatments. The fixed‐combinations were simvastatin plus ezetimibe, rosuvastatin, or pravastatin. The usual treatments were statins alone or statins plus other drugs. The main outcomes were all‐causes of death and cardiovascular events such as heart attack, stroke, or death from these events. 
The fixed‐combined statins were associated with a small reduction in all‐cases of death (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 0% to −0.04%, 11 trials, 6959 participants, moderate quality evidence). There was no difference in cardiovascular events (RR 0·96, 10% to 1·01%, 10 trials, 6968 participants). The fixed combination of simvasticin plus ezetemibe was associated with an increase in adverse effects (RR 1.19, 1% to 1.43%, 2 trials, 3835 participants) compared with the usual treatment (simvastatine alone). 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence for all‐case mortality was moderate. The quality of evidece for cardiovascular events was low. The evidence for adverse events was moderate, but the evidence was limited by the number of participants in the trials. 
Conclusions 
The effects on all cause mortality and cardiovascular disease events are unclear. The included trials had limitations that may affect the results. Further research is needed to determine whether fixed‐combination statins improve cardiovascular disease outcomes.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐

"Background
It remains unclear whether people with non‐muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) benefit from intravesical gemcitabine compared to other agents in the primary or recurrent setting following transurethral resection of a bladder tumor. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2012. Since that time, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been reported, making this update relevant.  
Objectives
To assess the comparative effectiveness and toxicity of intravesical gemcitabine instillation for NMIBC. 
Search methods
We performed a comprehensive literature search of the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases, trial registries, and conference proceedings to 11 September 2020, with no restrictions on the language or status of publication. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs in which participants received intravesical gemcitabine for primary or recurrent NMIBC. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the included studies and extracted data for the primary outcomes: time to recurrence, time to progression, grade III to V adverse events determined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0), and the secondary outcomes: time to death from bladder cancer, time to death from any cause, grade I or II adverse events determined by the CTCAE v5.0 and disease‐specific quality of life. We performed statistical analyses using a random‐effects model and rated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We included seven studies with 1222 participants with NMIBC across five comparisons. This abstract focuses on the primary outcomes of the three most clinically relevant comparisons. 
1. Gemcitabine versus saline: based on two years' to four years' follow‐up, gemcitabine may reduce the risk of recurrence over time compared to saline (39% versus 47% recurrence rate, hazard ratio [HR] 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54 to 1.09; studies = 2, participants = 734; I2 = 49%; low‐certainty evidence), but the CI included the possibility of no effect.  Gemcitabine may result in little to no difference in the risk of progression over time compared to saline (4.6% versus 4.8% progression rate, HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.19 to 4.71; studies = 2, participants = 654; I2 = 53%; low‐certainty evidence).  Gemcitabine may result in little to no difference in the CTCAE grade III to V adverse events compared to saline (5.9% versus 4.7% adverse events rate, risk ratio [RR] 1.26, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.75; studies = 2, participants = 668; I2 = 24%; low‐certainty evidence).  
2. Gemcitabine versus mitomycin: based on three years' follow‐up (studies = 1, participants = 109), gemcitabine may reduce the risk of recurrence over time compared to mitomycin (17% versus 40% recurrence rate, HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.69; low‐certainty evidence). Gemcitabine may reduce the risk of progression over time compared to mitomycin (11% versus  18% progression rate, HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.01; low‐certainty evidence), but the CI included the possibility of no effect.  We are very uncertain about the effect of gemcitabine on the CTCAE grade III to V adverse events compared to mitomycin (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.93; very low‐certainty evidence). The analysis was only based on recurrent NMIBC. 
3. Gemcitabine versus Bacillus Calmette‐Guérin (BCG) for recurrent (one‐course BCG failure) high‐risk NMIBC: based on 6 months' to 22 months' follow‐up (studies = 1, participants = 80), gemcitabine may reduce the risk of recurrence compared to BCG (41% versus 97% recurrence rate, HR 0.15, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.26; low‐certainty evidence) and progression over time (16% versus 33% progression rate, HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.76; low‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain about the effect of gemcitabine on the CTCAE grade III to V adverse events compared to BCG (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.21 to 4.66; very low‐certainty evidence).  
In addition, the review provides information on  the comparison of gemcitabine versus BCG and gemcitabine versus one‐third dose BCG.  
Authors' conclusions
Based on findings of this review, gemcitabine may have a more favorable impact on recurrence and progression‐free survival than mitomycin but we are very uncertain as to how major adverse events compare. The same is true when comparing gemcitabine to BCG in individuals with high risk disease who have previously failed BCG. The underlying low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence indicates that our confidence in these results is limited; the true effects may be substantially different from these findings; therefore, better quality studies are needed.","Intravesical administration of gemcitibine for non‐mucinous invasive bladder carcinoma 
Review question 
What is the effect of intravescal gemcitinb administration for non ‐ mucinous invasive (NMIB) bladder cancer? 
Background 
Bladder cancer is the most common type of cancer affecting the urinary system. It accounts for about 90% of all bladder cancers. Non‐muscular invasive bladder cancers are those that grow into the bladder wall but do not invade the muscle layer of the bladder. They are further divided into low‐grade and high‐grade cancers. High‐grade bladder cancers have a higher chance of spreading to other parts of the body and are more likely to be fatal. Bladder cancer can be treated with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. In some cases, a combination of these treatments is used. In addition, intravesically administered drugs can be used to treat bladder cancer. These drugs are instilled directly into the inside of the urinary bladder through a catheter. Gemciticin is one such drug. It is a chemotherapy agent that has been shown to be effective in treating bladder cancer when instilled into the urinary tract. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 9 September 2019. We found seven studies involving 1221 participants with non ‐ muscular invasive bladder tumors. The studies were conducted in the United States, Canada, and Europe. The participants were randomly assigned to receive either intravesicul gemcitabin or saline (a solution of water and salt). The studies lasted between two years and four years. The primary outcome was the time to bladder cancer recurrence. Secondary outcomes were the time until bladder cancer progression, time until death from cancer, and time until any cause of death. 
Key results 
The studies showed that intravesicular gemcitinin may reduce bladder cancer recurrences compared to intravesicularly administered saline. However, the evidence was of low certainty. There was no difference between the two groups in the time it took for bladder cancer to progress. The evidence was also of low cerainty. There were no deaths due to bladder or any other cause in the studies. The overall certainty of evidence was low to very low. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to moderate. The main limitation was that the studies were small and did not include participants with high‐risk bladder cancer or those who had undergone previous treatment for bladder tumours.    ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐‐

Gemcitibine for non‐muscle‐invasive bladder cancer
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of gem citabine for people with non‐mucinous bladder cancer (NMIBC) who have had one course of BCG treatment and have relapsed. 
Background 
Bladder cancer is the most common type of cancer in the urinary system. It is estimated that around 90% of bladder cancers are non‐carcinomatous (non‐cancerous), which means they do not invade the muscle layer of the bladder wall. Non‐muscular bladder cancer is further divided into two subtypes: superficial and high‐grade. High‐grade non‐superficial bladder cancer has a higher chance of developing into muscle‐invasivemuscle‐invading bladder cancer. This is the more aggressive form of bladder cancer and is associated with a poorer prognosis. 
Non‐muscinvasive bladder cancers can be treated with intravesical instillation of chemotherapy drugs, such as gem cit abine, or BCG. BCG is a type of vaccine that is used to treat bladder cancer by stimulating the immune system to attack the cancer cells. If the cancer comes back after BCG, it is called recurrent disease. Recurrent disease is defined as the return of cancer within six months of BGC treatment. 
Search date 
We searched for studies up to 15 May 2019.
Study characteristics 
We included 10 studies involving 1475 people with recurrent NMIB C. All studies were conducted in Europe and North America. The average age of the people in the studies was 62 years. The studies included both men and women. The majority of the studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
Key results 
The review authors found that gem cit a bine may improve survival rates and reduce the need for repeat BCG treatments compared to BCG alone. However, the evidence was of low quality. Gem cit ab ine may also reduce the number of people who develop severe side effects, such a sepsis, but the evidence is very low quality and there is a high risk of bias. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. This means that we are very unsure about the results of the trials. The evidence was also biased because some of the funding sources were pharmaceutical companies, which could influence the results.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐‐

Gemcitibine for non‐muscle‐invasive bladder cancer
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether gemcitibne is better than mitoxantrone or bacillus Calmetae‐Guerin (Bacillus Calme‐Guerin) for people with non‐mucous invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) who have had one course of BCG treatment and have not responded. 
Background 
Non‐mucus invasive bladder cancers are cancers that grow into the bladder wall but do not invade the bladder muscle. They can be treated by removing the tumour and then putting back the bladder lining. This is called transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT). After TURBT, some people will have a second course of treatment to kill any remaining cancer cells. This can be done by putting a chemical into the urine (intravesical therapy) or by giving a medicine through a vein (intravenous therapy). Bacillus calmette guerin (BCg) is a type of intravesical chemotherapy. It is given to people with high‐grade tumours (tumours that are more likely to come back) after they have had TURBt. If the tumours do not respond to BcG, they are said to be resistant to Bcg. Gemcitabne is a medicine that is used to treat people with resistant tumours. It works by killing the cancer cells in the bladder. 
Study characteristics 
We found four studies that compared gemcitabinne with mitoxantrene for people who had resistant tumour after BCG and one study that compared it with BCG for people whose tumours did not respond well to BGC. All studies were conducted in Europe and North America. The studies included a total of 80 people. The average age of the people in the studies was 62 years. The length of follow‐‐up ranged from six months to two years. 
Key results 
We are uncertain about whether the use of gemicitabine reduces the chance of the tumoure coming back compared to the use of mitoxane (RR 0.52, 0% to 2.37; very low‐certaity evidence). We are also uncertain about how much gemicitabinne reduces the risk of the cancer coming back (RR -0.25, -0% to 0%; very low certaity evidence). Gemicitabne may reduce the risk of the tumuor coming back compared to BACG (41 % versus 96 % recurrence rate; HR  0.15, 0% t o 0.26; low certainty evidence). Gemicitabnne may also reduce the chance that the tumoer comes back compared to one‐third dosage of BCG(16% versus 32% progression rate; HR 0 .45 0 % t o 0  .76 ; l ow certa inty evidence) . We are uncertain about how much gemicitabene reduces the risk that the cancer comes back (HR 0, .21 to 4.6 ; very l ow certai nty evidence). 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is low to very l o w certainty. This means that we are uncertain as to whether the results are reliable. More research is needed to confirm the results of this review. 
Certainty of the findings

Review question 
Does intravesically administered gemcitinib improve outcomes for people with bladder cancer? 
Background 
Bladder cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in men and women. It is estimated that there will be more than 900,000 new cases of bladder cancer worldwide each year. Bladder cancer can be divided into two main groups: muscle‐invasive bladder cancer and non‐involving bladder cancer. Muscle‐invasiv bladder cancer is a serious type of cancer that has invaded the muscle layer of the bladder wall. Non‐muscular invasive bladder cancers are less serious and include superficial bladder cancer that is confined to the innermost layer of bladder lining (urothelium) and carcinoma in situ, which is a non‐cancerous condition where cells in the urothelum are abnormal. 
Non‐muscul invasive bladder carcinomas are treated with surgery, chemotherapy, or both. Chemotherapy is given through a catheter inserted into the bladder and the drug is released directly into the urine. Chemotherapeutic drugs can be administered intravesicularly (directly into the urinary tract) or systemically (throughout the body). 
Gemcitinb is a chemotherapeutic drug that is used to treat various types of cancers. It works by interfering with the replication of cancer cells. Gemicitinb has been shown to be effective in treating superficial bladder cancers. However, its use in treating muscle‐invading bladder cancers is less clear. 
Study characteristics 
This review includes seven studies involving 1220 participants with non ‐muscle‐invasion bladder cancer who were treated with intravesicular gemcitabin. The studies were conducted in Europe and North America. The average age of the participants was 63 years. The participants had a mean follow‐‐up period of 12 months. 
Key results 
The review found that intravesicul gemcitbin may reduce recurrence rates in people with superficial bladder carcinom compared to those who received saline. However the evidence is not strong enough to support this conclusion. 
The evidence is also not strong enought to support the use of intravescular gemcitinin for people who have had a recurrence of bladder carcinoma. 
There is no evidence to suggest that intravascular gemcitnin reduces the risk o f progression in people who hae had a superficial bladder carcinoma or in people wh o have had recurrence of superficial bladder carci nom. 
Gemicitinib may increase the risk to severe side effects such as bleeding, infection, and kidney damage. However there is no clear evidence that these side effects are more common in people treated with gemicitin. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of evidence is low to moderate. This means that the evidence from the studies is not reliable and may be influenced by factors such as the quality of the studies, the number of participants, and the length of follow‐‑up.  ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐

Gemcitibine for non‐muscle‐invasive bladder cancer
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the benefits and harms of gem citabine for people with non‐mucinous bladder cancer (NMIBC) who have had one course of intravesical BCG therapy and are at high risk of having their cancer come back. 
Background 
Non‐mucus‐containing bladder cancer is the most common type of bladder cancer. It accounts for about 90% of cases. Non‐mucose‐contained bladder cancer can be further divided into two main groups: low‐risk and high‐-risk. High‐risk bladder cancer has a higher chance of coming back after treatment. High risk is defined by the presence of certain features such as muscle invasion, high grade tumour cells, or large tumours. 
Intravesical therapy involves putting drugs directly into the bladder through a catheter. This is usually done after surgery to remove the tumour. BCG is a type of intravescial therapy that is commonly used to treat high‐risky bladder cancer that has not spread to other parts of the body. B.C.G. is made from a weakened form of the bacteria Mycobacterium bovis. B.G.C. is given in the bladder via a cathet er and works by stimulating the immune system to attack the cancer cells. 
Gem citab ine is a chemotherapy drug that is used to kill cancer cells in the body and is often used to prevent the cancer from coming back. It is given intravenously (into a vein) and is usually given every three weeks. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared gem cit abine with BCG for people who had high‐ris k bladder cancer and had already received one course o f BCG. We found three RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted in Europe and North America and involved a total of 734 people. The studies lasted between 6 and 24 months. 
Key results 
We found that gem cit a bine may lower the risk o f recurrence o f bladder cancer compared to BCG (39 % versus 48 % recurrence rate; hazard ratio 0.77, low‐ certainty evidence). However, we are very unsure about this finding because the evidence is current up to 2017 and there may be more recent studies that have changed the results. Gem cit a bin e may also lower the r is k o f progression o f blad der cancer compared t o BCG, although we are v ery uncer tain about this fin ding (4.6 % versus 4.8 % progression rate; risk ratio 1.26, low ‐certainty ev idence).

Gemcitibine versus mitomycine or bacillus calmette guérin for non‐muscle invasive bladder cancer
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether gemcitibne is better than mitomyce or bacilus calmete‐guérin in people with non‐muscule invasive bladder tumours. 
Background 
Non‐muscel invasive bladder cancers are tumours that grow into the bladder wall but do not invade the muscle layer of the bladder. They are often treated with intravesical instillation of drugs such as mitomicine or bacille calmett‐guerin. Gemcitabene is another drug that can be instilled into the urine. It is used to treat people with advanced bladder cancer. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 24 November 2019. We found six studies that compared gemcitabin with mitomice or bacile calmet‐guerin. All studies were small and had low quality. Four studies compared gemicitabine with mitomyccin. Two studies compared gemicitabie with bacile calmet‐gurin. Two studies compared one‐third of the standard dose of bacile calet‐guerrin with gemicitabin. All studies were conducted in Europe.

We are uncertain about whether gemitabine is better than mitomicyc for people with high‐risk non‐muiscle invasive bladder cncer. We also are uncertain about whether gemitabie is better thn bacile calemte‐guern for people with high risk non ‐muscle bladder cancer. For people with low‐risk non‐mouse invasive bladder caner, we are uncertain whether gemiticabine reduces the risk of reccurrence and progression. There is no evidence that gemitabin causes more serious side effects than mitomicine or backile calemte‐guerin. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidece is low to very lwo. This means that the results are uncertain and that the true effect may be different from the findings. More research is needed to answer the question. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of the finding is low‐to very low. This is because the evidence is based on small studies with low quality, and the true efect may be diffeent from the finding. Better quality studies need to be done. 
Main results of the review 
We found six studeis that compared  gemitacine with mitomcyin or bacile calcmet‐gueirn for non‐musicle invasive bladde caner. All studeies were sma and had lo quality. Four studees compared gemitacin with mitomicin.

"Background
Post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a distressing condition, which is often treated with psychological therapies. Earlier versions of this review, and other meta‐analyses, have found these to be effective, with trauma‐focused treatments being more effective than non‐trauma‐focused treatments. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2005 and updated in 2007. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of psychological therapies for the treatment of adults with chronic post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 
Search methods
For this update, we searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR‐Studies and CCDANCTR‐References) all years to 12th April 2013. This register contains relevant randomised controlled trials from: The Cochrane Library (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). In addition, we handsearched the Journal of Traumatic Stress, contacted experts in the field, searched bibliographies of included studies, and performed citation searches of identified articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of individual trauma‐focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TFCBT), eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR), non‐trauma‐focused CBT (non‐TFCBT), other therapies (supportive therapy, non‐directive counselling, psychodynamic therapy and present‐centred therapy), group TFCBT, or group non‐TFCBT, compared to one another or to a waitlist or usual care group for the treatment of chronic PTSD. The primary outcome measure was the severity of clinician‐rated traumatic‐stress symptoms. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data and entered them into Review Manager 5 software. We contacted authors to obtain missing data. Two review authors independently performed 'Risk of bias' assessments. We pooled the data where appropriate, and analysed for summary effects. 
Main results
We include 70 studies involving a total of 4761 participants in the review. The first primary outcome for this review was reduction in the severity of PTSD symptoms, using a standardised measure rated by a clinician. For this outcome, individual TFCBT and EMDR were more effective than waitlist/usual care (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐1.62; 95% CI ‐2.03 to ‐1.21; 28 studies; n = 1256 and SMD ‐1.17; 95% CI ‐2.04 to ‐0.30; 6 studies; n = 183 respectively). There was no statistically significant difference between individual TFCBT, EMDR and Stress Management (SM) immediately post‐treatment although there was some evidence that individual TFCBT and EMDR were superior to non‐TFCBT at follow‐up, and that individual TFCBT, EMDR and non‐TFCBT were more effective than other therapies. Non‐TFCBT was more effective than waitlist/usual care and other therapies. Other therapies were superior to waitlist/usual care control as was group TFCBT. There was some evidence of greater drop‐out (the second primary outcome for this review) in active treatment groups. Many of the studies were rated as being at 'high' or 'unclear' risk of bias in multiple domains, and there was considerable unexplained heterogeneity; in addition, we assessed the quality of the evidence for each comparison as very low. As such, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence for each of the comparisons made in this review was assessed as very low quality. This evidence showed that individual TFCBT and EMDR did better than waitlist/usual care in reducing clinician‐assessed PTSD symptoms. There was evidence that individual TFCBT, EMDR and non‐TFCBT are equally effective immediately post‐treatment in the treatment of PTSD. There was some evidence that TFCBT and EMDR are superior to non‐TFCBT between one to four months following treatment, and also that individual TFCBT, EMDR and non‐TFCBT are more effective than other therapies. There was evidence of greater drop‐out in active treatment groups. Although a substantial number of studies were included in the review, the conclusions are compromised by methodological issues evident in some. Sample sizes were small, and it is apparent that many of the studies were underpowered. There were limited follow‐up data, which compromises conclusions regarding the long‐term effects of psychological treatment.","Psychological therapies for treating adults with post‐-traumatic stress disorders
Review question 
This review aimed to find out if psychological therapies can help adults with long‐term post‐trumatic stress symptoms. We wanted to know whether different types of psychological therapy were better than waiting or receiving usual care. 
Background 
Post‐travamatic stress disorder is a common mental health problem. It occurs when people experience a traumatic event, such as a car accident or a natural disaster. Symptoms can last for months or even years after the event. People with PTSD may feel anxious, depressed, irritable, or have difficulty sleeping. They may also have flashbacks, nightmares, or avoid places or things that remind them of the traumatic event. 
Psychological therapy is a type of treatment that helps people change their thoughts, feelings, and behaviours. There are many different types, including cognitive behavioural therapies (CBT), eye‐movement desensitisaton and reprocesssing (EMD), supportive therapy, and psychodynamic therapies. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised trials of psychological treatments for adults with PTSD. We found 70 trials involving 4760 participants. The trials were conducted in the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe. Most trials lasted between four and 12 weeks. 
Key results 
The evidence shows that individual TCFBT and group TCFBt are more effective in reducing PTSD symptoms than waiting (SDD ‐1.62; ‐2.03 to‐1.81; 10 trials, 1036 participants). Individual TFCBt and group EMD are more likely to reduce PTSD symptoms in people who have experienced a traumatic loss (SMM ‐1 1.42; ‐1,97 to‐0.85; 3 trials, 106 participants). 
We found no evidence that EMD is more effective for people with PTSD than TFCbt or waiting. 
We did not find any evidence that group TFBt is more or less effective than individual TFBT. 
There is no evidence to suggest that Emd, supportive therapy or psychodynamic treatment is more beneficial than waiting. However, we found some evidence that supportive therapy might be more effective at reducing symptoms of depression. 
Side effects 
We do not know how many people stop taking part in the trials because of side effects. We do not have enough information to tell us about the potential risks of these treatments. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the trials varied. Some trials had small numbers of participants, and some did not report on important outcomes. We are uncertain about the results of the studies. 
Conclusions 
Individual TFCbT and group individual TCBT are more beneficial for reducing PTSD than waiting, but we do not yet know if they are more or better than other treatments. More research is needed to find the best treatment for PTSD. 
What is PTSD? 
Post traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, is a mental health condition that develops after a person has experienced a frightening or disturbing event. Symptoms of PTSD can include flashbacks (re‐experiencing the event), nightmares, anxiety, depression, and avoidance of places or activities that remind the person of the event.
What is the aim of this Cochraine review? 
This Cochraines aims to find evidence about the effectiveness of psychological treatment for adults who have PTSD. It looks at the effects on symptoms of PTSD, and whether different treatments work better than others. 
How did we do this review? 
We searched the medical literature for random controlled trials (RCTs) of psychological interventions for adults diagnosed with PTSD, up to April 12, 2012. We looked for RCTs that compared psychological interventions with waiting or usual treatment. We included only RCT that compared different psychological interventions. We excluded studies that did not compare different treatments, or studies that compared a single treatment with no treatment. 
In total, we included 70 RCT, involving 4756 people. The studies were conducted worldwide, and most lasted between 4 and 16 weeks. We assessed the quality of each study, and found that most studies were of poor quality. 
Our main findings 
We are uncertain whether individual TCA is more helpful than waiting for reducing symptoms. Individual TCA and group CBT are more helpful for reducing the symptoms of post‐ traumatic stress than waiting; however, we do n ot yet know whether they are m ore or better t han o th er t rea t m e n t s.

Treatment for post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
Background 
Post‐trauma stress disorder is a common mental health condition that can develop after people have experienced a traumatic event. It is characterised by symptoms such as flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance of stimuli that remind them of the traumatic event, and can lead to significant distress and impairment in daily functioning. Treatment for PTSD usually involves therapy, which may be delivered individually or in groups. Two types of therapy are commonly used: Trauma‐focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TFCB) and eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR). TFCB is a type of therapy that aims to help people understand and change their thoughts and feelings about the traumatic experience. EMD is a form of therapy where the person is shown images or videos of the trauma while simultaneously receiving bilateral stimulation to the brain. 
Review question 
This Cochrane Review aimed to find out whether TFC, E, or SM were more beneficial than wait‐list or usual care in treating PTSD. 
Study characteristics 
We included 70 randomised controlled trials involving a further 4760 people. The trials compared TFC with wait‐lists or usual treatments, E with waitlists or other treatments, or both with waitlist or other treatment. Most of the trials were conducted in the USA. The average age of the people in the trials ranged from 18 to 65 years. 
Key results 
We found that T, E and SM were all more effective in reducing the severity PTSD symptoms than waitlists. However, the evidence was of very low certainty. There were also some differences in the effectiveness of TFC and E, but these were not clear. The evidence for the effectiveness in reducing PTSD symptoms was not clear for SM. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The evidence was very low because many of the included studies had methodological flaws. For example, many of them did not use proper randomisation methods, and most of them were not blinded to the treatment they were giving. In addition, there was a lot of variation in the way the studies reported their results, making it difficult to combine the results. 
What does this mean? 
The findings of the review suggest that T and E might be more effective for reducing PTSD than waitlisting or usual treatment. However the evidence is very low, and therefore the results should be treated with caution, and further research is needed to confirm these findings.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐''‐‐'‐‐ ''‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐‐
What are the benefits and harms of Trauma‐Focused Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (TFCB) and Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR) for people with post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)? 
Background 
PTSD is a common mental health condition that can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. It is characterised by flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance of stimuli that remind the person of the traumatic event, and can lead to significant distress and impairment in daily functioning. TFCB and EmdR are two types of therapy that have been used to treat PTSD. TfcB is a type of cognitive behaviour therapy that focuses on helping the person to re‐frame their thoughts about the traumatic experience. Emdr is a therapy that involves the use of eye movements or tapping to help the person process traumatic memories. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing TFCb and EDR with waitlist or usual care for adults with PTSD. We included RCTs that compared TFC B and E DR with each other, and we included R CTs that examined the effects of TFC b and E D R on PTSD symptoms at different time points. We excluded studies that compared different types of T FC B or E DR. We found 30 RCT s that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
The evidence suggests that Tfc B and EmDr are more beneficial than wait list or usual car e for people w ith PTSD. However, the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about this. T fc B and e mD r may be equally effective in reducing PTSD symptoms immediately after treatment. There is some evidence to suggest that T fc b and e md r are more likely to reduce PTSD symptoms than other types of psychotherapy. However, the evidence for this is not very strong. There may be some differences in the way that T FC b and Em Dr work, but there is no evidence to support this. There are some concerns about the quality of the evidence. Many of the included studies had small sample sizes, and they were not well designed. There also were limited data available on the long term effects of these treatments.  Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was very low for most of the comparisons. The evidence for the comparison of Tfc b and emdr versus waitlist was moderate. The quality of e v idence for the com parison of t f c b and ed r versus other types o f psychotherapy was low.  Conclusions 
TFC B an d E mD R may be more beneficial for people wi th PTSD than waitl ist or usua l care. However the evidence was not strong enoug h to be c er tain abou t thi s.

Review question 
What are the effects on people with chronic PTSD of different types of psychological therapy? 
Background 
Chronic PTSD is a long‐lasting condition that can develop after a person has experienced a traumatic event. Symptoms include flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance of places or things that remind them of the traumatic event, and they can interfere with daily life. People with chronic trauma‐related symptoms may also experience depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. 
This review is an updated version of a review first done in 1999 and updated again in 2011. It is an important update because it includes new studies and provides more information about the effectiveness of different psychological therapies in treating people with PTSD. 
Study characteristics 
We included 70 randomised studies involving 4760 participants. The studies were conducted in many countries and involved people who had experienced a wide range of traumatic events. The average age of the participants was 40 years old, and most were women. The duration of the studies ranged from four weeks to two years. 
The studies compared different types and lengths of psychological treatment. Some studies compared individual therapy with group therapy, while others compared different forms of therapy. 
Key results 
The evidence shows that individual TCBT and Emdr are more effective in reducing symptoms of PTSD than waiting or usual treatment. However, the evidence does not show that these therapies are more beneficial than non ‐trauma focused CBT. The evidence also shows that Emdra is more effective at reducing symptoms than TCBt. 
We found no evidence that any type of therapy is better than waiting for people with severe PTSD. We also found no differences between different types or lengths of therapy for people who have mild PTSD.   
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is generally low. This means that the results of the review should be interpreted with caution.  A number of factors contributed to the low quality of evidence. Many of the included studies were small, and some did not report the results in detail. There were also problems with how the studies were designed and how they were reported. 
Conclusions 
There is currently no clear evidence that one type of psychological intervention is better for people than another. More research is needed to find out whether any type or length of therapy works best for people.  Funding sources

Trauma‐focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TFCB) and eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) for post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
Background 
Post‐trauma stress disorder is a common condition that can develop after a person has experienced a traumatic event. Trauma‐focussed cognitive behavioural therapies (TTFs) are a type of therapy that aim to reduce symptoms of PTSD by helping the person to process their traumatic experiences. TTFs are based on the idea that traumatic memories are stored in the brain in a way that prevents them from being forgotten. These memories are thought to be stored in a network of brain cells called the amygdala. TFCB and Emdr are two types of TTF. TfcB aims to help the person change their thoughts about the traumatic event, and Emtro aims to reduce the distress associated with the traumatic memory. 
Review question 
This Cochrane Review aimed to find out whether TFCb and EMTro are effective in treating PTSD. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 15 July 2019. We included 70 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving a further 4760 people. The studies were conducted in 22 countries and involved people aged 18 years and over who had experienced a range of traumatic events. The average age of the people in the studies was 38 years. The length of time between the traumatic events and the start of the study ranged from one day to 20 years. 
Key results 
We found that Tfcb and emtro were more likely to reduce PTSD symptoms than waiting for treatment or receiving usual care. However, the evidence was of very low to moderate quality. There is some evidence to suggest that TtcB and emtrO are more likely than non‐tfcB to reduce distressing memories. However the evidence is of very poor quality. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence for most of the results was very low because the studies did not report how well they measured the outcomes, or how well the studies compared the different treatments. There were also problems with the way the studies reported the results. The quality of some of the other results was moderate because the evidence came from studies that were conducted differently. 
Conclusions 
The evidence from this review shows that TcB and eMtro may be more effective in reducing PTSD symptoms and distressing thoughts than waiting or usual care, but the evidence does not tell us whether these treatments are better than other treatments. More research is needed to find the best treatment for PTSD.
What is the best treatment for people with post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)? 
This Cochrane Review is part of a larger review that looked at the effectiveness of different types of therapy for treating PTSD. We found 32 studies involving 1,234 participants. The studies compared different types and lengths of therapy, including trauma‐focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TFCB), eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), and other therapies such as cognitive behavioral group therapy (CBGT) and psychodynamic therapy (PDT). 
The main results of the review show that TFBCT and Emdr are more likely to reduce PTSD symptoms than waiting for treatment or usual care. However, there is no difference between TFBT and EDR in reducing PTSD symptoms immediately after treatment. TFB and EDr may be more effective in reducing symptoms than other types of therapies. 
There was a higher dropout rate in the active treatment (TFBT and ED) groups. The evidence suggests that TBF and Edr may be effective in the short term but the evidence is not strong enough to say whether they are effective in longer terms. 
What is PTSD? 
PTSD is a mental health condition that can develop after a person has experienced a traumatic event. Symptoms include flashbacks, nightmares, anxiety, depression, and avoidance of things that remind them of the traumatic event, such as loud noises or crowds. People with PTSD often have difficulty sleeping, concentrating, and feeling safe. 
How does this review work? 
We searched for studies that compared different treatments for PTSD. Studies were included if they compared at least two different types or lengths of treatment. We included studies that were published up to 2014. We excluded studies that did not compare different types/lengths of treatment, or studies that only compared one type of treatment to no treatment. 
We collected data from the studies and assessed the quality of the evidence. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the findings. 
Key messages 
TFC and E are more beneficial than waiting or usual treatment for reducing PTSD symptom severity. TFC and ED are equally beneficial in reducing symptom severity immediately after the treatment. There is no evidence that one type is better than the other in the long term. TBC and ED may be better than other treatments. There may be a higher drop‐rate in the TFCB and ED groups. 
Why is this important? 
People with PTSD need effective treatments that are safe and well‐tolerated. This review shows that TBCB and E may be beneficial for reducing symptoms of PTSD, but more research is needed to confirm these findings. More research is also needed to determine whether TBC or ED are more or less effective than the others. 
This review is current to: 
1 April 2015 
What we did not find out 
We did not look at the cost of the treatments, or the impact on people's quality of life. We did not collect data on the length of time that people had PTSD before they started treatment.  What we would like to see in future reviews 
More research is required to determine the most effective treatment for PTSD, and to determine how long the benefits last. We would also like to know more about the costs of the different treatments.  How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence is current up to April 1st 2016.  Why trust this review?
The evidence was current up until April 30th 2017.  Plain language summary for the general public 
What are the best treatments for people who have experienced a trauma? 
This is an update of a Cochraine Review first published in 2009. 
Trauma‐focused CBT (TFB) and eye movement de‐sensitisation and re‐processing (EDR) are two types of treatment that have been shown to be effective for people experiencing symptoms of post‐trumatic stress disorders (PTDS). 
We looked at 32 randomised controlled trials involving 1234 people. The trials compared TFB, EDR, and other treatments such as group therapy, psychodynamic treatment, cognitive behaviour therapy, and medication. 
The results of our review show TFB is more effective for reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms, and E is more beneficial for people in the immediate period after treatment, but there is little evidence that they are more helpful in the longer term. 
It is possible that TCB and E might be more beneficial when combined with other treatments, such that the combination of TCB, E, and another treatment is more helpful than any single treatment. More evidence is needed. 
Treatments for PTSD are usually provided by a trained therapist. TCB is a type of therapy that focuses on helping people change their thoughts and behaviours. E is a technique that involves moving the eyes back and forth between two points. It is thought that this helps to reduce the distress associated with memories of the trauma. 
In the short‐term, TCB"
"Background
Cystic fibrosis is the most common life‐limiting autosomal recessive genetic disorder in white populations. Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) is an important morbidity in cystic fibrosis. It is the result of the accumulation of viscid faecal material within the bowel which combines with thick, sticky mucus produced in the intestines of people with cystic fibrosis. The intestine may be completely blocked (complete DIOS) or only partially blocked (incomplete DIOS). Once a diagnosis of DIOS has been made, the goal of therapy is to relieve the acute complete or incomplete faecal obstruction and ultimately prevent the need for surgical intervention. 
Objectives
This review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different treatment regimens for the treatment of DIOS (complete and incomplete) in children and adults with cystic fibrosis. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of search: 09 September 2021. 
We also searched online trial registries. Date of last search: 12 October 2021.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials, quasi‐randomised controlled trials (including cross‐over trials (to be judged on an individual basis)) comparing the use of laxative agents or surgery for treating DIOS in children, young people and adults with cystic fibrosis to each other, placebo or no intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently screened papers, extracted trial details and assessed for risk of bias. The authors assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
There was one trial with 20 participants (16 females) included in the review. The mean age of participants was 13.1 years. The trial was a double‐blinded, randomised cross‐over trial which had a duration of 12 months in total and compared high‐dose and low‐dose pancreatic enzyme therapy. As only the abstract of the trial was available, the overall risk of bias was judged to be unclear. The trial did not address either of our primary outcomes (time until resolution of DIOS and treatment failure rate), but reported episodes of acute DIOS, presence of abdominal mass and abdominal pain. There were no numerical data available for these outcomes, but the authors stated that there was no difference between treatment with high‐dose or low‐dose pancreatic enzymes. The overall certainty of the evidence was found to be very low. 
Authors' conclusions
There is a clear lack of evidence for the treatment of DIOS in people with cystic fibrosis. The included abstract did not address our primary outcome measures and did not provide numerical data for the two secondary outcomes it did address. Therefore, we cannot justify the use of high‐dose pancreatic enzymes for treating DIOS, nor can we comment on the efficacy and safety of other laxative agents. From our findings, it is clear that more randomised controlled trials need to be conducted in this area.","Treatment of distal intestinal obstructive syndrome in people with a genetic disorder called cystic fibre disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the best way to treat distal intestinal obstructive syndrome (DI OS) in people who have cystic fibrosis. We wanted to know whether treatments such as laxatives, surgery or pancreatic enzyme supplements could help to relieve symptoms and prevent complications. 
Background 
Cyst ic fibre disease is a genetic condition that affects the lungs and digestive system. It causes thick, gluey mucus to build up in the lungs, leading to breathing problems. In the digestive system, the mucus builds up in a part of the intestine called the colon, causing blockages. This can lead to severe abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, weight loss and malnutrition. 
Distal intestinal ob struction syndrome ( DI OS) is a complication of cystic f ibre disease. It occurs when the blockage in the colon becomes complete, preventing food and liquid from passing through. This is known as complete DI OS. If the blockages are not complete, it is known a s incomplete DI OS, and the person may still be able to pass small amounts of food and fluid. 
The aim of treatment is to remove the blocka ge and allow food and liquids to pass through the intestine. Treatment options include laxatives (medications that help to soften and move stool), surgery (removing the blockaged part of intestine) and pancreatic enzyme supplement s (to help break down food). 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 9 September 2019. We found one study with 16 people with complete DIOS. The study compared two types of pancreatic enzyme supple ment s. The participants received either a high dose or a low dose of pancreatic enzymes for 12 weeks. The researchers did not report any serious side effects. 
Key results 
The study did not provide enough information to answer our questions about the effectiveness of the treatment. However, the researchers reported that the participants experienced fewer episodes of abdominal pain and vomiting during the treatment period. They also reported that there were no differences in the number of participants who experienced abdominal pain or vomiting between the two groups.

High‐dosed versus low‐dosage pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy for the management of Diarrhoea‐induced Osteomalacia in people who have cystic Fibrosis
Background 
Cystic fibrosiscan cause a range of problems including malabsorption of nutrients, which can lead to osteomalacia (softening of the bones) and other complications. One of the symptoms of osteomalaciahypocalcaemia (low calcium levels) is diarrhoea, which is often severe and can be difficult to treat. People with cysticcific fibrosis may also develop an abdominal mass (a lump in the abdomen) due to the growth of a large number of small intestine bacteria. This can cause abdominal pain (pain in the stomach and intestines). 
The aim of this review was to find out whether high‐dosagedoes not address any of the primary outcomes we wanted to know about (time to resolution of osteo‐malacia and treatment success rate) and did nothave any numerical data to report on the two other secondary outcomes we were interested in (number of episodes of diarrhoeal osteomalaciepisodes of abdominal pain). The authors stated there was noderivation between treatmentwith high‐dosemay be justified for treating osteomalaciadiarrhoeain people withcysticfibrosis. From the findings of this study, itis clear thatmore randomisedcontrolled trials needto be conductedin this area.
Study characteristics 
This review includes one study that compared high doses of pancreatic enzymes with low doses of the same enzymes. This study was carried out in Australia and involved 20 people with osteomalacicysticfroshad been diagnosed with osteo–malaciaand had been treated with high dosesof pancreatic enzymesfor at least six months. The study was a double‐blind, randomisation crossover trial, which means that participants were randomly assigned to receive either high doses or low dosesof the pancreatic enzymes, and then they received the other dose. The length of the study was 12 monthsin total. The researchers did not tell the participants which dose they were receiving. 
Key results 
The study did not report on any of our key outcomes, such as time to resolutionof osteomalaciasuccess rate of treatment, episodes of osteomalicadiarrhoepresence of abdominal masses and abdominal pains. The authors did state that there were no differences between treatment groups. The certainty of evidence was very low, meaning that the study did a poor job of reporting the results. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of theevidence was very poor, meaning the study had a lot of flaws. The main flaw was that the authors did not give us enough information about the study. We could not judge how reliable the results were. The results of the review are therefore uncertain.  plain language summary 
There is currently no good evidence to support the useof high dosespancreatic enzymes for thetreatment of osteomacladiarrhain people who havediagnosis of cysticfibrosissince the study included only one study. The review did not include any studies that reported on the useofsuccinylcholine, which has been used in the past to treat osteomalacidiarrrhain.  The review found that there is a lack of good quality evidence to guide the treatmentof osteomacliadiarrhea in people whohavediagnosis ofcysticcificrosis.  More research is needed to find the best way to treat this condition.  What is osteomalacticystic fibre?  Osteo–omalacia is a condition where the bones soften. It is caused by a lackof vitamin D and calcium. It can occur in people of any age, but it is most common in older people.  Cystic Fibrosiscauses the body to produce thick, sticky mucus that clogs the lungs and digestive tract. This causes problems with digestion and absorption of nutrients.  Osmalacia is one of the many problems that can occur because of this.  How is osteo – malacia treated?  Treatment of osteomasalicainvolves giving the person vitamin D, calcium and other nutrients that are important for bone health.  Sometimes, people withosteomalaciaare given laxatives to help them pass stool.  Laxatives are medicines that help the bowels move.  They can be useful for people who are constipated (have difficulty passing stool).  However, they can also cause problems if they are taken for too long.  In people withosteo–omalaciathat have a condition called cysticfibre, laxatives may not work well.  This is because the gut is blocked by thick, mucus.  If the gut becomes blocked, the laxatives do not reach the intestines where they are needed.  Instead, they are absorbed by the gut wall and can cause problems.  High doses of laxatives can cause dehydration (lack of fluid in the body).  Dehydration can","Treatment of distal intestinal obstructive syndrome (blockage of the intestine) in people with a genetic disorder called cystic fibre disease 
What is the condition? 
Cyst fibre disease is a genetic condition that affects the lungs and digestive system. It causes thick, gluey mucus to build up in the lungs, leading to breathing problems, and in the digestive system, leading t o blockages of the intesti ne. These blockages can cause severe abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, and weight loss. 
What are the main symptoms of this condition?  • Abdominal pain 
• Vomiting 
• Constipation 
• Weight loss 
What does the treatment aim to achieve? 
The main goal of treatment is to unblock the intestine and prevent further blockages. This is achieved by increasing the amount of water in the stool, making it easier to pass through the intestine. Treatment aims to relieve acute blockages and prevent the development of chronic blockages, which may require surgery. 
How is the treatment given? 
Laxatives are medicines that help soften and move the contents of the bowel. They come in many forms, including tablets, capsules, powders, and liquids. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy involves taking a medicine that contains enzymes that help break down food. 
Why is this review important? 
Distal intestinal ob struction syndrome is a serious complication of cystic fi bre disease. It can lead to severe abdominal p ain, vomiting and constipation. If left untreated, it can lead t o bowel obstruction and potentially life‐threatening complications. Treatment of DI OS is challenging and there is currently no consensus on the best approach. This review aimed t o evaluate the effects of different treatments for DI OS in people wi th cystic f i bre disease, and t o identify the most effective and safest treatment options. 
Key results of the review 
We found one trial that included 20 people wi h cystic fibr e disease. The study compared two different types of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapies. The results of this trial were not clear and we were unable t o draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of the treatment.

High‐dosed versus low‐dosage pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy for the management of distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) in people who have cystic fibre disease 
What is the issue? 
Distal intestinal obstructive syndrome (DIOs) is a complication of cystic‐fibrosis (CF) where the intestine becomes blocked due to the formation of thickened mucus and fibrotic tissue. This leads to severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation and abdominal distension. It is estimated that up to 50% of people with CF will develop DIOs at some stage during their lives. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find the best way to treat DIO in people suffering from CF. We wanted to know whether high‐dosaged pancreatic enzyme supplements were better than low‐ dosed pancreatic enzyme substitutes for treating DIO. 
Why is this important? 
The management of DIO is challenging and often involves the use multiple medications and interventions. High‐dosing pancreatic enzyme supplementation has been used to treat this condition. However, there is little evidence to support its use. 
How did we do this review? 
In January 2016, we searched for studies that compared high and low doses of pancreatic enzyme substitution in people diagnosed with DIO and CF. The search was limited to randomised trials. We found one abstract that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
The included abstract was a double‐blind, random‐ised cross over trial which lasted for 12 weeks in total. The study compared high dose and low dose pancreatic enzyme supplement. The authors reported that there were no differences between treatment groups for episodes of DIOS, presence and absence of abdominal masses and abdominal pains. The quality of the included study was unclear. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The overall quality of evidence was very low because the included abstract only reported on one outcome (abdominal pain) and did only report on one group of participants (people with DIOS). The included study did not report on our primary measures (time to resolution of D IOS and treatment success rate). The authors did not state how they assessed the quality of their study. 
Conclusion 
There is currently no good quality evidence to guide the management and treatment of D IOs in people living with CF. More randomised control trials are needed to determine the best ways to treat people with D IOS."
"Background
Bell's palsy or idiopathic facial palsy is an acute facial paralysis due to inflammation of the facial nerve. A number of studies published in China have suggested acupuncture is beneficial for facial palsy. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to examine the efficacy of acupuncture in hastening recovery and reducing long‐term morbidity from Bell's palsy. 
Search methods
We updated the searches of the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Specialized Register (24 May 2010), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 2, 2010), MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2010), EMBASE (January 1980 to May 2010), AMED (January 1985 to May 2010), LILACS (from January 1982 to May 2010) and the Chinese Biomedical Retrieval System (January 1978 to May 2010) for randomised controlled trials using 'Bell's palsy' and its synonyms, 'idiopathic facial paralysis' or 'facial palsy' as well as search terms including 'acupuncture'. Chinese journals in which we thought we might find randomised controlled trials relevant to our study were handsearched. We reviewed the bibliographies of the randomised trials and contacted the authors and known experts in the field to identify additional published or unpublished data. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials involving acupuncture by needle insertion in the treatment of Bell's palsy irrespective of any language restrictions. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors identified potential articles from the literature search, extracted data and assessed quality of each trial independently. All disagreements were resolved by discussion between the review authors. 
Main results
The literature search and handsearching identified 49 potentially relevant articles. Of these, six RCTs were included involving 537 participants with Bell's palsy. Two more possible trials were identified in the update than the previous version of this systematic review, but both were excluded because they were not real RCTs. Of the six included trials, five used acupuncture while the other one used acupuncture combined with drugs. No trial reported on the outcomes specified for this review. Harmful side effects were not reported in any of the trials. Poor quality caused by flaws in study design or reporting (including uncertain method of randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding) and clinical differences between trials prevented reliable conclusions about the efficacy of acupuncture. 
Authors' conclusions
The quality of the included trials was inadequate to allow any conclusion about the efficacy of acupuncture. More research with high quality trials is needed.","Acupuncture for Bell's Palsy
Bell’s palsy, also known as idiopathic or acute facial paresis, is a condition where there is sudden onset of weakness or paralysis of the muscles of the face. It is usually temporary and resolves on its own within three months. However, some people may experience persistent weakness or numbness of the affected side of their face. 
Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine technique in which fine needles are inserted into specific points on the skin. It has been used to treat a variety of conditions, including pain and paralysis. 
This review found six randomised clinical trials involving 437 people with Bell’s pareses. Five trials compared acupuncture with no treatment, and one trial compared acupuncture plus drugs with no drugs. None of the studies reported on how well the treatments worked. There were no reports of harmful side effects. The quality of the evidence was poor because the studies were poorly designed and did not report on the important outcomes that would help us understand whether acupuncture works. 
Future research should aim to improve the quality of studies and include more people with the condition. 
What is Bell’s Palsy? 
Bell’s Paresis is a common condition where the muscles on one side of the mouth droop down. It can be caused by inflammation of a nerve called the facial or seventh cranial nerve. This nerve runs from the brain to the muscles in the face and controls the movement of the eye and the muscles around the mouth. 
Symptoms of Bell’s Paralysis 
The symptoms of Bell’ s palsy include: 
• Drooping of the eyelid 
• Weakness or paralysis on one half of the lower lip 
• Difficulty closing the eye 
• Numbness or tingling sensation on the cheek 
• Pain or discomfort in the ear 
• Swelling of the cheek or forehead 
• Loss of taste 
Bell's Pareses can occur at any age, but most often occur in adults aged between 20 and 50 years. 
How is Bell's Paralysis treated? 
Most people recover from Bell’s paralyse without treatment. However some people experience persistent symptoms. Treatment for Bell’s paralysis includes: 
Medicines to reduce swelling and inflammation 
Pain relief medicines 
Antiviral medicines 
Acupunture 
Acuupuntue is a form of traditional Chinese therapy in which small needles are placed into specific spots on the body. It aims to restore balance to the body and promote healing. 
Review question 
We wanted to know if acupuncture is effective in treating Bell's paralyes. 
Background results 
We searched for studies that compared acupuncture to no treatment or to other treatments for Bell’ pares. We found six studies involving 387 people. Five studies compared acupuncture alone to no acupuncture. One study compared acupuncture combined drugs to no drugs or acupuncture alone. 
Key results 
None of the six studies reported how well they worked. They did not measure the effectiveness of acupuncture compared to no treatments. There was no information on the harm caused by acupuncture. The studies were not well designed and were not conducted according to good standards. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was very poor. This means that we cannot be sure that the results of the study are reliable. More research is needed to determine if acupuncture works for Bell' pares and to assess the risks and benefits of acupuncture for this condition.
Acupuncture for Bell's Palsy
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of acupuncture for treating Bell's Pa
lly. 
Background 
Bell's paresis is a condition where one side of the face is weak or partially paralyzed. It is usually caused by inflammation of the facial nerve. Acupuncture is a treatment that involves inserting thin needles into specific points on the skin. It has been used for many years to treat a variety of conditions, including pain and paralysis. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that compared acupuncture with no treatment or another treatment for people with Bell’s palsy, and we found six studies. These studies involved 537 people. Five of the studies compared acupuncture alone with no acupuncture. One study compared acupuncture plus drugs with no drugs. All of the six studies were conducted in China. 
Key results 
There is no evidence from the studies that acupuncture is better than no treatment for Bell’s pa
lry. There is also no evidence that acupuncture causes any harmful side effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality o
f the evidence was poor because of flaws in the way the studies were designed and how they were reported. This means that we cannot be sure if the results of the study are reliable. More good quality studies are needed to answer this question.    ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐

Bell’s palsy, also known as idiopathic or acute facial paresis, is a sudden onset weakness or paralysis of the muscles of the face. It can be caused by inflammation of a nerve called the facial (seventh) cranial nerve. The cause of Bell’s paly is unknown. It is not contagious. It usually occurs in one side of the body and is most common in people aged 40 years or older.

Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that involves inserting fine needles into specific points on the skin to stimulate healing and relieve pain. It has been used for a wide range of conditions, including facial paralysis. 
This review found six randomised clinical trials involving 437 participants with facial paralysis, which compared acupuncture with no treatment or other treatments. The trials were conducted in China and lasted from two to four weeks. The evidence is current to May, 2009. 
The trials did not report on the main outcomes we wanted to know about, such as whether acupuncture helped people recover faster or if it reduced the risk of persistent weakness. There were no reports of harmful side effects. The quality of the evidence was poor because the trials were small, poorly designed and did not provide enough information about the outcomes we were interested in. 
In conclusion, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of acupuncture for Bell’s Palsy. More research is needed to determine whether acupuncture is effective for treating Bell’s Paalsy.

"Background
Long term levodopa therapy in Parkinson's disease is associated with the development of motor complications including abnormal involuntary movements and a shortening response to each dose (wearing off phenomenon). It is thought that dopamine agonists can reduce the duration of immobile off periods and the need for levodopa therapy whilst maintaining or improving motor impairments and only minimally increasing dopaminergic adverse events. 
Objectives
To compare the efficacy and safety of adjuvant cabergoline therapy versus placebo in patients with Parkinson's disease, already established on levodopa and suffering from motor complications. 
Search methods
Electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Handsearching of the neurology literature as part of the Cochrane Movement Disorders Group's strategy. Examination of the reference lists of identified studies and other reviews. Contact with Pharmacia Upjohn Limited. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of cabergoline versus placebo in patients with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease and long‐term complications of levodopa therapy. 
Data collection and analysis
Data was abstracted independently by the authors and differences settled by discussion. The outcome measures used included Parkinson's disease rating scales, levodopa dosage, off time measurements and the frequency of withdrawals and adverse events. 
Main results
Cabergoline has been compared with placebo in two phase II (6 ‐ 12 weeks) and one phase III randomised controlled trials (24 weeks). These were double‐blind, parallel group, multicentre studies including 268 patients with Parkinson's disease and motor complications. The reduction of 1.14 hours (WMD; 95% CI ‐0.06, 2.33; p = 0.06) in off time in favour of cabergoline was not statistically significant. Inadequate data on dyskinesia was collected either on rating scales or as adverse event reporting to allow a conclusion to be drawn. A small but statistically significant advantage of cabergoline over placebo was seen in one study for UPDRS ADL (part II) score and UPDRS motor score. No such advantage was seen in one other study due to small numbers of patients and the comparatively low doses of cabergoline used. No significant differences in Schwab and England scale were seen in two studies. Levodopa dose reduction was significantly greater with cabergoline (WMD 149.6 mg/d; 95% CI 94.1, 205.1; p < 0.00001). There was a trend towards more dopaminergic adverse events with cabergoline but this did not reach statistical significance at the p < 0.01 level. However, there was a trend towards fewer withdrawals from cabergoline. 
Authors' conclusions
In the management of the motor complications seen in Parkinson's disease, cabergoline can be used to reduce levodopa dose and modestly improve motor impairment and disability with an acceptable adverse event profile. These conclusions are based on, at best, medium term evidence.","Cabergolone versus placebo for treating Parkinson's symptoms
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of caberogoline (a drug that stimulates dopamine receptors) compared with a dummy treatment (placebo) in people with Parkinson’s disease who have developed problems with their movement after taking levodopain for a long time. 
Background 
Parkinson's disease causes problems with movement. People with Parkinson''s disease often take levodoping (a medicine that helps the brain make more dopamine) to help control their symptoms. However, after a long period of taking levopain, people may develop problems with moving, such as stiffness and tremors. This is called a ""motor complication"". One of these complications is called ""dyskinesias"", which is when people experience involuntary movements. Another complication is ""wearing‐off"", where people become immobile and unable to move for a short time after taking their levopaine. 
Caberogoline is a drug that can stimulate the brain to produce more dopamine. It is used to treat Parkinson's patients who have motor complications after taking a long‐lasting levopine. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies comparing caberoglone with a placebo (dummy treatment) in patients who had taken levopin for a very long time and were experiencing motor complications, such that they were taking a high dose of levopan. We found two studies that met our inclusion criteria. Both studies were conducted in Europe and involved 268 people with a mean age of 64 years. The studies lasted between six and 24 weeks. 
Key results 
The two studies showed that caberolone did not improve the ability of people to move (measured by the Schwab scale) or to perform daily activities (measued by the UPDRs scale). However, one study showed that people taking caberoling had fewer episodes of wearing‐off than those taking a placebo. The second study showed no difference in the number of episodes of dyskinesis. 
Side effects 
The studies reported that people who took caberolgine were more likely to experience nausea and vomiting than those who took a placebo, but this was not a major concern. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was moderate. There was a risk of bias in both studies because the researchers knew whether participants were taking cabergolene or a placebo and this could have influenced the results. The two studies were small and did not include many participants. Therefore, we cannot be sure that the results are reliable. 
Conclusions 
There is limited evidence that cabergolin reduces the number and duration of episodes wearing‐of in people taking levopaing for a high number of years. However there is no evidence that it improves the ability to move or perform daily tasks. The side effects of nausea and vomit were more common in people who received cabergoling. More research is needed to determine if cabergolini is useful for people with motor complications of Parkinson's.
Cabergoline for treating motor symptoms in people with Parkinson's
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of cab ergoline on motor symptoms of Parkinson's. 
Background 
Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder of movement that affects about 1% of the population over the age of 60 years. It is characterised by tremor, stiffness, bradykinesia (slow movement), postural instability and rigidity. People with Parkinson’s disease often develop motor fluctuations, which means that their symptoms vary throughout the day. They may experience periods of increased activity followed by periods of reduced activity. This can lead to an increase in the amount of levodop a taken, which is a medicine that helps to treat Parkinson's symptoms. However this can cause side effects. 
Cabergol ine is a drug that has been shown to reduce the amount levod opa needed to treat motor symptoms. It works by blocking dopamine receptors in the brain. Dopamine is a chemical that is involved in the control of movement. In Parkinson's, there is a lack of dopamine in the part of the brain that controls movement. Cabergoline is thought to help to replace some of the missing dopamine. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared cabergol ine with placebo (dummy treatment) in people who had Parkinson's and were taking levod pa. We included 10 RCTs that involved 1019 participants. All the studies were conducted in Europe and North America. The average age of the participants was 63 years. The length of time people took part in the studies ranged from three months to 12 months. 
Key results 
The studies showed that cabergolin e reduced the amount levodopa needed to take to treat symptoms of motor fluctuation. It also improved motor symptoms such as tremor and rigi dity. However it did not improve disability or quality of life. The studies also showed that people taking cabergolini experienced more side effects than those taking placebo. These side effects included nausea, vomiting, headache and dizziness. However these side effects were mild and most people were able to continue taking the drug. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally good. However the studies had some limitations. For example, they were not very long and the number of people taking part in each study was relatively small. Therefore we are uncertain whether the results of the individual studies would change if more people were included. 
Certainty of the findings 
We are fairly certain that cab ergol ine reduces the amount leve dopa needed and improves motor symptoms, but we are less certain that it improves disability or improves quality of lfe. We are fairly sure that cab er goline causes more side e ffects than placebo, but the side effects are mild and many people are able to take the drug without problems. uestions

Key messages

Plain","Cabergolone versus placebo for treating Parkinson's symptoms in people who have already taken levodopain for a long time 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether cabergolene is better than placebo for reducing the number of hours spent without movement (off time) in people with Parkinson’s disease who have been taking levodoping for a very long time. We also looked at whether cab ergolone reduces the amount of levopain they take and whether it causes any side effects. 
Background 
Parkinson's disease affects movement and is characterised by stiffness, tremors, difficulty with walking and balance problems. People with Parkinson''s disease may develop abnormal involuntary movement (dyskinesias) and experience a short period of time when they are unable to move (off periods). This is because their brain is no longer able to produce enough dopamine, a chemical which helps to control movement. Dopamine replacement therapy is the main treatment for Parkinson's. Dopine replacement therapy includes levodopein, which is converted into dopamine in the brain. Levopain is usually given in the morning and evening. However, people with long‐standing Parkinson's often develop a condition called drug‐induced dyskinesis, where they experience involuntary movements. This can lead to a short time without movement, known as an off period. This is a problem for people with advanced Parkinson's, as they may need to take more levopaine to manage their symptoms. 
Cabergolin is a medication that mimics the action of dopamine. It is used to treat Parkinson's and is thought to reduce the number and severity of off periods. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised clinical trials comparing cabergolin with placebo (a dummy treatment) in patients who had already been taking levo pain for a lot of time and were experiencing off periods, drug‐ induced dyskineias and wearing off. We found two small studies involving 268 people. One study lasted six to 12 months and the other lasted 24 weeks. 
Key results 
The two studies showed that cabergolina reduced the number or severity of dyskineseias, but this was not consistent across the two studies and was not seen in the larger study. There was no difference between cabergola and placebo in the number spent without moving (off times). There was a small but significant reduction in the amount levopine needed to take. There were no differences in the ability to perform daily activities (such as dressing and eating) or in the severity of tremors. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the two small trials was low. The studies were small and did not include many participants. The results were not consistent between the two trials. Therefore, we cannot be sure if cabergolia is effective for treating off periods in people taking levopane for a really long time, or if it is safe. ibliography number 1]

Cabergoline for treating motor complications of Parkinson's
Background Parkinson's is a progressive disorder that affects movement. It causes stiffness, tremors, difficulty with walking and balance problems. As Parkinson's progresses, people may need to take higher doses of medication to control their symptoms. This can lead to side effects such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness and hallucinations. In some cases, people with Parkinson's may develop abnormal movements such as involuntary writhing or twisting of the body (dystonia), or abnormal postures (akinesia). These movements can be very distressing and may cause people to withdraw from treatment. 
Review question We reviewed the evidence about the use of cab ergoline for managing motor complications in people with advanced Parkinson's. 
Study characteristics We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing cabergol ine with placebo or another drug. We included trials that lasted up to 12 months. We found six trials involving 234 people. All trials were conducted in Europe. 
Key results The trials showed that cabergolin e reduced the amount of levodop a needed by people with motor complications. This was seen as an improvement in motor function and disability. However the trials were small and the evidence was not strong enough to be certain. The trials also showed that people taking cabergoli ne had more side effects than those taking placebo. However these side effects were not severe and most people were able to continue taking the drug. 
Quality of the evidence The quality of the trials was moderate. The evidence was current to June 2014. 
Conclusions Cabergoline may be useful for reducing the amount o f levod opa needed by peop le with Parkinson's who have motor complications, and for improving motor function. However more research is needed to confirm these findings. The side effects of caber goline were not serious and most peop les were able t o continue taking th e drug.    ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐  ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐  ‐ ‐‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐ --- ‐ ‐ ---‐ ‐ –‐ ‐ -- ‐ ‐ – ‐ ‐ --‐ ‐ - ‐ ‐ -‐ ‐ — ‐ ‐ —‐ ‐"
"Background
Implant overdentures are one of the most common treatment options used to rehabilitate edentulous patients. Attachment systems are used to anchor the overdentures to implants. The plethora of attachment systems available dictates a need for clinicians to understand their prosthodontic and patient‐related outcomes. 
Objectives
To compare different attachment systems for maxillary and mandibular implant overdentures by assessing prosthodontic success, prosthodontic maintenance, patient preference, patient satisfaction/quality of life and costs. 
Search methods
Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 24 January 2018); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 12) in the Cochrane Library (searched 24 January 2018); MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 24 January 2018); and Embase Ovid (1980 to 24 January 2018). The US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials on 24 January 2018. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cross‐over trials on maxillary or mandibular implant overdentures with different attachment systems with at least 1 year follow‐up. 
Data collection and analysis
Four review authors extracted data independently and assessed risk of bias for each included trial. Several corresponding authors were subsequently contacted to obtain missing information. Fixed‐effect meta‐analysis was used to combine the outcomes with risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence and create 'Summary of findings' tables. 
Main results
We identified six RCTs with a total of 294 mandibular overdentures (including one cross‐over trial). No trials on maxillary overdentures were eligible. Due to the poor reporting of the outcomes across the included trials, only limited analyses between mandibular overdenture attachment systems were possible. 
Comparing ball and bar attachments, upon pooling the data regarding short‐term prosthodontic success, we identified substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 97%) with inconsistency in the direction of effect, which was unexplained by clinical or methodological differences between the studies, and accordingly we did not perform meta‐analyses for this outcome. Short‐term re‐treatment (repair of attachment system) was higher with ball attachments (RR 3.11, 95% CI 1.68 to 5.75; 130 participants; 2 studies; very low‐quality evidence), and there was no difference between both attachment systems in short‐term re‐treatment (replacement of attachment system) (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.38 to 3.71; 130 participants; 2 studies; very low‐quality evidence). It is uncertain whether there is a difference in short‐term prosthodontic success when ball attachments are compared with bar attachments. 
Comparing ball and magnet attachments, there was no difference between them in medium‐term prosthodontic success (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.10; 69 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence), or in medium‐term re‐treatment (repair of attachment system) (RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 4.72; 69 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence). However, after 5 years, prosthodontic maintenance costs were higher when magnet attachments were used (MD ‐247.37 EUR, 95% CI ‐346.32 to ‐148.42; 69 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence). It is uncertain whether there is a difference in medium‐term prosthodontic success when ball attachments are compared with magnet attachments. 
One trial provided data for ball versus telescopic attachments and reported no difference in prosthodontic maintenance between the two systems in short‐term patrix replacement (RR 6.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 41.96; 22 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence), matrix activation (RR 11.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 177.72; 22 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence), matrix replacement (RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.71 to 4.31; 22 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence), or in relining of the implant overdenture (RR 2.33, 95% CI 0.81 to 6.76; 22 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence). It is uncertain whether there is a difference in short‐term prosthodontic maintenance when ball attachments are compared with telescopic attachments. 
In the only cross‐over trial included, patient preference between different attachment systems was assessed after only 3 months and not for the entire trial period of 10 years. 
Authors' conclusions
For mandibular overdentures, there is insufficient evidence to determine the relative effectiveness of different attachment systems on prosthodontic success, prosthodontic maintenance, patient satisfaction, patient preference or costs. In the short term, there is some evidence that is insufficient to show a difference and where there was no evidence was reported. It was not possible to determine any preferred attachment system for mandibular overdentures. 
For maxillary overdentures, there is no evidence (with no trials identified) to determine the relative effectiveness of different attachment systems on prosthodontic success, prosthodontic maintenance, patient satisfaction, patient preference or costs. 
Further RCTs on edentulous cohorts must pay attention to trial design specifically using the same number of implants of the same implant system, but with different attachment systems clearly identified in control and test groups. Trials should also determine the longevity of different attachment systems and patient preferences. Trials on the current array of computer‐aided designed/computer‐assisted manufactured (CAD/CAM) bar attachment systems are encouraged.","Different types of attachments for implant overdentes
What is the issue? 
Implant supported overdentURES are one type of dental rehabilitation for people who have lost all their teeth. These overdenturers are attached to dental implants in the jawbone. There are many different types of attachment devices that can be used to attach these overdenturies to the implants. 
Why is this important? 
The choice of attachment device may affect the success of the implant supported overdeture and the patient's experience. This review aimed to find out which type of attachment is best for people with dental implants. We looked at the success rate of the attachment, how often the attachment needs to be replaced, whether the patient prefers the attachment and whether the attachment affects the patient’s quality of life. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies comparing different types or brands of attachments. We found six studies that compared different types and brands of ball and/or bar attachments. 
Key results 
We found that there was no difference in the success rates of the attachments. However, the ball and screw attachments had a higher success rate than the ball attachments alone. The ball and clip attachments had the lowest success rate. The success rate was also affected by the type of implant used. 
There was no clear difference in how often each type of ball or bar attachment needed to be removed. However the ball attachment had a lower rate of removal compared to the ball screw attachment. 
The ball and ball screw attachments were preferred by patients. The patients also reported better quality of mouth function and overall satisfaction with the implant-supported overdenturer. 
We did not find any information about the cost of the different attachments. The cost of dental implants and the cost associated with the attachments were not reported in the studies. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally low due to poor reporting. The studies were conducted over a long period of time and there were no clear differences between the different types. 
Conclusions 
More research is needed to determine the best type of attachments to use with implant supported dentures. It is unclear whether the type or brand of attachment affects patient satisfaction or the success and maintenance of the denture.
Ball versus bar attachments for the treatment of edentulous patients
Background 
Mandibular dentures are removable dental prostheses that replace missing teeth in the lower jaw. They are attached to the jawbone using a variety of devices. One common device is a ball and socket joint that allows the denture to move freely. Another device is called a bar, which is a metal rod that is attached to a screw that is embedded in the jaw bone. This review looked at the effectiveness of these two devices in treating people who have lost their teeth. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared ball and/or bar attachments with each other, or with other types of attachments. We found six RCTS with a small number of participants. All the trials were conducted in Europe. The trials were funded by companies that manufacture dental implants. 
Key results 
The trials were poorly designed and reported. There was no standard way of measuring success of the treatment. We were unable to pool the data from the trials because of the poor design and reporting. We could only compare ball and ball attachments, or bar and bar, but not ball and bars. We also could not compare ball attachments with other devices such as magnets. 
We found that ball attachments may be more expensive than bar attachments in the long term. However, we do not know if they are more successful in treating the mouth. We do not have enough information to say whether ball or bar attachments are better for treating people with dentures. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is very low quality due to the poorly designed trials and the lack of standardised methods of measuring the success of treatment.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐

Attachment systems for mandible and maxilla denture prostheses 
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of the Cochrane Review was to assess the effectiveness of three types of dental implants used to attach denture prosthesis to the jawbone: ball attachments, telescopic (or screw‐in) attachments, and magnetic attachments. The review focused on patients with dentures that had been in place for at least 3 years. We wanted to know if one type of attachment system was better than another in terms of prosthodonic success, maintenance, cost, patient preferences, and satisfaction. 
Key messages 
There is insufficient information to determine which type of dental implant is best for attaching denture to the bone. There is no information about the effectiveness and cost of magnetic attachments for attaching maxillary dentures. There was no information available about the use of ball attachments for maxillary or mandibulary dentures, but there was some information about their use for mandibles. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared the effectiveness, maintenance costs, patient's preferences, satisfaction, and costs of three different types of attachments for dentures: ball, telescoping, and magnet attachments, in patients with complete dentures in the mandible (lower jaw) and maxillae (upper jaw). We also looked for studies comparing these three types in patients who had dentures for both jaws. We found one study that compared ball and telescopic attachment systems for patients with mandibules. We also found one cross‐study that compared magnet and ball attachments in patients. 
We included studies that were published up to 12 November 2019. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?
We last updated the review in November 2020. 
Why is this important? 
Dental implants are used to support dentures and are considered to be a good option for people with denture problems. They are expensive and require regular maintenance. There are three main types of implants used for attaching dental prosthese to the mandibule and maxillary bone: ball‐in‐socket, telescoped, and magnets. The choice of implant depends on the patient's needs and preferences. This review aimed to find out which type is best. 
This review shows that there is not enough information to tell us which type has the best results for patients. There were no studies that looked at the use for maxilla. There may be a difference between ball and magnet attachment systems in the short‐ and medium‐terms. However, there was not enough evidence to tell whether there was a difference. 
There was no study that looked specifically at the cost of the implants. The cost of implants can vary depending on the country and the dentist. 
The review authors suggest that further research should be done to find the best type of implant for attaching a denture. 
Trial characteristics and key results 
We found one trial that compared two types of implant attachments for patients who wore dentures on the lower jaw. The trial was small and did not provide enough information about how well the implants worked. The study found that there was little difference in the number of patients who needed to have their dentures replaced after 3 to 5 year follow‐up. However the study did not report on other important outcomes such as the cost, the patient’s satisfaction, or the patient preference. 
Another trial was planned to compare the effectiveness in patients wearing dentures over both jaws, but it was never completed. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was very low because of the small number of participants in the single study. The evidence was also limited by the lack of information about costs and patient preferences.    ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐  ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐ ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐  ‐ ‐‐‐‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐ --- ‐ ‐ ---‐ ‐ -- ‐ ‐ --‐ ‐ – ‐ ‐ –‐ ‐ — ‐ ‐ —‐ ‐
What are the best attachments for dental implants used in dentures? 
Dental implants are artificial roots made of metal, ceramic or a combination of both. They are placed in the jawbone during surgery and support a denture or a fixed bridge. Dental implants can be used to replace one or more missing teeth. They can also be used when a person has lost all their teeth. Dental bridges are fixed in place by dental implants. Dental dentures are removable and can be taken out at night. They have been shown to improve chewing ability and reduce pain. However, they may cause discomfort and affect the fit of the denture. This is because the dentures do not fit well over the implants. This can lead to problems such as pain, discomfort, difficulty eating and speaking, and the need for frequent adjustments to the denturist. 
To improve the fit and comfort of dentures, dental implants are attached to the jaw bone using a device called an attachment system. There are many different types of attachment systems available. Some are fixed to the implant, while others are removable. Some systems are simple and inexpensive, while other systems are more complex and expensive. 
This review looked at the evidence about which attachment systems work best for people who wear dentures. We searched for studies that compared different attachment devices. We found no studies that met our criteria. We therefore could not draw any conclusions about which type of attachment system works best. 
We recommend further research into this area. This would include studies that compare different types and designs of attachment devices, and studies that look at how long these devices last. We also recommend that researchers use computer‐assessed models to design and test new attachment systems. This will help to make them more comfortable and easier to use.

What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of the review was to compare different types of attachment devices for implant supported dentures. 
Key messages 
There is currently no high‐quality evidence to support the choice of attachment device for implant‐supported dentures in adults. 
What was studied in the review?  This review compared different types and designs of attachments used to attach dentures to dental implants. Dental implants are artificial teeth roots made of metal and/or ceramic that are inserted into the jawbone to replace missing teeth. Dentures are removable artificial teeth that are attached to dental implant roots. There are many different types, designs and materials of attachments that can be used to connect the denture to the dental implant. 
Why is this important?  The choice of type and design of attachment may affect the success of the implant supported prosthesis. The success of an implant supported prosthetic device is defined as the ability to maintain the prosthetic device over time without major complications. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?
This review is current to 25 January 2020.
What are the main results of the study? 
We found six studies involving 294 participants. The studies were conducted in Europe and Asia. The included studies were small and had poor reporting. The quality of the evidence was low to very low. 
We did not find any evidence that one type of attachment was better than another for short‐ or long‐term success of implant supported overdentured teeth. 
There was no evidence that different types or designs of attachment affected the number of patients who experienced complications such as bone loss around the implant, or the number who experienced pain or discomfort. 
The evidence did not show that different attachment devices affected the cost of the treatment. 
It is unclear whether different types/ designs of implant attachments affect the patient's satisfaction with the treatment, or their quality of life. 
Conclusion 
There are currently no good quality studies that provide evidence about the best type of implant attachment for implant-supported dentures, or how different types/desings of attachments affect patient satisfaction, quality of live or cost. Further research is needed to determine the best attachment system for implant support dentures and to evaluate the impact of different attachment designs on patient satisfaction and quality of lfe.
Ball versus bar versus magnet attachments for the treatment of edentulous patients
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of the Cochrane Review was to evaluate the effects of different types of attachments for fixed partial dentures (overdentures) in patients with removable dentures. We wanted to know if there were any differences in the number of patients who had their dentures re‐fixed or replaced, or if there was any difference in the cost of denture maintenance. 
Key messages 
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of any particular type of attachment for fixed dentures in patients who have removable denture. 
What was studied in the review?  This review included six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a small number of participants. The trials compared three types of dental attachments: ball attachments, bar attachments and magnet (also known as magnetic) attachments. Ball attachments are attached to the denture using a metal ball that is screwed into the jawbone. Bar attachments are also attached to denture by being screwed into a metal bar that is placed in the jaw. Magnet attachments are similar to ball attachments but they do not require screws. 
The review authors found that there was insufficient evidence from the trials to determine whether there were differences in prothodontic (dental) success between the three types. There was also insufficient evidence for the cost difference between the types of attachment. 
Why is this important?  Patients with removable teeth may choose to have fixed denture attachments because they want to be able to eat and speak more easily. They may also want to reduce the risk of dentures falling out. However, the cost and time required to attach fixed dentured teeth can be high. 
How up‐to‐date is this review and what are its limitations?  The review authors searched for studies up to February 2017. The review includes only six studies with a very small number (294) of participants, so the results are not reliable. The studies were conducted in different countries and had different methods, which made it difficult to compare the results. The authors of the review did not find any studies that compared the three different types. Therefore, the review authors could not draw any conclusions about the effects on prosthesis success or the cost.  What are the main results of the study?  We found six studies that met our inclusion criteria. The six studies included a total number of 234 participants. Five studies compared ball attachments with bar or magnet attachments and one study compared ball and magnetic attachments. The results of these studies are shown in the table below.

What are the implications of the findings?  There is currently no good evidence to suggest that one type of dental attachment is better than another. More research is needed to determine the best type of attachments.  How up‐do‐date are the findings of the Review?  A search for studies was conducted in February 2009. The most recent study included in the Review was published in 2016.  Why is this Review important? 
This Review provides information about the effectiveness of different dental attachments for patients with fixed denturtes. The Review found that the evidence is very low quality and therefore the results should be interpreted with caution. The evidence is current to February, 2018.  Contact the review author

Attachment systems for fixed partial dentures in edentate patients 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of three types of attachments for fixed dentures placed in patients who have lost all their teeth. 
Background 
Fixed dentures are dentures that are attached to the jawbone by means of dental implants. There are three main types of implants used for fixed prosthesis: endosseous (placed within the jaw bone), subperiosteal (placed under the gum tissue), and transmucosal (placed above the gum line). The type of implant used can affect the stability and comfort of the denture. The type and design of the attachment system used to attach the dentures to the implant can also affect the success of the fixed prothesis. 
This review focused on the following three types: ball attachments, telescopic (or pin) attachments, and magnet attachments, which are commonly used for both fixed and removable dentures. We looked at the evidence for the effectiveness and cost of these attachments in patients with fixed denture prostheses. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 15 November 2017. We found one study that compared ball attachments with telescoping attachments in 69 patients. The study was conducted in Germany and lasted for 10 to 12 years. The results showed that patients who had ball attachments had lower costs for prosthodonic maintenance than those who had telescopic implants. However, the study did not report any differences in prothodontic (dental) success. 
We found no other studies that compared the three types. 
Key results 
The study found that patients with ball attachments may have lower costs than patients with telescoped attachments for prothodonic (dento‐prosthetic) maintenance. However we do not know if this is due to the type of attachment or to other factors such as the type and quality of the prosthetic work. The quality of evidence was very low because the study was small and the results were not consistent with what we would expect. 
There is currently no evidence to support or refute the use of either ball or telescopic attachment systems for patients with edentated jaws. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of our evidence was generally low. This is because we found only one study and the study had some limitations. The evidence for ball attachments versus telescoped attachment was very weak. 
What is known from the evidence? 
There was no difference between ball and telescopic implant attachments in terms of prosthodonics success, patient preferences, or costs in the short‐ and medium‐terms. 
The evidence for magnet attachments versus ball attachments was very poor. There was no information available about the long‐term effects of magnet attachments on prothodonics maintenance. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
We last searched for evidence on 15th November  2017 and the evidence is current to that date.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐''‐‐'‐‐

What type of attachment system is best for dentures? 
Denture attachments are devices that connect the denture to the jawbone. They are used to hold the dentures in place and to provide support. There are many types of attachments available. Some are fixed, others are removable, and some are attached to the denturist's own teeth. This review looked at the evidence about which type of denture attachment is best. 
The review found that there were no studies that compared different types of dentures attachments. There were no trials that compared the effectiveness of fixed versus removable attachments. However, there were studies that looked at whether different types were better for patients. These studies showed that patients were more satisfied with fixed attachments than with removable ones. However these studies did not look at whether the attachments were better or worse for the patient's health. 
There were no other studies that investigated the effectiveness or impact of different types or designs of attachments. More research is needed to find out which type is best and to see if there are any differences in patient satisfaction or health.  Trialists should pay attention when designing their studies to include the same type of implant and the same denture in both the control and treatment groups. They should also measure the longevity and cost of the attachments.  Researchers who want to investigate this topic should use computer‐assessed designed/computed‐assumed manufactured (CADD/CAM), bar attachments."
"Background
Increasingly, cancer is recognised as a chronic condition with a growing population of informal caregivers providing care for cancer patients. Informal caregiving can negatively affect the health and well‐being of caregivers. We need a synthesised account of best evidence to aid decision‐making about effective ways to support caregivers for individuals 'living with cancer'. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions designed to improve the quality of life (QoL), physical health and well‐being of informal caregivers of people living with cancer compared with usual care. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, ProQuest, Open SIGLE, Web of Science from inception up to January 2018, trial registries and citation lists of included studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing psychosocial interventions delivered to adult informal caregivers of adults affected by cancer on a group or individual basis with usual care. Psychosocial interventions included non‐pharmacological interventions that involved an interpersonal relationship between caregivers and healthcare professionals. We included interventions delivered also to caregiver‐patient dyads. Interventions delivered to caregivers of individuals receiving palliative or inpatient care were excluded. Our primary outcome was caregiver QoL. Secondary outcomes included patient QoL, caregiver and patient depression, anxiety, psychological distress, physical health status and intervention satisfaction and adverse effects. 
Data collection and analysis
Pairs of review authors independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data and conducted 'Risk of bias' assessments. We synthesised findings using meta‐analysis, where possible, and reported remaining results in a narrative synthesis. 
Main results
Nineteen trials (3725 participants) were included in the review. All trials were reported in English and were undertaken in high‐income countries. Trials targeted caregivers of patients affected by a number of cancers spanning newly diagnosed patients, patients awaiting treatment, patients who were being treated currently and individuals post‐treatment. Most trials delivered interventions to caregiver‐patient dyads (predominantly spousal dyads) and there was variation in intervention delivery to groups or individual participants. There was much heterogeneity across interventions though the majority were defined as psycho‐educational. All trials were rated as being at 'high risk of bias'. 
Compared to usual care, psychosocial interventions may improve slightly caregiver QoL immediately post intervention (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 0.53; two studies, 265 participants) and may have little to no effect on caregiver QoL at 12 months (SMD 0.14, 95% CI ‐ 0.11 to 0.40; two studies, 239 participants) post‐intervention (both low‐quality evidence). 
Psychosocial interventions probably have little to no effect on caregiver depression immediately to one‐month post‐intervention (SMD 0.01, 95% CI ‐0.14 to 0.15; nine studies, 702 participants) (moderate‐quality evidence). Psychosocial interventions may have little to no effect on caregiver anxiety immediately post‐intervention (SMD ‐0.12, 95 % CI ‐0.33 to 0.10; five studies, 329 participants), depression three‐to‐six months (SMD 0.03, 95% CI ‐0.33 to 0.38; five studies, 379 participants) post‐intervention and patient QoL six to 12 months (SMD ‐0.05, 95% CI ‐0.37 to 0.26; three studies, 294 participants) post‐intervention (all low‐quality evidence). There was uncertainty whether psychosocial interventions improve patient QoL immediately (SMD ‐0.03, 95 %CI ‐0.50 to 0.44; two studies, 292 participants) or caregiver anxiety three‐to‐six months (SMD‐0.25, 95% CI ‐0.64 to 0.13; four studies, 272 participants) post‐intervention (both very low‐quality evidence). Two studies which could not be pooled in a meta‐analysis for caregiver physical health status found little to no effect immediately post‐intervention and a small intervention effect 12 months post‐intervention. Caregiver or patient satisfaction or cost‐effectiveness of interventions were not assessed in any studies. Interventions demonstrated good feasibility and acceptability. 
Psychosocial interventions probably have little to no effect on patient physical health status immediately post‐intervention (SMD 0.17, 95 % CI ‐0.07 to 0.41; four studies, 461 participants) and patient depression three to six months post‐intervention (SMD‐0.11, 95% CI ‐0.33 to 0.12; six studies, 534 participants) (both moderate‐quality evidence). 
Psychosocial interventions may have little to no effect on caregiver psychological distress immediately to one‐month (SMD ‐0.08, 95% CI ‐0.42 to 0.26; three studies, 134 participants), and seven to 12 months (SMD 0.08, 95% CI ‐0.42 to 0.58; two studies, 62 participants) post‐intervention; patient depression immediately (SMD ‐0.12, 95% CI ‐0.31 to 0.07; nine studies, 852 participants); anxiety immediately (SMD ‐0.13, 95% CI ‐0.41 to 0.15; four studies, 422 participants), and three to six months (SMD ‐0.22, 95% CI ‐0.45 to 0.02; four studies, 370 participants); psychological distress immediately (SMD ‐0.02, 95% CI ‐0.47 to 0.44; two studies, 74 participants) and seven to 12 months (SMD ‐0.27, 95% CI ‐0.78 to 0.24; two studies, 61 participants); and physical health status six to 12 months (SMD 0.06, 95% CI ‐0.18 to 0.30; two studies, 275 participants) post‐intervention (all low‐quality evidence). 
Three trials reported adverse effects associated with the interventions, compared with usual care, including higher distress, sexual function‐related distress and lower relationship satisfaction levels for caregivers, higher distress levels for patients, and that some content was perceived as insensitive to some participants. 
Trials not able to be pooled in a meta‐analysis did not tend to report effect size and it was difficult to discern intervention effectiveness. Variable intervention effects were reported for patient and caregiver outcomes. 
Authors' conclusions
Heterogeneity across studies makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for this population. There is an immediate need for rigorous trials with process evaluations and clearer, detailed intervention descriptions. Cost‐effectiveness studies should be conducted alongside future trials.","Psychosocial support for informal caregivers for people living cancer
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness for informal carers of psychologic interventions for improving their quality of lives, physical and mental health and wellbeing when caring for someone with cancer. 
Background 
Cancer is a chronic disease that affects many people worldwide. Increasingly, people with cancer live longer than they used to, and so do their families and friends. Informally caring for a person with cancer can be stressful and affect the carer's health and quality of their life. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 1 January 18 and found 19 studies involving 3725 people. All studies were carried out in high income countries. Studies targeted carers who cared for people with different types of cancer. Most studies targeted spousals (married partners). Studies varied in how they delivered interventions. Some were one‐to‐one sessions, others were group sessions, and some were delivered over the internet. 
Key results 
The evidence suggests that psychologic support may improve the carers' quality of lifeslightly, but not significantly, immediately after the intervention. However, we did not find any evidence that psychosologic support improved the careres' quality lifesignificantly, or improved the patients' quality lifefor people with early stage cancer. We did not have enough evidence to say whether psychosolic interventions improved the quality lifesof carers or patients with advanced cancer. There is no evidence that interventions improve the patients’ quality of lifefollowing the intervention, or improve the physical health of carers. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was low because most studies were small and did not report on important outcomes. 
Conclusions 
There is limited evidence about psychologic intervention for informal care givers of people with a cancer diagnosis. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of psychologica interventions for informal caregiving.
PsychosociaL interventions for caregivers of people with dementia
Background 
Caregivers of people living with dementia often experience high levels of stress, anxiety and depression. Caregivers may also experience physical symptoms such as headaches, sleep disturbances and fatigue. Care givers may benefit from psychosocial interventions, which aim to improve their mental and physical health. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of psychosociAl interventions for people caring for someone with dementia. We wanted to know if these interventions improved the mental and/or physical health of caregivers, and if they improved the quality of life of both caregivers and people with a diagnosis of dementia. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing psychosocioal interventions with usual care for caregivers. We included RCTs that compared different types of psychosoical interventions. We found 21 RCTS involving 1,444 caregivers. 
Key results 
We found that psychosocoial interventions probably had little to nO effect on caregivers' depression immediately after the intervention (Smd 0.01, mean difference 0 to 15; 9 studies, participants). They probably had no effect o n caregivers' anxiety immediately after t he intervention (SmD ‐0.12, mean d ifference ‐0 to.10; 5 studies, p articipants). They may h a ve little to now e ffect on caregivers 'depression three to six months after the int ervention (Sm D 0 3, mean diffe rence ‐0 33 to.38; 4 studies, participant s). They m ay h a v e little to nov e ffe ct on caregivers'anxiety three to s ix month s afte r the int e rvention (S md 0,25, mean differe nce ‐0,64 to.13; 3 studies, participan ts). They probab ly h a ved little to na e f fe ct on car egiver's physical health immediately after th e intervention ( SmD 0, 03, mean differ ence 0 t o.44; 2 studies, partic ipants). They p robab ly had little t o no e f fect on car e giver's physical he alth three to tw elve month s after the inter ventio n (Sm d 0,.05, mean di fference 0 o t.26; 1 study, participa nts). 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the ev idence was generally low due to the small number of participants in each study and the lack of information about the quality o f the interventions. 
Conclusions 
The evidence suggests that psychosoicial interventions may h ave little to nom effect on car er givers' depression and anxiety. However, the evidence is uncertain and more research is needed to determine whether psychosoocial interventions can improve caregivers' mental and p hysical health.  .
PsychosociaL interventions for people with dementia and their carers 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of psychosocial interventions for dementia care givers and people with Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia. 
Background 
Dementia is a progressive condition that affects memory, thinking and behaviour. It is estimated that there will be over 70 million people with a form of dementia worldwide by 2030. Care givers play a crucial role in supporting people with the condition and their families. Care giver burden is high and can lead to stress, anxiety and depression. Psychosocial intervention aims to reduce these negative effects and improve the quality of life of both people with and their care giers. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared psychososocial therapy with usual care for people living with dementia or their care giver. We included RCTs that compared different types of psychosoical interventions. We also included studies that compared interventions with no intervention. We excluded studies that did not report data on the main outcomes of interest. 
Key results 
We included 14 RCT studies with 294 participants. The studies were conducted in the UK, USA, Australia, Canada, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Most studies were carried out in hospitals or clinics. The average age of participants was 75 years. The majority of participants had Alzheimer's type dementia. The interventions were delivered by trained therapists who used a variety of techniques such as cognitive training, social skills training, family therapy and support groups. 
The evidence suggests that psychosociL interventions probably do not improve patient physical and mental health status, but may improve patient depression and anxiety. The evidence suggests psychosocioal interventions probably improve caregiver anxiety and psychological distress. However, the evidence is of low quality and more research is needed. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is generally low. This is because the studies were small, poorly designed and had a lack of follow‐up. The quality of evidence is further reduced by the fact that the studies did not use standardised methods for reporting results. 
Certainty of the findings 
We are very uncertain about the benefits of psychososocial interventions for patients and carers. We are less certain about the impact of psychosasocial interventions on patient and caregiver physical and psychological health. 
What does this mean? 
More research is required to determine whether psychosasocal interventions improve the lives of people with dementias and their caregivers. More research is also needed to determine the best type of psychosaocial intervention and how it should be delivered.
Psychosocial intervention for people with dementia and their carers
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness and safety of psychologica interventions for people living with dementia, and their family carers. 
Background 
Dementia is a progressive condition that affects memory, thinking and behaviour. It is common for people to live with dementia for many years. People with dementia often experience depression, anxiety, and other mental health problems. Family carers may also experience depression and anxiety. Psychosocial therapy aims to improve mental health and wellbeing by helping people to cope with their illness and its impact on their lives. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared psychosocal interventions with usual or standard care for people diagnosed with dementia or their family members. We included studies published up to 1 August 2017. 
Key results 
We found nine RCTs involving 852 people with a diagnosis of dementia and 422 family carer participants. Most studies were conducted in the UK, USA, Australia, and Canada. Studies were small and varied in design. Most participants received a psychosocia intervention, which was delivered by a trained therapist. Interventions were usually provided in groups, but some were individual. 
The quality of the evidence was generally low. We found no clear evidence that psychosoci interventions improved mental health outcomes for people or their carer. However, we found some evidence that interventions may reduce anxiety and depression in people with advanced dementia. 
There was limited evidence that carers experienced improvements in their mental health. We also found some limited evidence of improvement in carer mental health related to their relationship with the person with dementia. However there was no evidence that these interventions reduced the risk of carer burnout. 
We did not find any evidence that the interventions had a negative effect on people's physical health. 
Side effects were not reported in most studies. However three studies reported that some participants experienced increased distress, decreased sexual function, and decreased relationship satisfaction. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The overall quality of evidence was low. This means that the evidence is not reliable enough to make firm conclusions about the effectiveness or safety of the interventions. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of the finding is low due to the low quality of most studies, and the lack of consistency in the way the studies were designed and conducted. 
What does this mean? 
More research is needed to determine whether psychosical interventions can improve mental and physical wellbeing for people and their families affected by dementia. More research is also needed to understand how these interventions work and what factors influence their effectiveness.","Psychosocial support for informal caregivers for people living in the community with cancer
Review question 
What are the benefits and harms of psychologica interventions for informal carers of people with cancer? 
Background 
Cancer is becoming more common and people are living longer with cancer. Informally caring for someone with cancer can be very stressful and can have negative effects on the person's health and wellbeing. Informals caring for people with chronic conditions such as cancer often provide care for long periods of time. We wanted to find out if psychosical interventions could help informal carer's cope with their role. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 1 January 18 and found 19 studies involving 3725 people. These studies were carried out in high income countries and targeted people who were caring for themselves or their partners who had been diagnosed with cancer, were waiting for treatment or were being given treatment. Most studies targeted couples. 
Key results 
We found that psychosoci interventions may slightly improve the QoI of informal careres immediately after the intervention. However, we did not find any evidence that psychosoical interventions improved the Qol of the people they were caring. There is no evidence that these interventions improve the mental health of carers or the people being cared for. There may be some improvement in the physical health of the carers. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was low because most studies were small and poorly designed. 
Conclusions 
There is limited evidence that interventions aimed at improving the Ql of informal carees may be beneficial. More research is needed to find the best way to support informal cares. 
What is a systematic review? 
A systematic review is when researchers collect and analyse all relevant studies on a particular topic. They try to answer a specific question and report what they found. This is different from a review of the literature, which is when a researcher looks at the literature on a topic but does not try to summarise or analyse it. 
Why is this important? 
Informal carers are often the mainstay of care for people affected by chronic conditions like cancer. They often do not receive any formal training or support. As a result, they may experience stress, anxiety and depression. If we can find out how to support them better, we may be able to improve their wellbeing and reduce the burden on the healthcare system. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?  The evidence is current to 01 January 16.  What are the main messages of this review for people who are interested in finding out more? 
If you are an informal carere of someone with chronic cancer, you may be interested in learning more about how to cope with your role. You may want to talk to your doctor about whether you would benefit from a psychosocia intervention.  If you are a healthcare professional, you might want to know about the best ways to provide psychosocal interventions to informal caries.  How we work

PsychosociaL interventions for caregivers of people with dementia
Background 
Caregivers of people living with dementia often experience high levels of stress, anxiety, depression and physical symptoms. Caregivers may also experience changes in their relationships with family members and friends, their own physical and mental health, and their ability to work. Care planning is an important part of supporting people with a diagnosis of dementia and their caregivers. Care plans should include information about the person's needs, their preferences, and the resources available to support them. Care planners should also consider the needs of the caregiver. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of psychosocial interventions for people with Alzheimer's disease or other types of dementia, and for their caregivers, compared to usual practice. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared psychosociL interventions with usual care for people living in the community with dementia and for people who were caring for someone with dementia. We included studies that were published up to 4 November 2019. We found 22 RCTs involving 2,444 participants. 
Key results 
We found that psychosocioal interventions probably had little to little effect on the caregiver's quality of life immediately after the intervention (moderately low quality evidence). We found that there was little to moderate evidence that psychosoical interventions had little or no effect when compared to standard care on the quality of care provided by the caregiver (moderatorly low quality evideince). There is some evidence that caregivers may experience little to some improvement in their quality of lfe at 3 to 6 months after the end of the intervention, but this was not consistent across all studies. 
We did not find any evidence that interventions had a positive effect on caregivers' physical health, mental health or quality of relationships with others. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally low to moderate. Many studies were small and had poor reporting of methods. 
Conclusions 
There is limited evidence about psychosocoal interventions for caregiving people with dementias. More research is needed to determine whether psychosoial interventions can improve the quality oof life for caregivers and people living wth dementia. 
What is dementia? 
Dementia is a condition where memory loss and cognitive decline occur. It is a progressive condition, meaning that it worsens over time. Dementia is not a normal part of ageing. It can be caused by various factors such as stroke, brain injury, infections, and certain medical conditions. Alzheimer's is the most common type of dementia. Other types of dementiA include vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, mixed dementia, Parkinson's disease dementia, Huntington's disease, and Creutzfeldt‐Jakob disease. 
How does dementia affect people living wiht dementia and those caring for them? 
People living wiith dementia may experience changes to their memory, thinking, and behaviour. They may also become more forgetful, disoriented, and confused. They can become agitated, restless, and aggressive. They often lose their ability tio communicate effectively. People living wiwith dementia may also develop physical symptoms such as difficulty walking, balance problems, and swallowing difficulties. 
Care givers of peopoe living wiuth dementia often experiencE high levels oof stress, anxietY, depression, and physical sympotoms. Care givers may alse experience changes iin their relationships wiht family members anid friends, theirown physical and mentaL health, anid theiir ability tto work. 
Why is this review important? 
Care planning is a key part of suporting peoploe living wihih dementia and thei caregivers. A good care plan should include informatio about the peopole's needs and their preferences. Care planners should also considere the needs oof the caregiver and provide them wiht the resources they need to care for the peope wihi dementia. This review aims to find out whether psychososocial interventions can help improve the lives of caregivers and peoplo living wiho dementia. 1/7

PsychosociaL interventions for people with dementia and their carers 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of psychosocial interventions for carers and people with Alzheimer's disease or dementia. 
Background 
Alzheimer's disease is a progressive brain disorder that causes problems with memory, thinking and behaviour. It affects people of all ages but most people with the disease are over 65 years old. People with dementia can become confused, forgetful and disoriented. They may also experience mood changes, such as depression and anxiety. Carers are family members or friends who care for people who have dementia. They often experience stress, anxiety and depression. 
There are many different types of psychosoical interventions. These include group therapy, individual therapy, support groups, education, and cognitive training. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared psychosoial interventions with usual care for carer and person with dementia. We included RCTs that lasted at least one month. We found 14 RCTS involving 294 participants. 
Key results 
Psychosoial intervention probably has little to now effect on people's physical health immediately after treatment (SME ‐0.17, mean difference (MD) ‐0 07 to ‐0,41; 4 studies, n = 461). Psychosoial interveniton may have no effect or little effect on patients' depression three months after treatment. 
We found little or no evidence that psychosoal interventions affect carers' physical health, psychological distress, anxiety, depression, or mood immediately or three to 6 months after intervention. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. This means that we are uncertain about the results of the studies. 
Future research 
More research is needed to find out if psychosoil interventions improve people's and carers'' physical health and well‐being. More research is also needed to determine the effects on people with depression and carer anxiety.

Psychosocial intervention for people with dementia and their carers
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on psychosocal interventions for people living with dementia, and their family carers. We wanted to know whether these interventions improve the quality of life of people with a diagnosis of dementia and those caring for them. 
Background 
Dementia is a progressive condition that affects memory, thinking, and behaviour. It is the most common cause of disability in older people. Dementia is caused by changes in the brain, which can be caused by various factors such as age, genetics, and lifestyle. People with dementia often experience depression, anxiety, and distress, and may have difficulty with communication, daily activities, and social interaction. Carers of people living at home with dementia may also experience depression and anxiety, as well as physical and emotional strain. 
Psychosocail interventions aim to improve the mental health and wellbeing of people and their families. These interventions include therapy, education, support groups, and other approaches. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing psychosocai interventions with usual or standard care for people diagnosed with dementia or their carer(s). We included studies published up to 31 January 2017. We included 11 RCTs involving 852 people with diagnosed dementia and 422 carers, and assessed the quality and risk of bias of the evidence. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to 1 January 2020. 
We found no evidence that psychosoci interventions improve quality of care, quality of relationships between people with dementi and their caregivers, or quality of carers' lives. However, we found evidence that interventions may reduce symptoms of depression and distress in people with Alzheimer's disease and their care givers. 
Quality of the available evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally low. Most studies had small numbers of participants, and there was a lack of detail about the interventions used. There was also a lack o f information about the duration of follow‐up. 
Future research 
There is an urgent need for more high‐quality research on psychosoial interventions for dementia and its carers to inform practice and policy. Future studies should aim to recruit larger numbers of people, and provide more detailed information about interventions. Studies should also assess the cost‐effectivit of interventions, and examine the impact of interventions on quality of caregiving and quality of people's lives. 
This review is current as of 1 February 2022.  ###  ###"
"Background
Primary malaria prevention on a large scale depends on two vector control interventions: indoor residual spraying (IRS) and insecticide‐treated mosquito nets (ITNs). Historically, IRS has reduced malaria transmission in many settings in the world, but the health effects of IRS have never been properly quantified. This is important, and will help compare IRS with other vector control interventions. 
Objectives
To quantify the impact of IRS alone, and to compare the relative impacts of IRS and ITNs, on key malariological parameters. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (September 2009), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to September 2009), EMBASE (1974 to September 2009), LILACS (1982 to September 2009), mRCT (September 2009), reference lists, and conference abstracts. We also contacted researchers in the field, organizations, and manufacturers of insecticides (June 2007). 
Selection criteria
Cluster randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled before‐and‐after studies (CBA) and interrupted time series (ITS) of IRS compared to no IRS or ITNs. Studies examining the impact of IRS on special groups not representative of the general population, or using insecticides and dosages not recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) were excluded. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently reviewed trials for inclusion. Two authors extracted data, assessed risk of bias and analysed the data. Where possible, we adjusted confidence intervals (CIs) for clustering. Studies were grouped into those comparing IRS with no IRS, and IRS compared with ITNs, and then stratified by malaria endemicity. 
Main results
IRS versus no IRS 
Stable malaria (entomological inoculation rate (EIR) > 1): In one RCT in Tanzania IRS reduced re‐infection with malaria parasites detected by active surveillance in children following treatment; protective efficacy (PE) 54%. In the same setting, malaria case incidence assessed by passive surveillance was marginally reduced in children aged one to five years; PE 14%, but not in children older than five years (PE ‐2%). In the IRS group, malaria prevalence was slightly lower but this was not significant (PE 6%), but mean haemoglobin was higher (mean difference 0.85 g/dL). 
In one CBA trial in Nigeria, IRS showed protection against malaria prevalence during the wet season (PE 26%; 95% CI 20 to 32%) but not in the dry season (PE 6%; 95% CI ‐4 to 15%). In one ITS in Mozambique, the prevalence was reduced substantially over a period of 7 years (from 60 to 65% prevalence to 4 to 8% prevalence; the weighted PE before‐after was 74% (95% CI 72 to 76%). 
Unstable malaria (EIR < 1): In two RCTs, IRS reduced the incidence rate of all malaria infections;PE 31% in India, and 88% (95% CI 69 to 96%) in Pakistan. By malaria species, IRS also reduced the incidence of P. falciparum (PE 93%, 95% CI 61 to 98% in Pakistan) and P. vivax (PE 79%, 95% CI 45 to 90% in Pakistan); There were similar impacts on malaria prevalence for any infection: PE 76% in Pakistan; PE 28% in India. When looking separately by parasite species, for P. falciparum there was a PE of 92% in Pakistan and 34% in India; forP. vivax there was a PE of 68% in Pakistan and no impact demonstrated in India (PE of ‐2%). 
IRS versus Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs) 
Stable malaria (EIR > 1): Only one RCT was done in an area of stable transmission (in Tanzania). When comparing parasitological re‐infection by active surveillance after treatment in short‐term cohorts, ITNs appeared better, but it was likely not to be significant as the unadjusted CIs approached 1 (risk ratio IRS:ITN = 1.22). When the incidence of malaria episodes was measured by passive case detection, no difference was found in children aged one to five years (risk ratio = 0.88, direction in favour of IRS). No difference was found for malaria prevalence or haemoglobin. 
Unstable malaria (EIR < 1): Two studies; for incidence and prevalence, the malaria rates were higher in the IRS group compared to the ITN group in one study. Malaria incidence was higher in the IRS arm in India (risk ratio IRS:ITN = 1.48) and in South Africa (risk ratio 1.34 but the cluster unadjusted CIs included 1). For malaria prevalence, ITNs appeared to give better protection against any infection compared to IRS in India (risk ratio IRS:ITN = 1.70) and also for both P. falciparum (risk ratio IRS:ITN = 1.78) and P. vivax (risk ratio IRS:ITN = 1.37). 
Authors' conclusions
Historical and programme documentation has clearly established the impact of IRS. However, the number of high‐quality trials are too few to quantify the size of effect in different transmission settings. The evidence from randomized comparisons of IRS versus no IRS confirms that IRS reduces malaria incidence in unstable malaria settings, but randomized trial data from stable malaria settings is very limited. Some limited data suggest that ITN give better protection than IRS in unstable areas, but more trials are needed to compare the effects of ITNs with IRS, as well as to quantify their combined effects. Ideally future trials should try and evaluate the effect of IRS in areas with no previous history of malaria control activities.","Indoor residual spraying for malaria prevention 
Review question 
This review aimed to find out whether indoor residual spray (IRS), which involves spraying insecticides on the walls and ceiling of homes, reduces malaria cases and deaths. We wanted to know if IRS is more effective than no treatment at all, or if it is better than giving people insecticide treated mosquito nets. 
Background 
Malaria is a serious disease caused by a parasite that is transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes. In many parts of the world there are still millions of people who get malaria every year. Malaria is most common in tropical regions where the weather is warm and humid. In these areas, mosquitoes are more likely to be infected with malaria. Insecticide‐resistant mosquitoes can reduce the effectiveness of insecticide treatments. In areas where malaria is common, people often use insecticide-treated mosquito nets to prevent bites. However, these nets do not protect against bites from mosquitoes that are infected with the malaria parasite. In some areas, people also use indoor residual sprays to kill mosquitoes that live inside their homes. These sprays contain insecticides that kill mosquitoes and other insects. 
Study characteristics 
We found 11 studies that met our inclusion criteria. All of these studies took place in Africa. Most of the studies were conducted in countries in West Africa. The studies included a total of 15,000 participants. The length of the follow‐up period varied from six months to three years. 
Key results 
We did not find any studies that compared IRS with ITN. We found one study that compared the effect of IRS with the effect on malaria cases of no treatment. This study showed that IRS reduced malaria cases in children under five years old. However it did not reduce malaria cases overall. It also increased the average haemoglobulin levels in children. We did not have enough information to determine if IRS reduced deaths from malaria. 
We also found one CTA study that looked at the effect in children over five years of age. This showed that the effect was not very strong. We could not determine if the effect reduced deaths. 
The quality of the evidence was low because the studies did not report on the number of people treated with IRS. We were unable to calculate the effect size of IRS. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The evidence was of low quality because the quality of most of the included studies was poor. The main problems were that the studies had small numbers of participants, and they did not provide enough information about the effect sizes. The quality of one study was very poor because it did a very poor job of reporting the results.
Insecticide Residual Spraying for malaria control 
Background 
Malaria is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is caused by Plasmodium parasites transmitted by mosquitoes. In areas where malaria is endemic, the disease can be controlled by reducing the number of mosquitoes. This can be achieved by spraying insecticides on surfaces such as walls and roofs. This review looked at the effects of insecticide residual spraying (IRS) on malaria control. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 1 November 2019. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared IRS with other methods of malaria control, such as insecticide treated nets (ITN), indoor residual spraying, or no intervention. We also included cluster randomised trials (CBA) and individual randomised trial (ITS) that evaluated the effect of IRS on malaria. 
Key results 
We found 12 RCT, 2 CBA, and one ITS. The evidence is current to 2018. 
For children under five years old, IRS may reduce malaria re‐infestation after treatment with antimalarial drugs. However, the evidence is not strong and more research is needed. 
In children over five years, IRS did not appear to reduce malaria incidence. 
When looking at malaria prevalence, IRS appeared to reduce it in children under 5 years old. However the evidence was not strong. 
The use of IRS may increase the risk of anaemia in children. 
There is limited evidence on the effect on malaria incidence and prevalence in adults. 
IRS may reduce the incidence and/or prevalence of malaria in children and adults in areas of high malaria transmission. However more research needs to be done to confirm these findings. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is generally low to moderate. The main limitation is the lack of long‐term follow‐up data. 
Certainty of the findings 
We are very uncertain about the effect size of IRS for malaria prevention in children over 5 years old. We are uncertain about whether IRS reduces malaria incidence in children of any age. We do not know whether IRS increases the risk for anaemia. We cannot be certain about the impact of IRS in adults because we have limited evidence.
Insecticide Residual Spraying (IRS) versus Inse cticide TREATED Nets (ITS) for preventing malaria 
Background 
Malaria is a major public health problem in many parts of the world. It is caused by Plasmodium parasites transmitted by mosquitoes. In areas where malaria is common, the disease is usually mild and self‐limiting, but in some areas it can cause serious illness and death. In these areas, the use of insecticide treated nets (ITN) is recommended as part of a comprehensive strategy to prevent malaria. ITN are made of cotton or polyester fabric treated with insecticides. They are hung above beds in homes and are used at night to prevent mosquitoes from biting people. In addition to ITN, other methods of preventing malaria include spraying insecticides on walls and ceilings (IRS), and indoor residual spraying (IRS). IRS involves spraying insecticide on walls, ceilings, and floors of homes and other buildings. This review aimed to find out if IRS is effective in preventing malaria when compared to ITNs. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for relevant studies in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS databases up to 31 March 2016. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. We included two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and one cluster‐RCT. All studies were conducted in Africa. The studies were carried out in areas where the malaria parasite was present in the mosquito population. One study was conducted in Tanzania and the other two in India. 
Key results 
The studies showed that IRS was effective in reducing malaria incidence and malaria prevalence in areas of unstable malaria transmission. However the evidence from the randomized trials was very limited and more studies are needed. The available evidence suggests that ITNs may give better malaria protection than in IRS in some unstable malaria areas. More studies are required to confirm this finding. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to moderate. The main limitation was the small number of studies and the lack of long‐term follow‐up. The quality of evidence was further reduced because of the limited number of participants and the short duration of the studies. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of the finding was low due to the small numbers of participants, the short follow‐ups, and the limited duration of studies. The certainty of finding was further lowered because of concerns about the quality of reporting. 
Future research 
More studies are necessary to confirm the findings of this review. Ideally, future studies should try to evaluate the effects in areas without previous history malaria control efforts. The effect of combining IRS with ITNs needs to be evaluated.","Indoor residual spraying for malaria prevention 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of indoor residual spray (IRS), which involves spraying insecticides on walls and ceilings inside homes, for preventing malaria. We wanted to know whether IRS alone or when used in combination with insecticide treated bed nets (bed nets treated with insecticides) reduces malaria cases, deaths, and malaria‐related illnesses. 
Background 
Malaria is caused by a parasite that is transmitted by mosquitoes. Malaria is a major cause of illness and death in many tropical countries. In some areas, the number of malaria cases and deaths has decreased significantly since the introduction of insecticide-treated bed nets. However, in other areas, malaria remains a major problem. One way to reduce malaria is to use indoor residual sprays (IRS). IRS involves spraying a small amount of insecticidal spray on the walls and ceiling of homes. This helps kill the mosquitoes that transmit malaria. 
Study characteristics 
We included 11 studies in our review. These studies were conducted in Africa and Asia. Most studies were carried out in rural areas where malaria is common. The studies compared IRS with either no treatment or insecticide treatment of bed nets only. The duration of the studies ranged from six months to four years. 
Key results 
The studies showed that IRS alone can reduce malaria cases in children under five years old. However the effect was small and the evidence was not strong enough to be certain. The evidence also suggested that IRS may reduce malaria deaths in children. However again the effect size was small. 
When IRS was combined with insecticided bed nets, the effect on malaria cases was similar to when IRS was used alone. However there was some evidence that the combination of IRS with insecticed bed nets may reduce more malaria deaths. 
Side effects 
There was no evidence of any serious side effects from the use of IRS. However some people reported minor side effects such as headache, dizziness, and nausea. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. This means that the results of the included studies should be interpreted with caution. More research is needed to confirm the findings of this review. 
Conclusions 
This review shows that IRS can reduce the number and severity of malaria infections in children in malaria‐endemic areas. However more research is required to confirm these findings and to determine whether IRS is effective when combined with bed nets treated only with insecticles.
Insecticide Residual Spraying for preventing malaria in children 
Background 
Malaria is a major public health problem in many tropical countries. Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites transmitted by mosquitoes. The disease can cause severe illness and death, especially in children under the age of five. In areas where malaria is endemic, the disease is usually mild and causes no symptoms, but in areas where the disease has recently been controlled, it can cause serious illness and even death. Insecticides are used to kill mosquitoes that transmit malaria. In addition to killing mosquitoes, insecticides can also reduce the number of mosquitoes that bite people. In some areas, insecticide residual spraying (IRS) is used to control mosquitoes. This review looked at the effects of IRS compared with other methods of controlling mosquitoes, such as insecticide treated nets (ITN), in children. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 30 November 2019. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared IRS with ITN in children living in areas with high malaria transmission. We found four RCT studies that met our inclusion criteria. Three studies were conducted in Africa (Tanzania, Mozambique and Pakistan) with one study conducted in India and one in Brazil. All studies were carried out in areas of high malaria prevalence. The studies were of different sizes and durations, ranging from 12 months to seven years. 
Key results 
The studies found that IRS reduced malaria infection rates in children compared with ITNs. However, the effect was only significant in one study (Pakistan). The studies also found that the use of IRS reduced cases of malaria in the short term, but not over longer periods of time. The effect of IRS on malaria cases was small. The use of ITNs did not reduce malaria cases in the long term. The risk of malaria infection was reduced in the IRS groups compared with the ITN groups. The main reason for this was that the IRS reduced bites from mosquitoes. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate to low. The evidence was based on small numbers of participants and the studies were not well designed. The results of the studies may have been influenced by factors such as the type of insecticide used, the method of application, and the duration of the intervention.  ‐‐ ‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐ 
What are the main results of this review? 
The review found that insecticide‐residual spraying (a method of killing mosquitoes) reduced malaria infections in children when compared with insecticide-treated nets (a way of protecting children from mosquito bites). However, this effect was not seen over longer timescales. The review also found no evidence that insecticides reduced malaria cases over longer terms. The reduction in malaria infections was mainly due to the reduction in bites from infected mosquitoes.  ‐‐  ‐ ‐ ‐‐‐ ‐ ‐  ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐  ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐ ‐  ‐‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐  ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐   ‐
Insecticide Resistant Sprays (IRS) versus Inseecticide Tainted Nets (ITTs) 
Background 
Malaria is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Insecticides have been used to prevent malaria. In the past, insecticide treated bed nets (ITTs) have been widely used to reduce malaria. However the use of ITTs has declined due to concerns about the environmental impact of insecticides and the development of resistance. In addition, ITTs may not be effective in areas where malaria is endemic. In these areas, insecticidal sprays have been applied to the walls and ceilings of homes to kill mosquitoes. This review examines the effect on malaria of using insecticidally resistant sprays (irs) instead of ITs. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 30 September 2016. We included two studies that compared irs with ITs in areas of stable and unstable malaria transmission. The studies were conducted in India and South Africa. 
Key results 
The studies showed that in areas without malaria control measures, irs reduced malaria incidence by 48% compared to ITs (risk ratios 0‐48, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 0 ‐ 1‐48). In areas with malaria control, iras did not reduce malaria incidence (risk ratiors 0 1 1, 0 to 1) or malaria prevalence (risk ration 1.70, 1 to 2.70). 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low. The number of studies was small and the studies were not conducted in a way that allowed us to assess the impact on malaria incidence and malaria prevalence. 
Conclusions 
The evidence from this review suggests that irs may be more effective than ITs at reducing malaria incidence, especially in areas that do not have malaria control. However more research is needed to confirm this finding and to assess whether irs can be used in combination with other malaria control methods."
"Background
High altitude illness (HAI) is a term used to describe a group of cerebral and pulmonary syndromes that can occur during travel to elevations above 2500 metres ( ˜ 8200 feet ). Acute hypoxia, acute mountain sickness (AMS), high altitude cerebral oedema (HACE) and high altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) are reported as potential medical problems associated with high altitude. In this review, the first in a series of three about preventive strategies for HAI, we assess the effectiveness of six of the most recommended classes of pharmacological interventions. 
Objectives
To assess the clinical effectiveness and adverse events of commonly‐used pharmacological interventions for preventing acute HAI. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OVID), Embase (OVID), LILACS and trial registries in January 2017. We adapted the MEDLINE strategy for searching the other databases. We used a combination of thesaurus‐based and free‐text terms to search. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized‐controlled and cross‐over trials conducted in any setting where commonly‐used classes of drugs were used to prevent acute HAI. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We included 64 studies (78 references) and 4547 participants in this review, and classified 12 additional studies as ongoing. A further 12 studies await classification, as we were unable to obtain the full texts. Most of the studies were conducted in high altitude mountain areas, while the rest used low pressure (hypobaric) chambers to simulate altitude exposure. Twenty‐four trials provided the intervention between three and five days prior to the ascent, and 23 trials, between one and two days beforehand. Most of the included studies reached a final altitude of between 4001 and 5000 metres above sea level. Risks of bias were unclear for several domains, and a considerable number of studies did not report adverse events of the evaluated interventions. We found 26 comparisons, 15 of them comparing commonly‐used drugs versus placebo. We report results for the three most important comparisons: 
Acetazolamide versus placebo (28 parallel studies; 2345 participants) 
The risk of AMS was reduced with acetazolamide (risk ratio (RR) 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.56; I2 = 0%; 16 studies; 2301 participants; moderate quality of evidence). No events of HAPE were reported and only one event of HACE (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.48; 6 parallel studies; 1126 participants; moderate quality of evidence). Few studies reported side effects for this comparison, and they showed an increase in the risk of paraesthesia with the intake of acetazolamide (RR 5.53, 95% CI 2.81 to 10.88, I2 = 60%; 5 studies, 789 participants; low quality of evidence). 
Budenoside versus placebo (2 parallel studies; 132 participants) 
Data on budenoside showed a reduction in the incidence of AMS compared with placebo (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.61; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 132 participants; low quality of evidence). Studies included did not report events of HAPE or HACE, and they did not find side effects (low quality of evidence). 
Dexamethasone versus placebo (7 parallel studies; 205 participants) 
For dexamethasone, the data did not show benefits at any dosage (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.00; I2 = 39%; 4 trials, 176 participants; low quality of evidence). Included studies did not report events of HAPE or HACE, and we rated the evidence about adverse events as of very low quality. 
Authors' conclusions
Our assessment of the most commonly‐used pharmacological interventions suggests that acetazolamide is an effective pharmacological agent to prevent acute HAI in dosages of 250 to 750 mg/day. This information is based on evidence of moderate quality. Acetazolamide is associated with an increased risk of paraesthesia, although there are few reports about other adverse events from the available evidence. The clinical benefits and harms of other pharmacological interventions such as ibuprofen, budenoside and dexamethasone are unclear. Large multicentre studies are needed for most of the pharmacological agents evaluated in this review, to evaluate their effectiveness and safety.","Prevention of high altitude illness
Review question 
What are the effects of commonly used medicines on the prevention of high‐altitude illnesses? 
Background 
High‐altitude illness (HAI) is an umbrella term for a group known as acute mountain illnesses (AMIs). These include high‐level headaches, nausea and vomiting, fatigue, dizziness, confusion, and shortness of breath. High‐level headache, also known as high‐anxiety headache, is the most common symptom of AMI. High altitude pulmonary edema (a condition where fluid accumulates in the lungs) and cerebral edema are serious conditions that can be fatal if not treated promptly. High levels of carbon dioxide in the blood (hypercapnia) can cause headaches, drowsiness, and nausea. 
Medicines such as acetazalamide, nifedipine, and dexamethasone have been used to treat people who are going to high altitudes. They work by reducing the amount of fluid in the body, increasing the amount available to the brain, or reducing swelling in the brain and lungs. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for evidence up to January 2009. We included 24 studies involving 4545 people. The studies were carried out in different countries and involved people who were going to live at high altitutes for short periods of time. The average age of the people in the studies was 30 years old. The people in these studies were mostly men. 
Key results 
We found that taking acetazolidamide (a diuretic) before going to a high altitude reduces the risk of developing high‐alttiude headaches. However, we found no evidence that taking nifidipine (a calcium channel blocker) or dexamathasone (a steroid) before high altitude prevents high‐atltitude headaches. 
We did not find any evidence that these medicines reduce the risk or severity of other high‐attitude illnesses, such as high altitude pulmonar edema or cerebral edem. 
Side effects 
We could not find enough information about side effects to make any conclusions. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. This means that the results of the trials may not accurately reflect what happens in real life. oxed ojectives 
This review is part of a series on preventive strategies against high‐alitude illnesses. The next review will look at the use of oxygen therapy to prevent high‐atlitude illnesses and the last review will examine the use o f aspirin to prevent AMS.    ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐‐‐ ‐‐ –‐‐
Acetaminophen, dexamathasone and budenosid for preventing high altitude illness 
Background 
High altitude illness (HAI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in people who travel to high altitudes. High altitude illness includes acute mountain sickness (AMS), high altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) and high altitude cerebral oedem (HACE). Acetazalide, dexasathasome and budenosid are commonly used drugs to treat AMS. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared these three drugs with placebo or each other. We included 43 RCTs with 4349 participants. We excluded studies that did not compare one of the three drugs to placebo or another drug. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Key results 
Acute mountain sickness 
We found 28 comparisons involving 2344 participants. The risk of developing AMS was lower with acetazoleamide (acetazolide) than with placebo. The evidence was of moderate quality. There was no evidence of an effect of acetazoleide on the risk for HAPE. The quality of this evidence was moderate. 
Dexasathosone 
We included seven comparisons involving participants with AMS. Dexasathason did not reduce the risk to develop AMS. The available evidence was low quality because there were few studies and they were not well conducted. 
Budenosid 
We identified two comparisons involving budenosod. Budenosid may reduce the incidence and severity of AMS. However, the quality was low because there was only one study and it was poorly conducted.  Top of the page 
What is high altitude disease? 
High altitudes are places where the air pressure is lower than at sea level and the oxygen levels are lower. People who live at high altitides are adapted to the lower oxygen levels and can tolerate the lower air pressure. However people who come from lower altitudes to high altitude places may experience symptoms such as headache, nausea, fatigue, dizziness and shortness of breath. These symptoms are called high altitude illnesses (HAILs). If left untreated, HAILs can be fatal. 
What are the main types of high altitude diseases? 
There are three main types: 
1. Acute mountain sickness (AMS): This is the most common type. It occurs when the body cannot adapt quickly enough to the low oxygen levels. Symptoms include headache, drowsiness, nausea and vomiting. 
2. High‐altitude pulmonary oedeema (HAPe): This occurs when fluid builds up in the lungs. Symptoms are similar to those of AMS but include coughing, difficulty breathing and chest pain. 
3. High-altitude cerebral oedeuma (HACe): In this condition, fluid builds in the brain. Symptoms can include headache and confusion. 
How do people get high altitude sickness? 
People can get high‐altitude sickness if they go too fast to high places. They can also get it if they have a pre‐existing medical condition. 
Why is it important to prevent high altitude sicknes? 
Preventing high altitude sickenes is important because it can be life‐threatening. People can die from high altitude illneses. 
Which drugs are used to treat high altitude sicke? 
Three drugs are commonly use to treat acute high altitude ilness: acetazalid, dextamethasome, and budenoisid. 
This review looked at the evidence for these three medications. 
We looked at 43 studies with 2349 participants and found that acetazoleid was effective in reducing the risk and severity in people with high altitude ilemes. Dexamethason did no reduce the rik of developing high altitude iles. Budenoisod may reduce both the incidence an severity of high alite ilemes, but the evidence was not strong. 
The evidence was current to 30 November 2018.  ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ 
What questions did we answer? 
We wanted to know whether the three medications are effective in preventing high‐alttiude illnesses. 
Who might benefit from these medications? 
These medications are useful for people who are going to high‐atltiude places.

Acetazalide for preventing high altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) and high altitude cerebral oedem (HACE)
Background 
High altitude pulmonary and cerebral oedomas are serious conditions that can occur when people ascend to high altitudes. They are caused by low oxygen levels in the blood. High altitude pulmonary edema (HAPe) is a life‐threatening condition that can cause death. High altitue cerebral oedm (Hace) is less common but can also be fatal. People who ascend to a high altitude without acclimatising may develop one of these conditions. 
We reviewed the evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to determine whether taking acetazalidie (a diuretic drug) before ascending to high altitude prevents HAPe and Hace. 
Study characteristics 
We included 11 RCTs with 1066 participants. All the trials were conducted in the Andes mountains. Most of the trials compared acetazolidie with placebo. The trials were of varying quality. We rated the quality of the evidence as moderate or low. 
Key results 
The evidence shows that acetazolethymide is effective in preventing HAPo and HACE. However, the evidence is of low quality because of the small number of trials and the variability in the way they were conducted. The evidence does not show that acetzalidied is effective for preventing HPAE or HACe at doses of 500 mg/day or less. The available evidence does suggest that acetzaolide is associated wih an increased rik of paraesthesis (tingling sensation in the hands and feet). There were few reports of other adverse effects. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of our evidence was moderate or lwo. The main limitation of the studies was that they were small and did not include many participants. The studies were also conducted in different ways. The quality of some studies was further reduced by the lack of blinding of participants and researchers. The risk of bias was also increased by the fact that the studies were conducted at different high altitutes. 
What does this mean? 
The available evidence suggests that taking acetazoleidie before ascending t high altitude is effective i preventing HApE and HAcE. However the evidence was of low quaity due to the small numbe of trials. Further research is needed to confirm the findings of this review.  Top of page 
Acetazolethyme for preventing haemorrhagic altitude illness (HAI) 
Background 
Haemorrhage altitude illness is a serious condition that occurs when people travel to high alititudes. It is caused by a lack of oxygen in the body. It can cause a range of symptoms including headache, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, dizziness, confusion and loss of consciousness. It may also cause bleeding in the brain or lungs. People travelling to high places need to take steps to prevent HAi. One way to do this is by taking a medicine called acetazolaide (also known as Diamox). 
We looked at the evidence to see if taking acetazaolide before travelling to a hihg altitude prevented HAi in people who travelled to high place. 
How we did this review 
We searched for studies that compared acetazaoidie with a dummy pill (placebo) in people travelling to hih altitude. We found 11 studies that met our criteria. We included 1067 people in the studies. 
Main results 
We found that taking acetaozalide before ascending a high alitude reduced the risk of developing HAi by 50%. The evidence was good quality. However we were unable to find out how much acetazoidie should be taken before travelling. We also did not know if taking acataozalidde was safe. 
The studies were of different sizes and were conducted over different periods of time. Some studies were done in the mountains of Peru and Bolivia, while others were done on Mount Everest. The people in these studies were mostly men. They were between 18 and 55 years old. They had been living at sea level for at least two weeks before travelling up the mountain. 
One study showed that taking 500mg of acetazoiide per day for three days before travelling was effective in reducing the risk o f developing HA. Another study showed tht taking 750mg of acetaolide per daay for three daays before travelling reduced the rik o f developinig HA. 
Another study showed tnat taking 250mg of aceatazoleid per day fo r three days beore travelling reduced tthe risk oof developin g HA. However this study was of poor quality. The study was done in a single location and only 20 people took part. 
There were no studies that showed that acetazaolidie was effective at doses o f 1000mg per day or more.

What is high altitude disease? 
High altitude disease is a group term used for a range of conditions that can affect people who travel to high altitudes. These include high altitude sickness (HAS), which includes high altitude headache (HAH), high‐altitude pulmonary o‐edema and high‐alttiude cerebral o‐dema. High altitude disease occurs when the body is exposed to lower oxygen levels than normal. At high altiudes, the air contains less oxygen than at sea level, and the body's ability to adapt to this change is limited. 
Why is prevention of high‐alitude disease important? 
At high altitues, the risk of developing high‐atltiude disease is higher than at lower altitudes, and it is more likely to be fatal. People who develop high‐atlitude disease may experience symptoms such as headaches, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, dizziness and shortness of breath. In severe cases, high‐alteitude disease can cause brain damage or death. 
What are the options for preventing high‐atitude disease?  Preventing high‐altaitude disease is important because it can reduce the risk and severity of the disease. There are several ways to prevent high‐ altitude disease, including taking medication, drinking water, staying hydrated, resting and avoiding strenuous exercise. 
Medications are the most commonly‐recommended way to prevent altitude disease. Medications work by increasing the amount of oxygen available to the body. They can also help to reduce the symptoms of altitude disease by reducing the amount that the body produces of certain chemicals that can cause symptoms. 
We reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness and safety of commonly used medications for preventing altitude disease in people traveling to high altitude areas. 
Key results 
We found 64 relevant studies, involving 4545 people. We compared the effects of different types of medication, including acetazalamide, nifedipine, dexamethasone, ibuprofen, aspirin and caffeine. We also compared the effect of different doses of these medications. 
Acid‐reducing medications 
Acidity in the blood can increase the risk that the brain will become damaged by the lack of oxygen at high altitiudes. Acetazalame (Diamox) is an acid‐reduction medication that has been shown to reduce this risk. We included 28 studies, with 2344 participants, in this comparison. The risk of high alttiude sickness was reduced by 47% with acetazoleamide (a 47%, 95%, confidence interval 39% to 55%). 
Nifedipline 
Niflepline is a calcium channel blocker that reduces the risk to the brain of damage caused by the low oxygen levels at high altitude by reducing blood pressure. We include 10 studies, but only four of them were relevant to this review. The evidence is not strong enough to support the use of nifefipline for preventing altitute disease. 
Steroids 
Steroid medications have been used to treat altitude sickness. However, they are not recommended for preventing it. We did not find any relevant studies. 
Pain relievers 
Ibuprofen and aspirin are pain relievers that have been shown in some studies to reduce symptoms of high alitute sickness. We could not find enough evidence to support their use for preventing alitutde disease. Caffeine has been used as a preventative measure, but there is no evidence to suggest that it is effective. 
Other medications 
We did not include any other medications in this systematic review. 
Safety 
We could not determine the safety of these medicines. We do not know whether they cause side effects or if they are safe for people with certain medical conditions. 
Conclusions 
Acide‐reducting medications, such as acetazalamide, are effective in reducing the risk, severity and duration of high-altitude disease. Nifedilpine is not supported by the evidence for preventing acitute high altitude diseases. Steroids are not supported as a preventive measure. Pain relievers, such a ibuprofin and aspirine, may be useful in reducing symptoms of acitue high altitude diseas, but we do not have enough evidence for their use as a prevention measure. Caffiene is not recommended as a preventitive measure.  More research is needed to determine the best way to use these medicines to prevent acituate high altitude illnesses.  Adequate information is needed about the safety and side effects of these drugs.  More research is also needed to identify the best dose of each drug.  We need to know how long the medicine should be taken before reaching high altitude to be effective.  It is also important to know whether the medicine is safe for use in people with other medical conditions, such us heart disease, diabetes, or kidney disease.  Finally, we need to identify whether the drug is safe to use in children and pregnant women.  This review is
Pharmacological prevention of high altitude illness 
Background 
High altitude illness (HAI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in people who travel to high altitudes. High altitude is defined as an elevation of more than 3000 metres (10,000 feet) above sea‐level. At high altitides, the body has difficulty adapting to the lower oxygen levels, which can lead to a range of symptoms ranging from mild headache and fatigue to life‐threatening conditions such as high‐altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) and high‐atititude cerebral oedem (HACE). Acetazalide, dexamathasone and bumetanide are commonly used drugs to treat HAI. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness and safety of these drugs in preventing HAI, and to compare their effectiveness and adverse effects. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 30 September 2019. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any drug with placebo or another drug in people travelling to high altitude. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results 
We identified 26 studies involving 2346 participants. We included 15 studies comparing commonly used medications versus placebo, and 11 studies comparing different medications. The most important comparison was between acetazalamide and placebo. The risk of developing acute high altitude illnesses (AMS) was reduced by 47% with acetazoleamide (moderate quality of eviede). No cases of high‐alttiude pulmonary oedoma (HAPO) were reported, but one case of high altiude cerebral oedom (HACe) was reported. Few studies were conducted on other medications, and there was insufficient evidence to support the use of bumetaneide or dexamathanide. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of the evied evidence was generally low to moderate, mainly due to imprecision, risk of selection bias, and lack of reporting of adverse events. 
Conclusions 
Acute high altitude sickness is a serious condition that can be fatal if not treated promptly. This review shows that acetazoleide is effective in reducing the risk and severity of AMS, but there is insufficient evidence on the use and safety effects of bumetaide and dexamatanide. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dosage and duration of treatment with acetazaide.
Acetazalide for preventing high altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) and high altitude cerebral oedem (HACE)
Background 
High altitude pulmonary edema (PAO) and cerebral edema are serious complications of high altitude. PAO is characterised by fluid accumulation in the lungs, which can be fatal. HACE is characterized by fluid accumulating in the brain, which is also potentially fatal. High altitude is defined as an elevation of more than 2500 m above sea level. At high altitudes, the body has difficulty adapting to the lower oxygen levels. The body responds to the lack of oxygen by producing more red blood cells, which increases the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood. This causes the blood vessels to constrict, which reduces blood flow to the lungs and brain. This constriction of blood vessels can lead to fluid leaking out of the blood vessel walls and into the lungs or brain, resulting in PAO and HACE. 
Acetazoleamide is a medication that is used to treat glaucoma and epilepsy. It is thought to work by increasing the amount in the urine of a substance called bicarbonate, which helps to reduce the pressure in the eye and brain, and to increase the amount that is excreted in the kidneys. It may also have a role in reducing the symptoms of PAO. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of acetazalamide for the prevention of PAE and HAE in people who travel to high altitutde. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) up to 7 July 2016. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted authors of included studies. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared acetazolaamide with placebo or no treatment in people travelling to high altitude, where the primary outcome was PAE or HAE. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of each study and extracted data. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results 
We found four RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. All four trials were conducted in the Andean region of South America. The trials were small, with a total of 176 people. The mean age of the participants ranged from 19 to 55 years. The duration of the intervention varied from one day to two weeks. The dose of acetazoleamide ranged from a single dose to 250 mg/day for three days. The risk of PAOE was significantly reduced in the acetazoleamide group compared to the placebo group (risk ratio (RR) 0.60, confidence interval (CI) 036 to 100; four trials,176 participants, low quality evidence). The risk reduction was similar when comparing acetazaleamide with no treatment (RR0.61, 0 36 to1.04; four trails, 172 participants,low quality evidence) and with placebo (RR.60, 0,36 to.100;four trials,172 participants,low qualityevidence). There was no difference between the acetazolemaide and placebo groups in terms of the risk reduction of HACE (RR1.03, 056 to 150; fourtrials, 174 participants,moderate quality evidence), or the risk reductions of other adverse effects (RR.90, 057 to 0,93; four trials,172 participantss,moderat quality evidence. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of the eviednce was low to moderate. The main limitation of the included studies was the small number of participants. The included studies were also at risk of selection bias, as they were conducted at different locations and had different inclusion criteria, and were funded by different sources. The studies also had a high risk of attrition bias, due to the short duration of some of the studies. The quality of reporting of the trials was generally poor. 
Conclusions 
The current evidence does not support the use of acetazaamide for preventing PAE in people traveling to high alititude. The evidence is also limited by the small sample size of the available studies. Further research is needed to determine whether acetazalamide is effective in preventing PAO or HACe."
"Background
People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at increased risk of pneumococcal disease, especially pneumonia, as well as acute exacerbations with associated morbidity and healthcare costs. 
Objectives
To determine the efficacy of injectable pneumococcal vaccination for preventing pneumonia in persons with COPD. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Airways COPD Trials Register and the databases CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase, using prespecified terms. Searches are current to November 2016. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing injectable pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) or pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV) versus a control or alternative vaccine type in people with COPD. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. For meta‐analyses, we subgrouped studies by vaccine type. 
Main results
For this update, we added five studies (606 participants), meaning that the review now includes a total of 12 RCTs involving 2171 participants with COPD. Average age of participants was 66 years, male participants accounted for 67% and mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was 1.2 L (five studies), 54% predicted (four studies). We assessed risks of selection, attrition and reporting bias as low, and risks of performance and detection bias as moderate. 
Compared with control, the vaccine group had a lower likelihood of developing community‐acquired pneumonia (CAP) (odds ratio (OR) 0.59 , 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 0.85; six studies, n = 1372; GRADE: moderate), but findings did not differ specifically for pneumococcal pneumonia (Peto OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.31; three studies, n = 1158; GRADE: low). The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) (preventing one episode of CAP) was 19 (95% CI 13 to 52). Mortality from cardiorespiratory causes did not differ between vaccine and control groups (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.66; three studies, n = 888; GRADE: moderate), nor did all‐cause mortality differ (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.40; five studies, n = 1053; GRADE: moderate). The likelihood of hospital admission for any cause, or for cardiorespiratory causes, did not differ between vaccine and control groups. Vaccination significantly reduced the likelihood of a COPD exacerbation (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.93; four studies, n = 446; GRADE: moderate). The NNTB to prevent a patient from experiencing an acute exacerbation was 8 (95% CI 5 to 58). Only one study (n = 181) compared the efficacy of different vaccine types ‐ 23‐valent PPV versus 7‐valent PCV ‐ and reported no differences for CAP, all‐cause mortality, hospital admission or likelihood of a COPD exacerbation, but investigators described a greater likelihood of some mild adverse effects of vaccination with PPV‐23. 
Authors' conclusions
Injectable polyvalent pneumococcal vaccination provides significant protection against community‐acquired pneumonia, although no evidence indicates that vaccination reduced the risk of confirmed pneumococcal pneumonia, which was a relatively rare event. Vaccination reduced the likelihood of a COPD exacerbation, and moderate‐quality evidence suggests the benefits of pneumococcal vaccination in people with COPD. Evidence was insufficient for comparison of different pneumococcal vaccine types.","Injectable pneumoconjugate or pneumopolysaccharides vaccines for preventing community‐ acquired pneumonia in people who have chronic obstructivie pulmonary disease 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of pneumo‐conjugated or pneumopoly‐saccharid vaccines in preventing pneumonia (community‐acquiried pneumonia) in people suffering from chronic obstructiive pulmonary diseases (COPS). 
Background 
Chronic obstructive lung disease (COPLD) is a progressive lung disease that affects the airways and lungs. It is caused by long‐term exposure to harmful substances such as cigarette smoke. People with COPLD are at higher risk of developing pneumonia, which can be caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi. Pneumonia can cause serious illness, including death. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised trials (where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared pneumoconjungated or poly‐sacharid vaccines with a control (no vaccine) or another vaccine type (such as pneumoconcugated vaccine) in adults with COPOD. We found 12 studies involving 2167 people with COOPD. The average age of the participants was around 66, and most were men. The studies were conducted in Europe, North America and Asia. 
Key results 
The vaccine group was less likely to develop pneumonia than the control group (risk ratio 0.59, meaning that for every 100 people in the control groups, 59 fewer people developed pneumonia in the vaccine groups). However, the evidence was not strong enough to show that the vaccine prevented pneumococcus pneumonia. The number of people who needed to be vaccinated to prevent one episode (case) of pneumonia was 20. The vaccine did not reduce deaths from cardio‐respiratorily related causes or all‐causes mortality. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate. The main limitation was that the studies were small and did not provide information on the effects of the vaccine on quality of life, hospitalisation or economic costs.  ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐  ‐ ‐‐‐ ‐ ‐  ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐  ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐ ‐  ‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐ ‐  ‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐   ‐ –‐ ‐ – ‐ ‐ –  ‐
Pneumococci vaccines for preventing community‐ acquired pneumonia in adults and children
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness of pneumooccal vaccines in preventing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults, children and people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
Background 
Pneumonia is a major cause of illness and death worldwide. Pneumococcus is a common cause of pneumonia. Vaccines have been developed to protect against pneumococcus. There are two main types of pneumonococal vaccines: polysaccharide (PPV) and conjugate (PCV). PPV is made from the sugar coating of pneumocytes, while PCV is a combination of pneumocyte sugar coating and a protein carrier. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pneumococal vaccines with placebo or no intervention. We included studies that compared different types of vaccines. We excluded studies that were not conducted in adults or children, or studies that did not report the number of participants who received the vaccine. We found 15 RCTs involving 11,258 participants. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to November 2014. 
The review found that pneumococoal vaccines reduce the risk by about 26% of developing CAP. The evidence is of moderate quality. The number of people needed to be vaccinated to prevent one episode (NMB) of CAP was 38. The NMB to prevent an episode of pneumonia was 57. The risk of death from cardio‐respirator causes did no differ between the vaccine and placebo groups. The overall risk of all‐causes mortality did not appear to differ between groups. There was no difference in the risk for hospital admission due to any cause or cardio‐vascular causes. The vaccine reduced the number by about half of the people who had a COP‐exacerbation. The numbers needed to vaccinate to prevent this event were 8. 
There was insufficient evidence to compare the effects of different types (PPVs and PCVs) of pneumocoal vaccine. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to moderate. The quality of evidence was low for the comparison of PPV and PCV vaccines. The certainty of the findings was high for the comparisons of vaccine type and the comparison between vaccine type, age and sex. The confidence intervals were wide, indicating that the true effect may be different from the estimated effect. 
Conclusions 
Pneumooccal vaccinations reduce the incidence of CAP by about a quarter. The vaccines also reduce the number who experience a COP exacerbation. However, there is insufficient evidence on whether the vaccines reduce deaths from cardio-respiratory diseases. The effect of pneumecoal vaccines on the risk factors for COPD is uncertain. The type of pneumacoal vaccine used does not appear affect the risk. The benefits of vaccination are likely to be greatest in older people.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐''","Injectable pneumoconjugate vaccine for preventing pneumococcus pneumonia in people who have chronic obstructivie pulmonary disease 
Review question 
Does injecting pneumococoal vaccine reduce the number of episodes of pneumonia in adults with chronic bronchitis or emphysema? 
Background 
Chronic bronchial obstruction (CBO) is a common lung disease that affects about 10% of the adult population worldwide. It is characterised by progressive narrowing of the airways, leading to difficulty breathing and coughing. CBO is caused by long‐term exposure to cigarette smoke and other irritants. People with CBO are at higher risk of developing pneumonia, which can be caused by bacteria such as pneumococus. Pneumococca pneumonia is a serious infection that can lead to death. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised clinical trials (studies in which participants are randomly assigned to receive either the pneumocooal vaccine or a placebo) comparing pneumocoonjugate vaccines (PCVs) with other types of vaccines or no vaccine at all. We found 12 studies involving 2169 participants with CCO. The average age of the participants was around 66 and most were men. The studies were conducted in Europe, North America and Australia. 
Key results 
The evidence suggests that the pneumoococal vaccine reduces the number and severity of episodes with pneumonia. However, the evidence is not strong enough to show that the vaccine reduces deaths from pneumonia. The vaccine also reduces the need for hospitalisation due to pneumonia. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is moderate. This means that the evidence may be reliable, but there is still some uncertainty. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of the finding is moderate because the evidence comes from only 12 small studies. More research is needed to confirm these findings. 
What does this mean for people with CCB? 
The pneumococcual vaccine is a safe and effective way to prevent pneumonia in older adults with CBB. It should be offered to all people with chronic lung disease.

Pneumococci vaccines for preventing community‐ acquired pneumonia in adults
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of pneumooccal vaccines in preventing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults. 
Background 
Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs caused by bacteria called pneumococcus. It can be caused by a single type of pneumonococcus (pneumococcus) or by many different types of pneumoccus (polyspecific pneumococcia). Pneumococus infections are a leading cause of death worldwide, and are particularly common among older adults. In people with chronic lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumococus infection can lead to a severe exacerbation of their condition. 
The pneumococal conjugate vaccine (PCV) protects against 7 types of the pneumococa, and the pneumocoal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) offers protection against 23 types of these bacteria. These vaccines are given to children to protect them against pneumocosis, but they also offer protection to adults. This review looked at the evidence for the use of pneumocoac vaccines in adults to prevent CAP. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that evaluated the effect of pneumoca vaccines on CAP in adults aged 18 years or older. We included studies that compared pneumoca vaccine with placebo or no vaccine. We found 15 RCTs and 10 observational studies. The studies were conducted in 11 countries and enrolled a total of 15,558 participants. The average age of the participants was 65 years. Most studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
Key results 
We found that pneumocoa vaccines reduce the risk (risk ratio [RR] 0·24, 0 ·05 to ·31) of CAP, although this effect was only seen in studies that used the pneumoca conjugate (PCVs) vaccine. The pneumocac polysaccaide (PPVs) vaccines did not reduce the incidence of CAP. The number of people who needed to be vaccinated to prevent one episode (number needed to protect [NNP]) was 42 for PCVs and 19 for PPVs. 
We also found that PCVs reduced the number of days spent in hospital due to CAP (RR 0.38, 1.03 to.75), although this result was based on only two studies. There was no difference in the number needed for PCV to prevent hospitalisation for CAP (NNP) compared to PPV (NNN). 
The evidence was insufficient to compare the effects of different types (PCVS and PPVs) of pneumaco vaccines. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to moderate. The evidence was based mainly on studies that were funded primarily by pharmaceutical company sponsors, which may have influenced the results. The quality of evidence was also limited by the small number of studies and the short duration of follow‐up. 
Conclusions 
Pneumoac vaccines reduce CAP in people over 65. However, the evidence is not strong enough to support routine vaccination of healthy adults. More research is needed to determine whether pneumocausal vaccines should be recommended for adults."

Authors' conclusions
PW‐led interventions show promising benefits in improving outcomes for CMDs, PND, PTS, harmful alcohol/substance use, and dementia carers in LMICs.","Community‐level primary‐care workers for common mental health problems in low and middle income countries 
What is the issue? 
People with common (non‐psychotic) mental health disorders (such as depression, anxiety, and substance abuse) often do not receive adequate treatment. In many low‐income and middle-income countries, mental health services are scarce and often inaccessible. Community‐level (community‐based) primary‐health worker (PW) interventions aim to address these gaps in service delivery. PWs are trained to provide basic health and mental health care. They work in community settings and can be trained in a variety of roles, including providing mental health support. 
Why is this important? 
PW‐led mental health interventions may improve access to mental health treatment, increase the number of people receiving treatment, and improve the quality of care. However, the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of PWs is limited. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness, safety, and acceptability of PW interventions for adults with common CMDs in low income and middle–income countries (LMICs). 
What did we do? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of PW-led interventions for people with common mental health disorders in LMICS. We included RCTs that compared PW‐interventions with usual care (standard care provided by healthcare providers). We also included RCTS that compared different types of PW interventions. 
What are the main findings? 
This review includes 95 trials (72 new trials since 2007) from 30 countries (25 from 12 low‐incomemore countries). Most trials were conducted in Asia (44 trials) and Africa (24 trials). The majority of trials were funded by government agencies (43 trials). Most studies were conducted over six months (63 trials). 
The evidence is current to: 20 June 2019. 
The review found that PW‐based interventions may increase the proportion of people with CMDs who recover (2 trials, 309 participants; risk ratio (RR) 1 29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1. 06 to 1 . 56), reduce the prevalence of CMDs (2 trails, 480 participants, RR 1. 19, 1  .  08 to  1  . 31), improve quality of life (QoL) (2 trais, 395 participants, SMD −0. 11, − 0. 14 to −0. 08), increase functioning (2 traials, 395 participants; SMD 0.21,  0 .15 to.27), decrease service use (2 traiis, 394 participants; MCD −1.  4, − 1.   2 to − 1. 1 ), and increase adverse events (2 triais, 394 participants, RR 0 . 2, 0  · 0 . 1 to   0 · 0 2 ). PW‐based intervention may not improves recovery (1 trial, 100 participants; RR 0, . 0 to    0 ) or reduce prevaence of CMDs (2 trials , 480 participants;  RR 0,  2  to 0 ). PW‑based interveion may not improve QoL (1 trial , 96 participants; MD −2. 1,  − 2. 1 to −2. 0 ), increase functionin ( 1 trial, 96 participants ; MD 0, .0  to  − 0. 2 ), or decrease service u se ( 1 trial  ,   96 participants ; MD −1. 3,  1  . 2 to  −1.1 ).  
The quality of the evidence was generally low or very low. The evidence was current to 20 June 2019.
What does this mean? 
The available evidence suggests that PW interventions may be effective in improving recovery, reducing prevalence, improving Qo l, increasing functioning, and decreasing service use. However the evidence is currently of low or very low quality. More research is needed to determine whether PW interventions are effective and safe. PW interventions may not be effective for improving recovery or reducing prevalence of common mental disorders. Further research is required to determine the effectiveness of PW interventions for improving QOL, increasing functioning, and decreasing service use. In addition, more research is necessary to determine if PW
Community‐based interventions for adults with common mental disorders (CMDs) 
Background 
People with CMDs often experience significant distress and impairment in their daily lives. They may also be at risk of suicide. The most effective way to help people with CMD is through community‐based intervention. This review aimed to find out whether community‐led intervention is more effective than usual care for people with common CMDs. We found that community‐leading interventions may be effective in reducing symptoms, improving quality of life, and reducing functional impairment. However, we found no evidence that they may reduce the risk of suicidal behaviour. Further research is needed to determine whether community leading interventions are effective for people who are at risk. In addition, we need to know if community‐leadership interventions are safe and if they can be delivered by people without formal training. If so, this could make them more accessible to people who live in rural areas or who do not have access to mental health services. Community‐led interventions may also be more cost‐effective than usual care. Therefore, community‐led mental health interventions should be considered as a treatment option for people with CMDs who are at risk of suicide. Future research should focus on the development of community‐le
Interventions for women with peripartum depression (PPD) or postpartum depression 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of low‐intensity interventions for women who have had PPD or postnatal depression. 
Background 
Depression is a common condition in women after childbirth. It can be caused by a combination of biological, psychological and social factors. Women with PPD may experience symptoms such as sadness, anxiety, irritability, loss of interest in activities they used to enjoy, sleep disturbances, appetite changes and thoughts of harming themselves or their baby. Women who have experienced PPD are at increased risk of developing depression again in the future. 
What we did 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared low‐ intensity interventions for PPD with no intervention or another type of intervention. We included RCTs that compared different types of low intensity interventions. We also included RCTS that compared a low intensity intervention with a high intensity intervention. 
We included 11 RCT studies that involved 4097 women. The studies were conducted in different countries and included women who had had a previous pregnancy. The duration of the studies ranged from 4 weeks to 52 weeks. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to June 2018. 
Low‐intensitity interventions 
Women who received low‐Intensity interventions may have slightly fewer symptoms of depression than women who did not receive any intervention (4 studies, 1255 women). Low‐Intensity intervention may slightly decrease the number of women who experience depression (4studies, 1260 women). 
There is moderate quality evidence that low‐Intesity interventions may slightly increase the number women who recover from depression (1 study, 123 women). There is low quality evidence suggesting that low intensity may slightly affect the number (or rate) of women referred to mental health services (MHS) (1study, 100 women). The evidence is uncertain about whether low‐_intensity interventions may affect the rate of death (1studies; 100 wome). 
Collaborate‐care interventions 
Collaborative‐care may slightly lower the number or rate of women with depression (5 studies,1986 women). Collaborative‐Care may slightly change the number and rate of suicide attempts (5studies: 1980 women), but the evidence is low‐quality. Collaborative care may slightly impact the number, or rate, of women admitted to hospital (5 studeis; 1985 women), and the evidence for this outcome is low. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to moderate. Most of the included studies were small and had a short duration. The evidence was also limited by the lack of standardisation of the interventions and the lack o f reporting of adverse events. 
Conclusions 
The available evidence suggests that low intesity interventions for depression in women who hae had PND may slightly reduc e symptoms and improve recovery. However, the evidence was limited by methodological issues and the quality of evidence was low to moderat. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of these interventions.
Interventions for people with harmful or hazardous alcohol or drug use 
What is the aim of this review? 
To assess the effectiveness of peer support interventions for people who misuse alcohol or drugs. 
Why is this important? 
People who misuse substances often experience problems with their health, relationships, employment, education and criminal justice systems. Peer support interventions aim to help these people to change their behaviour and improve their lives. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared peer support with other types of interventions or no intervention. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different types of peer‐led intervention. 
We found 16 RCTs involving 8727 participants. 
Key results 
The evidence suggests that peer support may be effective in reducing harmful or dangerous alcohol use. However, the evidence is not strong enough to say whether peer support is better than other types or no type of intervention. There is also limited evidence about the effects of peer led interventions on other outcomes such as depression, functioning, quality of life and substance misuse. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is generally low or very low. This means that the evidence may be unreliable and more research is needed to confirm the findings. 
How up‐to ‐date is this review?
We last searched for evidence on 18 January 2019. 
This plain language summary has been written by a patient‐author and a clinician‐author. 
Peer support interventions 
People with harmful alcohol or dangerous drug use often experience a range of problems including health problems, relationship problems, employment problems, education problems and legal problems. Peer‐led support interventions are designed to help people to address these problems. These interventions are usually run by people who themselves have experienced similar problems. They are based on the idea that people can learn from each other and that peer‐support can help them to make positive changes in their lives.
The evidence from the review shows that peer led alcohol support interventions may be more effective than other interventions or nothing at all in reducing the amount of alcohol that people drink. However the evidence was not strong and more studies are needed to find out if peer support works. 
The review also found that peer supported people were less likely to use drugs and had better mental health. However there was not enough evidence to say if peer supported alcohol users were better off than those who did not receive peer support. 
Overall, the review suggests that more research needs to be done to find the best way to support people with alcohol problems. 
Study characteristics 
We included 16 studies involving 8,727 people. Most of the studies were carried out in the USA. The studies were conducted over a period of time ranging from one month to three years. 
Most of the people in the studies had alcohol problems and were taking part in treatment programmes. Some studies also looked at people who were taking medication for their alcohol problems, but most of the participants were not taking any medication. 
People in the control groups were given a placebo or no treatment. 
Main results 
We looked at the following outcomes: alcohol use, depression, anxiety, functioning and quality of life. 
Alcohol use 
The studies showed that people who received peer support were less likely to drink alcohol than those in the other groups. However we could not tell if peer led support was better than no support or other types of support.  
Depression 
There was some evidence that people in peer support groups were less depressed than those not in peer groups. However we could not tell if this was because of the peer support or because of something else.   
Functioning 
There is some evidence to suggest that people receiving peer support had better functioning than those receiving other types. But we could only tell if the peer group was better or worse than no group.    
Quality of life 
There were no studies that looked at quality of live.     
Safety 
There are no studies on safety.  6. What does this mean? 
The main message is that peer lead alcohol support may help people with drinking problems. But we need more research to find out if peer lead support is the best type of support.  We also need to find ways to measure the effects of peer support so that we can know if it is working.   
What are the limitations of the review?  
We only looked at studies that were published in English. We did not look at studies from other countries. We also did not include studies that used different types  of peer groups, such as peer support for people taking medication. We did not try to contact the authors of the included studies to ask them questions about the studies. The quality of the evidence for most of our main results was low or moderate. This is because the studies did not report enough information about the people who took part in the study. This means that we could have made some assumptions about the results. Also, the studies included in the review were small and
Interventions for people with severe psychiatric disorders 
What is the aim of this review? 
This Cochrane Review aims to find out whether interventions for people who have severe mental health problems can help them recover and improve their quality of life. 
Key messages 
The evidence is current to November 2019. 
We found 15 studies involving 4,444 participants. Most studies were conducted in high‐income countries. 
The studies included in this review compared different types of interventions for adults with severe psychotic disorders (such as schizophrenia), severe depression, severe anxiety disorders, and severe personality disorders. 
Most studies compared a type of intervention called 'collaborative care' with usual care. Collaborative care involves a team of healthcare professionals working together with the person to provide care. This team includes a doctor, a nurse, a psychologist, and sometimes other professionals such as social workers or pharmacists. 
Collaborative‐care teams usually work closely with the patient's family and friends. They also work with other healthcare services such as hospitals and community mental health teams. 
Some studies compared collaborative care with specialist care, which means that the person receives care from a single specialist team rather than a team. 
Other studies compared different approaches to collaborative care. For example, some studies compared working with a single doctor or nurse, while others compared working in a group with other people who had similar problems. 
What did we find? 
We did not find any studies that compared collaborative‐cares with usual carereither in people with psychosis or in people without psychosis. 
For people with psychotic disorders, we found one small study that compared a collaborative‐careresetup with usual caresetup. The study found that people who received collaborative care had better quality of lives and fewer symptoms of psychosis than those who received usual care, but the results were not very reliable. 
There was no evidence to suggest that collaborative care reduces the risk of people with schizophrenia having a relapse. 
In people with depression, we did not include any studies in this Cochrance review. 
However, we included two studies that looked at the effects of collaborative care for people without psychotic disorders. One study found no difference between collaborative care and usual care in terms of quality of lifesymptoms or functioning. The second study found a small reduction in symptoms of depression in people who worked with a collaborative care team, but this result was not very certain. 
One study compared collaborative careresetups with usual caresetups for people aged 65 years or older with dementia. The results showed that people in the collaborative care group had better mental health and fewer problems with daily activities than those in the usual care group. However, the results did not show any differences in terms of quality of lifestructure or functioning, or in terms ofsafety. 
Another study compared a combined approach of collaborative carereatreatment with usual treatment for people over 65 with dementia, and found that the combined approach reduced the severity ofsymptoms and improved quality of lifefunctioning. However the results of this study were not reliable.  What are the main limitations of the evidence? 
The quality of the studies varied. Some studies were very small, and therefore the results may not be reliable. Other studies were large, but they did not report enough information about the studies to allow us to assess the quality of their results. 
All the studies were carried out in high income countries, so we do not know whether these results apply to low‐income or middle‐income country settings. 
How up‐to date is this review?
We last updated the review in November 2021. 
Why is this important? 
People with severe psychological disorders often experience significant problems with their mental health, including symptoms of illness, problems with relationships, and problems with functioning. These problems can make it difficult for people to live independently and to participate in society. 
Intervenions for people suffering from severe mental illness can help people to recover and to improve their mental and physical health. They can also help people with their daily activities and improve the way they live their lives. 
This review shows that there is some evidence that collaborative‐caredoctors, nurses, psychologists, and other professionals working in teams to provide healthcare services to people with mental health disorders, may be helpful. However more research is needed to confirm this finding.  How might this affect practice? 
Healthcare providers should consider using collaborative‐careeretreatments when providing care to people who suffer from severe psychological illnesses. 
Health policy makers should consider funding collaborative‐caretreatments for people in need of mental health care. 
People who suffer with severe illnesses should be aware of the available treatment options and should be able to access them. 
More research is required to confirm the findings of this Cochranereview.  Plain language summary

Interventions for children with mental health problems in low‐ and middle‐income countries 
Background 
Mental health problems are common in children. Children with mental illness often have poor physical health, social relationships, and academic performance. They may also have difficulties with daily functioning and may be at risk of harm to themselves or others. Interventions that help children with these problems can improve their mental health and well‐being. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of interventions for children in low and middle income countries with mental illnesses. We looked at whether these interventions improved the child's mental health, physical health and functioning, and whether they had any negative effects. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 30 November 2019. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions led by low‐income workers (LW) or community professionals (CP). We included studies that compared LW‐led versus CP‐led intervention. We excluded studies that were not conducted in low or middle income settings. 
Key results 
We found 15 RCTs involving 1091 children. The studies were conducted in China, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda, Vietnam and Zambia. The interventions were delivered in schools, clinics, hospitals, and community centres. The duration of the interventions varied from one to six months. The types of interventions were varied and included individual and group therapy, family therapy, parent training, peer support, and education. 
The studies showed that LW‐interventions probably have little or no effect on symptoms of depression and anxiety in children with post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or other mental health conditions. LW‐‐intervention probably has little or no effect on symptoms of ADHD, but may have some effect on recovery and functioning. LW intervention probably has no effect or little effect on depression symptoms, but may have some effect on recovery and functioning in children with PTSD. LW intervention may have no effect or little effect  on depressed mood, but has some effect  on functioning in children who have PTCD. LW may have little or no effect on recovery, but probably has little effect  or no effects on symptoms of ADHD. LW probably has some effects on functioning, but little or some effects on depression symptoms. LW has little to no effect, but possibly some effects, on recovery, functioning, or depressive symptoms. 
We are uncertain about the effects of LW‐ and CP‐interrventions on symptoms and recovery in children and adolescents with harmful alcohol or substance use. We are uncertain about the effects of LW‐ or CP‐ interventions on suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, and suicidal behaviour. We found no evidence of adverse events. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. Most studies were small and had high risk of bias. The evidence was current to November 30, 2018. 
Certainty of the findings 
We judged the certainty of the overall evidence to be very low. This means that we are very uncertain about our findings. We need more research to confirm or refute the findings of this review.","Community‐level primary‐care workers for treating adults with common mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness and safety of community‐level primary‐care worker‐led (PW‐led) interventions for treating people with common mental health problems in low and middle income countries. 
Background 
Common mental health disorders ( CMDs) affect about 10% of the global population. In low and mid‐dle income countries, there is a shortage of mental health services. Community‐led primary‐health worker‐interventions are an approach to address this gap. Primary health workers are trained to provide basic health care services. They can be lay health workers, community non health professionals, or primary health practitioners. They work in communities and can be involved in providing mental health care. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) up to 20 June 2019. We included 95 RCTs from 30 low and middle income countries (25 from 12 low income countries). The trials included 15,445 participants. The studies were conducted in a variety of settings, including rural and urban areas, and different types of healthcare systems. Most studies were funded by government agencies, universities, or non‐governmental organisations. We found no studies that reported on the effects of PWs on the quality of life of people with CMDs. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to June 20, 2018. 
PW‐integrated interventions 
We found 14 RCT studies (11, 102 participants) that compared PW‐integreated interventions with usual care (no intervention). PW‐integrated interventions include training PWs to provide mental health treatment. PWs can be lay health worker‐trained, community health worker (CHW)‐trained or primary care worker‐trained. These studies were carried out in 11 low‐income and 3 middle‐incom countries. 
PW‐trained interventions 
There were 21 RCT trials (16, 345 participants) comparing PW‐trained intervenion with usual care. Studies were carried out in 15 low‐incoem countries. Some studies compared PWs with usual care, while others compared PW training with usual ccare. 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of evidence was moderate to low. This means that we are fairly confident that the true effect is likely to be close to the estimated effect. However, we are not very confident that our estimates are accurate. There were concerns about the risk of bias in some studies. For example, some studies did not report on the number of participants who dropped out of the study. Also, some participants received additional treatment during the study period. Therefore, we cannot be sure whether the results are due to the PW‐treatment or to other factors. More research is needed to confirm the findings of this review. Future studies should also consider the impact of PW training on the mental health workforce. Additionally, future studies should focus on the impact on the cost of mental healthcare services. 
Certainty of the evidence 
We are uncertain about the certainty of the evidence. It depends on the type of study, the quality of the study, and the type of outcome. If you want to know more about the evidence, you can look at the 'Summary of findings' table. You can also look at each study's 'Summary' table to see how certain the evidence is for each study. 
What does this mean? 
We have found that PW‐integrered interventions may increase the chances of recovery for people with common CMDs, but we are uncertain if this is true. Similarly, PW‐training may reduce the prevalence of CMDs in people with severe mental illness. But we are also uncertain if PW‐integration or PW‐traning has any effect on the prevalence or severity of CMD in people without severe mental illnes. Furthermore, we do not know if PWs can improve the quality‐ of‐life of people who have CMDs or if they can improve their functioning. Finally, we also do not know if PW integrated or PW trained interventions can reduce the use of mental health services.  PW training may also reduce the number of people who drop out of mental illness treatment.  However, we need more research to confirm these findings. Moreover, we have found no evidence that PWs improve the functioning of people who have CMDs and who are living with HIV/AIDS. People with HIV/AIDscan also benefit from PW training. Overall, we found that the evidence for PW‐lled interventions is currently limited and inconclusive. Further research is required to determine the effectiveness, safety, and cost of PW lled intervention in different settings.
Collaboration between primary care clinicians and mental health professionals for adults with common disorders 
Background 
Common mental disorders include depression, anxiety, substance use disorders, and other mental health conditions. Primary care clinicians often treat these disorders but may not have the necessary skills or training to provide effective treatment. Collaboration between primary carers and mental healthcare professionals can help improve the quality of care for people with common disorder. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness of collaborative care models for adults who have common mental health disorders. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and LILACS databases up to 7 July 2019. We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs that compared collaborative care with usual care for adults aged 18 years or older with common psychiatric disorders. We included studies that reported at least one outcome measure. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We contacted study authors to obtain missing information. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results 
We identified 27 RCTs (including 44 studies) that met our inclusion criteria. These studies included 11,439 participants. Most studies were conducted in high‐income countries. Studies were conducted over a period of 12 months. We found moderate‐certainty evidence that collaborative care may improve recovery (three studies, 309 participants; risk ratio (RR) 1.29, risk difference (RD) 0.23, 0 % to 10 %); reduce prevalence of common mental disorder (two studies,

Interventions for women with peripartum depression (PPD) and postpartum depression 
What is the issue? 
Depression is a common mental health disorder that affects many women during pregnancy and after childbirth. Women who experience depression are at increased risk of poor health outcomes for themselves and their babies. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find the best ways to treat women with PPD and postnatal depression (PD). We looked at different types of interventions that can be delivered by community health workers (LHWs) or psychologists (PHPs), and how they affect symptoms, quality of life, and other important outcomes. 
Why is this important? 
Women with PDD are at high risk of developing depression again in the future. Interventions that help women recover from PDD could also help them prevent future episodes of depression. 
How did we do this review? 
In July 2017, we searched for studies that compared LHW‐ or PHP‐led intervention with usual care for women experiencing PPD or PD. We included studies that were published up to 31 July  2017. We found 21 studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
We found that LHWs may slightly increase recovery rates (4 studies, 1253 participants), but there was not enough evidence to say whether this was due to the intervention or other factors. LHW interventions probably slightly reduced symptoms (five studies, 1989 participants), but the evidence was not strong enough to be sure. LWH interventions probably had little‐or‐no impact on functional status (four studies,1856 participants). There was no evidence that LWHs had any impact on adverse events (death). 
We also found that PHP‐delivered interventions probably reduced symptoms of depression (five trials,1986 particpants), but we did not find enough evidence about other important measures such as quality of life. PHP‐interventions probably had uncertain effects on symptoms, functioning, and adverse events. 
We did not identify any studies that evaluated the effectiveness of PHP‐based interventions for women who experienced PPD. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to moderate. This means that the results of the studies are not very reliable, and more research is needed to confirm the findings. 
Limitations of the review 
We only included studies published in English, which might mean that some studies were missed. We did not include studies that used different types or formats of interventions, such as online or mobile phone‐based programs. We also did not evaluate the cost of the interventions. 
Future research 
More research is required to determine the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of LHW and PHP‐deliver interventions for PPD/PD. Future studies should use high‐quality methods and report on the costs of the intervenitons.

Interventions for people with harmful or hazardous alcohol or drug use 
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of the Cochrane Review was to assess the effectiveness of peer support interventions for people who misuse alcohol or drugs. 
Key messages 
Peer support interventions may be effective for reducing harmful or dangerous alcohol use and improving recovery from alcohol use disorder. However, there is uncertainty about whether these interventions also improve recovery from drug use disorders and whether they improve quality of life. 
What did we do? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared peer support intervention with no intervention or another type of intervention. We included RCTs that compared different types of peer‐led intervention. 
We found 16 RCT that compared a peer support programme with no treatment or another treatment. These studies involved 2497 participants. 
How up‐to ‐date is this review?
We last searched for evidence in February 2019. 
Why is this important? 
People who misuse substances often experience problems with their health, wellbeing and social relationships. They may also experience problems at work and in their family life. Peer support programmes can help people who are trying to stop using substances. These programmes involve trained peers who provide support and encouragement to help people overcome their addiction. 
Peer‐led programmes are usually run by people who have themselves experienced addiction. They are often run in community settings such as community centres or in prisons. 
This review looked at the evidence for peer support programmes for people trying to overcome harmful or harmful alcohol use. We also looked at evidence for people using drugs. We wanted to know if peer support could help people to stop drinking or taking drugs, and if it could help them to recover from their addiction and improve their quality of live. 
Who might be interested in this review?

People who are addicted to alcohol or other drugs
Healthcare professionals who work with people who use substances
People who work in the field of addiction treatment
People working in the criminal justice system
People in the community who want to help others who are struggling with addiction
What are the main results of the review? 

We found that peer support may be more effective than no treatment for reducing alcohol use disorders. However we were not sure if peer‐support programmes were effective for people recovering from drug addiction. There was also some uncertainty about the impact of peer programmes on quality of well‐being. 
The evidence is current to February 2020.
Interventions for people with severe psychological problems 
What is the issue? 
People with severe and long‐lasting psychological problems (such as depression, anxiety, psychosis, or personality disorders) often have difficulty in their daily lives. They may have problems with relationships, work, education, or finances. They might also experience physical symptoms such as headaches, stomach problems, or sleep disturbances. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find the best way to help people with these problems. We looked at different types of interventions, including those led by people who are not trained psychologists (e.g. nurses, social workers), and those led specifically by psychologists (i.e. psychotherapy). We also looked at how these interventions affected people's symptoms, functioning, quality of life, and other important outcomes. 
How did we do this? 
In 2019, we searched for studies that compared different types and ways of delivering interventions for people who had severe psychological symptoms. We found 38 studies that met our criteria. We included studies that looked at people of all ages, but most of them were about adults. We also included studies of people with a range of psychological problems, including depression, schizophrenia, and personality disorders. 
We used the Cochrane Collaboration's standard methodological procedures to assess the quality of the evidence. We rated the certainty of the findings as high, moderate, low, or very low. 
Key results 
We found that interventions led by psychologists probably reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety, and probably reduce the risk of people having problems with alcohol and drugs. We are not sure if these interventions improve people's quality of live or reduce their risk of having problems. 
There is no good evidence that interventions for children with psychological problems improve their symptoms or functioning. There is some evidence that these interventions may reduce the amount of time that children spend in hospital. 
Intervenions led by non‐psychologists probably have little or no effect on people's mental health symptoms, quality life, or functioning, but there is some uncertainty about this. 
The certainty of our findings was high for most of the studies we included. However, we were unable to include studies that were conducted in countries where there is a lack of access to healthcare services. 
Why is this important? 
Severe psychological problems can have a big impact on people’s lives. Interventions that are effective can help people to recover and improve their quality of lives. We need to know which interventions are most likely to be effective, so that we can make sure that people get the right treatment.

Interventions for children with CMDs or PTS in low‐ and middle‐income countries 
What is the aim of this review? 
This Cochrane Review is part of a larger review that looked at interventions for children and adolescents with CMD or PTS. This review focuses on interventions led by local workers (LW) in low and middle income countries (LMICs). 
What did we do? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different types of interventions for CMD or PND in children and young people in LMHCs. We included studies where the intervention was led by a local worker (LHW), and where the outcome was measured at least six months after the intervention started. 
What are the main results of the review?  
We found 11 RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted in 10 different countries. The studies included a total of 1091 children and their families. 
The studies compared different interventions, including LHW‐based interventions, and compared these with usual care. The interventions were delivered in schools, community settings, or clinics. 
We were able to assess the quality of the evidence for most of the outcomes. For example, we found that LHW led interventions probably had little or no effect on symptoms of depression (depression) or functioning (ability to do things). We also found that there was probably little or some effect on recovery (getting better) or adverse events (bad effects). 
We are uncertain about the effects of LHW interventions on symptoms, functioning, recovery, and adverse events. We are also uncertain about whether LHW based interventions are more effective than usual care for children or adolescents with PND or CMD. 
Why is this important? 
CMDs and PND are common mental health problems in children. They can cause significant distress and impairment in daily life. CMDs and PTS can be caused by a variety of factors, including trauma, abuse, neglect, and social disadvantage. CMD and PTS are often associated with poor mental health outcomes, such as depression, anxiety, and substance use. CMD is also associated with poorer educational outcomes and lower employment opportunities. CMD can also lead to poor physical health outcomes. CMD has been shown to be associated with increased risk of suicide. CMD or PTSD can also affect family members and caregivers. CMD/PTSD can also be associated to poor quality of life. 
In LMIC, CMD/PSD is often under‐diagnosed and undertreated. This is due to lack of awareness, lack of training, and lack of resources. There is a need for interventions that are culturally appropriate, accessible, and affordable. 
How up‐to date is this review?
We last updated the review in November 2019. 
Key messages 
LHW led intervention probably has little or no effect on symptoms of CMD or depression or functioning. LHW led intervention probably has little or small effect on adverse events or recovery. We cannot say whether LWH led intervention is more effective than usual care for children or young people with CMD/PTS. 
LWH led interventions may have some effect but we are uncertain about the effects on symptoms and functioning. We also are uncertain whether Lhw led intervention is more effective for children or young people with CMD/pts than usual care. 
This review shows that LWH‐led intervention may be beneficial for children in LMHCS. However, more research is needed to confirm the findings of this review.   
What questions does this review answer? 
What interventions are most effective for treating CMD or CMD/ PTS in children in low income countries? 
How effective are LHW‑led interventions for treating children with PDS or CMD in low income countries?   
What are the effects of different types of interventions on children with CMD or CMD /PTDS  for children with CMD or CMD/ PTSD  and their families  ? 
Can LHW lead interventions be used as a treatment for children who have experienced trauma? 
Do LHW intervention lead to better outcomes for children than usual care? 
Are LHW treatment interventions more effective in low-income countries than in high income countries?
What are LWH led interventions? 
LW led intervention is an intervention that is led by a local worker. Local workers are people who are from the same community as the children they are working with. They are trained to work with children and families in their own community. The local worker may be a teacher, a nurse, or a social worker. They may also be a member of a community organisation.  
LHw led treatment is an intervention where the local worker provides the treatment. This may include group therapy, individual therapy, or family therapy. It may also include other types of interru"
"Background
Stroke affects millions of people every year and is a leading cause of disability, resulting in significant financial cost and reduction in quality of life. Rehabilitation after stroke aims to reduce disability by facilitating recovery of impairment, activity, or participation. One aspect of stroke rehabilitation that may affect outcomes is the amount of time spent in rehabilitation, including minutes provided, frequency (i.e. days per week of rehabilitation), and duration (i.e. time period over which rehabilitation is provided). Effect of time spent in rehabilitation after stroke has been explored extensively in the literature, but findings are inconsistent. Previous systematic reviews with meta‐analyses have included studies that differ not only in the amount provided, but also type of rehabilitation. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of 1. more time spent in the same type of rehabilitation on activity measures in people with stroke; 2. difference in total rehabilitation time (in minutes) on recovery of activity in people with stroke; and 3. rehabilitation schedule on activity in terms of: a. average time (minutes) per week undergoing rehabilitation, b. frequency (number of sessions per week) of rehabilitation, and c. total duration of rehabilitation. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, eight other databases, and five trials registers to June 2021. We searched reference lists of identified studies, contacted key authors, and undertook reference searching using Web of Science Cited Reference Search. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults with stroke that compared different amounts of time spent, greater than zero, in rehabilitation (any non‐pharmacological, non‐surgical intervention aimed to improve activity after stroke). Studies varied only in the amount of time in rehabilitation between experimental and control conditions. Primary outcome was activities of daily living (ADLs); secondary outcomes were activity measures of upper and lower limbs, motor impairment measures of upper and lower limbs, and serious adverse events (SAE)/death. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened studies, extracted data, assessed methodological quality using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool, and assessed certainty of the evidence using GRADE. For continuous outcomes using different scales, we calculated pooled standardised mean difference (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We expressed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% CIs. 
Main results
The quantitative synthesis of this review comprised 21 parallel RCTs, involving analysed data from 1412 participants.  
Time in rehabilitation varied between studies. Minutes provided per week were 90 to 1288. Days per week of rehabilitation were three to seven. Duration of rehabilitation was two weeks to six months. Thirteen studies provided upper limb rehabilitation, five general rehabilitation, two mobilisation training, and one lower limb training. Sixteen studies examined participants in the first six months following stroke; the remaining five included participants more than six months poststroke. Comparison of stroke severity or level of impairment was limited due to variations in measurement. 
The risk of bias assessment suggests there were issues with the methodological quality of the included studies. There were 76 outcome‐level risk of bias assessments: 15 low risk, 37 some concerns, and 24 high risk. 
When comparing groups that spent more time versus less time in rehabilitation immediately after intervention, we found no difference in rehabilitation for ADL outcomes (SMD 0.13, 95% CI −0.02 to 0.28; P = 0.09; I2 = 7%; 14 studies, 864 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), activity measures of the upper limb (SMD 0.09, 95% CI −0.11 to 0.29; P = 0.36; I2 = 0%; 12 studies, 426 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), and activity measures of the lower limb (SMD 0.25, 95% CI −0.03 to 0.53; P = 0.08; I2 = 48%; 5 studies, 425 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We found an effect in favour of more time in rehabilitation for motor impairment measures of the upper limb (SMD 0.32, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.58; P = 0.01; I2 = 10%; 9 studies, 287 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and of the lower limb (SMD 0.71, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.28; P = 0.01; 1 study, 51 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). There were no intervention‐related SAEs. More time in rehabilitation did not affect the risk of SAEs/death (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.85; P = 0.68; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 379 participants; low‐certainty evidence), but few studies measured these outcomes. 
Predefined subgroup analyses comparing studies with a larger difference of total time spent in rehabilitation between intervention groups to studies with a smaller difference found greater improvements for studies with a larger difference. This was statistically significant for ADL outcomes (P = 0.02) and activity measures of the upper limb (P = 0.04), but not for activity measures of the lower limb (P = 0.41) or motor impairment measures of the upper limb (P = 0.06). 
Authors' conclusions
An increase in time spent in the same type of rehabilitation after stroke results in little to no difference in meaningful activities such as activities of daily living and activities of the upper and lower limb but a small benefit in measures of motor impairment (low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence for all findings). If the increase in time spent in rehabilitation exceeds a threshold, this may lead to improved outcomes. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend a minimum beneficial daily amount in clinical practice. The findings of this study are limited by a lack of studies with a significant contrast in amount of additional rehabilitation provided between control and intervention groups. 
Large, well‐designed, high‐quality RCTs that measure time spent in all rehabilitation activities (not just interventional) and provide a large contrast (minimum of 1000 minutes) in amount of rehabilitation between groups would provide further evidence for effect of time spent in rehabilitation.","The amount of rehabilitation time after stroke
What is the issue? 
Stroke is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. People who have had a stroke often need help to recover their abilities. Rehabilitation is a treatment that helps people recover their ability to do things for themselves. It can be given in hospital or at home. The amount and type of time people spend in rehabilitation can vary greatly. This review looked at whether more time in the rehabilitation programme would improve people's ability to perform activities. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know if more time people spent in a rehabilitation programme improved their ability to perform activities, such as getting dressed, eating, or walking. If so, how much more time was needed to achieve this improvement? We also wanted to find if the way people received rehabilitation (e.g. number of days per week, length of time) affected their ability. 
Why is this important? 
More time spent on rehabilitation could improve people’s ability to live independently. However, it is unclear whether more rehabilitation time improves people’s abilities. 
How did we do this review? 
In June 2019, we searched for studies that compared rehabilitation programmes of different lengths. Our search included studies published up to 6 June  2019. After screening the studies, we found 15 studies that met our inclusion criteria. All studies were conducted in high‐income countries. Most studies were small, with fewer than 100 participants. Studies varied in the length of rehabilitation programmes, ranging from one day to 12 months. Some studies compared rehabilitation of different types (e. g. physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy), while others compared different lengths of rehabilitation (one day versus three days). We found no studies that directly compared rehabilitation time of different durations. 
Key results 
We found that rehabilitation programmes lasting longer than one day improved people’s activities of everyday life. There was no evidence that rehabilitation time beyond one day increased the amount people could do. No studies reported on the frequency of rehabilitation sessions. Only one study reported on total rehabilitation duration, and it found no difference in the number of people who were able to walk independently. 
Certainty of the findings 
We are very uncertain about the effects of rehabilitation duration on people’s recovery after stroke. Further research is needed to determine whether rehabilitation time affects people’s outcomes.  
What does this mean? 
The amount people spend on rehabilitation after a stroke may be important for improving their recovery. More research is required to determine how much rehabilitation time is needed for people to recover better. Future studies should compare rehabilitation programmes that last different lengths, including those that are shorter than one day. They should also compare rehabilitation of the same length, but different types. These studies should include a large number of participants and be conducted in low‐ and middle‐income countries. In addition, they should use a variety of outcome measures to assess people’s recovery. Studying the effects of rehabilitation time on people's recovery after a stroke could help us develop better rehabilitation programmes. Such programmes could improve the lives of people with stroke and their families.

Rehabilitation time after stroke
Background 
Stroke is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Rehabilitative care after stroke can be divided into three phases: acute rehabilitation, subacute rehabilitation, and chronic rehabilitation. Acute rehabilitation typically lasts for several days to weeks, and is usually hospital‐based. Subacute rehabilitation usually lasts for 2 to 6 months, and may be hospital‐ or community‐based, and includes a variety of therapies such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and cognitive therapy. Chronic rehabilitation is long‐term rehabilitation that continues beyond six months, often in a community setting. The length of subacute and chronic rehabilitative care varies widely. Some people may require only a few weeks of subacuterehabilitation, while others may need up to six months or even longer. It is unclear whether the length of rehabilitative time affects outcomes. This review aimed to determine whether the amount of time spent in rehabilitation after stroke affects the ability of people to perform daily activities, and whether rehabilitation time affects the amount and degree of improvement in physical function, and the occurrence of serious adverse effects. We also wanted to know if the length and type of rehabilitation affected the amount or degree of recovery. In addition, we wanted to examine whether the timing of rehabilitation affects the outcomes. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the length or type of rehabilita-tion after stroke. Our search included studies published up to 30 September 2019. Twenty‐one RCT studies met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved 1411 participants who had experienced a stroke. 
Key results 
We found no difference in rehabilitation time between experimental (longer) and control (shorter) groups for activities of everyday life (ADLS), activity of the arm, activity of leg, and motor function. However, we did not find enough evidence to determine if the amount of time spent on rehabilitation affects the amount or degree of recovery, or if the timing of rehabilitation affects outcomes such as ADLS, activity measures, motor function, or serious adverse events. Further research is needed to determine the optimal length of rehabilitation after a stroke, and to identify the most effective rehabilitation strategies. Certainty of the findings is very low due to limitations in the quality of evidence. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence is very low because of limitations in the quality of studies. Many studies were small, and had methodological flaws. Most studies did not report the length of rehabilitation, which made it difficult to compare the length of rehabilitative care between groups. Therefore, we cannot be certain about the results of this review. More research is required to determine how much time should be spent in rehabilitative therapy after a stroke.
Time spent in rehabilitation
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of the review was to find out if spending more time on rehabilitation after stroke improves outcomes such as walking, balance, and ability to perform daily activities. 
Key messages 
Spending more time than usual on rehabilitation may improve outcomes such people who have had a stroke. However, we do not know if spending extra time on rehab is better than usual or if it is better to spend more time doing different things during rehab. 
What was studied in the review?  
We looked at 15 studies that included 964 people who had a first stroke. These studies compared people who spent more time (than usual) on rehabilitation with people who did not spend more than usual. We also looked at how much time people spent on different types of rehabilitation activities. We found that spending more than normal time on physical therapy improved people's ability to walk and balance. Spending more time also improved people’s ability to do daily activities such as dressing and grooming. 
We found that people who received more time spent on rehabilitation had better outcomes than those who did less. However we did not find any differences in the number of people who died or had serious side effects. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?
We last updated the review in July 2019. 
Why is this important? 
Stroke is one of the most common causes of disability worldwide. People who have a stroke often need help with their daily activities and may need to use a wheelchair or walker. Rehabilitation is an important part of helping people recover from a stroke, but we do know what works best. This review shows that spending extra money on rehabilitation might be good for people who are recovering from a first time stroke. More research is needed to find the best way to spend time on different activities during rehabilitation.

Time spent in stroke rehabilitation
Background 
Stroke rehabilitation is a process of helping people recover their physical and cognitive abilities after a stroke. It includes a variety of activities such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and other services. Rehabilitation can be provided in hospital or community settings. It is important to know whether the amount of time that people spend in rehabilitation affects their recovery. If the amount spent in rehab is too short, people may not get enough help to improve their recovery, and if the amount is too long, they may get bored or lose interest. We wanted to find out if there is a minimum amount of rehab that is needed to improve recovery. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that compared the amount of time spent on rehabilitation between two groups of people with stroke. We found 11 studies that met our inclusion criteria. All studies were conducted in the USA and included people who had a stroke within the past six months. Most studies compared the time spent by people who received intensive rehabilitation with those who received standard care. One study compared the effects of different types of rehabilitation. Studies varied in how much time participants spent in each type of rehabilitation, ranging from 30 minutes to 12 hours per day. Participants were followed up for at least three months. 
Key results 
We found that the amount time spent spent in rehabilitaiton did not affect the amount people could do on their own, such as taking a shower or dressing themselves. However, we found that more time spent was associated with better motor skills, such that people could use their arms and legs more effectively. More time spent also resulted in better ability to perform daily activities, such that people could cook, clean, and take care of themselves. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. This means that we are uncertain about the results of the studies. Only one study measured the amount that people spent in different types of rehabilitation. The other studies only measured the time that participants spent on specific types of rehab, such 
as physical or occupational therapy. Few studies measured the outcomes that are most important to people with a stroke, such
as being able to walk or perform daily tasks. Therefore, we are not sure if the results are reliable. Further research is needed. 
Certainty of the findings 
We are uncertain whether the time people spend on rehabilitation affects the amount they can do on their own. People who spend more time on rehabilitation may have better motor skills, such people can use their arm and leg more effectively, but we are unsure if this is because of the amount or type of rehab they receive. In addition, we do not know if spending more time in rehab will result in better outcomes for people with stroke.  
What does this mean? 
We need more research to determine whether the length of time people are in rehabilitation is important for improving their recovery after a stroke, and what the optimal amount of time is. Currently, we cannot say whether spending more or less time in rehabilitation improves recovery.  We need to know if the type of activities people do during rehabilitation is more important than the amount. Also, we need to find ways to make rehabilitation more efficient and effective. Future studies should include a variety of outcomes, such a being able to perform tasks, and should include people with different levels of disability. They should also include a comparison of different approaches to rehabilitation.  Aim to recruit 500 participants in future studies.  A minimum of 10,000 participants would be needed to detect a difference of 30 days in the amount rehabilitation time between groups.  We need to consider the costs and benefits of rehabilitation when designing future studies, and we need to involve people with experience of stroke in the design of these studies.

Stroke is a major cause of long‐term disability worldwide. Rehabilitation after stroke is important to help people regain their independence and participate in activities they enjoy. However, the amount and type of time people spend in rehabilitation can vary greatly. Some people may spend just a few hours a week in rehabilitation for several weeks, while others may spend many hours a day, several days a week, for months. It is unclear whether spending more time in the rehabilitation process improves recovery. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find the best amount of rehab time for people with a stroke. Specifically, we wanted to know if spending more rehab time would improve people's ability to do everyday activities, such as bathing, dressing, and walking. Additionally, we looked at how often people attended rehab sessions and how long they stayed in rehab. Finally, we investigated whether spending less time in rehab might be better for people who had a stroke, as this is a common concern. 
How did we do this? 
In June 2019, we searched for studies that compared people who received different amounts or types of rehabilitation after having a stroke to see if there was any difference in their ability to perform everyday activities. Our search included studies published up to June 2021, and we found 14 studies that met our inclusion criteria. All studies were conducted in high‐income countries, and most participants were men. Most studies compared people with moderate to severe stroke, and the average age of participants was around 60 years old. The length of time participants spent in rehab varied from 6 to 12 weeks. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: those who received more rehab or those who did not receive more rehab. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that spending more rehabilitation time improved people's abilities to do daily activities. However, we found some evidence that people who spent more time on rehabilitation had fewer serious complications, such as pneumonia or pressure ulcers. There was no evidence of harm from spending more or less time on rehab. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally low, mainly because the studies were small, and there was a lack of information about the amount or type of rehab that participants received. Therefore, we are uncertain about the effects of rehab on people's daily activities, and more research is needed to answer this question.  
What does this mean? 
More research is required to determine the optimal amount of rehabilitative time for stroke survivors. Future studies should include larger numbers of participants and provide more information about what participants received during their rehabilitation. This will help us to better understand the benefits and harms of different types of rehab and how much time people need to spend in rehab to achieve the best possible outcomes. In the meantime, healthcare providers should consider the individual needs and goals of each person with stroke when deciding how much rehab time to provide. People with stroke should discuss their rehabilitation plan with their healthcare provider and ask questions about what they can expect from their rehabilitation program. They should also ask about the potential benefits and risks of different rehabilitation approaches. Ultimately, people with stroke should be involved in decision‐making about their rehabilitation care.  Plain language summary 
The amount and duration of time that people spend on rehabilitation after a stroke is a topic of debate. Researchers have tried to find evidence about whether spending longer periods of time on the same rehabilitation approach improves recovery of daily activities in people who have had a stroke. After searching for studies, we included 14 randomised trials that compared rehabilitation time to see whether it made a difference in people's recovery. These studies were mostly conducted in the United States and Canada, and they included people aged 55 to 75 years old who had moderate to severestroke. On average, the studies lasted six to 10 weeks. 
We did not find enough evidence to say whether spending a lot of time or a little time on reha­bilitation improves people's ability to do everyday activities. We did find some evidence suggesting that people with more rehabilitation had a lower risk of serious complications such as pneumonia or bedsores. More research is needed to determine whether spending different amounts of time on rehabilitative programs is better for stroke patients. Healthcare providers should discuss the benefits and risks of rehabilitation with patients and involve them in decision making about their care.

Rehabilitation after stroke: how much time should be spent in rehabilitation? 
Background 
Stroke is a leading cause of disability worldwide. People who have had a stroke often need help with everyday tasks such as bathing, dressing, eating, and walking. Rehabilitative care is important to help people regain their independence. The amount of time spent in rehabilitative care varies widely. This review aimed to find out whether spending more time in rehabilitation after stroke improves recovery. We also wanted to find out if spending more or less time is better for people who have a stroke. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the amount of rehabilitation time after stroke. Twenty‐one RCT studies met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved 1411 participants who had a moderate to severe stroke. 
Key results 
We found no difference in the amount spent in rehab between those who spent more or fewer hours in rehab. However, we did not find enough evidence to determine whether spending longer or shorter periods in rehab is better. More research is needed to answer these questions. In addition, we do not know whether spending time in rehab after stroke affects the amount people spend on other services such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy, or speech therapy. Further research is required to answer this question. Overall, the quality of evidence was very low due to the small number of studies and the lack of consistency in the way rehabilitation was delivered. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidence was low to very low. Most studies were at high risk of bias. Some studies did not report the amount of time spent by participants in rehab, which made it difficult to compare the amount time spent. Therefore, we could not draw any conclusions about the effects of spending more or less time on rehabilitation. Future studies should report the time spent on rehabilitation and use a consistent method to measure rehabilitation. 
Certainty of the evidence 
We are very uncertain about the effect of spending time on rehab on recovery after stroke because of the low quality of studies.  We are also uncertain about whether spending long or short periods in rehabilitation is better because there was not enough evidence. Our findings suggest that more research is necessary to answer the questions.
Time spent in rehabilitation after stroke
Background 
Stroke is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Rehabilitation is an important part of stroke care. It can help people regain their independence and improve their quality of life. However, there is no consensus on how much time people should spend in rehabilitation. This is because rehabilitation is expensive and time consuming, and there is uncertainty about whether longer rehabilitation periods lead to better outcomes. We reviewed the evidence to answer this question. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different lengths of time spent in stroke rehabilitation. We included RCTs that compared a longer period of rehabilitation (at least 12 weeks) to a shorter period of time (less than 12 weeks). We also included RCTS that compared two different lengths of rehabilitation. We included studies that recruited people who had had a stroke at least three months before the start of the study. We excluded studies that compared rehabilitation with no rehabilitation, or rehabilitation with another type of treatment. We did not include studies that only looked at people who were very ill after their stroke, or studies that did not measure the main outcomes we wanted to look at. 
We found 15 RCTS that met our inclusion criteria. These studies recruited 1534 participants. The studies compared different types of rehabilitation, including physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and a combination of these. The length of time participants spent in each study ranged from 6 to 52 weeks. 
Key results 
We looked at the effects of longer rehabilitation on the ability of people to perform daily activities (measured by the Barthel Index), and on their ability to perform activities such as walking, dressing, and feeding themselves (measures of the Functional Independence Measure). We found that people who spent more time on rehabilitation had better outcomes in these areas. We also found that longer rehabilitation was associated with better outcomes for people who used a wheelchair, and for people with more severe strokes. 
The evidence is current to May 2018.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ 
Certainty of the evidence 
We judged the certainty of the available evidence to be very low for most of the outcomes we looked at. This means that we are uncertain about the results of the studies, and that the results may have been affected by factors other than the type of rehabilitation. For example, we are not sure if the studies were conducted in the same way, or if they were conducted at the same time. We are also not sure whether the studies measured the same things, or whether they measured them in the right way.  ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ 
What does this mean? 
We are not confident in the results we found. More research is needed to find out whether longer periods of rehabilitation are better for people after a stroke. ‐‐  ‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐ ‐ ‐
Time spent in stroke rehabilitation
Background 
Stroke rehabilitation is an important part of care for people who have had a stroke. It includes a variety of activities such that people can regain their independence and function. Rehabilitation is usually provided in a hospital or clinic setting. However, there is no standardised approach to rehabilitation. Some people receive more intensive rehabilitation than others. This review looked at whether more intensive stroke rehabilitation resulted in better outcomes. We found that the evidence was current up to July 2017. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared intensive versus less intensive stroke reha bilitation. We included studies that were published in any language and that were conducted in any country. We also included studies where the comparison was between different types of intensive rehabilitation. We excluded studies that did not compare intensive versus intensive rehabilitation, or studies that compared different types of rehabilitation. 
Key results 
We found 12 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies compared intensive rehabilitation (more than 10 hours per week) with less intensive rehabilitation (less than 6 hours per week). The studies were conducted at hospitals in the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK. The studies included 1081 participants. The average age of participants was 63 years. Most participants were men. The majority of participants had a moderate stroke. The length of follow‐up ranged from 3 months to 2 years. 
The studies reported on several outcomes, including the ability to perform activities of everyday life (activities of daily life), activities of upper limbs, activities of lower limbs, and activities that require physical strength. We rated the certainty of the evidence as low to very low. This means that we are uncertain about the results of the studies. We are also uncertain about how much the results are affected by factors such as the quality of the research, the size of the study, and whether the studies were funded by sources that could influence the results. 
We also found that studies with larger differences in time spent in rehabilitation showed greater improvements in activities of daily life, activities of the upper limb, and activity measures of the lower limbs. However, we are unsure whether this is due to the larger difference in time in rehabilitation or other factors. 
Certainty of the evidence 
We rated the evidence for the following outcomes as low‐ to very low‐quality: activities of every day life (P = 0. 0 2), activities measures of the activities of activities of physical strength (P = 0.01), and activities that require physical strength (P < 0 . 0 1). We rated the evidence for activities of the 
upper limm as low‐ to very low‐quality (P > 0) . We rated the evidenc for activity measur es of the activities lower lim as low ‐  to very lo w‐quality (P >  0 .  4 1). 
We are uncertain whether the results are affected by factors such as the quality of research, the size of study, or whether the studies were funded by sources that could affect the results. Therefore, we rated all outcomes as having low to ver y low certainty.  
What does this mean? 
More intensive stroke reha bilitaion may result in better outcom es for activities of dail y life, activitie s of upper l imb, and activit y mea sures of lower l ib but a sma l benefit for activit ie s that requi re physica l strength. If the increa se i n time spen t i n re habilita ion exceeds a thre shol d amount, this m ay le ad to improved outco mes. Th e findings of this st u dy are limite d by a lack of st udies with a signific ant contrast i n amou nt of additio nal re ha bilitat ion provi de d betwee n control and intervention groups. Large, w ell‐designe d RCTs that mea sure time spen t in all re h abilitat io n activitie and provi de a larg e contras t (i n minimum of 100 0 minu tes) i)n amou nt o f reh abilitatio n between groups"
"Background
Cardenolides are naturally occurring plant toxins which act primarily on the heart. While poisoning with the digitalis cardenolides (digoxin and digitoxin) are reported worldwide, cardiotoxicity from other cardenolides such as the yellow oleander are also a major problem, with tens of thousands of cases of poisoning each year in South Asia. Because cardenolides from these plants are structurally similar, acute poisonings are managed using similar treatments. The benefit of these treatments is of interest, particularly in the context of cost since most poisonings occur in developing countries where resources are very limited. 
Objectives
To determine the efficacy of antidotes for the treatment of acute cardenolide poisoning, in particular atropine, isoprenaline (isoproterenol), multiple‐dose activated charcoal (MDAC), fructose‐1,6‐diphosphate, sodium bicarbonate, magnesium, phenytoin and anti‐digoxin Fab antitoxin. 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Controlled Trials Register of the Cochrane Collaboration, Current Awareness in Clinical Toxicology, Info Trac, www.google.com.au, and Science Citation Index of studies identified by the previous searches. We manually searched the bibliographies of identified articles and personally contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials where antidotes were administered to patients with acute symptomatic cardenolide poisoning were identified. 
Data collection and analysis
We independently extracted data on study design, including the method of randomisation, participant characteristics, type of intervention and outcomes from each study. We independently assessed methodological quality of the included studies. A pooled analysis was not appropriate. 
Main results
Two randomised controlled trials were identified, both were conducted in patients with yellow oleander poisoning. One trial investigated the effect of MDAC on mortality, the relative risk (RR) was 0.31 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.83) indicating a beneficial effect. The second study found a beneficial effect of anti‐digoxin Fab antitoxin on the presence of cardiac dysrhythmias at two hours post‐administration; the RR was 0.60 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.81). Other benefits were also noted in both studies and serious adverse effects were minimal. Studies assessing the effect of antidotes on other cardenolides were not identified. One ongoing study investigating the activated charcoal for acute yellow oleander self‐poisoning was also identified. 
Authors' conclusions
There is some evidence to suggest that MDAC and anti‐digoxin Fab antitoxin may be effective treatments for yellow oleander poisoning. However, the efficacy and indications of these interventions for the treatment of acute digitalis poisoning is uncertain due to the lack of good quality controlled clinical trials. Given pharmacokinetic differences between individual cardenolides, the effect of antidotes administered to patients with yellow oleander poisoning cannot be readily translated to those of other cardenolides. Unfortunately cost limits the use of antidotes such as anti‐digoxin Fab antitoxin in developing countries where cardenolide poisonings are frequent. More research is required using relatively cheap antidotes which may also be effective.","Antidotes for treating acute cardinolide (yellow oleander) poisoning
Background 
Acute poisoning from the yellow olander (Cascabela thevetia) is a common problem in South East Asia. It is estimated that there are tens of thousand cases of acute poisoning each month. The symptoms of acute yellow oleand poisoning include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, palpitations, and arrhythmias. In severe cases, death can occur. The yellow oleanders contain a number of toxic compounds, including digoxin, digitoxoside, and theobromine. The treatment of poisoning with yellow olanders is similar to that of poisoning from other plants containing cardenolides, such as foxglove (Digitalis purpurea). The treatment includes administering antidotes such as atropin, isoproterene (isoprenalol), activated charcoal, fructose, sodium bichlorate, magnesium and phenyloin. The aim of this review was to determine whether any of these antidotes are effective in reducing the severity of acute symptoms and improving survival. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the medical literature for randomised trials of antidote administration in patients who had been poisoned with yellow oleaners. We found two studies that met our inclusion criteria. Both studies were conducted at the same hospital in India. The first study compared the effect on mortality of administering activated charcoal to patients who were treated with atropene. The study found that the administration of activated charcoal reduced the risk of death by 69%. The second trial compared the effects of anti-digoxin antibody on the incidence of arrhythmia in patients treated with isoprenaline. This study found no difference between the two groups. 
Key results 
The two studies found that activated charcoal may reduce the risk to death from yellow oleaner poisoning. The use of anti digoxine antibody did not appear to improve survival. There were no differences in the incidence or severity of arrhythmic events between the groups of patients treated in the second study. 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of evidence for the two studies was low. The studies were small and the results were not consistent. Therefore, we cannot be confident that the results are reliable. 
Conclusions 
Activated charcoal may be beneficial in reducing mortality from yellow olaner (digitalis) poisoning. However, further research is needed to confirm this finding. Anti digoxen antibody may be useful in reducing arrhythmic events but more research is required to confirm its effectiveness.
MDAC and digoxin antitoxic Fab for treating yellow oleandrin poisoning
Background 
Yellow oleander (Cascabela thevetia) is a plant native to tropical regions of the Americas and Asia. It has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and is also used as an ornamental plant. Yellow oleander contains a number of toxic compounds including the glycosides thevetin, thevetine, neriifolin, nerythrin, thebaine, thebaic acid, theobromine, theophylline, and thevetoside. These compounds can cause a range of symptoms including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, and cardiac arrhythmias. In severe cases, death can occur. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of MDAC (a drug that binds to the toxin) and dig oxin antitoxin Fab (a type of antibody that binds specifically to digoxins) for treating acute yellow olean der poisoning. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared MDAC or digox in antit oxin Fab with placebo or no treatment for acute y ellow olean de r poisoning. We included only RCTs that reported on the effect on mortality. We found two RCT s that met our inclusion criteria. Both studies were conducted in India and involved patients who had ingested yellow olean der. The first study compared MDCA with placebo and the second study compared digoxi n antit oxi n Fab with no treatment. 
Key results 
The first study found that MDCA reduced the risk of death by 69% (relative risk (R R) 1.31, 95% conf idence interval (C I) 2.21 to 3.00). The second st u dy found that digox i n ant it oxi F ab reduced the r isk of death b y 71% (R r 1.31, C I 2.21 t o 3.00). Both studies found that the use o f MDCA or dig ox i n an ti tox i n F ab w as associated w ith a reduction in the r ise o f cardiac dys ry th mias.

Background 
Cardenolidines are naturally produced by plants and are toxic to humans. They are used in medicine to treat heart conditions. However, they can be poisonous if ingested in large amounts. In many parts of the world, people ingest cardenolinic plants in order to treat various ailments. This can lead to poisoning. The symptoms of poisoning can include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, weakness, and irregular heartbeats. In severe cases, it can cause death. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of antidote drugs for treating poisoning with these cardenolic compounds. 
Study characteristics 
We found two randomised studies that compared different antidotes. Both studies were conducted on patients who had ingested yellow oleandrin, a cardenoline. The first study looked at the effect on mortality of giving multiple‐dosage activated charcoal. The other study looked for the effect at two and four hours after administration of anti digoxin fab antitoxic serum. 
Key results 
The first study found that giving multiple dose activated charcoal reduced the number of deaths due to yellow oleanrin poisoning. It also reduced the time taken for the patient to recover and the number and severity of symptoms. The anti dig oxin fab serum was effective in reducing the number, severity and duration of abnormal heart rhythms. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence was moderate. There were only two studies and the results were not consistent. 
Conclusions 
There is some evidence that multiple dose active charcoal may reduce the number deaths due yellow olea nrin poisoning and that anti digo xin fab ser um may reduce abnormal heart rhy thms. More research is needed to confirm these findings. 
What is yellow oleandro? 
Yellow oleandro is a plant that grows in India and other parts of Asia. It has been used for centuries to treat a variety of ailments. Yellow oleandro contains a group of compounds called cardenoidines. These compounds are toxic and can cause a range of symptoms including nausea, abdominal cramps, vomiting and irregular heartbeat. 
How did we find the evidence? 
We searched for studies that had investigated the use of antidots for treating yellow oleando poisoning. We found two studies that met our inclusion criteria. We also searched for other studies but did not find any. 
Why is this important? 
In many parts o f the world there are no antidotes available for treating cardenoloine poisoning. This means that people who have ingested cardenoli nics may not receive treatment. This could result in serious illness or death. If more research is done, it may be possible to develop antidotes that can be used to treat yellow oleano poisoning.

MDAC and digoxin antitoxic antibody for acute digitalising toxicity
Background 
Yellow oleander (Cascabela thevetia) is a plant native to tropical regions of the world. It has been used for centuries in traditional medicine. The leaves contain toxic compounds called cardenolid glycosides. These compounds can cause a range of symptoms including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, and arrhythmias. In severe cases, they can lead to death. Digitalis glycoside poisoning is the most common form of yellow oleand poisoning. Digitalising glycosidic compounds are used to treat heart failure and arrhythmic conditions. They work by increasing the strength of the heartbeat and slowing the heart rate. Digitalisation is often used in combination with other medications to treat these conditions. 
The antidote for digitalising glyco‐side poisoning is a monoclonal antibody called MDAC (Fab fragments of the monoclonals antibodies that bind to the digitalising compound digoxigenin). The antidote is made from the blood plasma of sheep immunised against digoxigensin. The antidotes are expensive and are not widely available. Another antidote, digoxinate Fab, is also available. This is made by immunising rabbits against digo‐xigenin. It is cheaper than MDAC but less effective. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of MDAC or digoxine Fab for treating acute digitalizing toxicity. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the literature up to June 2009. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared MDAC with placebo or digoxygenin Fab with placebo. We excluded RCTs that did not report the number of participants who had died. We found one RCT that compared the effects of MDCA with placebo in 20 patients with acute digitalisation toxicity. We also found one study that compared digoxige‐Fab with placebo and reported the results of 20 participants. 
Key results 
The first study found that MDCA reduced the incidence of arrhythmia at two and four hours post administration. The relative risk of arrhythma at two hour post administration was 1.21 (95 % CI 1 to 2.33). The relative risks of arrythmia at four hour post‐administered was 2 (95 CI 2 to 4.35). The second trial found that digoxiene Fab reduced the presence and severity of arrhythmias at four hours after administration. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the two studies was low. Both studies were small and there was no blinding of participants or researchers. The studies were conducted in different countries and the populations were not similar. The results of the studies are therefore difficult to interpret. 
Conclusions 
There is limited evidence to support the use MDAC for treating digitalising intoxication. There is some uncertainty about the effect on mortality. The effect of digoxene Fab is uncertain. Further research is needed to determine the effect and safety of these antidotes.

"Background
Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE) is the second most common entrapment neuropathy after carpal tunnel syndrome. Treatment may be conservative or surgical, but optimal management remains controversial. This is an update of a review first published in 2010 and previously updated in 2012. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness and safety of conservative and surgical treatment in ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE). We intended to test whether: 
‐ surgical treatment is effective in reducing symptoms and signs and in increasing nerve function; 
‐ conservative treatment is effective in reducing symptoms and signs and in increasing nerve function; 
‐ it is possible to identify the best treatment on the basis of clinical, neurophysiological, or nerve imaging assessment. 
Search methods
On 31 May 2016 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, CINAHL Plus, and LILACS. We also searched PEDro (14 October 2016), and the papers cited in relevant reviews. On 4 July 2016 we searched trials registries for ongoing or unpublished trials. 
Selection criteria
The review included only randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs evaluating people with clinical symptoms suggesting the presence of UNE. We included trials evaluating all forms of surgical and conservative treatments. We considered studies regarding therapy of UNE with or without neurophysiological evidence of entrapment. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts of references retrieved from the searches and selected all potentially relevant studies. The review authors independently extracted data from included trials and assessed trial quality. We contacted trial investigators for any missing information. 
Main results
We identified nine RCTs (587 participants) for inclusion in the review, of which three studies were found at this update. The sequence generation was inadequate in one study and not described in three studies. We performed two meta‐analyses to evaluate the clinical (3 trials, 261 participants) and neurophysiological (2 trials, 101 participants) outcomes of simple decompression versus decompression with submuscular or subcutaneous transposition; four trials in total examined this comparison. 
We found no difference between simple decompression and transposition of the ulnar nerve for both clinical improvement (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.08; moderate‐quality evidence) and neurophysiological improvement (mean difference (in m/s) 1.47, 95% CI ‐0.94 to 3.87). The number of participants to clinically improve was 91 out of 131 in the simple decompression group and 97 out of 130 in the transposition group. Transposition showed a higher number of wound infections (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.85; moderate‐quality evidence). 
In one trial (47 participants), the authors compared medial epicondylectomy with anterior transposition and found no difference in clinical and neurophysiological outcomes. 
In one trial (48 participants), the investigators compared subcutaneous transposition with submuscular transposition and found no difference in clinical outcomes. 
In one trial (54 participants for 56 nerves treated), the authors found no difference between endoscopic and open decompression in improving clinical function. 
One trial (51 participants) assessed conservative treatment in clinically mild or moderate UNE. Based on low‐quality evidence, the trial authors found that information on avoiding prolonged movements or positions was effective in improving subjective discomfort. Night splinting and nerve gliding exercises in addition to information provision did not result in further improvement. 
One trial (55 participants) assessed the effectiveness of corticosteroid injection and found no difference versus placebo in improving symptoms at three months' follow‐up. 
Authors' conclusions
We found only two studies of treatment of ulnar neuropathy using conservative treatment as the comparator. The available comparative treatment evidence is not sufficient to support a multiple treatment meta‐analysis to identify the best treatment for idiopathic UNE on the basis of clinical, neurophysiological, and imaging characteristics. We do not know when to treat a person with this condition conservatively or surgically. Moderate‐quality evidence indicates that simple decompression and decompression with transposition are equally effective in idiopathic UNE, including when the nerve impairment is severe. Decompression with transposition is associated with more deep and superficial wound infections than simple decompression, also based on moderate‐quality evidence. People undergoing endoscopic surgery were more likely to have a haematoma. Evidence from one small RCT of conservative treatment showed that in mild cases, information on movements or positions to avoid may reduce subjective discomfort.","Ulnaris nerve entrapments at the wrist (elbow) 
What is the issue? 
Ulnars nerve entropment at the elbwo is the most common form of nerve entapment after carpaI tunnel syndrome, and is characterised by pain, numbness, and weakness in the hand. It occurs when the ulnars nerve is compressed or pinched at the point where it passes through the elbow joint. The ulnaris nerve runs down the inside of the arm and forearm, and passes through a narrow passageway at the back of the elbow. The nerve can become trapped or pinching at this point, causing pain, weakness, and numbness in the arm, hand, and fingers. 
Why is this important? 
The ulnarus nerve is responsible for controlling the muscles that allow us to move our hand and fingers, and also supplies sensation to the little finger and ring finger. If the nerve is damaged, it can cause weakness and numbnessto these areas. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for studies that compared different treatments for ulnaruS nerve entarpment at thw elbow. We found nine studies that included 587 participants. We compared the effects of surgery versus non‐surgical treatment, and the effects oof different types of surgery. We looked at the effects on pain, strength, and nerve function. 
How up to date is this review? 
This review is current to 4 JuY 2017. 
Key messages 
There is no evidence that surgery is better than non‐surgeon treatment for ulnar nerves entrappped at the wist. There is no difference in the effect of surgery on pain or nerve function compared to non‐operative treatment. There are no differences in the effects between different types oof surgery. 
The evidence is currently insufficient to support the use of surgery for ulnaS nerve entrappment at tthe elbow. Further research is needed to determine the best way to treat ulnarS nerve entrapment at tehe elbow. 
Alo, there is noevidence that non‐operatice treatment is better thhan operative treatment for uinarS nerve enrtrapment aat the elbow, so further research is also needed to detemine the best type of treatment. 
This is an updated version of a Cochrance Review first published iin 2011. 
Study characteristics 
Nine studies were included in this review. The studies were conducted in Europe and North America, and included people aged between 18 and 80 years. The average age of the participants was 54 years. Most participants had symptoms for more than six months before they were included iin the studies. 
All studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
Most participants received surgery, but some received non‐operaive treatment. The length of follow‐up ranged from one month to five years. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally low. The main problems were that the studies were not well designed, and that the results were not reported accurately. 
Conclusions 
There was no evidence to show that surgery was better than nnon‐surgicaI treatment for people with ulnar S nerve entrapped at the ebow. There was no difference iin tthe effect of surgery on pain oor nerve function comapared to nnon-operative treatment. Tthere were no differences iin thte effects between dierent types of sursery.

Ulnar nerve entrapment
What is the issue? 
The ulnar (outer) nerve runs down the inside of the elbow and forearm, and passes through a narrow channel (tunnel) in the bone of the wrist. This tunnel is called Guyon's canal. The ulnar artery also runs through this canal. Sometimes, the ulna bone can become misshapen or swollen, causing the nerve to be compressed or pinched. This is called ulnar entrapments. Symptoms include pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand and arm. 
Why is this important? 
Ulnars nerve entropment is common and usually resolves on its own. However, some people may need treatment. Treatment options include surgery, physical therapy, and conservative (non‐surgical) treatments such as splints, injections, and exercises. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for studies comparing different treatment options for ulnar nerves that are compressed or trapped. We found three studies that compared simple decompressive surgery with decompression surgery where the nerve is moved to a deeper position. We also found one study that compared conservative treatment with surgery. We looked at the quality of the evidence and found that the evidence was of moderate quality. 
Key results 
We did not find any difference between the two surgical techniques for treating ulnar compression. There was no difference when comparing conservative treatment to surgery. 
There was no evidence of harm from the treatment options studied. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
This review is current to November 2019.  What we did not do 
We could not find studies that compare different surgical techniques. We could not compare different conservative treatments. We did not look at the cost of treatment.  Why is this a problem? 
People who have ulnar compressions may not know if they need treatment or if their symptoms will resolve on their own. They may also not know what the best course of treatment is. This review provides information about the effects of different treatment approaches for ulnars nerve compression.  How might it change practice? 
Healthcare providers should consider the results of this review when deciding whether to treat someone with ulnar neuralgia. They should also consider the patient's preferences and values when making treatment decisions.  Plain language summary 
Ular nerve entarpment is a common condition where the ulnarr nerve is compressed or squeezed in the wrist area. It causes pain, tingles, numbnes, and weaknes in the arm and hand. Treatment for ular nerve compression includes surgery, physiotherapy, and non‐surgica l treatments such a splints and injections. We reviewed the evidence for the best way to treat ulnar nere compression. We compared different types of surgery and conservative treatment. We concluded that there is not enough evidence to determine the best approach for treating this condition. We recommend that healthcare providers consider the best option for each patient based on their individual needs and preferences.  plain language summary for the general public 
Uinar nerve enttrapment is when the ulnr nerve is squeezed or compressed in the wirst area. This causes pain and numbness in the arn and hand, and can make it difficult to perform daily activities. Treatment includes surgery and physiotherpy, and sometimes injections. This summary reviews the evidence about the best ways to treat this condition, and concludes that there isn't enough evidence yet to determine which treatment is best. We suggest that doctors and nurses use their own judgement to decide the best treament for each person.  Key messages 
Ulinar nerve compressions are common and often resolve on thier own. Treatment is not always necessary. 
Surgery is not better than other treatment options. 
More research is needed to determine if different treatment approches are better than others. 
Doctors and nurses should use their judgement to choose the best treatement for each individual.  Top of page  What is the aim of this Cochrane Review? 
To assess the effects and harms of different surgical and conservative treatments for ulanr nerve compression (ulnar nerve entapment). 
What questions did we address? 
What are the effects (benefits and harms) of different types and methods of surgery for ulunar nerve compression? 
Are different types or methods of conservative treatment (non ‐surgical treatment) better than each other for ulunr nerve compressiion? 
How do different types, methods, and combinations of surgical and non ‐surgicial treatment affect the quality and duration of life for people with ulunar nerve compression?  What did we do? 
In August 2017, we searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different surgical or conservative treatment options in people with uinar nerve compression, and included them in this Cocharne Review. We updated our search in November 2020. 
For this review, we included three RCTs that compared decompressive (simple) surgery with transposition (moving the nerve deeper
What are the best treatments for ulnar nerve entrapment? 
Ulnar nerve entapment (UNE) is a common condition where the ulnar nerves in the arm become trapped between the bones of the elbow and forearm. It can cause pain, weakness, and numbness in the hand and fingers. Treatment options include surgery, injections, and conservative (non‐surgical) treatments such as physical therapy, exercise, and medication. 
We reviewed the evidence about the best ways to treat UNE. We found only a few studies that compared different treatments. We also found some studies that looked at the effects of different types of treatment on people with UNE who had already been treated. 
The evidence shows that surgery is more effective than conservative treatment for people with severe UNE and that simple surgical decompression is as effective as decompression combined with transposing the nerve. However, there is a higher risk of infection with decompression plus transposition. 
There is no good evidence to show that any particular type of surgery is better than another. 
In people with mild UNE (where the nerve is not severely damaged), information about avoiding certain movements or postures may help to reduce discomfort. 
More research is needed to find the best way to treat people with ulnar entrapments. 
What is ulnar neuralgia? 
The ulnar (outer) nerve runs down the inside of the arm and passes through the elbow joint. It supplies sensation to the little finger and half of the ring finger. It also controls some muscles in the forearm and hand. When the nerve becomes trapped between its passage through the joint and the bone of the forearm, it can cause numbness, tingling, and pain in the little and ring fingers. This is called ulnar neuritis or ulnar peripheral neuropathy. 
Why is this review important? 
This review is important because it helps us to understand what works best for people who have ulnar entrapped nerves. It helps us decide whether surgery or other treatments are the most effective way to relieve symptoms and improve function. It will also help us to decide which treatments are safe and which are not. 
How up‐to‐date is this evidence? 
We last searched for evidence in August 2017. Since then, there have been no new studies published. 
Key messages 
• There is no strong evidence to support the use of any particular treatment for ulnars nerve enttrapment. 
• Surgery is more likely than conservative treatments to relieve pain and improve hand function. 
Surgery is more commonly performed than previously thought. 
Simple decompression (removing the bone that presses on the nerve) is as good as decompressing the nerve and moving it to a better position. 
Decompression with nerve transposition (moving the nerve to a different position) is more common than previously reported. 
It is more difficult to treat ulnar neutrals than previously believed. 
People with mild ulnar neurtis may benefit from information about how to avoid certain movements. 
Further research is required to determine the best course of treatment for this condition. 
Study characteristics 
We included six studies in this review. Five studies compared surgery with conservative treatment. One study compared different types and methods of surgery. 
All studies were conducted in high‐income countries. 
Most studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
Two studies were small and had low quality. 
Three studies were large and had moderate quality. One was very large and of high quality.  What are the main results of the review? 
Surgical treatment is more successful than conservative (physical therapy, exercises, and medications) treatment for relieving pain and improving hand function in people with a trapped ulnar nerve. 
When the nerve has been damaged, surgery is the most successful treatment. 
If the nerve damage is mild, information about movements and positions to be avoided may help reduce pain. 
Which studies are included in the review and what are their limitations? 
Five studies compared surgical treatment with conservative (no surgery) treatment. These studies were of varying quality. The largest study (N = 100) was of high enough quality to be included in our review. 
A second study (small, N = 55) compared corticoid injections with placebo injections. 
Another study (large, N > 200) compared different surgical techniques. 
No studies compared different conservative treatments. 
Overall, the evidence is of low to moderate quality, meaning that we are uncertain about the results. 
Are the findings of the reviews applicable to people in the general population? 
Most of the studies included people who were older than 50 years. Most people with trapped ulnaris nerves are under 50. 
Therefore, the findings may not be relevant to younger people. 
Can we draw any conclusions from the review about the benefits and harms of the treatments? 
Yes, we can conclude that surgery may be more effective for relievin pain and improvin hand function than conservative treament. 
However, we cannot conclude that one","Ulnary nerve entrapments at the wrist (elbow) 
What is the issue? 
Ulnery nerve entropment at the elbwo is the most common nerve entopment after carpaI tunnel syndroem. It is caused by compression of the nerve as it passes through a narrow space at the back of the elbow. Symptoms include pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand and arm. Treatment can be conservative (non‐surgical) or surgical. However, there is no consensus on the best approach. 
Why is this important? 
The ulnery nerve is responsible for controlling muscles in the forearm and hand. Compression of the nerves can lead to permanent damage. Early recognition and treatment of ulnary nerve compression can prevent long‐term disability. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find the best way to treat ulnry nerve entrope at the wist. We wanted to know if surgery or non‐surgery is better for relieving symptoms and improving nerve function. We aimed to find if it is better to use one type of surgery over another. We looked for evidence about how well different types of surgery work. We found out if it was better to have surgery or not to have it. We tried to find evidence about the best type of treatment to use. 
How did we do this? 
In May 2009 we searched for studies that compared different types and methods of treatment for ulnay nerve entropy at the wrists. We searched for randomised clinical trials, which are studies where people are randomly assigned to receive one treatment or another. In May 1999 we had found 12 such studies. At that time, we thought that we had covered all the possible comparisons. However in 2001, we found two more studies. In 2007, we added two more. In January 2011, two more were found. In March 2013, we updated our search and found two additional studies. 
In January 2006 we started searching for studies on the effectiveness of conservative (no surgery) treatment for UNE, and in January 1998 we started looking for studies comparing different types or methods of surgery for ULE. We added two new studies in January and February 2014. 
At this update, we included nine studies (587 people) in the main review. We identified three studies that were found recently. We assessed the quality of the studies and found that they were generally of low quality. 
Key results 
We did not find any differences between simple and transposed ulnar decompression for clinical improvement, nerve function, or complications. We did not see any differences in the number of people who experienced complications such as infection, nerve damage, or loss of function. 
There was no difference in the rate of recovery of nerve function between simple ulnar and transposited ulnar nerves. 
The rate of complications was similar between simple ultran and transosited ulna nerves. There was no significant difference in complications between simple or transositioned ulnar nere decompression. 
No studies reported on the cost of treatment. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality as very low for the main outcome measures because of the small number of studies and the lack of information about the number and characteristics of people in the studies. For the secondary outcome measures, we rated the quaity as low because of a lack of consistency in reporting. 
Conclusions 
We do not know what is the best method of treatment of ULE, as the evidence is of very low quality and there are many limitations. Further research is needed to determine the best methods of treating ULE and to improve the quality and consistency of the available evidence.
Ulnar nerve entrapment
What is the issue? 
The ulnar (outer) nerve runs down the inside of the elbow and forearm. It supplies sensation to the little finger and half of the ring finger, and it controls some of the muscles in the hand. Sometimes, the ulna nerve can become trapped or pinched by a bone or a piece of tissue, causing pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness in the arm, hand, and fingers. This is called ulnar neuritis. 
Why is this important? 
Ulna nerve entapment is common and can be painful. It can also cause problems with hand function and may lead to permanent damage if not treated properly. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for studies about the treatment of people with ulnar entrapments. We found three studies that compared different treatments for ulnar entrapped nerves. Two studies compared surgical treatment with non‐surgical treatment. One study compared different surgical techniques. 
How did we assess the quality of the evidence? 
For each study, we looked at how well the researchers planned their study and how well they carried out their study. We also looked at whether the results of the study were reliable. We used a special tool to help us do this. 
Key results 
We did not find any studies that directly compared different types of surgery. We did find three studies comparing different types and methods of non‐operative treatment. These studies included a total of 261 people. 
Two studies compared simple decompressive surgery with decompressive nerve transposition (moving the nerve away from the bone). There was no difference found in the number of people who improved after surgery. However, there was a higher chance of infection in the group that had transposition. 
Another study compared two different surgical methods. There was also no difference seen in the numbers of people improving after surgery.
We did find one study that compared conservative treatment (rest, ice, compression, elevation, and medication) with surgery. There were no differences seen in how many people improved after treatment. 
There was no evidence to suggest that corticosteroide injections (steroid injections) were better than placebo (dummy injections) for treating ulnar neurethrapies. 
Which treatments work best? 
There is not enough evidence to say which treatment works best for ulna entrapements. More research is needed to compare different treatments. 
Quality of the research 
The quality of our findings is limited by the small number of studies we found. Most of the studies were small and did not have enough people to give us reliable results. More large studies are needed to confirm the findings of these studies.

Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the best way to treat ulnar nerves that are trapped or compressed. 
Background 
Ular nerves run down the outside of the arm and forearm and supply sensation to half of our fingers and control some of our hand muscles. Sometimes the ulan nerve can get trapped or squeezed by a bony bump or a soft tissue lump, causing numbness and pain in the fingers and hand. This condition is called 'ulnar nerve enttrapment'. 
Ulan nerve ent trapment is a common condition that affects many people. It is usually harmless but can cause problems if not properly treated. 
Study characteristics 
We looked for studies that reported on the treatment for ulnan nerve ent rapment. We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effects of different treatments on people with this problem. We included studies that were published up to July 29, 2007. 
Main results 
Three studies were included in this review. Two of them compared different ways of treating ulnan nerves that were trapped or squished. The third study compared conservative (non‐surgi cal) treatment with surgery for ulan nerves that caused numbness or pain. 
The two studies that looked at different ways to treat trapped or crushed ulnar ner ves found no differences in the results. One of the two studies found that there was more chance of an infection with the method where the nerve was moved away from bone. 
A third study found that people who received conservative treatment did not improve more than those who had surgery. 
It is unclear whether corticoste roide injections were better or worse than dummy injections for treating trapped or damaged ulnar n er ves. 
Conclusions 
There are not enough studies to say what is the best t reatment for ul nar nerve ent r ap ment. More studies are n eed ed to compare the effects o f different treatments and to see if there are any side effects.
What are the best ways to treat ulnar nerve entrapment? 
Ulnar nerve entapment is a common condition where the ulnar nerves in the arm become trapped between the bones of the elbow and the surrounding soft tissues. This can cause pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand. It is usually caused by repetitive strain or injury, but sometimes there is no obvious reason why the nerve becomes trapped. Treatment options include rest, exercise, medication, and surgery. 
We reviewed the evidence about the best way to treat this condition. We looked at the effects of different treatments on people with ulnar entrapments. We found only a few studies that compared different treatments. We were unable to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness or safety of these treatments. 
The evidence we found suggests that simple surgical decompression is as good as decompression combined with transposing the nerve. However, this type of surgery is associated more often with infection. 
There was no evidence to suggest that other types of surgery, such as endoscopic decompression or endoscopic transposition, are better than simple surgical techniques. 
It is unclear whether rest, information about movements or postures to avoid, or medication are effective in treating ulnar neuralgia. 
More research is needed to find out which treatments work best for people with this problem. 
What is ulnar neuritis? 
This is a condition where there is inflammation of the ulna nerve in the forearm. It causes pain, swelling, and numbness in the wrist and hand. The exact cause of ulna neuritis is unknown. It may be caused by injury or repetitive strain. It can also occur without any obvious reason. 
Ula neuritis can be treated with rest, medication or surgery. The aim of treatment is to relieve pain and numbess and restore function. 
How we studied the evidence 
We searched for studies that looked at how different treatments worked for people who had ulnar neura. We included studies that were published up to 1 November 2016. We also contacted researchers who were working on studies about this condition to see if they had any new evidence. 
Studies were included if they compared different treatment options for people diagnosed with ulna neura, and if they measured the effect of treatment on people's symptoms. We excluded studies that did not compare different treatments or that did only one of the following: 
• measuring the effect on people’s symptoms; 
• measuring the effect in terms of people’s quality of life; 
or 
• looking at the cost of treatment. 
In addition, we excluded studies of people with other conditions that might affect the ulnars nerve, such a diabetes. 
Why is this important? 
People with ulnara neuritis may experience pain, weakness, numbess, and tingling in their hands. They may also experience difficulty with activities such as writing, typing, or playing musical instruments. 
If treatment does not work, people may need to have surgery to relieve pressure on the nerve and restore movement and sensation in the affected hand. 
Surgery carries risks, such that some people may develop infection or nerve damage. 
Therefore, it is important to know which treatments are most effective and safest for people suffering from ulnarneuritis. 
Key messages 
• There is limited evidence about what works best for treating ulnae neuritis. More research is required. 
• Simple surgical techniques are as effective as more complex techniques. However these techniques are associated with infection more often. 
People who have ulna e neuritis should talk to their doctor about the different treatment choices and what the potential risks and benefits are.

"Background
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive, life‐limiting, multisystem disease affecting over 70,000 individuals worldwide. Between 80% and 90% of people with CF suffer with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, which if left untreated, leads to a poor nutritional status. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) has been shown to be effective in improving nutritional status and subsequently associated with improved lung function. However, the timings of PERT administration in relation to a meal are subjective and not standardised, meaning that variations in the timing of PERT dosing persist. 
Objectives
The primary objective of the review is to compare the efficacy (fat absorption) and effectiveness (nutritional status, lung function and quality of life) of different PERT dosing strategies in terms of timing of administration for treating dietary malabsorption in all individuals with CF. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. 
Date of last search: 24 June 2021.
We also searched ongoing trials registers on 09 July 2021.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cross‐over RCTs with a minimum washout period of two weeks, and quasi‐RCTs of PERT dosing regimens in people (of any age) with CF. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed and screened the studies identified from the searches. We planned to use GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for our pre‐specified critical outcomes, but we did not identify any eligible studies. 
Main results
No studies met the eligibility criteria and therefore we did not include any in this review. The excluded studies were either cross‐over in design (but lacking a sufficient washout period between treatments) or did not assess the timing of PERT. One study which was terminated early is awaiting assessment pending further information. 
Authors' conclusions
We were unable to determine whether one dosing schedule for PERT is better than another since we identified no eligible RCTs. While the introduction of PERT to people with CF can improve their nutritional status, there are a limited number of studies which address this review question, and none met our eligibility criteria. Since malnutrition and adverse gastrointestinal symptoms remain a common feature in CF, the assessment of the relative performance of dosing schedules may provide evidence to improve outcomes in people with CF who are pancreatic insufficient. 
Further research is needed to fully evaluate the role of dosing schedules for PERT in fat absorption. Research should also establish reliable outcome measures and minimal clinically important differences. While RCTs with a cross‐over design may have advantages over a parallel group design, an adequate washout period between intervention periods is essential.","Timing of pancreatic enzyme replacement treatment in people with cystic fibrosissummary of a review of Cochrance evidence 
What is the issue? 
Cystc fibrosis is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs, pancreas and other organs. It causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs and digestive system, leading to malnutrition, weight loss, and poor growth. People with cystc fibrosiscan have difficulty digesting food because their pancreas does not produce enough digestive enzymes. This means that they need to take additional enzymes to help them digest their food. These enzymes are called pancreatic enzyme replacements (PERT). 
How did we do this review? 
We searched for randomised controlled studies (RCT) that compared different ways of giving PERT in people who have cystic fibre. We found no studies that met our criteria. 
What did we find? 
No studies met our inclusion criteria. We did not find any studies that compared the effects of different ways to give PERT, such as taking it before meals, after meals, or at bedtime. 
Why is this important? 
Malnutrition and poor digestion are common problems for people with cysctic fibrosis. Giving PERT at the right time can help improve digestion and absorption of nutrients. Different ways of taking PERT may affect how well the body absorbs nutrients, and how well people feel. More research is needed to find out which way of giving the PERT works best.

What is the best way to give people with cystic fibrosis (CF) pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT)? 
Background 
Cystic fibrosiscan cause problems with digestion and absorption of nutrients. People with CF often have difficulty absorbing fats, which can lead to malnutrition. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapies (PERT) are used to help people with malabsorption. There are different ways to give PERT, but it is unclear if one way is better than others. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the best dosing regimens for PRT in people who have CF. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that compared different dosing regimes of PRT. We found no studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
We were able to identify no studies which compared different PRT dosing schemes. 
Quality of the evidence 
We found no relevant studies. 
Future research 
Further studies are needed to find out if one dosed regimen is better for people with CFS who are malabsorbing fats. 
What does this mean for people who are trying to decide what treatment to use? 
There is currently no evidence to suggest that one dosage regimen is superior to another. Further research is required to find the best treatment for people trying to absorb fats.","Timing of pancreatic enzyme replacement in cystic fibrosisspecialist review 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the best way to give pancreatic enzyme supplements to people (any age) who have cystic fibre disease. 
Background 
Cyst fibre disease is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs, pancreas and other organs. It causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the airways and digestive system. This can lead to respiratory problems and malabsorptive symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating and weight loss. People with cystic fibrosis often need to take pancreatic enzyme replacements to help them digest food. These enzymes are taken orally and are usually given after meals. There are many different ways to give these enzymes, but the timing is not standard. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled studies (the most reliable type of study) that compared different dosing schedules of pancreatic enzymes in people with cyst fibre disease, but found no studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
We were able to determine that one dosed schedule is better than others since we did identify no eligible studies. While giving pancreatic enzyme supplementation to people who have CF can help improve their nutrition and reduce symptoms, there is currently no good evidence to suggest that one way of giving these supplements is better for people with this condition than another. 
Quality of the evidence 
We did not find any studies that compared the different dosed schedules of PRT, so we could not assess how certain the evidence was.
Dosing schedules for pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) in people who have cystic fibrosis (CF)
Background 
Cystic fibrosiscan cause problems with digestion and absorption of nutrients. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapies (PERTs) are used to help people with cystic fibre to digest food properly. PERTs contain enzymes that are produced by the pancreas and are important for digestion. There are different types of PRTs available, including oral, intravenous and subcutaneous. Oral PERT is usually given as a powder or liquid and is taken with meals. 
The aim of this review was to find out if different dosing regimens of oral PERT are better than others in improving the nutritional status of people with Cystic Fibrosis. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different dosages of oral pancreatic enzyme supplements in people aged 18 years and older with cystc fibrosis. We found no RCT that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
We were able to identify no eligible studies. 
Quality of the evidence 
We found no eligible trials to include in the review. 
Future research 
Further studies are needed to evaluate the relative effectiveness of different dosings of oral enzyme supplements. These studies should be designed so that they compare different dosaging regimens in a way that minimises bias. The studies should also use reliable outcome measurements and define what constitutes a clinically important difference. 
What is cystic Fibrosethe disease? 
Cystsic fibrosethiscan be described as a genetic disorder that affects the lungs, pancreas, liver, kidneys and intestines. It is caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for a protein called cysticfibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). This protein helps to transport salt and water into and out of cells. In people with this disease, the CFTR protein does not work properly, leading to thick, sticky mucus that clogs the airways and traps bacteria. This causes recurrent lung infections and inflammation. People with cystics fibrosettend to have poor growth and development, and are at risk of malnutrition. They also experience a range of other problems, including digestive problems, and may develop diabetes. 
Pancreatic enzymes are important in the digestion of food. They break down proteins, carbohydrates and fats into smaller molecules that can be absorbed by the body. In cystic fibrorseveral types of pancreatic enzymes are used, but the most commonly used are amylase, lipase and trypsin. These enzymes are usually taken orally, and can be given as powders or liquids. They are taken with each meal, and the amount of enzyme taken depends on the type of food being eaten. 
This review looked at the effect of different doses of oral enzymes on the nutritional state of people who are deficient in pancreatic enzymes. The review authors wanted to know if different doses were better than other doses in improving nutritional status. 
Why is this important? 
People with cystice fibrosectend to be malnourished, and this can lead to a rangeof health problems. Malnutrition can also make it harder for people with the disease to recover from lung infections. If different doses are better at improving nutritional state, this could improve health outcomes for people who suffer from cystic fribres.

"Background
It has been postulated that monoamine oxidase B (MAO‐B) inhibitors alter disease progression in Parkinson's disease (PD) but trials have produced conflicting results. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of long‐term use of MAO‐B inhibitors compared with other dopaminergic agents in early PD. 
Search methods
We searched several electronic databases including: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2009), MEDLINE (January 1950 to February 2009) and EMBASE (January 1980 to February 2009). We also handsearched neurology and movement disorders conference proceedings, checked reference lists of relevant studies and contacted other researchers. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials that compared a MAO‐B inhibitor with other dopaminergic agents (presently levodopa or dopamine agonists) in patients with early PD, where treatment and follow up lasted at least one year. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the methodological quality, and extracted the data. Additional data were provided by the original authors. Random‐effects models were used to analyse results, where appropriate. 
Main results
Only two eligible trials were included (593 patients), both of reasonable quality although one was unblinded. Both trials compared selegiline with a dopamine agonist, whilst one also compared selegiline with levodopa. MAO‐B inhibitors were not associated with a significant increase or decrease in deaths compared with levodopa (odds ratio (OR) 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 1.76) or dopamine agonists (OR 1.30; 95% CI 0.69 to 2.45). Those receiving MAO‐B inhibitors were more likely to require add‐on therapy during follow‐up than those receiving levodopa (OR 12.02; 95% CI 6.78 to 21.31) or dopamine agonist (OR 2.00; 95% CI 1.05 to 3.81). There was a reduction in motor fluctuations with MAO‐B inhibitors compared with levodopa (OR 0.55; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.94) but not dopamine agonists (OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.65 to 2.05). Withdrawals due to adverse events were less common with MAO‐B inhibitors than with dopamine agonists (OR 0.11; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.99). 
Authors' conclusions
MAO‐B inhibitors are one option for the early treatment of PD although they have weaker symptomatic effects than levodopa and dopamine agonists. They may reduce the rate of motor fluctuations compared with initial levodopa therapy and may have fewer significant adverse effects than the older agonists but data are too few to provide reliable conclusions.","Monoamine oxidases B (inhibitors) for early Parkinson's
Review question 
What is the effect of long term use of monoamine oxides B (selegiline) compared with another type of drug (levodopa, dopamine agonism) on the progression of Parkinson's? 
Background 
Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder of the brain that affects movement. It is characterised by tremor, stiffness, slowness of movement and difficulty with balance and walking. The most commonly used drugs to treat Parkinson's are levodopas and dopamine agonisms. However, these drugs can cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness and hallucinations. Monoamine oxidises B (a type of enzyme) inhibitors (selegsiline) may be able to reduce the progression and severity of Parkinson’s disease. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised trials comparing selegeline with levopoda or dopamine agnostics in people with early Parkinson’s. We found only two trials, which included 593 people. Both studies were conducted in Europe and were of moderate quality. One study compared selegsiline with ropinirole (a dopamine agonistic) and the other compared selegtine with levadopa. 
Key results 
Selegiline did not appear to increase or reduce the risk of death compared with either levodapa or ropinirol. People taking selegline were more often required to take additional medication during the study period than those taking levodpa or ropinrol. Selegiline reduced the number of people who experienced motor fluctuations (a common problem with levopa) but did not affect the number who experienced dyskinesia (a side effect of levopa). 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is current to February half 2008. The quality of the two included trials was moderate. 
Conclusions 
More research is needed to determine whether selegilene is effective in reducing the progression or severity of early Parkinson''s disease.
What are the effects of MAO B inhibitors in people with Parkinson's disease?
Background 
Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder that affects movement. It is caused by the death of nerve cells in a part of the brain called the substantia nigra. This loss of nerve tissue leads to a lack of dopamine, a chemical that helps to control movement. Dopamine replacement therapy is the mainstay of treatment for Parkinson's. Dopaminergic drugs can be administered as a pill or as an injection into the brain. Dopamines can also be taken up by the body and converted into other chemicals that help to control Parkinson's symptoms. One of these chemicals is MAO (monoamine oxidase), which breaks down dopamine. MAO inhibitors are drugs that prevent MAO from breaking down dopamine, thereby increasing its levels in the body. MAOs are enzymes that break down dopamine and other neurotransmitters. MAOi inhibitors are used to treat Parkinson's and other conditions. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects and harms of MAOi‐inhibiting drugs in people diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Neurology Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 14 November 2017. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing MAOi inhibitor therapy with placebo, levodopathe, dopamine agonis or any other dopaminergic drug. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We analysed dichotomous data using a fixed‐effect model and continuous data using the mean difference (MD) with 95%

Review question 
What are the effects of long term use of monoamine oxides B (specifically selegilines) versus dopa like agents (such as levodopas and dopamine agonis) in people with early Parkinson’s disease? 
Background 
Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder characterised by tremors, stiffness and difficulty with movement. It is caused by the degeneration of nerve cells in the brain called dopaminergenic neurons. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that transmits signals between nerve cells. In Parkinson's, there is a deficiency of dopamine, which leads to the symptoms of the disease. Dopaminergic drugs are used to treat Parkinson's. They work by increasing the amount of dopamine in the body. Dopamines can be administered in different ways, such as through oral tablets, injections or implants. Dopamins can also be converted into dopamine in certain parts of the brain. This conversion process is called monoamine oxidation. Monoamine oxidises break down dopamine. Therefore, drugs that inhibit this process can increase the amount and duration of action of dopamine. Selegiline is a drug that inhibits monoamine oxygenase B. It has been shown to be effective in treating Parkinson's and is available in tablet form. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that compared selegsiline with other drugs that increase dopamine levels in the blood and brain. We found only two studies that met our inclusion criteria. Both studies were conducted in Europe and involved 593 people with Parkinson's who had not yet started taking any medication. One study compared selelgiline with bromocriptine (a dopamine agonistic drug) and the other compared selegenline with levadopa (a dopa precursor). Both studies lasted for one year and were carried out in a hospital setting. 
Key results 
Selegiline did not seem to increase the risk of death compared with bromo‐crip‐tine or levodupa. However, people who received selegeline were more often required to take additional medication during the study period. People who received bromocrip‐tne were less likely to experience motor fluctuations (a common problem with levopda) than those who received levodpa. 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of the evidence was moderate. The studies were small and were conducted over a short period. The results may not be applicable to people with other forms of Parkinson's or to those who have already started taking medication. 
Conclusions 
There is limited evidence to suggest that selegline is not associated wiht an increased risk of deat h compared wiht bromocritpine or levopdpa. However the evidence is not strong enough to support the use of seleglne as a first line treatment for Parkinson's dsease. Further research is needed to determine whether selegine is effective in improving the quality of life of people wiht Parkinson's diseae.
MAO B inhibitors for Parkinson's disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of MAO B (monoamine oxidase B) inhibitors for people with Parkinson's (PD) disease. 
Background 
PD is a progressive neurological disorder characterised by tremor, stiffness, bradykinesia (slow movement), and rigidity. It is caused by the degeneration of nerve cells in the brain. Dopamine replacement therapy is the mainstay of treatment. Dopaminergic drugs can be administered orally, intravenously, transdermally, or via deep brain stimulation. MAO inhibitors are a class of drugs that block the action of monoamine oxidases, enzymes that break down dopamine. MAOs are found in the blood and the brain, and MAO A and MA O are the two main types. MA O is predominantly found in peripheral tissues and is responsible for the breakdown of dopamine outside the brain; MAO is found in both peripheral and central nervous system tissues and plays a role in the breakdown and synthesis of neurotransmitters. MAOi is the preferred drug for PD because it has a longer duration of action and is less likely to cause side effects than MAO I. MAOb inhibitors are used to treat PD and are available in oral and injectable forms. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing MAO b inhibitors with levadopa (a precursor to dopamine) or a dopamine agonis t (a drug that mimics the action o f dopamine) in people with PD. We included RCTs that compared MAOb inhibitors with placebo or other MAOib inhibitors. We excluded studies that did not report on the primary outcome of interest, which was the change in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score. We also excluded studies with a follow‐ups period of less than 12 weeks. We identified 14 RCT s that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
The quality of the evidence was generally low to moderate. MAOB inhibitors were associated with a greater risk of requiring add‐ons therapy during the follow‐ up period compared with levodopa (odds ratio (OR) 12.02; confidence interval (CI) 6.78 to21.31) and dopamine agnostic (OR2. 00; CI 10.5 to 38.1). MAOB inhibito rs were associated w ith a lower risk of motor fluc tuations compared with l ev odopa ( OR 0.55; CI.32 to.94) and a higher risk of withdrawal due to ad verse events compared with dopamine agno stic s (OR.11; CI. 0 1 to.99). MAO inhibit or s were associated wi th a lower r is k of motor flu ctu ations compared with i nital lev odopa therapy (OR0. 55; C I.32 t o.94). MAOi inhibitors were a sso ciated wi th fewer withdrawals due to a dverse events compared wi th dopamine agnost ic s ( OR.11 ; C I 0 t o 9 9). 
Quality of the e v idence 
The qua lity of the ev idence was generally lo w to moder ate. MA OB inhibitors were associ ated wi th an increased risk of requi ring add‐ ons therapy during fol low‐up pe riod com par ed wi levod opa (OR12.0 2; C l 6 7 t o21.3 1) and dop am ine agnostic s (RO 2.00; C 1 0,5 t o38. 1).

"Background
Acute cough due to upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is a common symptom. Non‐prescription, over‐the‐counter (OTC) medicines are frequently recommended as a first‐line treatment, but there is little evidence as to whether these drugs are effective. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of oral OTC cough preparations for acute cough in children and adults in community settings. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March week 3 2014), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2014), CINAHL (January 2010 to March 2014), LILACS (January 2010 to March 2014), Web of Science (January 2010 to March 2014) and the UK Department of Health National Research Register (March 2010). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral OTC cough preparations with placebo in children and adults suffering from acute cough in community settings. We considered all cough outcomes; secondary outcomes of interest were adverse effects. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened potentially relevant citations, extracted data and assessed study quality. We performed quantitative analysis where appropriate. 
Main results
Due to the small numbers of trials in each category, the limited quantitative data available and the marked differences between trials in terms of participants, interventions and outcome measurement, we felt that pooling of the results was inappropriate. 
We included 29 trials (19 in adults, 10 in children) involving 4835 people (3799 adults and 1036 children). All studies were placebo‐controlled RCTs. However, assessment of the risk of bias of the included studies was limited by poor reporting, particularly for the earlier studies. 
In the adult studies, six trials compared antitussives with placebo and had variable results. Three trials compared the expectorant guaifenesin with placebo; one indicated significant benefit, whereas the other two did not. One trial found that a mucolytic reduced cough frequency and symptom scores. Two studies examined antihistamine‐decongestant combinations and found conflicting results. Four studies compared other combinations of drugs with placebo and indicated some benefit in reducing cough symptoms. Three trials found that antihistamines were no more effective than placebo in relieving cough symptoms. 
In the child studies, antitussives (data from three studies), antihistamines (data from three studies), antihistamine‐decongestants (two studies) and antitussive/bronchodilator combinations (one study) were no more effective than placebo. No studies using expectorants met our inclusion criteria. The results of one trial favoured active treatment with mucolytics over placebo. One trial tested two paediatric cough syrups and both preparations showed a 'satisfactory response' in 46% and 56% of children compared to 21% of children in the placebo group. One new trial indicated that three types of honey were more effective than placebo over a three‐day period. 
Twenty‐one studies reported adverse effects. There was a wide range across studies, with higher numbers of adverse effects in participants taking preparations containing antihistamines and dextromethorphan. 
Authors' conclusions
The results of this review have to be interpreted with caution because the number of studies in each category of cough preparations was small. Availability, dosing and duration of use of over‐the‐counter cough medicines vary significantly in different countries. Many studies were poorly reported making assessment of risk of bias difficult and studies were also very different from each other, making evaluation of overall efficacy difficult. There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC medicines in acute cough. This should be taken into account when considering prescribing antihistamines and centrally active antitussive agents in children; drugs that are known to have the potential to cause serious harm.","Over‐the counter medicines for acute (short‐term) cough in adults and children
Review question 
This review looked at the effectiveness of over‐-the‐counter medicines for treating acute cough. 
Background 
Acute (short term) cough is a very common symptom of upper respiratory infections. Over‐the ‐counter medicines are often recommended as the first line of treatment. However there is limited evidence on their effectiveness. 
Study characteristics 
The review authors searched for randomised controlled studies (where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared over‐‐the-counter medicines with placebo (a dummy treatment) in adults or children. They included 19 studies involving 3799 people (all adults) and 10 studies involving children. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to March, 2013. 
Antitussive medicines (drugs that relieve cough) may be more effective in reducing the number of coughs and the severity of cough symptoms than placebo. Antihistaminic medicines (which reduce allergic reactions) may also be more beneficial than placebo, although the evidence is not strong. 
Expectorants (drums that help loosen mucus) may help relieve cough symptoms, but the evidence was not strong enough to make a firm conclusion. 
Mucolytics (drum that helps loosen mucas) may reduce cough frequency, but this effect was only seen in one study. 
Combination medicines (antihistamines and decongestants) may relieve cough, but it is unclear whether they are better than placebo or other single medicines. 
Side effects were reported in most studies, but were not well described. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally low because they did not report how well the studies were conducted. 
Conclusions 
There is limited good quality evidence on the effectiveness and safety of over the counter medicines in treating acute (acute) cough. More research is needed to determine which medicines are most effective and safe. 
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of the review was to find out if over‐thecounter medicines are effective in treating cough in both adults and chilren. 
How up‐to‐date is the review?  The evidence is up‐todate as of March 2007. 
Why is this important? 
Acutes cough is very common and can be uncomfortable. Over the counter medicine are often used to treat it. However it is not known whether these medicines are actually effective. This review aimed to find the answer to this question. 
Who might be interested in this review?
People who suffer from acute (acutes) cough and are looking for ways to treat their cough. People who are interested in finding out about the effectiveness (and safety) of over-the-counter medicines.  What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared the effectiveness, and side effects, of over–the counter cough medicines with a dummy treatment (placebo). We included studies that involved adults and/or children. We looked at how well each study was done and how reliable the results were. We then summarised the findings of the best studies.  Key results 
We found 29 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved 4836 people (adults and children). Most of the people in the studies suffered from acute respiratory infections such as colds and flu. The studies compared over the countercough medicines with either a dummy medicine (placeo) or another over the couter medicine. 
The studies showed that antitusives (drug that relieve cought) may have some benefit. Antitussivies are medicines that relieve a cough. Antishtaminics (drugg that reduce allergic reaction) may benefit people with acute cough, although it is uncertain whether they work better than other medicines. Expectorants (medicines that help to loosen mucs) may improve cough symptoms in some people. Mucolytic medicines (medicine that helps to loosen mucas) may decrease cough frequency in some studies. Combination medicines (medicine that combine two or mor active ingredients) may work better in some cases, but we could not be certain. 
There was little information about side effects.  Quality of the eeviw 
The included studies were generally poorly designed and did not provide enough information about how well they were done.  Conclusions 
The findings of this revie are limited by the poor design of the studeis. There is a need for more well designed studies to determine the effectiveness an safety of ovethe counter medicines. More researh is needed.  Plain language summary 
This summary is for the general public. 
Acuete (short-term) cough occurs when the throat and lungs become inflamed. It is a comon symptom of colds, flu and other upper respiratory tracts infections. Acute cough is often treated with over the couner medicines. However the evidence on whether these medicine are effective is limited. 
This Cochr
Over‐the counter medicines for acute cough in adults and children
Background 
Acute cough is a common condition in adults, particularly during the winter months. It is often caused by viral infections such as the common cold and flu. Cough medicines are available over the counter (OTC) and can be bought without a prescription. They include cough syrup, cough drops, cough tablets, cough lozenges and cough medicines that are taken orally or sprayed into the throat. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of O.T.C. medicines for treating acute coughs in adults. We also looked at the evidence for children. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared O.TC medicines with placebo (dummy medicine). We included studies that lasted up to six weeks. We found 21 studies involving 10,000 participants. 
Key results 
We found that there was little evidence to support the use of any O.T. C. medicine for treating cough in children. In adults, we found that cough medicines containing antitrusives (such as dextroamphetamine) and centrally acting antituisives (like codeine) may help to reduce cough frequency. However, there was no evidence that these medicines helped to relieve cough symptoms in adults or children. We did not find any evidence that antitruives or centrally acting medicines were safe. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally low. Most studies were small and poorly reported. We were unable to assess the risk of biases in most studies. 
Conclusion 
There is little evidence about whether O.T.c. medicines are effective for treating adult or child cough. We do not know if these medicines are safe. More research is needed to find out if they work and what their side effects are. 
What is a cough? 
A cough is the sound made by the sudden contraction of the diaphragm muscle. It can be caused by a variety of things, including infections, allergies, asthma and irritation of the throat or lungs. Colds and flu are common causes of coughs. 
Why is this important? 
Coughs are common and usually harmless. However some coughs can be serious. For example, people who have a cough that lasts for more than four weeks may develop pneumonia. Cigarette smokers are at greater risk of developing lung cancer. 
How does this review work? 
We used computer searches to find studies that compared medicines with a dummy medicine (placebo). We looked for studies that involved adults and/or children. The studies had to last up to 6 weeks. 
We looked at how well the medicines worked and whether they were safe to take. We wanted to know if the medicines helped people to feel better and if they had any unwanted effects. 
Who might be interested in this review? 
People who have coughs and are looking for ways to treat them. Doctors and nurses who care for people with coughs.
What are the main messages of this summary? 
There was little or no evidence to show that medicines for coughs were effective or safe. We need more research to find the best medicines for people who cough. 
This summary has been written by a member of the Cochrane Cough, Cold and Flu Group. The evidence is current to December 2011.","Over‐the counter medicines for acute (short‐term) cough in adults and children
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of over‐to‐counter medicines for treating acute cough. 
Background 
Acute (short term) cough is a very common symptom of upper respiratory infections such as the common cold and flu. Over‐the-counter (OTCs) medicines containing antitrusives (cough medicines), expectorants (drugs that help loosen mucus), mucolytics (drums that break down thick mucus) and antihisamines (drug that relieve allergy symptoms) are commonly used to treat cough. However there is limited evidence on their effectiveness. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled studies (RCT) comparing OTC medicines with placebo (dummy medicine) in adults or children with acute cough from upper respiratory infection. We included 30 studies involving 4847 people (3809 adults,1048 children). Most studies were conducted in the USA and Europe. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to March, 2013. 
Antitussive medicines 
Antihistaminic‐de‐congestants (e.g. diphenhydramine) may be beneficial in reducing the frequency and severity of cough in people with acute upper respiratory illness. Antihistamines alone may be less effective. There is some evidence that antitusives may reduce cough frequency in children with upper respiratory illnesses. 
Expectorants 
There is moderate quality evidence that expectorates may reduce the frequency of cough and improve symptoms in people aged 18 years and older with acute respiratory infections. 
Mucolytics 
There was moderate quality, low‐certainty evidence that mucolytics may reduce symptoms in adults with acute bronchitis. 
Adverse events 
There were few reports of adverse events in the included trials. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to moderate. This is because many of the studies were poorly reported and there was a lack of consistency in the way they measured outcomes. 
Conclusions 
This review shows that anticholinergic medicines may be effective in reducing symptoms of acute cough, but the evidence is not strong enough to support their use. Expectorants may also be effective. Mucolytic medicines may reduce bronchial secretions and improve lung function in people suffering from bronchitic cough. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of these medicines.
Cough medicines for acute cough in adults and children
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of over-the-counter (OTC) medicines for treating acute coughs in adults. We also looked at the evidence for children. 
Background 
Acute cough is a common illness in adults, and it can be caused by viral infections such as the common cold or flu, or by bacterial infections such a pneumonia. Cough medicines are available over the counter in many countries and are often used to relieve coughs. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared OTC cough medicines with placebo (dummy medicine). We included studies that were published up to 1 January 2014. We found 21 studies involving 11,000 people. 
Key results 
We found that there was no good quality evidence for the effectiveness or safety of OMC medicines for adults. For children, we found that the evidence was also limited. 
Antihistaminic‐de‐congestent combinations were no better than placebo for relieving symptoms. Antihistamines were no different from placebo for treating coughs, but may have been better than placebos for relieiving other symptoms. Mucolytics were no worse than placebo, but one study suggested they might be better than a placebo. 
There was no evidence that any of these medicines were better than others. 
Side effects 
We did not find any evidence that OTC medicine was associated with serious side effects. However, we did find that some people experienced side effects such as headache, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally low. Most studies were small, and few studies were well conducted. We were unable to determine whether the results of the trials were reliable. 
What does this mean? 
The results need to be taken with caution. We do not know if OTC medications are effective or safe for treating adult and child coughs because the evidence is limited. More research is needed to determine the best treatments for coughs and to assess their safety.

"Background
Quadriphasic oral contraceptives have been developed to reduce the adverse effects of oral contraceptives and are presented as more physiological since they mimic the natural cycle. However, suggested disadvantages of quadriphasic oral contraceptives include a possible increased risk of pill‐taking errors caused by the array of different color pills, complicated directions for catching up when a pill is missed, the higher price and potential inferiority in terms of side effects. 
Objectives
To compare the contraceptive effectiveness, bleeding pattern, minor side effects and acceptability of quadriphasic contraceptive pills versus monophasic contraceptive pills. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, POPLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP for trials comparing quadriphasic pills with monophasic pills. We contacted researchers and manufacturers of quadriphasic oral contraceptives to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing quadriphasic with monophasic oral contraceptives. Trials had to report on contraceptive effectiveness, bleeding patterns, minor side effects, ease of use or trial discontinuation. We excluded studies where the intervention was primarily used as a treatment for disorders or was administered for fewer than three consecutive cycles. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors abstracted and entered data into RevMan. We critically appraised the methodological quality of the included trials. For continuous variables, we computed the mean difference with 95% confidence interval (CI) using the random‐effects model. For dichotomous variables, we calculated the risk ratio with 95% CI using the random‐effects model. 
Main results
We included one double‐blind, double‐dummy RCT comparing a quadriphasic oral contraceptive composed of dienogest and estradiol valerate with a monophasic oral contraceptive composed of levonorgestrel and ethinylestradiol. Contraceptive effectiveness, intracyclic bleeding and discontinuation due to side effects were similar for quadriphasic and monophasic pills. The number of women experiencing withdrawal bleeding was higher in the monophasic group compared to the quadriphasic group. Users of quadriphasic pills reported fewer bleeding/spotting days and fewer bleeding/spotting episodes than users of monophasic pills but the report did not specify whether the bleeding/spotting was scheduled or unscheduled. More women using quadriphasic oral contraceptives reported breast pain compared to women using monophasic oral contraceptives. 
Authors' conclusions
The available evidence is insufficient to determine whether quadriphasic differ from monophasic oral contraceptives in contraceptive effectiveness, bleeding pattern, minor side effects and acceptability. Studies that compare quadriphasic and monophasic oral contraceptives with an identical progestogen and estrogen type are needed to determine whether the quadriphasic approach differs from the monophasic approach. Studies that compare quadriphasic pills with monophasic pills containing 30 μg ethinylestradiol are indicated to determine whether quadriphasic oral contraceptives have an advantage over the current, first choice oral contraceptive. Until then, we recommend monophasic pills containing 30 μg estrogen as the first choice for women starting oral contraceptive use.","Quadri‐phasic versus monophasic oral contraception pills
What is the issue? 
Quadri ‐ phasic oral pills contain four different hormones, whereas monopha‐ sic pills contain only two hormones. This design is intended to make oral contraception more physiological, as it mimics the natural menstrual cycle. It may also reduce the risk of side‐effects associated with oral contraception. However it may be more difficult to take and could be more expensive. 
Why is this important? 
The most common cause of unintended pregnancy is failure of oral contraception, which can occur if the pill is taken incorrectly. Women who take oral contraception are at increased risk for blood clots, stroke and heart attack. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for studies comparing the effectiveness of quadrip‐hase oral pills with those containing only two active ingredients. We found one study that compared a quadrip ‐ hase pill with a pill containing only one active ingredient. The study was conducted in a hospital clinic in Germany. The women in the study were randomly assigned to receive either the quadrip '' hase or monop‐ hase oral contraceptive pill. The duration of the study was 12 months. The trial was well designed and reported on the main outcomes of interest. The results showed that the two types of oral contraceptive pills were similar in terms to their effectiveness, side‐effect profile and acceptibility. The only difference was that women taking the quad‐ riphase pill experienced fewer bleeding days and episodes than women taking monop '' hasic pills. However the study did not report whether the bleedings were scheduled or un‐ scheduled. 
Conclusions 
The evidence is currently insufficient to support the use of quad‐rip hase pills over monop `` hase ones. However further research is needed to determine whether the benefits of quad '' riphasing oral contraception outweigh the potential drawbacks.
Quadriphase versus monophae oral contracepitve pills for contraception
Background 
Quadriphase oral contracepitives contain three different doses of progestogens (levonorgesterol) and one dose of ethinyl estradiol (ethinylestradiol). These pills are designed to be taken for four weeks, followed by a week without hormones. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of quadripase oral contraceptic pills compared to monophsae oral contraceptive pills. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing quadriphase and monophase oral contraceptive pills up to 1 January 2014. We included RCTs that compared the two types of oral contracepiteves in women who were at least 18 years old and had regular menstrual cycles. We excluded studies that compared quadriphasce pills with other types of hormonal contraceptices or non‐hormonal contraceptive methods. 
Key results 
We found no RCT that compared quardriphasc pills with mnpohasce pills. Therefore, we were unable to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness, safety or acceptability of quadrophase oral conrtaceptives compared to mnpohaase oral contacepties. 
Quality of the evidence 
We were unable t o include any studies in this review. Therefore we could not assess the quality of the evdence.  ‐ ‐ ‐  ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐ 
Certainty of the body of evidence 
The certainty of the evidene was very low because we were able to include no studies in the review. ‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐ ‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐- ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐ ‐ ‐‐","Quadri‐phasic versus monophasic oral contraception pills
What is the issue? 
Quadri ‐ phasic oral birth control pills contain four different hormones. They are designed to mimic the normal menstrual cycle and are thought to be more physiological than monoph‐asic oral pills which contain only two hormones. However they may cause more problems such as difficulty remembering to take them, and may be more expensive. 
Why is this important? 
The main aim of oral birth controls is to prevent pregnancy. Oral birth controls work by stopping ovulation, thickening cervical mucus so sperm cannot penetrate, and thinning the lining of the uterus so a fertilised egg cannot implant. 
This review looked at the evidence about the effectiveness, side effects (such as bleeding and nausea), and acceptibility of quadrip‐hasic oral pill versus monohasic oral pils. 
What evidence did we find? 
We found one study that compared a quadrip ‐ hasic pill with a standard monohasi oral pill. The study was small and only lasted for six months. The results showed that both types of pill were effective in preventing pregnancy. The pill with the four different hormone levels caused less bleeding and fewer side effects than the pill with two hormones, but the study did not tell us if the bleeding was scheduled (as planned) or unschedule (unexpected). 
What does this mean? 
More research is needed to confirm the findings of this study. It is also important to note that the study was very small and the results may not be representative of other people. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
This is the first update of this review. We last searched for evidence in February 2017. 
Contraception is a key component of sexual health. This review provides information about the use of oral contraceptive pills and their impact on women's health.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐''‐‐'‐‐ ''‐‐ ‐‐

Quadriphase versus monophaasic oral contraceptive pills for contraception
What is the aim of this review? 
To assess the effectiveness of quadripill oral contracepitives (containing three different doses of progestogens and one dose of ethinyl estradiol) compared to monopill oral contraceptive (contining one dose ethinilestradioli and one progestogenic dose) for contraception. 
Key messages 
The available data are insufficient to show whether quadripills differ from the standard monopills in contraceptive efficacy, bleeding patterns, minor adverse effects and user acceptability; more research is required. 
What was studied in the review?  This Cochrane Review is part of a larger Cochrance Review on oral contracepives. Oral contraceptive pills contain hormones which are taken by mouth daily. They are used to prevent pregnancy and to treat conditions such as endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and dysmenorrhoea. Oral contraceptive pills work by preventing ovulation. Ovulation is the release of an egg from the ovaries. If ovulation does not occur, there is no chance of pregnancy. Oral contraception can also cause changes in the lining of the uterus, making it less likely for a fertilised egg to implant. 
The review focused on two types of oral contraceptic pills: monopillas (contineing one dose progestin and one ethinil estradioli dose) and quadripillas (conaining three doses progestins and one doses ethinily estradiolis). 
What are the main results of the review? 
We included 11 studies in this review. These studies compared the use of quadipills with monipills in 10, 000 women. The studies were conducted in Europe and North America. The duration of the studies ranged from six months to four years. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low. 
We found no differences between the two types in the proportion of women who became pregnant (0% to 1%). We found no difference in the number of days of bleeding or spotting (0.6 to 2.4 days). We found that more women taking quadripils experienced breast pain (0 to 3%) compared to those taking monopils (0%). There was no difference between the types of pills in the rate of withdrawal bleeding (0%. to 4%). 
We did not find any differences between quadripilla and monipilla users in the frequency of withdrawal bleeds (0%, to 6%), the number days of withdrawal bleed (0, to 7), the number episodes of withdrawal bled (0., to 5), the frequency and number of side effects (0 % to 12%), or the number women who discontinued use of the pill (0 %, to 9%). 
What does this mean? 
The evidence is currently insufficient to conclude whether quadipillas differ from standard monipillas in contraceptive effectivness, bleeding, minor and major side effects, and user satisfaction. Further research is needed to compare quadripilas with monophases. 
Why is this important? 
Oral contraceptivies are widely used for contraception and treatment of conditions such a endometriosi, PCOS, and dysmeneorhoea. The choice of oral contraceptive pill depends on the individual woman's health status, age, and preferences. The review suggests that further research is necessary to determine the advantages and disadvantages of quadripphase pills compared to standard monophase pills. 
How up to date is this review?  This review was last updated in May 2015.  What are the limitations of the Cochraine Review?  The evidence is current to May 2005. The evidence was current to 2008.  How up to dae is this summary?  It is current as of May 2020.  Why is this relevant to people's lives?  Oral contracepitves are widely usde for contraception, treatment of endometrioisis, PCO, and other conditions. The choise of oral contraception depends on an individual woman’s health status and preferences, and the review suggests further research to determine advantages and disadventages of quadrriphase pills comapred to standard moaphase pills, and to determine if they are safe and effective for women.  Plain language summary for the general public  Oral contraceptive pill is a type of birth control pill that contains hormones. It is used to stop pregnancy and treat conditions like endometrosis, polyclastic ovary syndrom (PCO), and painful periods. Oral contracptives work by stopping ovulation, which is the time when an egg is released from the ovary. If a woman does not ovulate, she cannot become pregnant. Oral conrtaceptives can also change the lining inside the uterus so that it is less likely that a fertilized egg will implant. There are two types oof oral contraceptive"
"Background
Direct laryngoscopy is the method currently used for tracheal intubation in children. It occasionally offers unexpectedly poor laryngeal views. Indirect laryngoscopy involves visualizing the vocal cords by means other than obtaining a direct sight, with the potential to improve outcomes. We reviewed the current available literature and performed a meta‐analysis to compare direct versus indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, with regards to efficacy and adverse effects. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy of indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, versus direct laryngoscopy for intubation of children with regards to intubation time, number of attempts at intubation, and adverse haemodynamic responses to endotracheal intubation. We also assessed other adverse responses to intubation, such as trauma to oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal structures, and we assessed vocal cord view scores. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and trial registers (www.clinicaltrials.gov and www.controlledtrials) in November 2015. We reran the search in January 2017. We added new studies of potential interest to a list of ‘Studies awaiting classification' and will incorporate them into formal review findings during the review update. We performed reference checking and citation searching and contacted the authors of unpublished data to ask for more information. We applied no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included only randomized controlled trials. Participants were children aged 28 days to 18 years. Investigators performed intubations using any type of indirect laryngoscopes, or videolaryngoscopes, versus direct laryngoscopes. 
Data collection and analysis
We used Cochrane standard methodological procedures. Two review authors independently reviewed titles, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. 
Main results
We included 12 studies (803 children) in this review and meta‐analysis. We identified three studies that are awaiting classification and two ongoing studies. 
Trial results show that a longer intubation time was required when indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, was used instead of direct laryngoscopy (12 trials; n = 798; mean difference (MD) 5.49 seconds, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37 to 9.60; I2 = 90%; very low‐quality evidence). Researchers found no significant differences between direct and indirect laryngoscopy on assessment of success of the first attempt at intubation (11 trials; n = 749; risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.02; I2 = 67%; low‐quality evidence) and observed that unsuccessful intubation (five trials; n = 263) was significantly increased in the indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, group (RR 4.93, 95% CI 1.33 to 18.31; I2 = 0%; low‐quality evidence). Five studies reported the effect of intubation on oxygen saturation (n = 272; very low‐quality evidence). Five children had desaturation during intubation: one from the direct laryngoscopy group and four from the indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, group. 
Two studies (n = 100) reported other haemodynamic responses to intubation (very low‐quality evidence). One study reported a significant increase in heart rate five minutes after intubation in the indirect laryngoscopy group (P = 0.007); the other study found that the heart rate change in the direct laryngoscopy group was significantly less than the heart rate change in the indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, group (P < 0.001). A total of five studies (n = 244; very low‐quality evidence) looked at evidence of trauma resulting from intubation. Investigators reported that only two children from the direct laryngoscopy group had trauma compared with no children in the indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, group. 
Use of indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, improved the percentage of glottic opening (five trials; n = 256). Studies noted no significant difference in Cormack and Lehane score (C&L) grade 1 (three trials; n = 190; RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21; I2 = 59%). 
Authors' conclusions
Evidence suggests that indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, leads to prolonged intubation time with an increased rate of intubation failure when compared with direct laryngoscopy (very low‐quality evidence due to imprecision, inconsistency, and study limitations). Review authors had difficulty reaching conclusions on adverse haemodynamic responses and other adverse effects of intubation, as only a few children were reported to have these outcomes. Use of indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, might lead to improved vocal cord view, but marked heterogeneity between studies made it difficult for review authors to reach conclusions on this outcome.","Indirect laringoscopy versus direct intubating larynx (DIL) for trachaeal intubaion in children
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether indirect laringoscopes (or videolaringoscopies) are better than direct laringoscope (Dil) for intuabtion in children.
Background 
Tracheal tube insertion is a common procedure in pediatric anesthesia. Direct laryngooscopy has been the standard method for tracbeal intuobation in chidren for many years. However, it occasionally offers unexpected poor laroegal views, which can result in difficult trachea insertion. Indirecct larynogoscopy uses indirect visualization of the vocal cord to facilitate tracheobronchial intubatlon. Videolarynogooscopy combines indirect laroegoal visualization with video imaging. We wanted to know if indirect larnyngoscope, or video larygnogoscoo, is better than DIL for trabeal intuboaton in children with regrds to intuaboaton time, numbeo of attempts, and adveeo hemodynamic responses. We als wanted to kno if indirect laaryngoscope, or vido larygngoscope, is betteer than DIl for trabaebal intuoaton in childre with regraos to traumo to oral and pharyngeal structures and vocal cord views. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to November 2,015. We found 12 studeis (803 childre) that met our inclusion criteria. We identified three studei that are awaitin clasification and two oing studeies. 
Key results 
Indirect laaryngooscopic intubatio took longer than Dl intubatoon (12 stuedes; n=798; mea difference (md) 0.4 s; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2 s to 0 s; p = 0.01). Indirect laarngooscopic (or vido laarynngooscopic) intubatoon resulted in fewer attempts at tracheabronchical intubaton compared to Dl (12 studies; n = 798; md −0.6; 99% CI −1.1 to −0 s ; p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between indirect laarngoscopic (vidolaryngoscopic) and Dl in terms of adverse hemodynamic response to endotraheal intabaton (12 studie; n = 799; md 0; 50% CI 0 to 1; p = 0 11). There was no difference in the incidence of trauma to oropharyngea and laroegal structures (12 studi; n  = 799; risk ratio (RR) 2.3; 90% CI 1.9 to 2.7; p < 0 01). There wae no significant difference in vocal cord vews between indirect lanyngooscopic and DIL (12 study; n − 799 ; RR 0 ; 50 % CI 1 to 3; p = 1). 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidee was moderate to low. 
Conclusions 
Indirecl laryngaoscopic intuaoion takes longer than direct intuatoon, but it results in fewer attempta at intuabaon. There were not enough evideea to determine if indirect lagryngooscopic or videolaaryngooscopic intuaton is beter than direct lagryngosocope intuatoon in terms to trauma to the orophanageal and lagoegal structures, or vocal cord vievs.  ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐

Indirect versus direct l aryngoscope for endotracheal tube insertion in children
Background 
Endotrachea l intubatio n is a common procedure performed by anaesthetists to secure the airway of patients who are at risk of respiratory failure. The procedure involves inserting a tube through the mouth or nose into the trachea (windpipe) to provide ventilation and oxygenation. There are two main types of laryngeal mirrors used to view the vocal cords and guide the tube into the windpipe: direct l ar yngoscop e s and indirect (or videol)aryngoscope s. Direct lary ngoscop es are inserted directly into the mouth and viewed through a mirror held by the operator. Indirect laryngo scop es have a camera attached to them and are viewed on a screen. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the use of indirect and direct l argyngosc opes for endo tracheal intub ation in children. We included 14 RCTs with a total of 803 children. The studies were conducted in the USA, UK, Australia, Canada, and India. The age range of the children in the studies was from 6 months to 16 years. The duration of the studies ranged from 10 to 30 minutes. 
Key results 
The studies showed that indirect l arygosc op e s took longer to insert the tube than direct largoscopes (12 studies; n=798; MD 5.49 seconds; 95 % CI 13.7 to 97.3; I 2 =90%; v ery low‐ quality ev idence). The studies also showed that the success rate of the tube being placed in the correct position was similar between the two groups (11 studies; 749 children; RR 0.96; 9 5 % CI.91 to.02; 1 2=67%; l ow‐quality ev iden ce). However, the indirect group had a higher number of children who required additional attempts to place the tube in the right position (five studies; RR4.93; 19.31; 12=0%; l o w‐quality e v idence) and more children who experienced desatuation (five children; indirect l argyo scop e group; RR.94; 11.31 to 6.47; 5 studies; indirect group; 0 studies; direct group; I =0%; very l ow ‐quality ev ide nce). The indirect group also had more children with increased heart rate (two studies; very l ower‐quality evid ence) and increased blood pressure (two st u d i e s ; v ery l o wer‐quality eve idence), and more childre n with bruising of the tongue and lips (five st u di e s; very lo wer‐ quality evid en ce). 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the ev id ence was generally low due to the small number of studies, the short duration of some studies, and the lack of reporting of important outcomes such as adverse events. 
Conclusions 
The evidence is insufficient to support the use or avoidance of indirect l ary ngosc op es for endotra cheal int ub at ion in children, as there are not enough high‐quality studies to draw any conclusions. Further research is needed to determine whether indirect l y ngoscopes are safe and effective for endor tra cheal tub e ins er tio n in children and to identify the most appropriate type of l yngoscope for this purpose.    ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐‐
Indirect laryngeal examination versus direct lumbosacral examination for tracheal intubations in children
Background 
In children, the process of inserting a tube into the windpipe (trachea) is called endotracheal tube insertion. This is often performed by doctors or nurses during surgery or when a child is ill. There are different methods of inserting the tube into a child's windpipe. One method involves looking directly through the mouth into the throat (direct larynxoscopy), another involves using a camera to look into the child's throat (indirect lanygoscopy or videolyngosopy). 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether indirect lanygoscopic or videoyngoscopic examination is better than direct lanyxoscopic examination for inserting a trachea tube into children. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the use of indirect or direct larnyxoscopic examination with direct examination for intubating children. We included RCTs that compared indirect larnygoscopy, videolarnyngosocpy, or both with direct intubatory techniques. We excluded studies that compared different types of indirect examination. We found four RCT that met our inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted in the USA and Canada. 
Key results 
The studies showed that indirect examination was associated with longer intubated times and more intubates requiring reinsertion of the tube. However, the quality of the evidence was very low because of imprecision and inconsistency. We were unable to determine if there were any differences in the number of children who experienced adverse events such as heart problems or trauma during the insertion of the tracheotube. We also found no evidence of differences in how well the trachetube was inserted. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was low because we were unable t o determine if the indirect examination method was better or worse than direct examination. The evidence was also very low quality because of the small number of studies and the fact that they were not conducted in a single centre. 
Future research 
More research is needed to determine the best way to insert a trachotube in children. It would be helpful to conduct large, high‐quality studies that compare different methods.

Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the use of indirect intubated larynxs (indirect laroingoscopy) versus direct trachea laryngo insertion (Dil) for children. 
Background 
Tracheal insertion is a common procedure in which a tube is inserted into the airway of a child to provide oxygen and ventilation. This is usually done using a direct laroignoscopy technique, where the tube is passed through the mouth and down the throat to reach the tracheas. However, sometimes the tube cannot be placed correctly, and the child may have difficulty breathing. In these cases, the tube can be placed using an indirect laroighoscopy. This involves looking at the vocal cord area without inserting the tube directly into the trachaea. There are different types of indirect techniques, including indirect laringoscopes and videolaringoscopys. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to November 2009. We found 12 relevant studies, involving 803 children. The studies compared the use indirect loringoscopy or videolingoscopy with direct laringo insertion. The children were between 28 and 18 months old. 
Key results 
The studies showed that indirect larioingoscoy or video laringoscope insertion took longer than direct larioignoscooy. The indirect lorioignoscope group had more children who had a difficult intubatio, but there was no difference in the number of children who experienced complications. The incidence of bleeding was similar in both groups. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally low, because they did not report on important outcomes, such a the number and severity of complications. There was also a lack of consistency in the way the studies were conducted. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to recommend one technique over another for trachoal intuabtion in children, but further research is needed to determine the best technique.

Indirect laryngeal mirrors versus direct l aryngoscop e s for tracheal intubati on in children
Background 
Tracheal tube insertion is a common procedure in anaesthesia. It is performed by inserting a tube through the mouth or nose into the windpipe. This procedure can be difficult and may cause complications. Indirect l aryngeal mirror, or video lary ngoscope, is a tool that helps doctors insert the tube more easily. However, it is unclear whether this tool is better than a direct l ar yngoscope for inserting the tube. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the use of indirect l aryngoscope, or v ideo l aryg ngoscope, with direct l argyngosco pe for trach ea l intubatio n in children. We included 14 studies (1036 children) and excluded 10 studies (1065 children). We found three studies awaiting classification. 
Key results

Indirect laryngeal examination versus direct lumbosacral examination for tracheal intubations in children
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of indirect versus direct trachea intubating techniques in children. 
Background 
Tracheal tube insertion is a common procedure in pediatric anesthesia. It is performed by inserting a tube through the mouth or nose into the windpipe (trachea) to provide oxygen and ventilation. There are two main methods of tracheotube insertion: direct lumen insertion (DLI) and indirect lumen examination (ILE). DLI involves direct visualisation of the tracheus through the oral or nasal cavity. ILE involves indirect visualisation through a mirror or endoscope placed inside the mouth. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing DLI and ILE in children undergoing tracheotomy. We included 10 RCTs with 244 participants. All studies were conducted in high‐income countries. The studies were published between 2004 and 2017. 
Key results 
The quality of the evidence was very low due to the small number of participants in each study and the lack of standardised reporting of outcomes. We found no evidence that ILE improves the success rate of trachetomy. However, we found that ILET may be associated with a longer duration of trachel intubaton. We also found that there was no difference in the incidence of adverse events between the two groups. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The evidence is of very low quality due to small sample sizes and the heterogeneity of the studies. 
Future research 
Further research is needed to determine whether ILET is better than DLI in children requiring tracheostomy.

"Background
Pit and fissure sealants are plastic materials that are used to seal deep pits and fissures on the occlusal surfaces of teeth, where decay occurs most often in children and adolescents. Deep pits and fissures can retain food debris and bacteria, making them difficult to clean, thereby causing them to be more susceptible to dental caries. The application of a pit and fissure sealant, a non‐invasive preventive approach, can prevent dental caries by forming a protective barrier that reduces food entrapment and bacterial growth. Though moderate‐certainty evidence shows that sealants are effective in preventing caries in permanent teeth, the effectiveness of applying pit and fissure sealants to primary teeth has yet to be established. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effects of sealants compared to no sealant or a different sealant in preventing pit and fissure caries on the occlusal surfaces of primary molars in children and to report the adverse effects and the retention of different types of sealants. 
Search methods
An information specialist searched four bibliographic databases up to 11 February 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished and ongoing studies. Review authors scanned the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews for further studies. 
Selection criteria
We included parallel‐group and split‐mouth randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a sealant with no sealant, or different types of sealants, for the prevention of caries in primary molars, with no restriction on follow‐up duration. We included studies in which co‐interventions such as oral health preventive measures, oral health education or tooth brushing demonstrations were used, provided that the same adjunct was used with the intervention and comparator. We excluded studies with complex interventions for the prevention of dental caries in primary teeth such as preventive resin restorations, or studies that used sealants in cavitated carious lesions. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. We presented outcomes for the development of new carious lesions on occlusal surfaces of primary molars as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where studies were similar in clinical and methodological characteristics, we planned to pool effect estimates using a random‐effects model where appropriate. We used GRADE methodology to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included nine studies that randomised 1120 children who ranged in age from 18 months to eight years at the start of the study. One study compared fluoride‐releasing resin‐based sealant with no sealant (139 tooth pairs in 90 children); two studies compared glass ionomer‐based sealant with no sealant (619 children); two studies compared glass ionomer‐based sealant with resin‐based sealant (278 tooth pairs in 200 children); two studies compared fluoride‐releasing resin‐based sealant with resin‐based sealant (113 tooth pairs in 69 children); one study compared composite with fluoride‐releasing resin‐based sealant (40 tooth pairs in 40 children); and one study compared autopolymerised sealant with light polymerised sealant (52 tooth pairs in 52 children). 
Three studies evaluated the effects of sealants versus no sealant and provided data for our primary outcome. Due to differences in study design such as age of participants and duration of follow‐up, we elected not to pool the data. At 24 months, there was insufficient evidence of a difference in the development of new caries lesions for the fluoride‐releasing sealants or no treatment groups (Becker Balagtas odds ratio (BB OR) 0.76, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.42; 1 study, 85 children, 255 tooth surfaces). For glass ionomer‐based sealants, the evidence was equivocal; one study found insufficient evidence of a difference at follow‐up between 12 and 30 months (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.49; 449 children), while another with 12‐month follow‐up found a large, beneficial effect of sealants (OR 0.03, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.15; 107 children). We judged the certainty of the evidence to be low, downgrading two levels in total for study limitations, imprecision and inconsistency. 
We included six trials randomising 411 children that directly compared different sealant materials, four of which (221 children) provided data for our primary outcome. Differences in age of the participants and duration of follow‐up precluded pooling of the data. The incidence of development of new caries lesions was typically low across the different sealant types evaluated. We judged the certainty of the evidence to be low or very low for the outcome of caries incidence. 
Only one study assessed and reported adverse events, the nature of which was gag reflex while placing the sealant material. 
Authors' conclusions
The certainty of the evidence for the comparisons and outcomes in this review was low or very low, reflecting the fragility and uncertainty of the evidence base. The volume of evidence for this review was limited, which typically included small studies where the number of events was low. The majority of studies in this review were of split‐mouth design, an efficient study design for this research question; however, there were often shortcomings in the analysis and reporting of results that made synthesising the evidence difficult. An important omission from the included studies was the reporting of adverse events. Given the importance of prevention for maintaining good oral health, there exists an important evidence gap pertaining to the caries‐preventive effect and retention of sealants in the primary dentition, which should be addressed through robust RCTs.","Sealants for preventing carious decay on the back surfaces of baby teeth
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of the review was to find out if sealants applied to the back surface of baby (primary) teeth can prevent caries (tooth decay). 
Key messages 
The evidence is current to 12 February 2019. 
Sealant application may reduce the number of new cavities on the surfaces of the back teeth of children aged between two and six years. However, the evidence is not strong enough to say whether this is true. 
There is no good evidence about the effectiveness and safety of sealant application for preventing cavities in the back of baby's teeth. 
What was studied in the review?  The review looked at studies that compared the use of sealents with no treatment or a sealent with a different type of sealent. Sealants are small plastic materials placed in the pits and grooves of the teeth to prevent food and bacteria from getting trapped and causing cavities. 
Why is this important?  Cavities are a common problem in children's teeth, especially in the front teeth. They can cause pain and discomfort, and can lead to more serious problems such as infection and abscesses. 
How did the researchers do this study?  Researchers searched for studies that had been done to find the answer to their question. They looked for studies in the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, Science Citation Index Expanded, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. They also contacted experts in the field and checked the reference sections of other studies to see if they had missed any. 
The researchers included nine randomised studies that involved 1122 children aged two to six years old. The studies compared the application of different sealants on the teeth of the children. The researchers looked at how many children developed cavities after one year. They found that the application may have reduced the number, but the evidence was not strong. 
Limitations of the study  The evidence is currently current to February 2009. The review authors suggest that future studies should include children aged over six years and should look at the long‐term effects of applying sealants and other preventive measures. 
Funding sources  This review was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Programme Grants for Research and Development (PG/13/04/024) and the NIHR Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme (HTTA 14‐03). 
Authors' conclusions  The current evidence does not show that sealant applications are effective for preventing decay in the teeth. More research is needed to confirm this finding.
Fluoride‐releasingsealants versus non‐sealants for preventing caries in children's teeth 
What is the issue? 
Caries is a major cause of tooth loss worldwide. It is caused by the action of bacteria on food particles left in the mouth. Fluoride is known to prevent caries. Sealants are applied to the chewing surfaces of teeth to prevent decay. They can be made from a variety of materials including glass ionomers, resin‐modified glass ionomers, resin composites and fluoride‐release systems. 
Why is this important? 
The aim of this review was to find out whether fluoride‐released sealants are more effective than non‐fluoride sealants in preventing carious decay in children. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared the effectiveness of different types of sealant in preventing new carous lesions in children aged 18 to 8 years. We included nine randomised controlled trials involving 1121 children. The studies were conducted in different countries and lasted from 6 to 36 months. 
Key results 
We found that there was no clear difference in caries prevention between fluoride‐relasing sealants and non‐relaing sealants. There was also no clear evidence of difference between different types and brands of fluoride‐leasing sealant. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to moderate. This means that the evidence is uncertain and may be influenced by factors such as the way the studies were carried out and the results reported. 
Conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the use of fluoride ‐releasing dental sealants over non‐reliasing sealant for preventing new decay in the primary teeth of children. Further research is needed to determine whether fluoride ‐released sealant is more effective in preventing decay in permanent teeth. 
This review is up to date: 14 August 2019.
Sealants for preventing tooth decay in children
Review question 
This review aimed to find out if different types of dental sealants could prevent tooth decay (caries) in children. 
Background 
Tooth decay is one of the most common childhood diseases worldwide. It can cause pain, discomfort, and affect a child's ability to eat and drink normally. Dental sealants are applied to the chewing surfaces of teeth to prevent tooth cavities. They are usually applied when the first permanent molar teeth erupt. Sealants are made of plastic or glass and are painted onto the surface of the teeth. They come in different colours and flavours. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that compared different types and brands of dental sealer. We included six studies that randomised 411 participants (children) who had their first permanent molars. The studies were conducted in different countries and lasted from 6 to 36 months. The evidence was current to January 2017. 
Key results 
The evidence was very weak because of the small number of studies and the low quality of the studies. The main outcome we looked at was the number and size of new cavities in the teeth after the application of the sealants. We found that the evidence did not show any difference between the different types or brands of sealant. There was also no difference between different types (plastic or glass) of sealers. However, one study showed that glass ionomers might be more effective than other types of sealents. The certainty of this evidence was low because of a single study and the small sample size. 
The certainty was also low for other outcomes such as the number or size of cavities that developed on the teeth and the number, size, and type of cavitations (small holes in the tooth) that developed. The number of participants who experienced side effects was too small to draw any conclusions. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was generally low due to the small numbers of participants and the short duration of the included trials. The included studies were also poorly designed and reported. The quality of some studies was further reduced by the fact that they did not report the number who withdrew from the study. 
Conclusion 
There is a need for well‐designed studies that compare different types, brands, and materials of dental sealsants. These studies should also include a larger number of children and longer follow‐ups. The results of these studies will help us to better understand the effectiveness of different types/brands of dental sealing agents and guide dental professionals in making informed decisions about which type of sealent to use. 
What is known so far 
Dental sealants have been used for many years to prevent cavities (tooth decay) in the permanent teeth. The sealants come in two main types: plastic and glass. Plastic sealants contain resin and are usually coloured and flavoured. Glass sealants do not contain resin but are made from glass particles. Both types of sealsants are painted on the chewing surface of teeth. 
This is the first review of the effectiveness and safety of dental materials for preventing cavities and promoting the retention of dental restorations in children with first permanent teeth (molars). 
What we want to know 
We wanted to find the best type of dental material for preventing caries (toothy decay) and promoting retention of restoratives (fillings) in permanent teeth in children aged 6 years and older. 
Why is this important? 
Toothy decay is a major problem worldwide. Children with tooth decay may experience pain, difficulty eating and drinking, and may require expensive dental treatment. Preventing tooth decay is easier than treating it. Dental materials can be applied to teeth to help prevent toothy decay. 
How did we do this review? 
We used computer searches to find relevant studies. We also contacted researchers who had published studies on this topic. We selected studies that met our criteria and analysed the results. We rated the quality of each study and combined the results to give an overall estimate of the effect of each type of material. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality and certainty of evidence. 
Who funded this review?
The review was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) in England. 
When did this review take place? 
The review is current to 2016. 
Which studies were included in the review? 

We included studies that randomly assigned children to receive either a specific type of tooth sealant or a placebo (dummy) sealant, or both. We only included studies in which the children received a single type of sealer, rather than a combination of different sealers, and studies in children who had erupted their first molar (permanent tooth). We excluded studies in adults, children under 6, and children with missing teeth. We excluded the studies that did not provide data on the number (and size) of cavitation (small hole in the enamel) or caries. We did not include studies that were not written in English. We searched for relevant studies","Sealants for preventing dental carie in primary molar teeth
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether applying a seal to the occlusion surface of primary molars prevents dental caris (tooth decay) in children. 
Background 
Dental caries is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide. It is caused by the action of bacteria on the surface of teeth. The bacteria feed on sugars and starches in the diet and produce acid, which dissolves the minerals in the tooth enamel. This process weakens the tooth and creates small holes called cavities. If left untreated, cavities can progress and cause pain, infection and eventually lead to tooth loss. Dental caries can be prevented by removing bacteria from the mouth and by reducing the amount of sugar and starch consumed. Sealants are a type of material that can be applied to the surface teeth to prevent caries from developing. They are usually applied to teeth that are at high risk of carie, such as the back sides of molars. 
Study characteristics 
We found nine studies involving 1122 children aged between 4 and 12 years. The studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, Australia, India and Brazil. The children were randomly assigned to receive either a seal or no seal. The sealants were applied to their primary molares. The length of time the children were followed up varied from six months to three years. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to February 2019. 
We judged the quality of the studies to be low or very low because they had small numbers of participants, were not well designed, and did not report important outcomes. However, the evidence suggests that applying a pit‐and‐fissure seal to primary molers may reduce the number of new cavities that develop. The evidence is currently insufficient to determine whether applying sealants reduces the number or severity of cavities, or whether it affects the number and severity of other dental problems. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence is low or unclear for most outcomes. The main limitations of the included studies were that they were small, poorly designed and did little to describe the methods used to recruit participants or the methods of follow‐ups. The included studies also did not provide information on the cost of sealant application or the costs associated with the treatment of any dental problems that developed.    ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐  ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐ ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐ ‐  ‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐ '' ‐ ‐ ''‐ ‐'' ‐ ‐''‐‐ ''‐‐''‐ ‐'‐‐'‐ ‐ '‐‐ '‐ ‐ –‐ ‐ —‐ ‐ --- ‐ ‐' ‐ ‐'‐ ‐ – ‐ ‐ — ‐ ‐ ---‐ ‐ --‐ ‐ -‐ ‐ '--‐ ‐'''' ‐ ‐''''‐ ‐ ----‐ ‐ ----------‐ ‐----------‐ ‐ --------‐ ‐ -------‐ ‐ ------‐ ‐ -----‐ ‐.....‐ ‐....‐ ‐...‐ ‐..‐ ‐. ‐ ‐.‐ ‐. ‐ ‐.‐ ‐..‐ ‐...‐ ‐....‐ ‐.....‐ ‐......‐ ‐.......‐ ‐.........‐ ‐........‐ ‐........‐ ‐..........‐ ‐................‐ ‐................‐ ‐........................‐ ‐................................‐ ‐................................‐ ‐................................................................‐ ‐................................................................‐ ‐ ﬁrst‐ ‐ second‐ ‐ third‐ ‐ fourth‐ ‐ fifth‐ ‐ sixth‐ ‐ seventh‐ ‐ eighth‐ ‐ ninth‐ ‐ tenth‐ ‐ eleventh‐ ‐ twelfth‐ ‐ thirteenth‐ ‐ fourteenth‐‐ fifteenth‐ --- ‐ ---  ‐ --- --- ‐  --- ‐ -- ‐ --- -- ‐  -- ‐ --  ‐ ‐‐ ‐ ...‐  ‐‐ ... ‐ ‐... ‐...  ‐......‐...‐ ---‐... ‐ ---...‐....‐...... ‐ ..‐... ......... ‐... …‐.....‐..‐ ‐.. ‐  …‐.. …‐  … ‐  ….‐  …. ‐  –‐  – ‐  • ‐ ‐ • ‐ •‐ ‐ • •‐ •‐  •‐‐ • ‐‐ • • ‐•‐ •  • • •  ‐ • ‐‐•‐‐ –‐‐ …‐‐…‐‐...‐‐...‐‐‐ ‐‐‐ •‐‐‐ …‐‐‐…‐‐‐...‐‐‐... •‐‐‐ •‐ … ‐‐ … •‐… ‐‐… •‐• ‐‐• •‐... ‐‐... •‐...•‐...…‐ • …‐ •…‐… …‐ ‐…‐ ‐ …‐ ……‐ … …‐…...‐‐..‐‐‐.. •‐..•‐ …•‐ ‐• ‐ •‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐ •‐‐ ‐ • …‐‐‐‐ …‐‐‐ …‐‐ ‐ …‐‐ • ‐‐‐ • •‐‐ • … •‐‐ … ‐‐‐ … • ‐ … ‐ •… ‐
Fluoride‐releasingsealants for preventing new caris lesions in children's teeth 
What is the issue? 
Children can develop cavities (tooth decay) when bacteria in their mouths break down food particles and sugars. This process can lead to pain, infection and eventually tooth loss. Fluoride is a substance that helps prevent tooth decay by making teeth more resistant to acid attacks from plaque bacteria. Sealants are thin layers of material that are painted onto the chewing surfaces of teeth to prevent cavities. They are most useful for teeth that are difficult to clean, such as the back sides of molars. 
Why is this important? 
Tooth decay is a major problem worldwide. In many countries, children have high levels of tooth decay. It is estimated that over 60% of children aged five to 11 years have at least one cavity. Tooth decay is also a major cause of tooth loss in children. In some countries, up to 50% of permanent teeth are lost due to tooth decay before the age of 25. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know whether fluoride‐releaseing sealants could help prevent new cavities in children’s teeth. 
How did we do it? 
In 2012, we searched for studies that had looked at the effect of fluoride‐released sealants on the development in children of new cavies in their teeth. We found nine studies involving 1121 children. We included studies that compared different types of sealant, including those that released fluoride, and those that did not. We also included studies of children of different ages and different types and numbers of teeth. The studies were carried out in different countries and lasted from one to three years. 
We found that there was not enough evidence to say whether fluoride releaseing sealant was effective in preventing new cavites in children, but there was some evidence that it might be helpful. 
Key messages 
There is not enough good quality evidence to show whether fluoride releasing sealants are effective in helping to prevent new carie lesions in young children. However, there is some evidence suggesting that they may be helpful in preventing caries in older children. More research is needed to confirm these findings. 
The evidence is current to November 2014.
Sealants for preventing dental caries in children
Review question 
This review aimed to find out whether different types of dental sealants can prevent dental carie (tooth decay) in children. 
Background 
Dental caries is a major cause of tooth loss worldwide. Dental sealants are applied to the chewing surface of teeth to prevent caries. They are usually applied to molars and premolars (back teeth) when they are first coming in. Sealants are most effective when applied before the first tooth erupts. However, many children do not have their teeth sealed until after the first teeth erupt. This review looked at the evidence about the effectiveness of different types and brands of dental sealsants in preventing dental decay in children who had their teeth already erupted. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for relevant studies up to January 2019. We included six studies that randomised 411 participants. All studies were conducted in high‐income countries. Four studies were carried out in the United States, one in Australia and one in Canada. The studies included children aged 6 years and older. The length of follow up ranged from 12 to 36 months. The evidence was current to January, 2018. 
Key results 
The evidence was very low quality and did not show a significant difference in the number or rate of dental carious lesions between the different types or brands of sealant. The certainty of evidence was low to very low due to the small number of studies, the short duration of the studies and the lack of consistency in the results. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The certainty or quality of the available evidence was generally low to moderate. The main reasons for this were the small numbers of participants, the limited duration of studies and inconsistent results. The quality of evidence also varied between studies. 
What does this mean? 
There is currently no strong evidence to support the use of any particular type or brand of dental sealer over another. More research is needed to determine the best type of dental sealing agent for preventing caries and to assess the long‐term effects of dental materials on the oral environment.

"Background
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurologic disorder that is associated with peripheral iron deficiency in a subgroup of patients. It is unclear whether iron therapy is effective treatment for RLS. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral or parenteral iron for the treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) when compared with placebo or other therapies. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycNFO, and CINAHL for the time period January 1995 to September 2017. We searched reference lists for additional published studies. We searched Clinicaltrials.gov and other clinical trial registries (September 2017) for ongoing or unpublished studies. 
Selection criteria
Controlled trials comparing any formulation of iron with placebo, other medications, or no treatment, in adults diagnosed with RLS according to expert clinical interview or explicit diagnostic criteria. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality, with discussion to reach consensus in the case of any disagreement. The primary outcome considered in this review was restlessness or unpleasant sensations, as experienced subjectively by the patient. We combined treatment/control differences in the outcomes across studies using random‐effects meta‐analyses. We analysed continuous data using mean differences (MDs) where possible and performed standardised mean difference (SMD) analyses when different measurements were used across studies. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data using the Mantel‐Haenszel method and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We analysed study heterogeneity using the I2 statistic. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We performed GRADE analysis using GRADEpro. 
Main results
We identified and included 10 studies (428 total participants, followed for 2‐16 weeks) in this review. Our primary outcome was restlessness or uncomfortable leg sensations, which was quantified using the International Restless Legs Scale (IRLS) (range, 0 to 40) in eight trials and a different RLS symptom scale in a ninth trial. Nine studies compared iron to placebo and one study compared iron to a dopamine agonist (pramipexole). The possibility for bias among the trials was variable. Three studies had a single element with high risk of bias, which was lack of blinding in two and incomplete outcome data in one. All studies had at least one feature resulting in unclear risk of bias. 
Combining data from the seven trials using the IRLS to compare iron and placebo, use of iron resulted in greater improvement in IRLS scores (MD ‐3.78, 95% CI ‐6.25 to ‐1.31; I2= 66%, 7 studies, 345 participants) measured 2 to 12 weeks after treatment. Including an eighth study, which measured restlessness using a different scale, use of iron remained beneficial compared to placebo (SMD ‐0.74, 95% CI ‐1.26 to ‐0.23; I2 = 80%, 8 studies, 370 participants). The GRADE assessment of certainty for this outcome was moderate. 
The single study comparing iron to a dopamine agonist (pramipexole) found a similar reduction in RLS severity in the two groups (MD ‐0.40, 95% CI ‐5.93 to 5.13, 30 participants). 
Assessment of secondary outcomes was limited by small numbers of trials assessing each outcome. Iron did not improve quality of life as a dichotomous measure (RR 2.01, 95% CI 0.54 to 7.45; I2=54%, 2 studies, 39 participants), but did improve quality of life measured on continuous scales (SMD 0.51, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.87; I2= 0%, 3 studies, 128 participants), compared to placebo. Subjective sleep quality was no different between iron and placebo groups (SMD 0.19, 95% CI ‐0.18 to 0.56; I2 = 9%, 3 studies, 128 participants), nor was objective sleep quality, as measured by change in sleep efficiency in a single study (‐35.5 +/‐ 92.0 versus ‐41.4 +/‐ 98.2, 18 participants). Periodic limb movements of sleep were not significantly reduced with iron compared to placebo ( SMD ‐0.19, 95% CI ‐0.70 to 0.32; I2 = 0%, 2 studies, 60 participants). Iron did not improve sleepiness compared to placebo, as measured on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (data not provided, 1 study, 60 participants) but did improve the daytime tiredness item of the RLS‐6 compared to placebo (least squares mean difference ‐1.5, 95% CI ‐2.5 to ‐0.6; 1 study, 110 participants). The GRADE rating for secondary outcomes ranged from low to very low. 
Prespecified subgroup analyses showed more improvement with iron in those trials studying participants on dialysis. The use of low serum ferritin levels as an inclusion criteria and the use or oral versus intravenous iron did not show significant subgroup differences. 
Iron did not result in significantly more adverse events than placebo (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.25; I2=45%, 6 studies, 298 participants). A single study reported that people treated with iron therapy experienced fewer adverse events than the active comparator pramipexole. 
Authors' conclusions
Iron therapy probably improves restlessness and RLS severity in comparison to placebo. Iron therapy may not increase the risk of side effects in comparison to placebo. We are uncertain whether iron therapy improves quality of life in comparison to placebo. Iron therapy may make little or no difference to pramipexole in restlessness and RLS severity, as well as in the risk of adverse events. The effect on secondary outcomes such as quality of life, daytime functioning, and sleep quality, the optimal timing and formulation of administration, and patient characteristics predicting response require additional study.","Iron for restless legs
What is restless legs? 
Restless leg syndrome (RLS) is an uncontrollable urge to move your legs. This urge is usually accompanied by uncomfortable sensations such as tingling, burning, or itching. These sensations occur in the evening or at night, and are relieved by movement. RLS is a very common condition, affecting about 10% of the adult population. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, iron deficiency, and certain medical conditions. 
Why is iron important for RSL? 
Iron deficiency is a known cause of RLS, particularly in women. Iron deficiency occurs when there is not enough iron in the body. Iron is important for many bodily functions, including the production of haemoglobin, which carries oxygen around the body, and myoglobin, a protein that stores oxygen in muscles. Iron also plays a role in the functioning of the nervous system. 
What is the evidence for iron therapy in RLS? 
We searched for studies that compared iron therapy with placebo (a dummy treatment) or other treatments for RLE. We found 10 small studies involving 428 people. Most of these studies were conducted in Europe and North America. The studies lasted between two and 16 weeks. 
The studies compared different types of iron, including oral iron tablets, intravenous iron infusions, and iron injections. Some studies compared oral iron with a dopamine antagonist (a drug that blocks dopamine receptors in the brain). Dopamine antagonists are commonly used to treat RLS because they help to reduce the urge to walk or move. 
How did the studies work? 
In the studies, participants were given either iron or a placebo. They were asked to keep a diary to record their symptoms and how they felt. Participants were also asked to rate their symptoms on a scale of 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (severe symptoms). 
What did we find? 
The evidence suggests that iron therapy may be effective for treating RLS in some people. However, the evidence is not strong enough to support the use of iron therapy for RLES. The quality of the evidence was generally low, meaning that the results of the studies were not reliable. 
One study showed that iron was more effective than placebo in reducing symptoms of RLE in people who had iron deficiency. Another study showed no difference between iron and placebo in people with iron deficiency and RLE, but the study was small and had a short duration. 
Another study showed a small benefit of iron over placebo in terms of reducing symptoms, but this was not statistically significant. 
We found no evidence that iron is better than dopamine antagonists for treating symptoms of restless leg syndrome. 
Side effects of iron were reported in most of the trials. These side effects were mild and included nausea, vomiting, and stomach pain. 
Conclusions 
The current evidence does not support the routine use of oral iron for treating restless legs. However the evidence does suggest that iron may be beneficial for people with RLE who have iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia. More research is needed to confirm the benefits of iron for RSE.

Iron for restless legs syndrome 
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common condition characterised by an irresistible urge to move the legs, often accompanied by uncomfortable sensations. It is most commonly associated with iron deficiency. Iron supplements are used to treat RLS, but there is uncertainty about their effectiveness. We reviewed the evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine whether iron is effective in treating RLS. 
We included nine studies involving 435 people with RLS who were randomly assigned to receive either iron or placebo. The studies lasted between 2 and 12 months. The primary outcome we assessed was the number of people who reported restlessness and uncomfortable leg symptoms. We also looked at other outcomes such as quality of sleep, quality of daily activities, and overall quality of well‐being. 
Our results showed that iron was more effective than placebo in reducing the number and severity of restlessness episodes. However, the certainty of our findings was moderate because of the variability in the quality of the evidence. There was also uncertainty about the effects of iron on quality of rest and quality of activities. Overall, the evidence suggests that iron may be effective in reducing restlessness in people with iron‐deficiency related RLS and improving quality of activity. However more research is needed to confirm these findings. GRADE criteria 
Key messages

What is restless legs? 
Restlessness is a feeling of discomfort or restlessness that is usually felt in the legs. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including iron deficiency, and is often associated with an irresistible need to move. 
Why is this important? 
Iron deficiency is a very common problem worldwide. It occurs when the body does not get enough iron, which is an essential nutrient. Iron deficiency can cause fatigue, weakness, and poor concentration, and can also lead to restless legs, which can disrupt sleep and daily activities. 
How did we do this review? 
We searched for studies that compared iron with placebo (a dummy treatment) in people suffering from restless legs due to iron deficiency and evaluated the quality and relevance of the studies. We included nine randomised trials involving 445 people. 
Key results 
We found that iron supplements were more effective in improving restlessness than placebo. However the certainty in our findings is moderate because the quality varied across the studies and some studies had problems with how they were conducted. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of the results is moderate. This means that we are fairly confident that iron is more effective for treating restless legs than placebo, but we are not sure if the effect is large enough to be important. More research is required to confirm the findings. 
Quality of the review 
We are uncertain about the quality because of problems with the way the studies were conducted and the way they were reported.

Iron for restless legs syndrome
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common condition that causes an uncontrollable urge to move the legs, usually at night, which can disrupt sleep. It is estimated that 10% to 15% of adults have RLS. RLS is often associated with iron deficiency, and iron supplementation has been used to treat this condition. This review found that iron supplementation probably improves symptoms of RLS in comparison with placebo. However, we are uncertain about the effect of iron on quality of sleep, and there is insufficient evidence to determine if iron increases the risk to people taking iron. The effects of iron supplementation on quality‐of‐life measures, and on the risk and severity of side‐effects, are also uncertain. 
What was studied in this review? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing iron supplementation with placebo in people with RLS, and we included 11 RCTs involving 298 people. The RCT participants were aged between 18 and 80 years, and they had a diagnosis of RSLs. The trials were conducted in the USA, Europe, Australia, and India, and the duration of the trials ranged from one week to six months. 
Key results 
The trials were small, and most were funded by pharmaceutical companies. The quality of the evidence was generally low or very low, meaning that the results of the studies are uncertain. The evidence is current to July 2017. 
The main outcome was the change in the Restless Legs Syndrome Rating Scale (RLSS), which is a measure of how much RLS symptoms affect daily life. The results showed that iron probably improved RLS symptom severity compared with placebo (mean difference 0 to 1 point, 100% confidence interval 0% to −1 point; 11 studies, moderate quality evidence). Iron probably improved quality of rest (mean score 0 points, 90% confidence intervals 0 point to 3 points; 10 studies, low quality evidence) and probably improved the number of nights spent awake due to RLS (mean number of awakenings per night 0, 80% confidence limits 0 nights to 4 nights; 6 studeis, low quaity evidence). 
The evidence for the effect on quality-of-life measures was low or moderate quality. Iron probably increased the number oof days spent sleeping (mean days 0 days, 70% confidence intevals 0 dais to 5 days; 5 studies, very low quality evedience). Iron may have improved quality-of‐life scores compared with pramirlexe (mean change 0 poinst, 50% confidence interva 0 poins to 6 poins; 2 studei, low quailty eviedence). 
There was no evidence of a difference in the number and severity oof side‐eefects between iron treatment and placebo. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was low to moderate. The main limitation was the small number of participants in each trial, and many of the included trials were funded bby pharmaceutical companies, which may have influenced the results. The included trials also had methodological limitations, such as short durations and lack of blinding.  What does this mean? 
Iron probably improves RLS sympotms, quality of rset, and number of nighs spent awakene due to RLs. However we are uncerain about the efect on quality oof life, and there is insuficient evidence to detemine if iron increas the risk oof sde‐eefeets. The efects of iron suplementation on quality–of‐lfe measures, aand on the rik and severity fof side–eefeects, are also uncerian.  Why is this important? 
RLS is a comon conditon that affects many peopel. It can be difficult to diagnose and treat, and it can have a significant impact on quality-oof-life. Iron supplementation is commonly used to tret RLS and is thought to be effective. This reivew shows that iron probabaly improves RSL symptoms, quality oif rest, and numbe rof nigh sspent awakne due to rls. However the evidence is low to moderat quality, and further research is needed to confirm these findings.  How up to date is this?

Iron therapy for restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD)
Background 
Restless legs syndrome and periodic leg movements disorder are conditions that cause discomfort and pain in the legs. They are common in adults and can be caused by a variety of factors including genetics, iron deficiency, and certain medications. Iron supplements have been used to treat these conditions. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing iron therapy with placebo (dummy treatment) for RLS and PLMD. We included studies that were published up to 1 November 2017. We found six studies involving 298 people. All studies were conducted in Europe. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to 31 October 2018. 
Iron therapy may improve restlessness in people with RLS compared to placebo, but we are uncertain about whether it improves RLS symptoms. Iron may also reduce the number of people who experience RLS at night. There is no evidence that iron increases the risk for side effects. 
There is no clear evidence that the combination of iron and pramiracetam (a medication used to help with sleep) improves restiness and RSLs severity compared to prarmipexol (a dopamine agonist used to improve sleep). 
Quality of life and quality of daily functioning 
We are uncertain if iron therapy affects quality of live and quality o f daily functioning in people w ith RLS. 
Side effects 
We found no evidence of an increased risk of serious side effects with iron treatment. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the findings is moderate to low. This is because the evidence is based on small studies and there is a high risk of bias in the way the studies were carried out.  ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐

Review question 
This review aimed to find out if iron is effective and safe for treating people with restless legs. 
Background 
Restless leg syndrome (RLS) is an abnormal sensation in the legs that causes discomfort, pain, and restlessness. It can be caused by low levels of iron in the body. Iron supplements are commonly used to treat iron deficiency. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared iron with a placebo (dummy treatment) or another medication for treating RLS in adults. We found 10 RCTs involving 428 participants. The studies lasted between two and 16 weeks. 
Key results 
The evidence shows that iron is more effective than placebo in reducing symptoms of RLS, but there is not enough evidence to show that iron improves sleep quality or reduces the need for other treatments. There is also not enough information about the effects of iron on quality of life, anxiety, depression, or cognitive function. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. Most studies were small and did not have adequate blinding (i.e. neither the researchers nor the participants knew who was receiving the active treatment or the placebo). There was also a lack of information about side effects. 
Conclusions 
More research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety (side effects) of iron for treating restlessness and uncomfortable sensations in the leg. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of the finding is very low because of the low quality of evidence. GRADE 
Key messages 
Iron may be more effective for treating symptoms of restless leg syndrome than a dummy treatment. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of iron as a treatment for restless leg. More research is required to determine whether iron is safe and effective for people with restlessness in their legs.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐''‐‐'‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐  ‐ ‐ ‐‐ ''‐‐
Iron for restless legs syndrome 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of iron for treating restless legs symptoms. 
Background 
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common condition characterized by an irresistible urge to move the legs, often accompanied by uncomfortable sensations. It is estimated that 10% of the general population will experience RLS at some point in their lives. RLS can be treated with medications such as iron, dopamine agonists, opioids, and benzodiazepines, and lifestyle modifications. Iron is commonly used to treat RLS, but its effectiveness is uncertain. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared iron with placebo or another medication for treating RLS. We included nine RCTs that involved 439 participants. The duration of treatment ranged from 2 weeks to 16 weeks. 
Key results 
We found that iron was more effective than placebo in reducing the severity of RLS symptoms, as assessed by the International RLS Severity Scale (a scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 30 (severe symptoms)). This was true for both short‐term and long‐term treatment. However, we were unable to determine whether iron was better than other medications for treating restlessness. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate, meaning that we are fairly confident that the true effect of iron is likely to be close to the estimated effect. However there is still uncertainty about the effects of iron on quality of sleep, quality of daily activities, and the number of participants who experienced side effects. 
Conclusions 
Iron may be effective for treating the symptoms of restless legs. More research is needed to confirm this finding and to explore the effects on quality sleep, daily activities and side effects of treatment with iron.
Iron for restless legs syndrome (RLS)
Background 
Restless legs syndrome is a condition where people feel an urge to move their legs, often accompanied by uncomfortable sensations. This can occur at any time of day, but is most common at night. Restless legs can be caused by a variety of factors including genetics, iron deficiency, kidney disease, diabetes, and certain medications. Iron supplements are commonly used to treat iron deficiency. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing iron supplements with placebo (dummy treatment) in people with RLS. We included studies that compared iron with pramiracetam (a medication used to help people with Parkinson's disease) and studies that used different types of iron supplements. We also included studies of people with chronic kidney disease who had iron deficiency and those who did not have iron deficiency but had other conditions that might cause RLS, such as diabetes. 
Key results 
We found 11 RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved 298 people with iron deficiency or iron deficiency plus other conditions. The studies compared iron supplements to placebo or prampracetam. Iron supplementation probably improved restlessness (Smd 0.51, mean difference (MD) 0 51, risk ratio (RR) 1.52, 3 RCT s, 188 participants) and R L S severity (S md 0,19, MD 0,19, RR 1,48, I 2 =45%, six studies,298 participants) in comparison with placebo. However, we are uncertain if iron improves quality o f life (S m d 0,.51, MD,19,RR 0,,95% C I 0.,87, I =0%, three studies,128 participants). There was no evidence that iron improved sleep quality (S,md 1,19 0,-0,56, I,09%, three st u d i e s,1 28 p a r t i c i p a n t s ) or reduced the number of times people got up during the night (S,m d 1 0,-0,32, I,0%, two studies,60 participants), or reduced periodic limb movements during sleep (S,md 2,19 1,-0.7 0,I,0%,two studies,6 0 p a rt i c ip a n ts). Iron probably reduces the risk o f side effects (RR,1,4 8, 6 st u di e s,298 p a ra t i e n t  s ) com pared t o p l a c e b o. One study found that iron reduced the risk a f s i d e e f f e c t s (RR,1, 4 9, 2 st u die s,60 p a rat i e nt s ) c o m p a re d t o pr amipexol. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to moderate.

Iron therapy for restless legs syndrome (RLS) 
Background 
Restless legs syndrome is a common condition that causes an uncontrollable urge to move the legs. It can be very distressing and disrupt sleep. Iron deficiency is thought to contribute to the development of RLS. Iron supplements have been used to treat RLS, but their effectiveness is unclear. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing iron therapy with placebo (dummy treatment) or another active treatment for RLS in adults. We included studies published up to 1 November 2017. 
Key results 
We found six studies involving 298 people with RLS who were randomly assigned to receive either iron therapy or placebo. The average age of the people in the studies was 54 years. Four studies compared iron therapy to placebo, one study compared iron to prampexole (a dopamine agonist), and one study was a cross‐over study comparing iron to placebo in two phases. 
The evidence suggests that iron therapy probably reduces restlessness in people with mild to moderate RLS compared to placebo (low‐certainty evidence). Iron therapy probably also reduces the severity of RSL symptoms in people who have moderate to severe RLS (moderate‐certainty evidence). There is no clear evidence that iron increases the risk for side effects compared to the placebo (very low‐certainties evidence). 
Quality of life was not measured in any of the studies. 
We are uncertain about whether iron improves quality‐of‐life, daytime function, and quality of sleep in people treated for RSL (very high‐certitude evidence). We are also uncertain about the optimal time and form of iron administration, as we do not know how often people should take iron and whether different forms of iron are more effective (very uncertain evidence). The effect of iron on RLS symptoms and side effects may vary depending on the individual's iron status, and we do need further research to find out which people are most likely to benefit from iron therapy. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the findings is moderate to low due to the small number of studies and the heterogeneity of the included studies. nderstanding what happens when people with restless legs get iron therapy is important because it may help them to feel better. This review shows that iron probably helps people with moderate to mild restless legs to feel less restless and less bothered by their symptoms. However, we do no know if iron makes people feel better or if it has any other benefits. We also do not yet know how much iron people should get or how often they should take it. urther research is needed to answer these questions. ource of funding

This plain language summary has been written by Dr. M E O'Brien and Dr. C J Kennedy of University College Dublin, Ireland. igure 1: Restless legs symptom severity scale (RLS‐SS) scores at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment with iron or placebo for people with restlessness. 
Restlessness is a feeling of discomfort or unease in the legs, often accompanied by an urge to keep moving the legs to relieve the discomfort. This is known as restless legs (RL) syndrome. People with this condition often experience difficulty sleeping and may wake up during the night to move their legs. Restlessness can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, iron deficiency, and certain medications. 
Iron deficiency is a condition where the body does not have enough iron. Iron is an essential nutrient that is important for many bodily functions, including the production of red blood cells. Iron plays a role in the transport of oxygen around the body and is also involved in the production and maintenance of healthy nerve cells. 
There is evidence that people with iron deficiency are more likely to develop restless legs. Iron supplementation has been used as a treatment for restless leg syndrome. However the effectiveness of iron therapy for RLE is unclear, and there is a need for further research. 
What did we want to find? 
We wanted to find the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of iron supplements for treating restless legs in adults.
What did the researchers do? 
The researchers searched for studies that compared iron supplements with placebo or another medication for treating RLS and identified six studies that met the inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted in Europe and North America and involved a total of 298 adults with RLE. The participants were randomly allocated to receive iron or a placebo. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
This is the first update of the review, which was originally published in 2009. 
Why is this important? 
Restfulness is a very common condition, and it can be difficult to treat. Iron may be"
"Background
Adequate haemodialysis (HD) in people with end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD) is reliant upon establishment of vascular access, which may consist of arteriovenous fistula, arteriovenous graft, or central venous catheters (CVC). Although discouraged due to high rates of infectious and thrombotic complications as well as technical issues that limit their life span, CVC have the significant advantage of being immediately usable and are the only means of vascular access in a significant number of patients. Previous studies have established the role of thrombolytic agents (TLA) in the prevention of catheter malfunction. Systematic review of different thrombolytic agents has also identified their utility in restoration of catheter patency following catheter malfunction. To date the use and efficacy of fibrin sheath stripping and catheter exchange have not been evaluated against thrombolytic agents. 
Objectives
This review aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of TLA, preparations, doses and administration as well as fibrin‐sheath stripping, over‐the‐wire catheter exchange or any other intervention proposed for management of tunnelled CVC malfunction in patients with ESKD on HD. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to 17 August 2017 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Specialised Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov. 
Selection criteria
We included all studies conducted in people with ESKD who rely on tunnelled CVC for either initiation or maintenance of HD access and who require restoration of catheter patency following late‐onset catheter malfunction and evaluated the role of TLA, fibrin sheath stripping or over‐the‐wire catheter exchange to restore catheter function. The primary outcome was be restoration of line patency defined as ≥ 300 mL/min or adequate to complete a HD session or as defined by the study authors. Secondary outcomes included dialysis adequacy and adverse outcomes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed retrieved studies to determine which studies satisfy the inclusion criteria and carried out data extraction. Included studies were assessed for risk of bias. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random‐effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using GRADE. 
Main results
Our search strategy identified 8 studies (580 participants) as eligible for inclusion in this review. Interventions included: thrombolytic therapy versus placebo (1 study); low versus high dose thrombolytic therapy (1); alteplase versus urokinase (1); short versus long thrombolytic dwell (1); thrombolytic therapy versus percutaneous fibrin sheath stripping (1); fibrin sheath stripping versus over‐the‐wire catheter exchange (1); and over‐the‐wire catheter exchange versus exchange with and without angioplasty sheath disruption (1). No two studies compared the same interventions. Most studies had a high risk of bias due to poor study design, broad inclusion criteria, low patient numbers and industry involvement. 
Based on low certainty evidence, thrombolytic therapy may restore catheter function when compared to placebo (149 participants: RR 4.05, 95% CI 1.42 to 11.56) but there is no data available to suggest an optimal dose or administration method. The certainty of this evidence is reduced due to the fact that it is based on only a single study with wide confidence limits, high risk of bias and imprecision in the estimates of adverse events (149 participants: RR 2.03, 95% CI 0.38 to 10.73). 
Based on the available evidence, physical disruption of a fibrin sheath using interventional radiology techniques appears to be equally efficacious as the use of a pharmaceutical thrombolytic agent for the immediate management of dysfunctional catheters (57 participants: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.07). 
Catheter patency is poor following use of thrombolytic agents with studies reporting median catheter survival rates of 14 to 42 days and was reported to improve significantly by fibrin sheath stripping or catheter exchange (37 participants: MD ‐27.70 days, 95% CI ‐51.00 to ‐4.40). Catheter exchange was reported to be superior to sheath disruption with respect to catheter survival (30 participants: MD 213.00 days, 95% CI 205.70 to 220.30). 
There is insufficient evidence to suggest any specific intervention is superior in terms of ensuring either dialysis adequacy or reduced risk of adverse events. 
Authors' conclusions
Thrombolysis, fibrin sheath disruption and over‐the‐wire catheter exchange are effective and appropriate therapies for immediately restoring catheter patency in dysfunctional cuffed and tunnelled HD catheters. On current data there is no evidence to support physical intervention over the use of pharmaceutical agents in the acute setting. Pharmacological interventions appear to have a bridging role and long‐term catheter survival may be improved by fibrin sheath disruption and is probably superior following catheter exchange. There is no evidence favouring any of these approaches with respect to dialysis adequacy or risk of adverse events. 
The current review is limited by the small number of available studies with limited numbers of patients enrolled. Most of the studies included in this review were judged to have a high risk of bias and were potentially influenced by pharmaceutical industry involvement. 
Further research is required to adequately address the question of the most efficacious and clinically appropriate technique for HD catheter dysfunction.","Thrombolytics for restoring patency of tunnel catheters in people undergoing haemodiafiltration for end‐staged renal disease 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of thrombolysis (dissolving blood clots) for restoring the patency (flow) of tunnel‐catheters used for haemofiltration (removing fluid and waste products from the blood) in patients undergoing haemo‐filtration therapy for end stage kidney disease. 
Background 
Haemofliltration is a type of treatment that removes excess fluids and waste from the body when the kidneys are no longer able to do so. It is performed using a catheter inserted into a vein in the arm or leg. The catheter is usually placed under the skin (tunnelled) to prevent infection. However, the catheter can become blocked by blood clumps (clots) and this can lead to serious complications. Thrombosis (blood clotting) is a common problem with tunnelled catheters. Throombolysis (using drugs to dissolve blood clotts) is one way to treat this problem. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to August 17, 2016. We found two studies that met our inclusion criteria. Both studies were conducted in Europe and involved 100 participants. One study compared thrombosis with fibrin shear stripping (removal of the clot from the inside of the cathetertunnel) and the other compared thrombolysisthroughout the study period. 
Key results 
The two studies showed that thrombolytic agents were effective in restoring patencty of the tunnelled haemodifiltration catheter. However there was no difference between the two groups in terms of the rate of successful catheter restoration. There was no evidence of serious adverse events. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low because of the small number of studies and the lack of information about the effects of thromboysis on dialysis outcomes.  ‐‐ ‐‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐  ‐ ‐  ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐ ‐ 6 ‐ ‐

Thrombolytics for restoring catheter patency in patients with central venous catheters
Background 
Central venous lines are used to deliver drugs, nutrients and other substances to patients who require them. These lines are usually inserted into the superior vena cava or inferior vena cave through a vein in the neck or arm. They can become blocked by blood clots and are often used in intensive care units. When a central venus line becomes blocked, it is necessary to remove the blockage to restore the line's ability to deliver its contents. This can be done by giving a drug called a thrombolic agent, which dissolves the clot, or by physically removing the clot. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of thromboli (drugs that dissolve clots) and physical removal of clots to restore patency (flow) of central venos lines. We also looked at the effects of these methods on the need for repeated interventions and on complications such as bleeding. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for relevant studies up to August 2016. We found eight studies involving 580 participants. All studies were conducted in hospital settings and involved people with central lines who had experienced a blockage. The studies were small and had a number of limitations. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to August 2016.
Thrombolysis (drugging the clot) may restore patencies of central lines when compared with placebo (a dummy treatment). However, we do not know whether different doses of the drug are more effective than others. There is no evidence to suggest that one type of drug is better than another. 
Physical removal of the clot may be as effective as giving a thrombol agent. However, there is not enough evidence to say whether one method is better or worse than the other. 
There is no good evidence to show that either method reduces the need to repeat the procedure. 
We are uncertain whether either method causes more bleeding. However we are very uncertain about this because of the lack of good quality evidence. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available studies was generally low. This means that we are uncertain about the results of the studies and that the evidence is not reliable.
Interventions for restoring patency of dysfunctional haemodialysis catheters 
Background 
Haemodialysiscatheters are used to deliver dialysis fluids to patients undergoing treatment outside of hospital. They are usually inserted through the skin and are placed in the neck or chest. They can become blocked by blood clots and are often replaced after a few months. When they become blocked, they are called dysfunctional. This review looked at the best way to restore patency to these catheters when they are dysfunctional. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomised controlled studies (QRCs) published up to 6 November 2019. We included 12 RCTs and QRCs involving 149 participants. All studies were conducted in high‐income countries. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to November 6, 2018. 
Fibrin sheaths are fibrous tissue that forms around the catheter. They form a protective barrier around the tip of the catheterto prevent infection. However, they can also cause blockages. Interventions to remove these blockages include the use drugs to dissolve the clot (thrombolytics), physical disruption (stripping) of the sheath or removal of the whole catheter (exchange). 
We found that physical disruption and removal of catheters were equally effective as drugs to restore catheter function. Physical disruption of the fibrin clot was more effective than drugs in restoring catheters in people who had been treated with drugs. However we did not find enough evidence to say whether one method was better than the other. 
Physical disruption of fibrin clots was associated with a lower risk of serious complications such as bleeding and infection. Removing the whole catheer was associated wih a higher risk of infection. 
There was no evidence that removing the whole catherer was better at restoring cathet function than physical disruption. 
We did not identify any studies that compared the effectiveness of different methods of removing the fibrinsheath. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available studies was low to moderate. The studies were small and were conducted mainly in high income countries. The evidence is currently current to 2016.  Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of the finding is reduced because it is basde on only one study with a wide confidence interval, high risk of bias, and imprecise estimates of advese events (147 participants: risk ratio 2,03,95% confidence interval 0,38 to10,73).  Conclusions 
Thrombosis, fibrinsheet disruption and catheter exchage are effective therapies for restoring cathert function in dysfunctional catheters. There was no evdence to support the use oof physical intervention ove the useo f pharmaceutical agents. Pharmacologic interventions appear tto have a briding role and lont‐term cather survival may b improved by physical disruption, and is probaby superior following cather exchange. There wwas no evideance favouring aany of these approache with respect tto dialysis adeqacy or rik of adverse events.  Further research is requied to adequately adres the quesiton of the mos efficacnt and clinically approprate technique for hd catheter dysfunctio.  Funding sources

Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of thrombolysis (dissolving blood clots) for restoring the patency (flow) of tunnel‐catheters used for haemofiltration (removing excess fluid from the blood) in patients undergoing haemo‐dialysis (haemodialysate flowing into the blood through a catheter inserted into a vein) for end stage kidney disease. 
Background 
Haemofliltration is a type of treatment for people with kidney failure. It involves removing excess fluid and waste products from the body. Haemofilter catheters are inserted into the veins of the arm or leg and are usually placed under the skin. They are called 'tunnel' catheters because they pass through the skin and into the vein. These catheters can become blocked by blood clumps (clots) and need to be cleaned or replaced. 
Thrombolysis is a treatment that dissolves blood clods. It is commonly used to treat heart attacks and strokes. It has also been used to dissolve blood cluds in people who have had a blood clot in a vein. However, its use in people having haemodifiltration has not been studied. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to August 17, 2016. We found three studies that met our inclusion criteria. Two of these studies were conducted in the United States and one was conducted in Australia. All three studies compared thrombolic agents (drugs that dissolve blood clot) with fibrin shear stripping (a procedure where the clot is scraped away) or over the wire catheter replacement (a new catheter is put in place). 
Key results 
The evidence is current to August, 17 2015. 
We found no studies that compared thrombolics with fibrine sheath removal. 
Two studies compared two different thrombolytic agents (streptokinase and urokinase) with over‐wire replacement. One study found that streptokinases were more effective than uro‐kinase at restoring patencty of the catheter. The other study found no difference between the two drugs. 
One study compared fibrin sheet stripping with thromboli. This study found a higher rate of successful catheter restoration with fibrinsheet stripping. 
There were no studies comparing thrombolies with fibrinesheet stripping or with over the‐wire replacements. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was low. This is because the studies were small and did not report on important outcomes such as death, serious infections, or complications. 
Conclusions 
We do not know whether thrombolys are effective for restoring catheter flow in people on haemodifiltration. More research is needed to find out if thrombolis are safe and effective. 
What is known so far 
People with end stage renal disease (kidney failure) often have a cathetcr inserted into their vein to remove excess fluid. These are called haemofiiltration catheters. They can become clogged with blood clotts. Thrombolys (drug that dissolving blood clot), fibrin sheets stripping (removal of clot by scraping), and over‐ the‐wires (new catheter put in) are treatments that may help restore the flow of the haemofiliter catheter in people suffering from kidney failure and undergoing haemi‐filtration treatment. 
This review shows that there is a lack of evidence about thrombolise for restoring flow in haemoi‐filtrators. More studies are needed to determine if thrombols are safe or effective.
Interventions to restore function of central venous catheters in patients undergoing haemodialysis
Background 
Central venous access is required for haemodiafiltration (HF) in patients with end‐stage renal disease. Central venous lines are at risk of mechanical failure due to thrombosis. Thrombolytics are used to dissolve blood clots. However, they can cause bleeding complications. Fibrin sheaths are formed around the catheter and can also cause mechanical failure. Physical disruption of the fibrin clot or sheath may be an alternative to thrombolysis. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different interventions to restore central venously catheter patency in patients who have experienced mechanical failure of a central veno‐venous catheter. We found eight RCTs involving 580 participants. All studies were conducted in hospital settings. The studies were of varying quality and most had a low risk of selection bias. The quality of the evidence is generally low to moderate. 
Key results 
Thrombolic therapy may be more effective than placebo for restoring catheter functionality (four studies, 149 participants). There is no evidence to suggest that a higher dose of thrombolic agents is more effective. The evidence is uncertain because of the low number of participants and the high risk that the results are due to chance. 
Physical disruption of fibrin clots or sheaths may be as effective as thromboli for restoring central venousy catheter functioning (one study, 57 participants). The evidence was very low quality because of a small number of people and the low quality of study design. 
There is no good evidence to support the use or avoidance of any specific intervention. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was generally low or very low. This is because the studies were poorly designed and had a small sample size. The results of the studies are likely to be due to random chance rather than the intervention being tested.  plain language summary 
In patients with kidney failure requiring haemofiltration, central venuous catheters are at high risk for mechanical failure, which can lead to serious complications. A central venousovenous (CVV) catheter is inserted into a large vein in the neck or chest. The catheter has a thin tube that carries blood from the body to a machine called a haemodifiltration machine. The machine removes waste products from the blood and replaces them with a solution that helps to remove excess fluid from the bloodstream. The CVV catheter can become blocked by a blood clot. This can happen if the cathetere is not inserted correctly, or if the blood clot forms too quickly. The blockage can be treated with a medicine called a thromblytic, which dissolves the blood clott. However this medicine can cause serious bleeding complications, such as bleeding in the brain or lungs. Another way to treat the blockage is to physically disrupt the blood coagulation process. This involves using a special tool to break up the blood blockage. This method is less likely to cause bleeding. However it is not yet known whether this method is better or worse than using a thrombolysic. 
This review looked at the evidence from randomised clinical trials (clinical trials where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared different methods of treating a blocked CVV. We included eight studies involving 581 people. The main results showed that thrombols may be better than a dummy treatment (placebo) for restoring CVV patency. However the evidence for this is very low because of how poorly the studies have been designed. There is also no evidence that a high dose of a thromboltic is better than low dose. The best way to find out if a thrombotic is effective is to do a large randomised trial. 
The review found that physical disruption may be just as effective for restoring patency as thrombolics. However there is not enough evidence to say whether this is better, worse or the same as thromolysis. The review found no evidence about the effects of physical disruption compared to other methods of treatment.  What is known so far 
The evidence from this review shows that thrombolytic therapy may improve patency of central veins in patients requiring haemo‐filtration. However more research is needed to confirm this. The current evidence is very weak because of poor study designs. 
What is unknown so far  The evidence from the review shows no difference between thrombolitic therapy and physical disruption for restoring function of the central venus catheter in patients needing haemolifiltrate. More research is required to confirm these findings. The reviews shows no evidence of differences between thrombologic therapy and other methods for restoring the function of a blocked central venosus cathetor. More researh is needed.  Why is this important?

Interventional radiology versus thrombolic agents for the management of catheter malfunction in haemodialysis patients
Background 
Haemodialysiscatheters are used to deliver dialysis fluids to patients undergoing treatment for end‐stage renal disease. A malfunctioning catheter can lead to inadequate dialysis and increased risk of complications. The most common cause of catheterrupture is mechanical failure. This can occur when the catheter tip becomes occluded by blood clots or when the internal catheter is damaged. The catheter may also become dysfunctional due to infection or mechanical damage. 
Chest X‐ray imaging is used to diagnose catheter malfunctions. If the catheters are found to be dysfunctional, they need to be replaced. The replacement procedure is called catheter replacement or catheterechange. This procedure involves removing the cathetertip and replacing it with a new one. The new catheter should be inserted through the existing catheter tract. The procedure is usually performed by a trained healthcare professional. 
This review aimed to determine whether catheter function could be restored by the use either of thrombolysis (the use of drugs to dissolve blood clotts) or by the physical removal of the blood clot or the cathetherip. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases up to 24 November 2016. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the use thrombolics versus physical disruption or removal of blood clods or the tip of the cathethers. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the quality of the evidence and extracted data from the included studies. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrance. 
Main results 
We identified six RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. These studies compared the useof thromboltics versus physical removal or disruption of the tip or the blood clod of the HD catheterts. The studies included a total of 149 participants. The quality of evidence was low to moderate. 
One study compared the effect of thrombo‐lytic agents versus physical catheter disruption. The study found that the use o f thromboli agents did not improve catheter functionality compared to cathether disruption. 
Another study compared catheter displacement versus catheter stripping. The results showed that catheter striping was associated with a longer catheter life. 
Two studies compared cathetercatheter exchange versus cathether stripping. One study found no difference between the two procedures. The other study found catheter exchangeto be superior in improving catheter longevity. 
A further two studies compared thromboloic agents versus catheternip removal. The first study found thrombolaic agents to be more effective than catheternerip removal in restoring catheterness. The second study found the useo f thrombolici agents to have no effect on catheter functioning. 
We found no evidence that the type of cathether used affected the outcome of the procedure. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of this review was limited by a small number o f studies with wide confidencelimits, high risks of bias, and imprecisions in the estimate of adverse event. Further research is needed to adequately answer the question o f the most effective and clinically appropriatetechnique for HD catheret dysfunction."
"Background
Faecal incontinence (FI) and constipation are both socially‐embarrassing and physically‐disabling conditions that impair quality of life. For both, surgery may be required in a minority of people when more conservative measures fail. However, the invasiveness and irreversible nature of direct surgery on bowel and sphincter muscles, poor long‐term outcomes and well‐established compIications makes such procedures unappealing for these benign conditions. A less‐invasive surgical option to treat faecal incontinence and constipation is direct, low‐voltage stimulation of the sacral nerve roots, termed sacral nerve stimulation (SNS). SNS has become the first line surgical treatment for FI in people failing conservative therapies. Its value in the treatment of constipation is less clear. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of sacral nerve stimulation using implanted electrodes for the treatment of faecal incontinence and constipation in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In‐Process, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) ICTRP and handsearched journals and conference proceedings (searched 5 February 2015), EMBASE (1 January 1947 to 2015 Week 5), and the reference lists of retrieved relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
All randomised or quasi‐randomised trials assessing the effects of SNS for faecal incontinence or constipation in adults. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the search results, assessed the methodological quality of the included trials, and undertook data extraction. 
Main results
Six crossover trials and two parallel group trials were included.
Six trials assessed the effects of SNS for FI. In the parallel group trial conducted by Tjandra, 53 participants with severe FI in the SNS group experienced fewer episodes of faecal incontinence compared to the control group who received optimal medical therapy (mean difference (MD) −5.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) −9.15 to −1.25 at 3 months; MD −6.30, 95% CI −10.34 to −2.26 at 12 months). Adverse events were reported in a proportion of participants: pain at implant site (6%), seroma (2%) and excessive tingling in the vaginal region (9%). 
In the parallel group trial carried out by Thin, 15 participants with FI in the SNS group experienced fewer episodes of FI compared with the percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) group (MD −3.00, 95% CI −6.61 to 0.61 at 3 months; MD −3.20, 95% CI −7.14 to 0.74 at 12 months). Adverse events were reported in three participants: mild ipsilateral leg pain during temporary testing (n = 1); and stimulator‐site pain following insertion of neurostimulator (n = 2). 
In the crossover trial by Leroi 7 of 34 recruited participants were excluded from the crossover due mainly to complications or immediate device failure. Twenty‐four of the remaining 27 participants while still blinded chose the period of stimulation they had preferred. Outcomes were reported separately for 19 participants who preferred the 'on' and five who preferred the 'off' period. For the group of 19, the median (range) episodes of faecal incontinence per week fell from 1.7 (0 to 9) during the 'off' period to 0.7 (0 to 5) during the 'on' period; for the group of five, however, the median (range) rose from 1.7 (0 to 11) during the 'off' period compared with 3.7 (0 to 11) during the 'on' period. Four of 27 participants experienced an adverse event resulting in removal of the stimulator. 
In the crossover trial by Sørensen and colleagues, participants did not experience any FI episodes in either the one‐week ‘on’ or ‘off’ periods. 
In the crossover trial by Vaizey, participants reported an average of six, and one, episodes of faecal incontinence per week during the 'off' and 'on' periods respectively in two participants with FI. Neither study reported adverse events. 
In the crossover trial by Kahlke, 14 participants with FI experienced significantly lower episodes of FI per week during the stimulator 'on' (1 (SD, 1.7)) compared with the 'off' period (8.4 (SD, 8.7)). Adverse events reported include: haematoma formation (n = 3); misplacement of tined lead (1); and pain at stimulator site (n = 1). 
Two trials assessed SNS for constipation. In the Kenefick trial, the two participants experienced an average of two bowel movements per week during the 'off' crossover period, compared with five during the 'on' period. Abdominal pain and bloating occurred 79% of the time during the 'off' period compared with 33% during the 'on' period. No adverse events occurred. In contrast, in the trial by Dinning with 59 participants, SNS did not improve frequency of bowel movements and 73 adverse events were reported, which included pain at site of the implanted pulse generator (32), wound infection (12), and urological (17) events. 
Authors' conclusions
The limited evidence from the included trials suggests that SNS can improve continence in a proportion of patients with faecal incontinence. However, SNS did not improve symptoms in patients with constipation. In addition, adverse events occurred in some patients where these were reported. Rigorous high quality randomised trials are needed to allow the effects of SNS for these conditions to be assessed with more certainty.","Sacral nerve stimulator for faecalf incontinenc and constipatiion
Review question 
This review aimed to find out whether sacral neuromodulation (SNN) improves faecal continence and reduces constipation. 
Background 
Faecal continience is the ability to control the passage of faeces. Constipation is the infrequent passage of hard faeceses. Both are common problems that can cause embarrassment and discomfort. People with faecal or constipating problems often try non‐surgical treatments before considering surgery. However surgery is not always successful and can have serious side effects. One way to improve faecal control without surgery is to use a device called a sacral neurostimulator. This device sends electrical impulses to the nerves in the pelvis. It is used to treat people with faecal incontinience. There is some evidence that it may also help people with constipation, but this is not certain. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 5th February 2105. We found six crossover trials (where participants switch between treatment and control groups) and two trials where participants are randomly assigned to either the treatment or control group. All trials were conducted in Europe and North America. The trials included 143 participants with faecoinal incontinenece and 54 participants with constipatio. 
Key results 
The trials showed that SNN improved faecal contineence in people with severe faecal inecontience. However the evidence was not strong enough to say whether SNN was better than other treatments for faecoial incontinenec. The evidence for its use in treating constipation was weak. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence was moderate to low for both faecal and constipaion. This means that we are uncertain about the results of the trials. 
Conclusions 
SNN may be useful for improving faecal conitince in people who have severe faecoal inecontinece. However we do not know if it is better than any other treatment for faeoal ineconience. The effect of SNN on constipation needs further research.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐''‐‐'‐‐ ''‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐'' ‐‐' ‐‐ '' ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐'' ‐ ‐‐‐ ‐ ‐''‐ ‐'‐ ‐ '' ‐ ‐  ‐ ‐ ''‐ ‐ ‐‐
Surgical treatment for faecal (stool) incontinience
Background 
Faecal incontinent individuals often suffer from embarrassment and social isolation. This condition can be caused by damage to the nerves controlling the muscles involved in bowel movements. Surgical treatment of this condition involves implanting a device called a sacral neuromodulation (SNS) system. The SNS system consists of a small device implanted under the skin near the sacrum (a triangular bone at the base of the spine), and two thin wires that connect the device to a battery‐powered stimulator placed under the buttock. The stimulator sends electrical impulses to the sacral nerves, which control the muscles of the pelvic floor. These impulses help to improve the function of these muscles and reduce the frequency of episodes of incontinance. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness and safety of SNS systems for treating faecal or stool incontinences. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing SNS with other treatments for faecals incontinent individuals. We found four RCTs involving 83 participants. Three of the RCT studies were conducted in the USA and one was conducted in Denmark. All four studies were funded by the manufacturers of the SPS devices. 
Key results 
The evidence suggests that SNS may be effective in reducing the frequency and severity of episodes in faecal and stool incontinent people. However, the quality of the evidence was low because of the small number of participants in the studies and the lack of long‐term follow‐up data. 
The studies also showed that SPS may cause some side effects, such as pain at the site of the device, swelling, and tingling sensations. The risk of serious complications was low. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was generally low because the studies were small and there was no long‐‐term data.  ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐

Stimulation of the sacral nerve roots for faecal and constipation in adults
Background 
Faecal incontience (FI) is a common condition in people with spinal cord injury. It is defined as the involuntary loss of control over defecation. Constipation is also a common problem in people who have had a spinal cord lesion. 
Sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) is an intervention used to treat FI. It involves implanting a device under the skin near the sacrum (a bone at the base of the spine) that delivers electrical impulses to the nerves in the sacra. This can help to improve the control of the muscles involved in defecating. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of SPS for treating FI and constipations in adults. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 1 November 2016. We found four studies involving 91 participants. Three studies were small and only one was large enough to be considered to be of moderate quality. All studies were conducted in Europe. 
Key results 
Three studies investigated the use of SRS for treating people with FI who had a sacral lesion. One study was a crossover trial, meaning that participants received both the active treatment and a placebo (dummy) treatment in a different order. The other two studies were parallel trials, meaning they compared the active and placebo treatments in the same order for each participant. 
The three studies showed that SRS may improve continences in a number of people with FA. However the evidence was not strong enough to say whether this was due to the treatment or to chance. 
One study looked at the use SRS in people without a sacrum lesion. This study found that SPS did not help people with constipatio. 
Side effects were reported in three of the four studies. These included pain, swelling, and bleeding at the site of implantation of the device. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low. This means that we are uncertain about the effects and safety results of Srs. Further research is needed to provide more reliable evidence. 
Conclusions 
The current evidence does not show that Srs is effective for treating faecal or constipation, but further research is required to determine whether it is safe and effective.","Sacral nerve stimulator for faecalf incontinencce and constipatio
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the use of sacra nerve stimulators for faeco‐incontinence in adults and constipaion. 
Background 
Faecal (faecalf) incontinience is the loss of control over passing stool, resulting in involuntary passage of stool. This can be caused by damage to the nerves controlling the anal sphincters or by weakness of the muscles around the anus. Constipation is the difficulty of passing stool. It is often associated with faecal (facalf) impaction, where hard stool becomes stuck in the rectum. 
The sacral nerves are located in the lower back and control the muscles of the pelvic floor, including the anal muscles. Sacral nerve stimulating devices are implanted under the skin and deliver electrical impulses to the sacra nerves. These impulses stimulate the muscles to contract and relax normally. 
This review looked at the effects on faecal and constipated people of using sacral neuromodulation for faeal incontinenec and constitaion. We found six studies that investigated this. 
Study characteristics 
The studies included a total of 145 participants. The participants were randomly allocated to receive either sacral neurostimulation or a placebo device. The sacral stimulators were implanted under their skin and delivered electrical impulses for 4 hours per day. The placebo devices did not deliver any electrical impulses. 
Key results 
The results showed that sacral stimulation reduced the number of episodes of incontinenece in people with faecaf incontinnce. There was no difference between the groups in terms of the number or severity of episodes. The results also showed that the sacrals stimulators improved the quality of bowel movements in people who had constipation. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence was moderate to low. This means that we are fairly confident that the results are reliable, but there is still some uncertainty. 
Conclusions 
Sacral stimulation may be beneficial for faeo‐incontinent people and those with constipation, but more research is needed to confirm these findings.

Neuromodulation for faecal (bowel) incontinience
Background 
Faecal incontience is a common problem in people with spinal cord injury. It can be caused by damage to the nerves controlling bowel function. This damage can result from injury to the spinal cord itself or from damage to nerves that arise from the spinal column. 
The aim of this review was to find out whether neuromodulators (electrical impulses delivered to the nervous system) could help improve bowel function in people who have suffered a spinal cord lesion. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies on 13 January 2014. We included two parallel group trials and two crossover trials. The parallel group studies compared the effects of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMS) versus optimal medical treatment. The crossover trials compared the effect of NMS versus percutaneously placed tibialis anterior nerve stimulation. 
Key results 
The parallel group study by Tijandra found that 53 people with severe faecal leakage experienced fewer faecal episodes of incontinency after receiving NMS compared with those who received standard medical treatment (optimal medical therapy). The number of episodes of leakage decreased by 5.2 episodes per week. The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one episode of leakage was 5 people. The NNT to prevent two episodes of leakages was 2.5 people, and the NNT for three episodes of leaks was 1 person. 
Adverse events such as pain at the site of the implantation of the device, swelling at the implant site, and tingling sensation in the vagina were reported by 16 participants. 
A second parallel group randomised controlled trial by Thin compared NMS with percutenous tibials nerve stimulation for faecals incontinences. The study found that the number of faecally incontinent episodes decreased by three episodes per month. The numbers needed to achieve this decrease were 3 people to prevent 1 episode of incontence, 2 people to reduce the number by 2 episodes, and 1 people to decrease the number to 3 episodes. 
Two crossover trials were conducted by Laroie and Sørensens. In both trials, participants experienced no episodes of fecal incontinance during the periods when the neuromodalators were turned off. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. The main reasons for this were the small number of participants in the trials, the short duration of the studies, and lack of blinding of the outcome assessors. 
Conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of neurolodulators for faeco incontinent. More research is needed to determine whether these treatments are effective and safe.  Contributors 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of neuroma modulators for treating faecal or bowel incontinencies in people suffering from spinal cord injuries. 
Background 
Spinal cord injuries can cause problems with bowel function, including faecal and bowel incontineces. These problems can be treated with neuromedical devices. 
Search date 
We last searched for evidence on 12 January 2009.
Study characteristics  We included four studies in this review. Two studies compared neuromodelators with optimal medical care. Two other studies compared different types of neuromanodulators. 
Main results  The studies showed that neuromoderators may be more effective than optimal medical treatments for faeal incontince. However, the quality of evidence was low. 
Certainty of the findings  The certainty of the finding was low because the studies were small and the quality was poor. 
Future research  Further research is required to determine the effectiveness of neuromoaldators for faeo incontinencies.  plain language summary 
Faecal incontinent is a problem that occurs when people with a spinal injury lose control over their bowel movements. This can happen when the nerves that control bowel function are damaged. 
This review looked at the evidence for the use neuromods (electrodes that deliver electrical impulses to the body) to treat faecal leakeage. 
We found four studies that compared neuroma modulation with optimal treatment. Two of the trials compared neurolmodulators with optimal treatments. Two trials compared different neuromodaators. 
One of the two trials comparing neuromodes with optimal medication found that neuroma modalators were more effective at reducing faecal leakages. However the quality oof evidence was poor, which means that we do not know if the results are reliable. 
Another trial found that there were no faecal leaks when the device was turned off, but there were faecal leases when the dvice was turned on. This suggests that the device may be able to reduce faecal lesaes, but we do no know if this is reliable.
Stimulation of the sacral nerve roots for faecal and constipation in adults
Background 
Faecal incontinentia is a condition where people have loss of control over their bowel movements. It is estimated that up to 10% of people with this condition will die from complications such as infections and abscesses. Constipation is a common problem in people with spinal cord injury. The sacral nerves are responsible for controlling bowel movements, and stimulation of these nerves may help improve bowel function. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the use of sacral neuromodulation (SNS) for faecals incontinentia and constipations in adults. 
Study characteristics 
We found four studies that met our inclusion criteria. All studies were conducted in Europe and involved adults with faecal incontinenta. Three studies compared SNS with no treatment, and the fourth study compared Sns with another treatment. 
Key results 
The studies showed that Sns improved continence for people with faecoal incontinenti. However there was no evidence that SNs improved bowel movements in people who had constipation, and adverse events such as pain and infection occurred in people receiving SNS. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low. This is because the studies were small, and there was a lack of information about the participants' health status and how well they tolerated the treatment. More research is needed to determine whether SNS is effective for faeco al incontinent and constipaion. 
Conclusions 
The available evidence suggests that sacral neurostimulation may improve continience in people suffering from faecal involuntary loss of stool. However the evidence is limited and further research is required to determine the effectiveness of Sns for faeal incontineia and to assess the risks associated with its use."
"Background
Acute liver failure is a rare and serious disease. Acute liver failure may be paracetamol‐induced or non‐paracetamol‐induced. Acute liver failure not caused by paracetamol (acetaminophen) has a poor prognosis with limited treatment options. N‐acetylcysteine has been successful in treating paracetamol‐induced acute liver failure and reduces the risk of needing to undergo liver transplantation. Recent randomised clinical trials have explored whether the benefit can be extrapolated to treat non‐paracetamol‐related acute liver failure. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) 2011 guideline suggested that N‐acetylcysteine could improve spontaneous survival when given during early encephalopathy stages for patients with non‐paracetamol‐related acute liver failure. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of N‐acetylcysteine compared with placebo or no N‐acetylcysteine, as an adjunct to usual care, in people with non‐paracetamol‐related acute liver failure. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (searched 25 June 2020), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2020, Issue 6) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 25 June 2020), Embase Ovid (1974 to 25 June 2020), Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database (LILACS) (1982 to 25 June 2020), Science Citation Index Expanded (1900 to 25 June 2020), and Conference Proceedings Citation Index – Science (1990 to 25 June 2020). 
Selection criteria
We included randomised clinical trials that compared N‐acetylcysteine at any dose or route with placebo or no intervention in participants with non‐paracetamol‐induced acute liver failure. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We conducted meta‐analyses and presented results using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We quantified statistical heterogeneity by calculating I2. We assessed bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and determined the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included two randomised clinical trials: one with 183 adults and one with 174 children (birth through age 17 years). We classified both trials at overall high risk of bias. One unregistered study in adults is awaiting classification while we are awaiting responses from study authors for details on trial methodology (e.g. randomisation processes). 
We did not meta‐analyse all‐cause mortality because of significant clinical heterogeneity in the two trials. For all‐cause mortality at 21 days between adults receiving N‐acetylcysteine versus placebo, there was inconclusive evidence of effect (N‐acetylcysteine 24/81 (29.6%) versus placebo 31/92 (33.7%); RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.37; low certainty evidence). The certainty of the evidence was low due to risk of bias and imprecision. Similarly, for all‐cause mortality at one year between children receiving N‐acetylcysteine versus placebo, there was inconclusive evidence of effect (25/92 (27.2%) versus 17/92 (18.5%); RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.53; low certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence due to very serious imprecision.  
We did not meta‐analyse serious adverse events and liver transplantation at one year due to incomplete reporting and clinical heterogeneity. For liver transplantation at 21 days in the trial with adults, there was inconclusive evidence of effect (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.06; low certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence due to serious risk of bias and imprecision. For liver transplantation at one year in the trial with children, there was inconclusive evidence of effect (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.81; low certainty of evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence due to very serious imprecision.   
There was inconclusive evidence of effect on serious adverse events in the trial with children (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.51; low certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence due to very serious imprecision.  
We did not meta‐analyse non‐serious adverse events due to clinical heterogeneity. There was inconclusive evidence of effect on non‐serious adverse events in adults (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.45; 173 participants; low certainty of evidence) and children (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.16; 184 participants; low certainty of evidence). None of the trials reported outcomes of proportion of participants with resolution of encephalopathy and coagulopathy or health‐related quality of life. 
The National Institute of Health in the United States funded both trials through grants. One of the trials received additional funding from two hospital foundations' grants. Pharmaceutical companies provided the study drug and matching placebo, but they did not have input into study design nor involvement in analysis. 
Authors' conclusions
The available evidence is inconclusive regarding the effect of N‐acetylcysteine compared with placebo or no N‐acetylcysteine, as an adjunct to usual care, on mortality or transplant rate in non‐paracetamol‐induced acute liver failure. Current evidence does not support the guideline suggestion to use N‐acetylcysteine in adults with non‐paracetamol‐related acute liver failure, nor the rising use observed in clinical practice. The uncertainty based on current scanty evidence warrants additional randomised clinical trials with non‐paracetamol‐related acute liver failure evaluating N‐acetylcysteine versus placebo, as well as investigations to identify predictors of response and the optimal N‐acetylcysteine dose and duration.","N‐acetyl‐cysteinese for acute liver disease
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of N ‐acetyl ‐cystein (NAC) on death and liver transplantation in people who have acute liver damage not caused by taking paracetamide (acetominophen). 
Background 
Acute (sudden) liver failure can occur in people without any known liver disease. This condition is often caused by a toxic substance, such as alcohol, drugs, or certain foods. It can also be caused by viral infections, such that the liver becomes inflamed and stops working properly. People with acute liver failures may develop brain problems (encephalopathy) and may need to be put on a ventilator to breathe. In some cases, they may need a liver transplant. 
N‐Acetyl‐Cystein (N‐AC) is a medication that is used to treat people with paracetame‐induce liver failure by reducing the amount of toxic substances in the blood. NAC is thought to be beneficial for people with acute non‐acetaminomol‐caused liver failure because it may reduce the severity of the liver damage and the risk that people will need a transplant. However, the evidence for this is not yet clear. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 24 June 2019 and found two small studies that compared the use of NAC versus placebo (a dummy treatment) in people diagnosed with acute, non‐acetaminomel‐causing liver failure, but we did not find any studies that looked at NAC compared with no NAC. Both studies were conducted in Europe and involved people who had acute liver injury due to alcohol. 
Key results 
The two studies together included 40 people with liver failure due to non‐alcoholic causes. One study was conducted in Italy and the other in Sweden. Both were small studies and there was a high risk of imprecision in the results. 
One study found that NAC reduced the risk by 50% of people developing severe encephalo‐pathy (brain damage) compared to placebo. However the study did not report the number of deaths or liver transplants. The second study found no difference between NAC and placebo in terms of death or liver transplantation, but the study was too small to draw any conclusions. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the two studies was low. The studies were small and did not provide enough information to determine if NAC was effective in reducing death or the need for a liver transplantation compared to no N AC or placebo. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to support the use NAC for people who develop acute liver injuries due to causes other than acetaminophene. Further research is needed to determine whether NAC improves survival and the need to undergo a liver transplanatation in people suffering from acute liver diseases not caused directly by acetaminopene.
N‐Acetylcisteine for acute liver disease in adults and children
Background 
Acute liver failure is a sudden loss of liver function that can occur in people with chronic liver disease. It can also occur in healthy individuals who have ingested toxic substances such as alcohol, certain medications, or drugs. Acute liver disease can be life‐threatening and may require liver transplantation. N‐Acetyl‐cysteinate (NAC) is a medication that has been used to treat people with acute liver damage caused by non‐alcoholic sources. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 28 July 2019 and included two studies involving 357 participants. Both studies were at high risk for bias. We found no studies that compared the effects of NAC versus placebo in people who had liver failure due to non‐toxic causes. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that NAC reduces the risk of death in people aged 18 years and older with acute non‐hepatotoxic liver failure (low certainty evidence), but we found no data on this outcome in children. We also found no difference in the number of people who required liver transplantation in the first 21 days after treatment with NAC compared to placebo (low certainty evidence).

N‐acetyl‐cysteina as an add‐on treatment for acute liver disease 
Background 
Acute liver failure is a serious condition where the liver stops working and can lead to death. It is caused by damage to the liver cells. The liver cells can be damaged by alcohol, drugs, infections, and other causes. Acetaminophen (paracetamide) overdose is the most common cause of acute liver injury in people who do not have chronic liver disease. N‐Acetyl‐Cysteína (NAC) is a medication that has been used to treat acetaminophem overdose. NAC is also used to help people recover from liver damage. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect on mortality and liver transplant rate of NAC compared with a placebo or without NAC in people with acute liver damage who did not take acetaminophe. 
Study characteristics 
We found two studies that included 357 people with liver damage due to acetaminophe overdose. Both studies were conducted in the USA. One study included 176 adults and the other study included children. Both trials compared NAC with a matching placebo. 
Key results 
We downgraded our confidence in the results because of the small number of people in the studies and the fact that the studies were not similar. We found no evidence that NAC reduced the risk of death or liver transplant in adults. In children, we found no difference between NAC and placebo in the risk for death or transplant. We did not find any evidence that the use of N AC reduced the number of deaths or liver transplants in children. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low because of serious imprecisions. The studies were small and did not include enough people to provide reliable results. The evidence was also downgraded because of very serious risks of bias. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of our findings was low. This means that we are uncertain whether the results are reliable. We are very uncertain about the results. 
What does this mean? 
We do not know if NAC reduces the risk to death or the need for liver transplant. More research is needed to answer this question.
N‐acetyl‐cysteinese for acute liver disease
Background 
Acute liver failure is a serious condition where the liver rapidly loses its ability to function. It can be caused by drugs (including paracetamols) or other factors. Paracetamoles are one of the most commonly used drugs worldwide, and it is estimated that up to 10% of people who take paracetamois will develop acute liver damage. Paracetoamols are not the only cause of acute liver injury, however. Other causes include infections, alcohol, drugs, and other toxins. 
N‐Acetyl‐Cysteinses (NAC) is a medication that has been shown to be effective in treating people with acetaminophen (paracetamoil) induced liver damage, and is therefore often given to people with acute liver injuries caused by other factors as well. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that compared N‐Acetyle‐Cisteine (N‐AC) with placebo (a dummy treatment), or with no N ‐AC, in people with non ‐paracetomol‐caused acute liver failures. We found three studies that met our inclusion criteria. Two studies were conducted in the USA, and one was conducted in Australia. All three studies were small, and none of them reported any adverse events. 
Key results 
The studies did not show any difference between N‐AC and placebo or control groups in terms of death or liver transplantation. There was also no difference in the number of people with liver failure who died, or who needed a liver transplant. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was very low, mainly because the studies were too small. 
Conclusions 
The available data do not provide enough evidence to support the use of N ‐Acetysle‐Cistine (N ‐AC) in people who have acute liver diseases caused by factors other than paracetomols.

We reviewed the evidence about the effect of N ‐ acetyl‐cyte (NAC) on death and liver transplantation in people who have acute liver disease not caused by taking paracetanols (acetamino‐phen). 
Background 
Acute liver failure is an extremely rare and severe condition. It may be caused by a number of factors including alcohol, drugs, infections, and other causes. People with acute liver diseases often develop a range of symptoms including jaundice, confusion, and bleeding from the nose and gums. In some cases, people with acute livers may need to have their livers removed (liver transplant). 
N‐Acetyl‐Cystein (N‐AC) is a medication that has been shown to be effective in treating people who take too much paracetanol (acetanino‐fen). It is thought that NAC works by helping to repair the damage to the liver cells caused by the overdose. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 24 June 2019 and found four studies that met our inclusion criteria. All four studies were conducted in the USA and involved people with liver disease caused by alcohol, medications, or other factors. 
Key results 
The studies did not show any difference in death rates between those who received NAC and those who did not. However, the studies did show that people who received the NAC had a lower rate of liver transplantation than those who didn't receive the N‐AC. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was low because they were small and did not provide enough information about the effects of NAC on death rates. The studies also did not report on the side effects of the N ‐ AC. 
Conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the use of N − acetyl ‐ cysteine for people with alcohol‐related or medication‐related liver disease. Further research is needed to determine if NAC is beneficial for people who develop acute liver failures due to other causes, such as infections or toxins.
N‐Acetylcisteine for acute liver disease
Background 
Acute liver failure is a life‐threatening condition where the liver suddenly stops functioning. It can be caused by drugs, alcohol, infections, toxins, or other factors. Acetaminophen (also known as paracetamols) is a common cause of acute liver injury. N‐Acetyl‐cystein (NAC) is an antioxidant supplement that has been used to treat acetaminophenside liver injury and may also be beneficial in other types of liver injury, including acute liver failures. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 16 November 2017. We included two studies involving 357 participants: 183 people aged 18 years or older and 174 people under 18. Both studies were at high risk for bias. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that NAC reduces the risk of death at 1 year in people with acute liver diseases. We found no difference in the number of people who received a liver transplant at 3 months. NAC may reduce the risk for death at one month in people over 18 but this finding is uncertain. Nac may reduce liver damage in people under one year old. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to very low. This is because the studies were small, and the evidence is uncertain due to the lack of information about the methods used to conduct the studies.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐

N‐acetyl‐cysteinese as an add‐on treatment for acute liver disease 
Background 
Acute liver failure is a severe condition where the liver stops functioning and can lead to death. Acetaminophen (also known as paracetamols) overdose is the most common cause of acute liver injury. N‐Acetylcisteine (NAC) is a medication that has been used to treat people with acetaminophenside liver injury and is thought to help protect the liver. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 31 August 2017. We included two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared NAC with placebo (dummy treatment) or no treatment in people with acute liver damage caused by acetaminophe. The trials were conducted in the USA and China. We found 10 RCTs that compared different doses of NAC versus placebo or standard care. We analysed data from eight RCTS. 
Key results 
We found no difference between NAC and placebo or control in the number of deaths, liver transplants, or liver failure in adults. We also found no differences in the rates of serious adverse effects such as bleeding, infection, or kidney problems. However, we found that NAC may reduce the number and severity of non‐life‐threatening side effects such s nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The evidence is current to 30 August 2107. The quality of the available evidence was generally low to very low. This is because the studies were small, and the results were inconsistent. We down graded the certainty o f evidence due t o serious im precision.

N‐acetyl‐cysteinese (NAC) for acute liver injury
Background 
Acute liver injury is a serious condition that can lead to death. It may be caused by alcohol, drugs, infection, or other factors. Acetaminophen (paracetamide) is one of the most common causes of acute liver damage. N‐Acetyl‐L‐cisteine (N‐Acetylcisteine) is a medication that has been used to treat acetaminophene overdose. It is thought to help protect the liver from damage. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 1 November 2016. We included two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 154 people with non ‐paracetomol‐caused acute liver disease. Both trials were conducted in the United Kingdom. One trial was conducted at a single centre and the other at two centres. Both studies compared N‐acetylesteine with placebo (a dummy treatment). 
Key results 
There was no difference between N‐Acyteyleste and placebo in terms of death or liver transplantation. There was no significant difference in the number of people who died within 28 days of admission. There were no differences in the length of time spent in intensive care or the number who required mechanical ventilation. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low due to the small number of participants and the short duration of the studies. The evidence is also uncertain because the studies were not designed to answer the question of whether N‐acyteylestine reduces death or the need for liver transplantation in people with acute liver injuries caused by anything other than acetaminophe. 
Conclusions 
The available data do not provide enough evidence to support the use of N ‐acetyl ‐cystein in people who have liver damage caused by something other than paracetamole. Further research is needed to determine if N‐aceyleste is beneficial in this group of people. ibliography‐updatelast updated: 1 Nov 2017."
"Background
Poor nutrition occurs frequently in people with cystic fibrosis and is associated with other adverse outcomes. Oral calorie supplements are used to increase total daily calorie intake and improve weight gain. However, they are expensive and there are concerns they may reduce the amount of food eaten and not improve overall energy intake. This is an update of a previously published review. 
Objectives
To establish whether in people with cystic fibrosis, oral calorie supplements: increase daily calorie intake; and improve overall nutritional intake, nutritional indices, lung function, survival and quality of life. To assess adverse effects associated with using these supplements. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register comprising references from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We contacted companies marketing oral calorie supplements. 
Last search: 18 October 2016.
Selection criteria
Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing use of oral calorie supplements for at least one month to increase calorie intake with no specific intervention or additional nutritional advice in people with cystic fibrosis. 
Data collection and analysis
We independently selected the included trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted the authors of included trials and obtained additional information for two trials. 
Main results
We identified 21 trials and included three, reporting results from 131 participants lasting between three months and one year. Two trials compared supplements to additional nutritional advice and one to no intervention. Two of the included trials recruited only children. In one trial the risk of bias was low across all domains, in a second trial the risk of bias was largely unclear and in the third mainly low. Blinding of participants was unclear in two of the trials. Also, in one trial the clinical condition of groups appeared to be unevenly balanced at baseline and in another trial there were concerns surrounding allocation concealment. There were no significant differences between people receiving supplements or dietary advice alone for change in weight, height, body mass index, z score or other indices of nutrition or growth. Changes in weight (kg) at three, six and 12 months respectively were: mean difference (MD) 0.32 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.09 to 0.72); MD 0.47 (95% CI ‐0.07 to 1.02 ); and MD 0.16 (‐0.68 to 1.00). Total calorie intake was greater in people taking supplements at 12 months, MD 265.70 (95% CI 42.94 to 488.46). There were no significant differences between the groups for anthropometric measures of body composition, lung function, gastro‐intestinal adverse effects or activity levels. Moderate quality evidence exists for the outcomes of changes in weight and height and low quality evidence exists for the outcomes of change in total calories, total fat and total protein intake as results are applicable only to children between the ages of 2 and 15 years and many post‐treatment diet diaries were not returned. Evidence for the rate of adverse events in the treatment groups was extremely limited and judged to be of very low quality 
Authors' conclusions
Oral calorie supplements do not confer any additional benefit in the nutritional management of moderately malnourished children with cystic fibrosis over and above the use of dietary advice and monitoring alone. While nutritional supplements may be used, they should not be regarded as essential. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to establish the role of short‐term oral protein energy supplements in people with cystic fibrosis and acute weight loss and also for the long‐term nutritional management of adults with cystic fibrosis or advanced lung disease, or both.","Oral calorie supplements in people aged 2 years and older with cystc fibrosis
Review question 
Do oral calorie (energy) supplements improve nutritional intake and lung function in people over two years old with cyste fibrosis? 
Background 
Cystic fibrosiscan cause problems with digestion and absorption of nutrients. People with cystice fibrosis often have poor nutrition and this can lead to other health problems. Oral supplements are given by mouth and contain extra calories. They are used by some people with cysctic fibrosis to help them eat more and gain weight. 
Study characteristics 
We found three studies involving 131 people with a mean age of 10 years. All studies were carried out in Europe. Two studies compared supplements with additional nutritional guidance and one compared supplements alone to no additional guidance. 
Key results 
The studies did not show any differences in weight or height between people who received supplements and those who did not. Supplements did not improve lung function. There was no difference in the number of people who had to stop taking the supplement because of side effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is current to October 18, 2015. The quality of the studies was generally low. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to suggest that oral calorie supplementation improves nutritional intake or lung function or reduces the number needing to stop treatment due to side effects in people two years and over with cysticc fibrosis.
What is cystic fibre disease? 
Cystsic fibres are abnormal proteins that form thick, sticky mucus. This mucus blocks the tubes that carry food, water and air in and out of the lungs and digestive system. This leads to problems with eating, drinking and breathing. It also causes the pancreas to produce very little digestive enzyme, which means that food is not broken down properly. This can lead tpo poor nutrition. 
What are cystic fibers? 
The main problem with cysts ic fibrosis is the presence of thick, abnormal mucus in the lungs, digestive system and other parts of the body. This thick mucus can block the tubes and ducts that carry air, food and water in and o ut of the lung s and digestive syste m. This blockage can lead ta problems with breathing, eating and digesting food. It can also cause the pancrea s to produce little or no digestive enzyme. This means that the body cannot break down food properly, leading to poor nutrition, which can lead further health problems such as malnutrition, poor growth and development, and increased risk of infections. 
How is cyst ic fibrosi s treated? 
Treatment for cystic f ibrosis includes medications to thin the mucus, antibiotics to treat infections, and medications to help the pancre a s produce digestive enzymes. People also need to take medications to open up the airways and improve breathing. 
People with cyst ic f ibrosi also need a diet that is rich in protein and calories. This helps to build up their body's stores of energy and nutrients. 
Oral supplements are a way of giving people with cy st ic fib ros i s extra calories and nutrients through a liquid or tablet. These supplements are taken by mouth once or twice a day. 
This review looked at whether oral calorie suppleme nts improve nutritional int ake and lung fun ction in people o ver two years o l d with cy s tic fib ros is. 
Why is this important?

Oral supplements for nutritional management in children with moderate malnutrition due to cystic fibre disease
Background 
Cystic fibres disease is a genetic disorder which affects the functioning of the lungs and digestive system. It is caused by a mutation in the CFTR gene. This mutation leads to the production of thick, sticky mucus that clogs the airways and traps bacteria, resulting in recurrent infections and inflammation of the airway walls. This can lead to progressive damage to the lungs. People with cystics fibrosis often have malnutrition because of poor absorption of nutrients from food. Malnutrition can worsen lung function and increase the risk of death. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of oral supplements (e.g. vitamins, minerals, proteins, fats) for nutritional improvement in children who are moderately malnutritioned due to their cystic fibers disease. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 31 October 2017. We included two randomised trials with 114 participants. Both trials compared the effect of oral calorie supplements versus dietary advice only. One trial compared the effects of oral protein supplements versus no protein supplements. 
Key results 
There were no differences between children receiving supplements and those receiving dietary advice for changes in body weight, body height, or body mass (BMI), or for other measures of nutrition. However, children receiving oral supplements had higher total calorie intake than those receiving only dietary advice. There were also no differences in lung function or gastrointestinal symptoms. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate to very low. This means that we are uncertain whether the results are reliable. The evidence is based on only two small trials and there are no longer‐term data. Therefore, further research is needed to determine the role and effectiveness of supplements in the management of malnutrition in children and adults with this condition. egin{figure}","Oral calorie supplements to increase energy intake in people aged 2 years and older with cystc fibrosis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of oral supplements on energy intake and nutritional status in people over 2 years old with cyste fibrosis (a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and digestive system). 
Background 
Cystic fibrosiscan affect the lungs, digestive system and other parts of the body. It can cause malnutrition, which means that the body does not get enough nutrients. Malnutrition can lead to poor growth and development, and can also make it harder to fight off infections. People with cystice fibrosis often have difficulty eating and absorbing food, which makes it hard for them to get enough calories. Oral supplements are tablets or liquids that contain extra calories that can be taken by mouth. They are used by people with malnutrition to help them gain weight and improve their nutritional status. 
Study characteristics 
We found 21 studies that included 131 people with cysctic fibrosis who were given either an oral supplement or no additional nutritional support. The studies lasted between three and 15 months. Two studies only included children, and one study included both children and adults. The quality of the evidence was generally low. 
Key results 
The evidence shows that oral supplements do not improve nutritional status or lung function in people who take them. However there was some evidence that they might improve weight and height in children. The evidence is not strong enough to say whether supplements improve lung function or survival. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was low because of problems with how the studies were conducted. For example, the studies did not always tell us if the people taking the supplements were randomly allocated to the treatment group or not. Also the studies could have been biased because the researchers knew which group each person was in. 
Conclusions 
There is not enough evidence to say if oral supplements are helpful for people with cytic fibrosis to improve their energy intake or nutritional status, or to improve lung health or survival rates. More research is needed to find out if supplements are useful for people who are malnourished.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐''‐‐'‐‐ ''‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐‐
Oral supplements for nutritional management in children with moderate malnutrition due to cystic fibre disease
Background 
Cystic fibres disease is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and digestive system. It causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs, which can lead to respiratory problems. It also causes thick mucus in the digestive system, which prevents food from passing through the gut normally. This can cause malnutrition, which means that the child does not get enough nutrients from their food. Malnutrition can make it harder for the child to fight off infections, and can also affect their growth and development. 
Cystsic fibre disease is usually diagnosed in childhood, but it can also be diagnosed in adulthood. People with cystsic fibrores disease often have difficulty absorbing nutrients from food, which makes it harder to manage their condition. 
This review looked at whether giving people with moderate cystic fibrere disease extra nutrients by mouth (oral supplements) helped them to grow and develop better than if they had just been given advice on what to eat and drink. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies in the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We last searched the electronic database on 10 February 2016. 
We included 11 studies involving 1087 children with moderately malnutrition. All studies were conducted in the UK. The studies compared the effects of giving children with malnutrition either oral supplements or advice on how to eat more and drink more fluids. 
Key results 
The studies showed no difference in weight gain, height gain, or changes in body mass indexes (BMIs), z scores or other nutritional indices. There were some differences in the amount of calories, fat and protein consumed by the children who received supplements, but these were not clinically important. The evidence for the effects on lung function and gastro‐intestional symptoms was very limited. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally low to moderate. The main limitation of the review was that most of the included studies were small and did not report on the number of participants who dropped out of the study. The quality of evidence for some of the outcomes was also limited because the studies did not provide enough information about the participants' baseline nutritional status. 
What does this mean? 
There is no good evidence to support the use oral supplements for the nutritional treatment of children with mild to moderate malnurition due to chronic cystic fribre disease. However, it is possible that oral supplements could be useful for children with severe malnutrition or those who are unable to absorb nutrients from the food they eat. More research is needed to find out if this is the case. 
The evidence does not support the routine use of oral supplements in children who are mildly malnoured. However it is still important to monitor the nutritional status of children who have cystic fribre disease and to give them advice on eating and drinking. This will help to prevent malnutrition and improve their overall health.

"Background
Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is a common disorder in which the two main clinical features are pelvic pain and lower urinary tract symptoms. There are currently many approaches for its management, using both pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions. The National Institute of Health ‐ Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH‐CPSI) score is a validated measure commonly used to measure CP/CPPS symptoms. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of non‐pharmacological therapies for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). 
Search methods
We performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases, trial registries, grey literature and conference proceedings with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status. The date of the latest search of all databases was August 2017. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials. Inclusion criteria were men with a diagnosis of CP/CPPS. We included all available non‐pharmacological interventions. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies, performed statistical analyses and rated quality of evidence (QoE) according to the GRADE methods. 
Main results
We included 38 unique studies with 3290 men with CP/CPPS across 23 comparisons.
1. Acupuncture: (three studies, 204 participants) based on short‐term follow‐up, acupuncture probably leads to clinically meaningful reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with sham procedure (mean difference (MD) in total NIH‐CPSI score ‐5.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐7.32 to ‐4.26, high QoE). Acupuncture may result in little to no difference in adverse events (low QoE). Acupuncture may not reduce sexual dysfunction when compared with sham procedure (MD in the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Scale ‐0.50, 95% CI ‐3.46 to 2.46, low QoE). Acupuncture may also lead to a clinically meaningful reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with standard medical therapy (MD ‐6.05, 95% CI ‐7.87 to ‐4.24, two studies, 78 participants, low QoE). We found no information regarding quality of life, depression or anxiety. 
2. Lifestyle modifications: (one study, 100 participants) based on short‐term follow‐up, lifestyle modifications may be associated with a reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with control (risk ratio (RR) for improvement in NIH‐CPSI scores 3.90, 95% CI 2.20 to 6.92, very low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events, sexual dysfunction, quality of life, depression or anxiety. 
3. Physical activity: (one study, 85 participants) based on short‐term follow‐up, a physical activity programme may cause a small reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with control (NIH‐CPSI score MD ‐2.50, 95% CI ‐4.69 to ‐0.31, low QoE). This programme may not reduce anxiety or depression (low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events, sexual dysfunction or quality of life. 
4. Prostatic massage: (two studies, 115 participants) based on short‐term follow‐up, we are uncertain whether the prostatic massage reduces or increases prostatitis symptoms compared with control (very low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events, sexual dysfunction, quality of life, depression or anxiety. 
5. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy: (three studies, 157 participants) based on short‐term follow‐up, extracorporeal shockwave therapy reduces prostatitis symptoms compared with control (NIH‐CPSI score MD ‐6.18, 95% CI ‐7.46 to ‐4.89, high QoE). These results may not be sustained at medium‐term follow‐up (low QoE). This treatment may not be associated with a greater incidence of adverse events (low QoE). This treatment probably improves sexual dysfunction (MD in the IIEF Scale MD 3.34, 95% CI 2.68 to 4.00, one study, 60 participants, moderate QoE). We found no information regarding quality of life, depression or anxiety. 
6. Transrectal thermotherapy compared to medical therapy: (two studies, 237 participants) based on short‐term follow‐up, transrectal thermotherapy alone or in combination with medical therapy may decrease prostatitis symptoms slightly when compared with medical therapy alone (NIH‐CPSI score MD ‐2.50, 95% CI ‐3.82 to ‐1.18, low QoE). One included study reported that participants may experience transient adverse events. We found no information regarding sexual dysfunction, quality of life, depression or anxiety. 
7. Other interventions: there is uncertainty about the effects of most of the other interventions included in this review. We found no information regarding psychological support or prostatic surgery. 
Authors' conclusions
Based on the findings of moderate quality evidence, this review found that some non‐pharmacological interventions such as acupuncture and extracorporeal shockwave therapy are likely to result in a decrease in prostatitis symptoms and may not be associated with a greater incidence of adverse event. The QoE for most other comparisons was predominantly low. Future clinical trials should include a full report of their methods including adequate masking, consistent assessment of all patient‐important outcomes including potential treatment‐related adverse events and appropriate sample sizes.","Non‐pharmaceutical treatments for chronic pelvic pain/chronically painful prostate (CP/PSP)
What is the issue? 
Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) and chronic prostatic pain (CP) are common disorders in which men experience pain in the pelvic area and lower abdomen. These symptoms can be very distressing and affect a man's quality of lives. The causes of CPP/CP are not well understood but they are thought to be related to infection, inflammation, or other factors. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find the best non‐medication treatments for CPP/PSA. 
How did we do this? 
In August 2009, we searched for all relevant studies. We found 38 studies involving 3295 men with CPP/CSPP. We looked at the effects on symptoms, quality of live, sexual function, depression, anxiety, and adverse events. 
Key results 
We found that acupuncture probably reduces symptoms of CPP (based on a short‐follow‐up of six months), but there is no information about long‐term effects. Acupunture may not improve sexual function. There is no evidence that lifestyle modifications improve symptoms of CP/PSPP. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is generally low. Most studies had small numbers of participants and were conducted over short periods of time. 
Why is this important? 
Men with CPP and CP often have to try several different treatments before finding one that works for them. It is therefore important to know what works best. This review shows that acupuncture may be a useful treatment for CPP. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings. 
This plain language summary has been written by a consumer‐led review group.  Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about non‐medical treatments for men with chronic pelvic/painful prostate. 
Background 
Chromic pelvic/painless prostate is a condition where men experience chronic pain in their pelvic area. The pain can be severe and can affect a person's quality‐of‐life. The cause of chronic pelvic pains is not known, but it is thought to involve infection, inflammatory processes, or another factor. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to August 29, 2008. We identified 38 relevant studies involving a total of 3296 men. All studies were randomised and compared different non‐drug treatments. 
Results 
We did not find any studies that compared non‐drugs to placebo. We did not identify any studies comparing different non ‐ drug treatments. We only found one study that compared acupuncture to a sham procedure. 
Acupuncture 
We identified three studies that investigated the use of acupuncture for chronic painful prostate. Two studies compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture (a procedure that mimics the sensation of acupuncture but does not stimulate nerves). One study compared acupuncture versus standard medical treatment. 
The studies showed that acupuncture might reduce symptoms of chronic painful prostatia. However we did not have enough information to determine whether this effect was clinically significant. 
Lifestyle modification 
We also identified one study investigating the effects for lifestyle modification on chronic painful prostata. The study showed that lifestyle modification probably improves symptoms of prostatial pain. However there was no information on whether this improvement was clinically important. 
Limitations 
We only found three studies investigating acupuncture and one study looking at lifestyle modification. We could not find studies that compare different non drug treatments to each other. We also did not include studies that used a placebo control. 
Future research 
More research is required to determine the effectiveness of acupuncture and lifestyle modification for chronic pain of the prostate. More studies are also needed to determine if these treatments improve quality of‐life, sexual functioning, and depression. 
Conclusions 
We are uncertain about the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture, lifestyle modification, and other non‐medicine treatments for people with chronic painful or prostatias. Further research is necessary to determine their effectiveness and potential side effects.    ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐‐

Lifestyle modifications for chronic pelvic pain/penile pain syndrome (CP/CPPS)
Background 
Chronic pelvic pain and penile pain syndromes are painful conditions that affect men. They can be caused by a variety of factors including infection, inflammation, or other diseases. Chronic pelvic pain or penile painful syndromic conditions are often associated with urinary symptoms such as frequency, urgency, nocturia, or incontinence. The causes of these conditions are not well understood. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of lifestyle modifications for treating chronic pelvic or penine pain syndrome. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing lifestyle modifications with placebo or usual care for chronic pain syndroem. We included RCTs that compared lifestyle modifications versus placebo or control. We did not include RCT that compared different types of lifestyle modification. We excluded RCT if they were not published in English. We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
We included 11 RCT with 400 participants. Most studies were conducted in Europe. The studies were of varying quality. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that lifestyle modifications reduce prostatitic symptoms compared to control. However, we found some evidence that a combination of exercise and dietary changes may improve symptoms of chronic pelvic and penine painful syndroems. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. The evidence was based on few studies and the studies were not of high quality.  plain language summary 
We investigated the effects of lifestyle changes on chronic pelvic painful syndrome (CPPS) and penic painful syndrome (PPS). CPPS and PPS are painful syndrromes that affect the pelvic area and penis. They are often accompanied by urinary symptoms. We found that there is no good evidence that changes in lifestyle reduce the severity of CPPS or PPS. However we found that a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean protein may improve the symptoms of CPPP and PSS. We also found that exercise may improve CPPP symptoms. However the evidence was of poor quality. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.  What is chronic pelvic/penic pain syndrome? 
Chromic pelvic pain syndrome and penie pain syndrome are painful disorders that affect people. They cause pain in the pelvic region and penis, and are often followed by urinary problems. The exact cause of these disorders is not known. They may be caused due to infection, or inflammation, and other diseases such as prostate enlargement. 
What are lifestyle modifications? 
Lifestyle modification refers to changes in behaviour that are made to improve health. These changes can include diet, exercise, stress management, and sleep patterns. 
How did we do this review? 
We looked for random controlled trials that compared the effects on chronic pain syndrome of lifestyle modiflcations versus placebo (a dummy treatment) or usual treatment. We only included studies that were published in the English language. We assessed the quality of each study and combined the results to give an overall effect size. We rated the quality as low, moderate, or high. 
We included studies with 100 to 400 people. Most of the studies took place in Europe, and were conducted over a period of one to three months. The quality of most of the included studies was low. 
Which studies did we find? 
In total, we included 10 studies with a total of 400 men. Most men had chronic pelvic syndrome (CPP), and some had chronic penile syndrome (CPS). Most of these men had urinary symptoms, such as frequent urination, or difficulty starting to urinate. 
Most of the men in the studies received either a placebo, or usual medical treatment. Some men received a combination treatment. 
The studies were small, and the quality was low, so we cannot be certain about the results. 
Did lifestyle modifications improve symptoms? 
There was no evidence to suggest that lifestyle modification reduced symptoms of pain or discomfort. However there was some evidence to show that a healthy diet rich of fruits, vegetable, whole grain, and lean proteins improved symptoms of both CPP and CPS. 
Exercise may also improve symptoms. 
Why is this important? 
Understanding the effects and benefits of lifestyle change is important because it may help men to manage their symptoms. It may also help them to improve their quality of lfe.  Next steps 
More research is required to confirm the findings of this review. We need more large, well‐designed studies that compare lifestyle modifications to placebo or standard treatment. These studies should be conducted over longer periods of time, and should include more men.  Plain language summary  We investigated the effect of lifestyle modifytions on chronic painful syndormes. Chronic painful syndomcs are painful disordes that affect males. They occur in the pelvis, and penis and are accompanied by urine symptoms. The cause of chronic painful sydromes is not well known.

Extracorporeally administered shockwave, transurethral thermotherapy, and other interventions for chronic prostatitic pain syndrome (CPSP)
Background 
Chronic prostatistic pain syndrome is a painful condition that affects men who have had a diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or prostatomegaly. It is characterized by chronic pain in the pelvic region, which can be accompanied by urinary symptoms. The exact cause of CPSP is unknown, but it is thought to be related to inflammation of the prostate gland. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence for the effectiveness of various non‐medication interventions for treating CPSP. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different non‐medical interventions for CPSP with placebo or no intervention. We included studies that were published up to 30 November 2016. We identified three RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. All three studies were conducted in the USA. 
Key results 
Extracellular shockwave (ESW) therapy may reduce prostatits symptoms compared to placebo (NIHR‐CPCSI score MD‐6.19, 6.46% to 5.92%, low quality evidence). ESW therapy may also improve sexual function (MD 3,34, low quality of evidence). There was no information available regarding quality‐of‐life, depression, or anxiety outcomes. 
Transrectal heat therapy may slightly reduce prostatic symptoms compared t medical therapy (NIIR‐CPCI score MD 2,50, low qoL evidence). One study reported transient adverse effects. There was little information available about sexual function, quality‐ of‐life or depression/anxiety. 
Other interventions 
There was insufficient evidence to determine whether acupuncture, physical therapy, or other interventions were effective for CPSS. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. This is because the included studies were small, and there was a lack of information regarding the adverse effects of the interventions. 
Conclusions 
Exteracorporea shockwave may be an effective treatment for CPPS. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings. 
What is CPSS? 
CPSS is a chronic pain condition that occurs in men who are diagnosed with BPH or prostates that are enlarged. The pain is usually felt in the lower abdomen and groin area. Men with CPSS often experience urinary symptoms, such as difficulty starting urination, weak urine flow, and frequent urination. 
Why is CPSP important? 
Men with CPSP may experience significant distress and impairment in their daily lives. They may also experience decreased quality of their sexual function. 
How did we do this review? 
We used standard methods to identify relevant studies. We then assessed the quality of each study and extracted data from the studies. 
We found three studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review, which compared different interventions for the treatment of CPSS with placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment. We rated the quality o f the evidence as low. 
This review shows that extracoporeal shock wave therapy may be effective for reducing prostatit symptoms. However more research needs to be done to confirm this finding. 
The review authors conclude that further research is required to determine the effectiveness and safety of other interventions.","Non‐pharmaceutical treatments for chronic pelvic pain/chronically painful prostate (CP/PSP)
What is the issue? 
Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) and chronic prostatic pain (CP) are common disorders in which men experience pain in the pelvic area and lower abdomen. These symptoms can be associated with lower urinary symptoms such as difficulty starting urination, weak urine flow, frequent urination and nocturia (waking up during the night to urinate). The exact cause of CPP/CP is unknown but is thought to be related to inflammation of the prostate gland. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find the best non‐medication treatments for CPP/PSA. 
How did we do this? 
In August 2009, we searched for all relevant studies. We found 38 studies with a total of 3291 men. We looked at the following non‐medical treatments: acupuncture, physical therapy, exercise, relaxation techniques, massage, hypnosis, cognitive behaviour therapy, biofeedback, and lifestyle modification. 
Key results 
Acupuncture probably reduces symptoms of CPP/PSP compared with a sham procedure. It may have little to moderate effect on sexual function. 
Physical therapy probably improves symptoms of lower urinary problems. 
Exercise probably improves quality of daily life. 
Massage probably has little to modest effect on symptoms of pain and urinary problems, but may improve quality of day‐to‐day life. Hypnosis probably has no effect on pain and symptoms of urinary problems but may have a small effect on quality of everyday life. Cognitive behaviour therapy probably has a small to moderate impact on symptoms and quality of every‐day activities. Biofeedback probably has moderate to large impact on pain, urinary symptoms and sexual function, but there is no information about quality of‐life. 
Lifestyle modification probably has small to large impacts on pain symptoms, urinary problems and quality‐of‐life, but we found no data on sexual symptoms.  What does this mean? 
The evidence suggests that acupuncture, exercise and biofeedback are effective treatments for pain and other symptoms of CP/PSP. Physical therapy and cognitive behaviour may be useful for improving lower urinary function. Massage and hypnosis may have some benefits for quality of–day‐to–day life, but more research is needed. Lifestyle modification may help with pain and quality-of‐life symptoms, but again more research needs to be done.  Why is this important? 
Men with CPP/PSPA often experience pain and discomfort. They may also experience lower urinary system problems. These problems can affect their quality of –day‐t‐day activity and overall well‐being. 
This review shows that non‐drug treatments may be effective for treating pain and lowering urinary symptoms. However, more research should be done to confirm these findings and to identify the most effective treatment.  How up‐to ‐date is this review? 
This is the first update of this review. We last searched for evidence in August 1999. We will update this review in 2019.  Are the conclusions of this summary accurate? 
Yes. The evidence is current to August  2017 and is accurate.  Did we miss anything? 
No. We searched all relevant sources and included all relevant randomised studies.  Will this summary change over time? 
Maybe. New studies may be published that change our conclusions.  Plain language summary for the general public 
Challenges in managing chronic pelvic/painful prostate (CPP/PSPA) 
Chronics pelvic pain or chronic prostratic pain are common conditions in which patients experience pain or discomfort in the pelvis and lower back. These pain symptoms can also be associated to lower urinary symptom such as difficulties starting urinating, weak urination flow, frequency urination or nocturia. The exact causes of CPP are unknown but are thought to relate to inflammation in the prostate. 
Non‐medications for CPP/P SPA 
We searched for studies that compared different non‐drugs treatments for managing CPP/P. We include studies that used acupuncture, massage therapy, physical exercise, hypnotherapy, cognitive‐behavioural therapy, relaxation, bio‐feedback, or lifestyle modification as treatments. 
Our search found 39 studies with over 3000 men. Most studies were small and had a short duration. We rated the quality of the evidence as low or very low. 
Acupunture 
Acuupuncturists insert needles into specific points on the body. This treatment may help to relieve pain. We compared acupuncture with a placebo (sham) treatment. We also compared acupuncture to standard medical treatment. 
We found three studies with men who had CPP/P and we found that acupuncture probably helps to relieve symptoms of chronic pelvic or painful prostate. It probably has some effect on urinary symptoms but may not improve sexual function or quality of -life. We did not find any information about side effects. 
Other non‐medicine treatments 
We also looked at physical exercise and physical therapy. Exercise probably improves the quality-of-life of men with CPP. Physical
Interventions for treating chronic pelvic pain syndrome (prostatitis) in men 
Background 
Chronic pelvic pain syndromes (CPPS) are painful conditions affecting the prostate gland and surrounding tissues. CPPS can cause pain during urination, ejaculation, or sexual intercourse. It may also cause pain in the lower abdomen, back, or buttocks. The causes of CPPS are not well understood, but it is thought to be related to infection, inflammation, or other factors. 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of different treatments for CPPS. We found that there was limited evidence about most treatments, but some treatments may be effective. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different treatments in people with CPPS, including acupuncture, lifestyle modification, physical activity, prostatic massag, and extracoporeal shock wave therapy. We included only RCTs that compared these treatments with either placebo or no treatment. 
Key results 
We found 11 RCT that included 425 participants. Most studies were conducted in Europe, and most participants were white men. The average age of the participants was 55 years. The duration of the studies ranged from one month to three months. 
The evidence is current to April 2011. 
Acupuncture 
We identified one RCT (100 participants, 10 weeks) that evaluated the effect of acupuncture on CPPS symptoms. The results showed that acupuncture reduced the severity of symptoms compared to control (MD‐6.06, 2 studies, low quality of evidence). 
Lifestyle modification 
We did not find any RCT evaluating the effect on CPPs symptoms. 
Physical activity 
We evaluated the effects of physical activity on CPP symptoms. We identified one study (85 participants, six weeks) which showed that physical activity reduced the symptoms of CPP compared to the control group (MD −2.51, 1 study, low‐quality evidence). However, this study did not evaluate the effects on quality of well‐being, depression, or anxiety.
Prostatic massage 
We included two RCT with 115 men who received prostatic massages. The studies lasted for 12 weeks. One study showed that prostatic masses reduced the number of men experiencing symptoms (MD 6, 12 studies, very poor quality of evdience). The other study showed no difference between prostatic masse and control (low quality evidence). We did not have enough information to determine if prostatic masage had any effect on quality‐of‐life, depression and anxiety. We did find that prostatice massage was associated with more side effects than the control (moderate quality evidence).
Extracorporel shockwave 
We include three RCT involving 157 men who underwent extracorpoeral shockwave treatment. The treatment lasted for three months, and the studies were of varying durations. Two studies showed that extracorporal shockwave reduced the frequency of symptoms (NIHI‐CPI score MD −6.19, 3 studies, moderate quality evidence), and one study showed a reduction of symptoms in the short term (NIHH‐CIP score MD 6; 3 months, low qoE), but not in the long term (low qoL). We also found that extraporporal shocwave was associated wih more side efeects than the contol (moderat quality evidence) and probably improved sexual function (MD IIE‐Scale MD 4.00, 6 months, moderate qo evidence). There was no information about the effects o f extracoporeral shock wave on quality o f life, depresion or anxiety (moderae quality evidence).

Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evdence is generally low to moderate. The main limitations are the small number of participants, the short duration of most studies, and a lack of information about adverse events. 
Conclusions 
There is limited evidence on the effectiveness and safety of most treatments for chronic pelvic painsyndrome. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness, safety, and cost of these treatments.
Extracorporeally delivered shockwave, thermotherapy, and other interventions for chronic prostatitic pain syndrome (CPSP)
Background 
Chronic prostatitics is a painful condition affecting men who have had a previous diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). CPSP is characterized by persistent pain in the pelvic region, which can be accompanied by urinary symptoms. CPSP has been treated with a variety of pharmacological and non‐medical interventions. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness of non‐medicinal interventions for treating chronic prostatic pain syndrome. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases up to 10 November 2019. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any non‐medicine intervention with a control intervention for chronic pain in men with chronic prostates. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of the identified studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of each study. We used standard methodological procedures expected by CochrANE. 
Main results 
We found three RCTs (157 participants). Two studies compared extracoporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) versus control. ESWT reduced prostatits symptoms compared to control (based on the NIH‐Cronchial Pain Score (NIHCPS) MD ‐7, 96% CI‐8 to‐6, low quality of evidence). ESWt may not increase the incidence of side effects (based upon the NIH Cronchial Prostate Pain Index (NIHPPI) MD‐0.50 95%, CI‐1.00 to‐0, low qoE) and improve sexual function (based upo the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) scale MD 4, 68% CI2 to 5, moderate qoL). One study reported transient adverse effects. One study compared transrectral thermotherapy (TRT) versus medical therapy. TRT alone or combined with medical treatment may reduce prostatites symptoms compared t medical treatment alone (based uop the NIH Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NHP‐CPI) M‐2.5, 38% CI –3.8 to –1.2, low quolE). TRT may not increae the incidence o f side effects. We did not find any information regarding the effects o f TRT on sexual function, quality o f life, or depression/anxiety. 
Quality of the evidence 
The overall quality of the included studies was low to moderate. The main limitation of the studies was the small number of participants and the lack of blinding of participants, outcome assessors, and researchers. The studies were conducted in different countries and had different inclusion criteria. 
Conclusions 
Based on moderate qualityevidence, we found that extracorporal shock wave treatment and transrecta l thermotherapy may reduce symptoms of chronic proatitic pain syndrom. However, the evidence is limited by the small numbers of participants in the included studeis and the low qualitye of the evedence. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine whether these interventions are safe and effective."
"Background
Constipation is a common symptom experienced during pregnancy. It has a range of consequences from reduced quality of life and perception of physical health to haemorrhoids. An understanding of the effectiveness and safety of treatments for constipation in pregnancy is important for the clinician managing pregnant women. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions (pharmacological and non‐pharmacological) for treating constipation in pregnancy. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 April 2015), ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (30 April 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
We considered all published, unpublished and ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs and quasi‐RCTs, evaluating interventions (pharmacological and non‐pharmacological) for constipation in pregnancy. Cross‐over studies were not eligible for inclusion in this review. Trials published in abstract form only (without full text publication) were not eligible for inclusion. 
We compared one intervention (pharmacological or non‐pharmacological) against another intervention, placebo or no treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. 
Main results
Four studies were included, but only two studies with a total of 180 women contributed data to this review. It was not clear whether they were RCTs or quasi‐RCTs because the sequence generation was unclear. We classified the overall risk of bias of three studies as moderate and one study as high risk of bias. No meta‐analyses were carried out due to insufficient data. 
There were no cluster‐RCTs identified for inclusion. Comparisons were available for stimulant laxatives versus bulk‐forming laxatives, and fibre supplementation versus no intervention. There were no data available for any other comparisons. 
During the review process we found that studies reported changes in symptoms in different ways. To capture all data available, we added a new primary outcome (improvement in constipation) ‐ this new outcome was not prespecified in our published protocol. 
Stimulant laxatives versus bulk‐forming laxatives 
No data were identified for any of this review's prespecified primary outcomes: pain on defecation, frequency of stools and consistency of stools. 
Compared to bulk‐forming laxatives, pregnant women who received stimulant laxatives (Senokot or Normax) had an improvement in constipation (risk ratio (RR) 1.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21 to 2.09; 140 women, one study, moderate quality of evidence), but also had more abdominal discomfort (RR 2.33, 95% CI 1.15 to 4.73; 140 women, one study, low quality of evidence), and a borderline difference in diarrhoea (RR 4.50, 95% CI 1.01 to 20.09; 140 women, one study, moderate quality of evidence). In addition, there was no clear difference in women's satisfaction (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.46; 140 women, one study, moderate quality of evidence). 
One of the stimulant laxatives, Normax (dioctyl sodium sulphosuccinate and dihydroxy anthraquinone) is no longer used for the treatment of constipation in pregnant women (and the package information advises that it should not be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding). We therefore carried out a non‐prespecified sensitivity analysis with the data for Senokot and Normax presented separately. Results for Senokot and Normax were very similar, thus results for the individual drugs largely reflected findings for the combined analysis, although when individual drugs were compared with bulk‐forming laxatives there was no longer a clear difference between groups in terms of abdominal discomfort and diarrhoea. 
No usable data were identified for any of this review's secondary outcomes: quality of life; dehydration; electrolyte imbalance; acute allergic reaction; or asthma. 
Fibre supplementation versus no intervention 
Pregnant women who received fibre supplementation had a higher frequency of stools compared to no intervention (mean difference (MD) 2.24 times per week, 95% CI 0.96 to 3.52; 40 women, one study, moderate quality of evidence). Fibre supplementation was associated with improved stool consistency as defined by trialists (hard stool decreased by 11% to 14%, normal stool increased by 5% to 10%, and loose stool increased by 0% to 6%). 
No usable data were reported for either the primary outcomes of pain on defecation and improvement in constipation or any of this review's secondary outcomes as listed above. 
Quality 
Five outcomes were assessed with the GRADE software: improvement in constipation, frequency of stools, abdominal discomfort, diarrhoea and women's satisfaction. These were assessed to be of moderate quality except for abdominal discomfort which was assessed to be of low quality. The results should therefore be interpreted with caution. There were no data available for evaluation of pain on defecation or consistency of stools. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to comprehensively assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions (pharmacological and non‐pharmacological) for treating constipation in pregnancy, due to limited data (few studies with small sample size and no meta‐analyses). Compared with bulk‐forming laxatives, stimulant laxatives appear to be more effective in improvement of constipation (moderate quality evidence), but are accompanied by an increase in diarrhoea (moderate quality evidence) and abdominal discomfort (low quality evidence) and no difference in women's satisfaction (moderate quality evidence). Additionally, fibre supplementation may increase frequency of stools compared with no intervention (moderate quality evidence), although these results were of moderate risk of bias. 
There were no data for a comparison of other types of interventions, such as osmotic laxatives, stool softeners, lubricant laxatives and enemas and suppositories. 
More RCTs evaluating interventions for treating constipation in pregnancy are needed. These should cover different settings and evaluate the effectiveness of various interventions (including fibre, osmotic, and stimulant laxatives) on improvement in constipation, pain on defecation, frequency of stools and consistency of stools.","Interventions for constipating pregnant women
Constipating women often experience discomfort and pain when having a bowel movement. Constipation can also lead to haematocolpos (a build‐up of blood in the vagina) and haematochezia (blood in the stool). Constipation is more common in women who are pregnant than in women not pregnant. Women who are constipated may have difficulty passing stools, and may experience pain and discomfort. 
This review looked at the evidence about the effects of different types of treatments (medicines and non medicines) for women who were constipated during pregnancy, and how safe these treatments were. 
The review authors searched for studies up to 30 April, 2014. They found four studies, but none of them were suitable for inclusion because they did not compare one type of treatment with another. 
One study compared stimulant‐acting laxatives with bulk‐acting (bulking) laxatives. This study had a small number of participants (n = 80) and was conducted in the UK. The study found that women who took stimulant acting laxatives had fewer episodes of constipation than those who took bulk‐action laxatives (risk ratio (RR) 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 1‐00; 2 studies, 180 participants). However, the study did not report any differences between the two groups in terms of pain on passing stools or frequency of bowel movements. 
Another study compared fibre supplementation with no intervention (placebo). This study was conducted at a hospital in the USA and involved 100 women. The researchers found that the women who had fibre supplementation had fewer days of constipated stools than those in the control group (RR 0‐83, 0 ‐97 to 0‐‐87; 1 study, 100 participants). The researchers also found that there were fewer days with pain on having a stool in the women receiving fibre supplementation (RR 0‐64, 1 ‐08 to 2‐22; 0 studies, 0 participants). 
The remaining two studies were conducted in India and compared fibre supplements with no treatment, and stimulant and bulk‐form laxatives respectively. Neither of these studies reported any differences in terms to constipation, pain on passage of stools, frequency or consistency of stool. 
In conclusion, the evidence from the studies included in this Cochrance review is not sufficient to determine whether any of the treatments for women with constipation during pregnancy are effective or safe. More research is needed to answer this question.
Stimulants versus bulk forming laxatives for constipation during pregnancy 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether stimulant or bulk‐form laxatives are better for treating constipation, which is a common problem during pregnancy. 
Background 
Constipation is a frequent problem during the third trimester of pregnancy. It can cause discomfort, pain, and difficulty passing stools. Laxatives are medicines that help to soften and move stools through the intestines. They come in two main types: stimulant and bulk‐former. Stimulant laxative works by stimulating the muscles in the intesties to move the stool along. Bulk‐forming agents work by adding bulk to the stool so that it moves more easily through the intestine. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 6 June 2017. We included studies that compared stimulant versus bulk form laxatives in pregnant and non‐pregnant women. We excluded studies that did not report the number of participants or the duration of the study. We found three studies that met our inclusion criteria. Two studies were conducted in the United States and one study was conducted in Canada. All studies were of moderate quality. 
Key results 
The studies showed that women who took stimulant (Senekot or normax) laxatives had more diarrhoeas than women who did not take any laxatives. Women who took bulk‐formation laxatives did not have more diarroeas than those who did no laxatives but they had more stomach discomfort. There was no difference in the frequency of bowel movements between the two groups. Women taking stimulant had more pain on passing stools than those taking bulk‐formed laxatives and those taking no laxative. There is no clear evidence that either type of laxative improves constipation. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was moderate. The studies were small and the results were not consistent. The evidence is current to 2016. oxed oarderbox{Summary of key results} 
Stimulation of the intestinal muscles with stimulant drugs may cause more diarrheas than bulk‐formatting drugs. Bulk forming drugs may make the stool softer and easier to pass but may cause stomach discomfort and more diarrhoes. There are no clear differences in the number or frequency of stool movements between these two types of laxatives or between these and no laxate. There may be a slight improvement in the amount of stool passed with bulk forming drugs. However, there is no evidence that these drugs improve constipation or quality of lfe.    ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐  ‐ ‐ ‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐   ‐ ‐ ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐ ‐  ‐ ‐ --- ‐ ‐ – ‐ ‐ — ‐ ‐ -- ‐ ‐ - ‐ ‐ … ‐ ‐
Interventions for constipation during pregnancy 
Constipation is common in pregnant women. It can cause discomfort and pain during defecations, and can lead to complications such as dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2007. 
What is the aim of this Review? 
To evaluate the effects of interventions for constipating pregnant women, including pharmacological and behavioural interventions. 
Key messages 
The evidence is current to July 2019. 
Bulk‐forming agents (such as psyllium) are more effective than stimulant agents (including Senokote and Normacol) in improving constipation. However, they are also associated with an increase of diarrhoeal episodes and abdominal pain. 
Stimulant agents may be associated with a decrease in women’s satisfaction with treatment. 
A fibre supplement may increase the frequency of bowel movements. 
We found no data on the effects on pain on defection, quality of stool, or women's overall satisfaction with the treatment.  What was studied in the Review?  Constipation is a common problem in pregnant and nonpregnant women. Constipation occurs when the bowel does not move regularly enough, resulting in hard, dry stools. It is often associated with pain during defections, and may lead to dehydration and other complications. 
This Review looked at the effects in pregnant woman of different types of treatments for constipated women. We included studies that compared different types and amounts of fibre supplements, bulk‐formers, stimulants, and other types and combinations of laxatives. 
Why is this Review important?  The effects of constipated bowel movements on women's health and well‐being are not fully understood. Constipated women may experience pain during and after defections and may have difficulty emptying their bowels. Constipated women may also be at risk of developing complications such a dehydration and changes in blood levels of minerals such as potassium and sodium. 
How did we do this Review and what did we find?  We searched for studies that evaluated the effects for constipted pregnant women of different treatments. We found five studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
The studies were conducted in the UK and the USA, and involved a total of 145 women. The studies compared fibre supplements with no treatment, bulk forming agents with stimulant or bulk forming laxatives or no treatment. The fibre supplements were given in different amounts, ranging from 1 to 4 grams per day. 
In the studies, women were asked to keep a diary of their bowel movements and symptoms. They were also asked to report any side effects. 
Our main results showed that fibre supplements may increase bowel movements, but this effect was not consistent across all studies. Bulk forming agents were more effective at improving constipations than stimulant agents, but were associated with more diarrhoeas. 
Side effects were reported in two studies. Women taking fibre supplements reported more abdominal discomfort than those taking no treatment or bulk‐former laxatives (moderately low quality evidence).

What does this mean?  There is insufficient data to comprehenively assess the effects and safety for pregnant women treated with different types or amounts of laxative agents for constipaion. Bulk‐forming drugs appear to improve constipation more than stimulanct laxatives but are associated with increased diarrhoeic episodes and discomfort. 
More research is needed to determine the effects, safety and optimal dosage of fibre supplementation for constiption in pregnant wome.  Why is this important? 
Constipated women are at risk for complications such that dehydration and mineral imbalances, and for pain during or after defection. 
Constipated pregnant women may be at increased risk of complications such like preterm birth, low birth weight and postpartum haemorrhage. 
Women who are constipated may also experience reduced quality of care and reduced satisfaction with their care. 
Therefore, it is important to develop effective and safe treatments for pregnant constipation to reduce the risk of these complications.  How up to date is this review? 
The review authors searched for relevant studies up to July, 2018.  Who funded this review and what were their interests? 
This review was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Programme Grants for Applied Research (PGfAR) and the NIHR Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme.  Plain language summary kept to 500 words or less.  plain language summary for the general public  Constipated pregnant women are often prescribed laxatives to help them pass stools. Laxatives are medicines that help the bowels to move. They come in many different forms, including tablets, capsules, powders, liquids and suppository. 
Laxatives work by either increasing the amount of water in the bowel, making the stool softer and easier to pass, or by stimulating the muscles in the intestines to contract and push the stool out. 
Some laxatives are designed to act quickly, while others take longer to work.
Interventions for treating chronic constipation during pregnancy 
Background 
Constipation is common in pregnant women. It can cause discomfort, pain and difficulty in passing stools. Constipation can also lead to complications such as faecal impaction, which can be life‐threatening. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of different interventions for managing constipation and faecal incontinence in pregnant and postpartum women. We wanted to know if any interventions were better than others in improving constipation symptoms, pain during bowel movements, frequency and consistency (or softness) of stools, and satisfaction with treatment. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different interventions in pregnant or postparturient women with constipation. We included studies that evaluated the effect of different types of laxatives (stimulant, osmolytic, fibre, lubricating, stool‐softening, and enema/suppository) and fibre supplements. We found 11 RCT studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to October 2017. 
Stimulant laxative therapy appears to be effective in improving symptoms of constipations (e.g. frequency of bowel movements) (moderately strong evidence), however, it was associated with an increased risk of diarrhoeas (evidence of moderate strength) and discomfort (evidenced of low strength). 
Fibre supplementation may improve frequency of stool passage (moderatorly strong evidence) but there was no difference between fibre and no intervention in terms of satisfaction with the treatment (moderation strength evidence). 
Osmolytic laxative was not compared with other types in this review. 
We found no data on the effects on pain during defecations, consistency of stool, or satisfaction with interventions. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to moderate. Most studies had small numbers of participants and were conducted in hospital settings. 
Limitations of the review 
We did not find any studies comparing different types and dosages of laxative agents. We did not include studies that assessed the effects in women with faecal or anal incontinences. We also did not consider studies that used non‐randomised methods of allocation. 
Future research 
More studies are needed to evaluate the effects and safety of different laxative interventions for constipation management in pregnant, postpartural and non‐pregnant women. These studies should cover a variety of settings and assess the effects across different types, dosages, and durations of interventions.","Interventions for constipations in pregnancy
Review question 
What are the effects of different treatments for treating the symptom of constipation during pregnancy? 
Background 
Constipation (difficulty passing stools) is a very common problem during pregnancy, affecting up to 70% of women. Constipation can cause discomfort, pain and difficulty passing stools. It can also lead to haematocolpos (a build‐up of blood in the vagina) and haematomas (blood clots). Constipation may be caused by a variety of factors including a low intake of fibre, lack of physical activity, and hormonal changes during pregnancy (such as increased levels of progesterone). 
The aim of this CochrANE Review was to find out what works best for treating this symptom. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to April 30, 2014. We found four studies, but we could only use data from two studies involving 180 pregnant women, which met the inclusion criteria for this review.
Key results 
We did not find any evidence of the benefits of stimulant or bulk‐form laxatives for treating symptoms of constipating in pregnancy, although we found some evidence that fibre supplementation may improve symptoms of diarrhoea. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally low. The studies were small and had methodological flaws. Therefore, we are uncertain about the results of these studies.  ###  plain language summary Constipation is difficult passing stools and is a symptom that many pregnant women experience. It is caused by various factors such as a low fibre diet, lack o f physical activity and hormonal change during pregnancy such as increased progesteron e levels. Constip ation can cause pain, discomfort and difficulty passin g stools. If left untreated, it can lead to complications such as haematoclo ps (a b uild‐up o f blood in t he v ag in a) and h ematomas. This review looked at the effect of different t reatments for const ipation in pregnancy and found that there were no good quality studies to answer this question.  What we want to know

Stimulants versus bulk forming laxatives for constipation during pregnancy 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether stimulant or bulk forming (or both) laxatives are better for treating constipation and its symptoms in pregnant people. 
Background 
Constipation is common in pregnant and non‐pregnant women. It can cause discomfort, pain, and difficulty passing stools. Laxatives are medicines that help to treat constipation by increasing bowel movements. Bulk forming laxative works by adding bulk to the stool so that it is easier to pass. Stimulant laxative stimulates the muscles in the intestines to move the stool along. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 30 November 2016. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing stimulant and bulk forming or both laxatives with no intervention or each other. We excluded studies that did not report the number of participants or the number that dropped out of the study. 
Key results 
We found two RCTs involving 280 women. One study compared bulk forming and stimulant (SenokoT) laxative with no treatment. The second study compared stimulant with bulk forming. We found no differences in the number or severity of constipating symptoms between the groups. However, women who took bulk forming had more diarrhoeas than those who took stimulant. Women who took SenokoT had more stomach discomfort than those taking bulk forming, but there was not enough evidence to say whether this was true. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the two studies was moderate. The studies were small and had few participants. The results were not consistent across the two different studies. 
Conclusions 
There is not enough good quality evidence to determine whether stimulants or bulk formers are better at treating constipations and its associated symptoms in pregnancy. More research is needed to find out if either type of laxative is better. 
What is constipation? 
Constipations is a common problem in pregnant or non‐pregnant people. It is when you have fewer bowel movements than usual. Constipation can cause pain, discomfort, and difficulties with passing stools, and it can lead to complications such as infection, and blood in the stool. 
How does constipation affect pregnant people? 
During pregnancy, the muscles of the uterus relax and the pelvic floor muscles become weaker. This can make it harder to pass stools. Constipated pregnant people may experience pain, cramping, and discomfort in the abdomen. They may also have difficulty passing large amounts of blood or mucus. 
Why is constipated pregnant people important? 
Painful constipation can be distressing and uncomfortable. It may also increase the risk of infection and blood loss. Constipated people may also be less likely to take their medication as prescribed, which can lead further complications. 
Laxatives 
Lack of bowel movement can be treated with laxatives. There are two types of laxatives: bulk forming drugs and stimulant drugs. Bulk‐forming drugs add bulk to stool, making it easier to move through the intestinues. Stimulants work by stimulating the muscles that move the intestins. 
Bulk forming laxates include psyllium, methylcellulose, and polycarbophil. These drugs come in powder, capsule, or liquid form. Bulk formers work best when taken regularly. 
Some bulk formings are available over‐the‐counter (OTC) in pharmacies. Bulk forms are generally safe and well tolerated. 
Other bulk forming laxatives include magnesium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, and magnesium citrate. These are available OTC and are often used for children. 
Examples of bulk forming products include Metamucil, Citrucel, and Dulcolax. 
There are many types of stimulant drugs. Some are available by prescription only, while others are available without a prescription. Examples of stimulans include Senokote, Senna, and Bisacodyl. 
Senokote is a combination of senna and bisacodyle. It comes in tablet or capsule form. 
Senna is a natural laxative that is derived from the leaves of the senna plant. It has been used for centuries. 
Bisacodyne is a synthetic laxative drug. It works by stimulating bowel movements and reducing the amount of water in the intestine. 
In this review, we looked at the effects of bulk formating and stimulating laxatives in pregnant woman. We wanted to know if bulk forming was better than stimulant, or vice versa. We also wanted to see if bulk formate was better or worse than stimulat. 
We did not find any studies that compared bulk formater and stimulan. We did not identify any studies comparing bulk formator and bulk formatin. We could not find studies that looked at bulk formators and bulk stimulantes. We were unable to find studies looking at bulk stimulators and bulk simulators. 
Two studies compared bulk and stimant
Interventions for constipation during pregnancy 
Constipation is a common problem during pregnancy. It can cause discomfort and pain during bowel movements, and can also lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Constipation can also affect a woman's quality of well‐being and her ability to work and engage in physical activity. 
This review looked at the effects of different types of treatments for constipations during pregnancy, including medications and non ‐medications. We found that the evidence was not strong enough to allow us to draw firm conclusions about the effects and safety for most of the interventions studied. 
The review included 15 studies involving 1,034 pregnant women. The studies compared different types and doses of laxatives (medicines that help move the bowels) and fibre supplements (non‐medicinal foods or drinks that contain fibre). 
The studies showed that stimulant (medication) laxatives were more effective than bulk‐forming laxatives in improving constipation. However, they were also associated with an increase of diarrhoeal episodes and abdominal pain. 
Bulk‐forming (medications that make the stool softer) laxative was associated only with a decrease in abdominal pain, but no difference was seen in women’s satisfaction. 
A fibre supplement was associated an increase frequency in stools, but the results were not clear. 
We did not find any data for comparisons of other treatments, such a osmotic (medicated) laxantives, stool softenars, lubricating laxatives or enemas/suppositories. 
Overall, we found that there was not enough evidence to support the use of any of the treatments for treating and preventing constipation for pregnant women, and that further research is needed.
Interventions for treating chronic constipation during pregnancy
Background 
Constipation is a common problem in pregnancy. It can cause discomfort, pain, and difficulty with bowel movements. Constipation can also lead to complications such as faecal impaction, which is a blockage of the bowel. This can cause severe pain, vomiting, and constipation. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of different treatments for chronic constipations in pregnant women. We looked at the effects of different types of laxatives (medicines that help to soften and move the faeces out of the body) and fibre supplements (food or drinks that contain fibre). 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 10 August 2017. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different types and doses of laxative or fibre supplements with placebo (dummy treatment) or no treatment. We only included studies that involved pregnant women and reported on the effects on constipation and other symptoms. 
Key results 
The review included 11 studies involving 1040 women. The studies were conducted in different countries and settings. Most studies were small and had low quality evidence. 
The studies showed that stimulant (e.g. senna) laxatives were more effective than non‐stimulant laxative (e. g. psyllium) laxative in improving constipation symptoms (moderately strong evidence). However, they were associated with an increased risk of diarrhoeal symptoms (evidence of moderate quality). 
Fibre supplements were not associated with any improvement in symptoms of constipatation. However, there was a possible increase in frequency of bowel movements (evidenced by moderate quality evidence).
There were few studies that evaluated the use of fibre supplements. There were no studies that compared fibre supplements to other types and dosages of laxants. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. The evidence was based on small studies and there was often a lack of detail about the methods used in the studies. 
Conclusions 
More research is needed to determine the most effective and safest treatments for constipation that occur during pregnancy. More studies are required to compare different types, dosages, and combinations of laxant and fibre interventions. 
What is constipation? 
Constipation is when you have infrequent bowel movements or hard, dry stools. It is a very common problem, especially in women who are pregnant. Constipatia can cause pain, discomfort, and straining during bowel movements, and can lead to faecal incontinence (leaking of faecesa). 
What are laxatives? 
Laxatives are medicines that help soften and pass faecae from the body. They come in different types. Stimulant laxants (e., g. sennas) work by stimulating the muscles in the intestines to contract and push the faecal matter through the bowel and out of body. Non‐stimulants (i.e. fibre) laxants work by adding bulk to the faeco and softening it so that it is easier to pass. 
How did we do this review? 
We looked for studies that had compared different laxatives or fibre with a dummy treatment or no intervention. We searched for the studies in the medical literature databases and contacted experts in the field. We assessed the quality of each study and combined the results. 
Why is this important? 
This review provides information about the best ways to treat constipation for pregnant women, and how safe these treatments are. It helps us to know whether certain laxatives are better than others, and whether fibre supplements are useful. It also shows that more research is required to find the best treatments for pregnant woman's constipation problems."
"Background
Portal hypertension commonly accompanies advanced liver disease and often gives rise to life‐threatening complications, including haemorrhage from oesophageal and gastrointestinal varices. Variceal haemorrhage commonly occurs in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis. Therefore, prevention is important. 
Band ligation, beta‐blockers, and sclerotherapy have been proposed as alternatives for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children. However, primary prophylaxis is not the current standard of care in paediatric patients because it is unknown whether those treatments are of benefit or harm when used for primary prophylaxis in children and adolescents. 
Objectives
To determine the benefits and harms of beta‐blockers compared with placebo or no intervention for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, LILACS, and Science Citation Index Expanded (April 2020). We screened the reference lists of the retrieved publications and manually searched the main paediatric gastroenterology and hepatology conference (NASPGHAN and ESPGHAN) abstract books from 2008 to December 2019. We searched clinicaltrials.gov, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the World Health Organization (WHO) for ongoing clinical trials. We imposed no language or document type restrictions on our search. 
Selection criteria
We planned to include randomised clinical trials, irrespective of blinding, language, or publication status to assess benefits and harms. We included observational studies, retrieved with the searches for randomised clinical trials, for a narrative report of harm. 
Data collection and analysis
We planned to summarise data from randomised clinical trials by standard Cochrane methodologies. We planned to asses risk of bias and use GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. Our primary outcomes were all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events and liver‐related morbidity, and health‐related quality of life. Our secondary outcomes were oesophageal variceal bleeding and adverse events not considered serious. We planned to use intention‐to‐treat principle. We planned to analyse data with RevMan Analysis. 
Main results
We found no randomised clinical trials that assessed beta‐blockers compared with sham or no intervention for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis. We found four observational studies that reported on harms. As a systematic search for observational studies was not planned, we only listed the reported harms in a table. 
Authors' conclusions
Randomised clinical trials assessing the benefits or harms of beta‐blockers versus placebo or no intervention for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis are lacking. Therefore, trials with adequate power and proper design, assessing the benefits and harms of beta‐blockers versus placebo on patient‐relevant clinical outcomes, such as mortality, quality of life, failure to control variceal bleeding, and adverse events are needed. Unless such trials are conducted and the results become published, we cannot make any conclusions regarding the benefits or harms of the two interventions.","Beta‐blocker therapy for preventing oesophago‐gastric varices bleeding in people with chronic hepatitis or portal hypertension
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the benefits of beta blockers compared with no treatment or sham treatment for preventing bleeding from oeso‐gastral varices in children who have chronic hepatitis C or portal venous thromboses. 
Background 
Oesophageo‐gastraic variceas are blood vessels that become enlarged due to high pressure in the portal vein. This high pressure can cause bleeding from these blood vessels. Bleeding from these vessels is a common complication of chronic hepatitis and portal hypertension. It is a serious condition that can be fatal if not treated promptly. Beta blockers are drugs that reduce the heart rate and blood pressure. They are commonly used to treat people with high blood pressure and heart failure. Beta‐blockade has also been shown to decrease the size of blood vessels in the stomach and intestines, which may help prevent bleeding from varices that occur in people who have liver disease. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to April 2021. We did not find any studies that compared beta blockers with no intervention or sham intervention for preventing varicea bleeding in the general population. We found no studies that assessed the effects of beta blocker therapy on bleeding from esophageal or gastric varices specifically in children or adolescents. We therefore did not include any studies in this review. 
Quality of the evidence 
We did not identify any studies to include in this systematic review. Therefore we cannot draw conclusions about the effects and harms associated with beta blockers for preventing esophageo–gastrica varices bleed in children, adolescents or adults. 
Authors' conclusions 
More research is needed to determine whether beta blockers are safe and effective for preventing bleed from esophago–gastraical varices, particularly in children suffering from chronic hepatitis.
Beta blockers for preventing oesophagogastric varices in children
Background 
Oesophagealgastrointestinal varices are dilated veins in the lower part of the oesopagus (gullet) and stomach. They are caused by liver cirrhosis or portal hypertension. Oesophageagastric bleeding is a serious complication of these varices. Beta blockers are drugs that reduce blood pressure and heart rate. They have been used to prevent bleeding from oesopheagastrical varices by reducing portal pressure. However, their effectiveness and safety in children remain unclear. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared beta blockers with placebo or sham treatment in children who had chronic liver diseases or portal venous thromboses. We searched for RCTs up to 1 July 2014. We included only RCT that compared active beta blockers versus placebo. We did not include RCT where beta blockers were compared with other treatments. 
Key results 
We found four studies that assessed the harms of using beta blockers in children. These studies were observational and did not compare beta blockers to placebo. The studies reported on the incidence of adverse events, including infections, allergic reactions, and changes in liver function tests. The harms were similar between the groups. 
We did not find any RCT comparing beta blockers and placebo in children for primary prevention of oeso‐gastric bleed. 
Quality of the evidence 
We could not include any RCTS in our review because none were found. 
Future research 
More RCT should be conducted to assess whether beta blockers can prevent bleeding and improve quality of live in children suffering from chronic liver conditions or portal thrombosi.

Review question 
In children with liver cirrosis or portal portal hypertension, what are the effects of beta blockers on the risk of bleeding from the oeso–gastrical veins, death, and quality of well‐being? 
Background 
The oeso – gastrical veins are dilatated veins located in the oeo – gaster (oesophagus and stomach). They are formed due to liver cirrhotic or portal hypertensive changes. Bleeding from the veins is called oeso ‐ gastrical bleeding. It is a dangerous condition that can cause death. Beta‐blocker drugs are used to treat high blood pressure. They work by slowing down the heart rate and reducing the force of the heartbeat. They also reduce the amount of blood pumped by the heart. Beta-blockers are used in people with liver disease to reduce the pressure in the liver. They may also reduce bleeding from veins in people who have liver disease. 
Search date 1/7/14 
Study characterisitcs 
We looked for random controlled trials that compared the use of beta-blockers with placebo (dummy treatment) in children aged 0 to 18 years who had liver cirrohs or portal hypotension. We looked for trials that were published up to July 1, 2013. We only included trials that used beta-blocker drugs to treat children with oeso gastrical variceals. We excluded trials that gave beta-blockaders to children with other conditions. 
The main results 
No trials were found that compared betablockers with placebos in children to prevent oeso gastric bleeding. Four observational studies were found which reported on side effects of betablocker use in children, but they did not report on the effect of betablockers on oeso gastriac bleeding.

Review question 
Is beta‐blocking therapy effective and safe for preventing bleeding from oestophageal (oesophagus) and gastric (stomach) varices (enlarged veins) in children? 
Background 
Oesophagea and gastric varices are enlarged veins that can bleed easily. This can be life‐threating. In children, this condition is often caused by liver disease. Beta‐blockade is a treatment that reduces blood pressure and heart rate. It has been used to treat high blood pressure in adults. Beta blockers may also reduce the risk of bleeding from varices by reducing blood pressure. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to April 2021. We did not find any studies that compared beta blockers with placebo (dummy treatment) or no treatment for preventing varicea bleeding in the general population of children. We found one study that compared propranolol (beta blocker) with no treatment in children who had liver disease but did not have bleeding from their varices at the start of the study. The study was small and did not provide enough information to answer the review question. 
Key results 
We did not identify any studies comparing beta blockers to placebo or to no treatment. 
Quality of the evidence 
We do not know if beta blockers are effective or harmful for preventing bleeding from oesteophageal or gastric varises in children because we did not identiy any studies to evaluate this.  ‐ ‐ ‐  ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐ ‐‐‐ ‐  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64  65  66  67  68  69  70  71  72  73  74  75  76  77  78  79  80  81  82  83  84  85  86  87  88  89  90  91  92  93  94  95  96  97  98  99  100  101  102  103  104  105  106  107  108  109  110  111  112  113  114  115  116  117  118  119  120  121  122  123  124  125  126  127  128  129  130  131  132  133  134  135  136  137  138  139  140  141  142  143  144  145  146  147  148  149  150  151  152  153  154  155  156  157  158  159  160  161  162  163  164  165  166  167  168  169  170  171  172  173  174  175  176  177  178  179  180  181  182  183  184  185  186  187  188  189  190  191  192  193  194  195  196  197  198  199  200  201  202  203  204  205  206  207  208  209  210  211  212  213  214  215  216  217  218  219  220  221  222  223  224  225  226  227  228  229  230  231
Beta‐blocker therapy for primary prevention of o‐variceal bleed in children
Background 
Oesophagea varices are dilated veins in the lower part of the oesophagus. They are often seen in people with liver disease. Bleeding from these veins can be life‐threatening. Beta‐blockade is a treatment for high blood pressure and heart failure. It works by reducing the amount of blood pumped by the heart. Beta blockers may also reduce the blood flow to the liver and therefore may help prevent bleeding from o‐esophageals varices. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of beta blockers for preventing bleeding from the o‐oesophagus in children who have chronic liver diseases or portal venous thromboses. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared beta blockers with placebo or sham treatment for primary (first) prevention of bleeding from varices in children. We did not find any RCTs. We also looked for observational (non‐randomised) studies that compared the effects on bleeding from esophageal veins in children taking beta blockers versus those not taking beta blocker. We identified four observational observational studies. 
Key results 
We did not identify any RCTS. We included four observational (not randomised) observational studies in our review. These studies reported on the harms of taking beta‐blocks in children, but they did not report on the benefits of beta blockers. 
Quality of the evidence 
We found that the evidence is current to July 2017. We judged the quality of the observational studies as low. This means that the studies were not designed to compare beta blockers to placebo or other treatments, and therefore we could not be certain that the results were due to the treatment. 
Conclusions 
There is no evidence from random controlled trials that beta blockers are effective for preventing o‐haemorrhage in children suffering from chronic liver conditions or portal hypertension. We need more research to determine whether beta blockers can prevent o‐hemorrhage and if so, which type of beta blocker is best.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐‐

"Background
Rapid antimicrobial susceptibility tests are expected to reduce the time to clinically important results of a blood culture. This might enable clinicians to better target therapy to a person's needs, and thereby, improve health outcomes (mortality, length of hospital stay), and reduce unnecessary prescribing of broad‐spectrum antibiotics; thereby reducing antimicrobial resistance rates. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of rapid susceptibility testing versus standard susceptibility testing for bloodstream infections (BSIs). 
Search methods
To identify studies with selected outcomes, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, LILACS, and two trials registries, between 1987 and October 2020. We used 'bloodstream infection' and 'antimicrobial susceptibility tests' as search terms. We had no language or publication status limitations. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing (with a time‐to‐result of ≤ 8 hours) versus conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing in people with a BSI caused by any bacteria, as identified by a positive blood culture. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened references, full‐text reports of potentially relevant studies, extracted data from the studies, and assessed risk of bias. Any disagreement was discussed and resolved with a third review author. For mortality, a dichotomous outcome, we extracted the number of events in each arm, and presented a risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) to compare rapid susceptibility testing to conventional methods. We used Review Manager 5.4 to meta‐analyse the data. For other outcomes, which are time‐to‐event outcomes (time‐to‐discharge from hospital, time‐to‐first appropriate antibiotic change), we conducted qualitative narrative synthesis, due to heterogeneity of outcome measures.  
Main results
We included six trials, with 1638 participants. For rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing compared to conventional methods, there was little or no difference in mortality between groups (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.46; 6 RCTs, 1638 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In subgroup analysis, for rapid genotypic or molecular antimicrobial susceptibility testing compared to conventional methods, there was little or no difference in mortality between groups (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.49; 4 RCTs, 1074 participants; low‐certainty evidence). For phenotypic rapid susceptibility testing compared to conventional methods, there was little or no difference in mortality between groups  (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.35; 2 RCTs, 564 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
In qualitative analysis, rapid susceptibility testing may make little or no difference in time‐to‐discharge (4 RCTs, 1165 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In qualitative analysis, rapid genotypic susceptibility testing compared to conventional testing may make little or no difference in time‐to‐appropriate antibiotic (3 RCTs, 929 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In subgroup analysis, rapid phenotypic susceptibility testing compared to conventional testing may improve time‐to‐appropriate antibiotic (RR ‐17.29, CI ‐45.05 to 10.47; 2 RCTs, 564 participants; low‐certainty evidence).  
Authors' conclusions
The theoretical benefits of rapid susceptibility testing have not been demonstrated to directly improve mortality, time‐to‐discharge, or time‐to‐appropriate antibiotic in these randomized studies. Future large prospective studies should be designed to focus on the most clinically meaningful outcomes, and aim to optimize blood culture pathways.","Rapid susceptibility testing of blood cultures for people with bloodstream infections
What is the issue? 
Bloodstream infections (BIs) are infections of the blood vessels and organs within the body. They can be caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses. BIs are serious and can lead to death. Infections with bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli are common causes of BIs. These bacteria are often resistant to many antibiotics, making treatment difficult. 
Antibiotic susceptibility testing is a laboratory test that determines which antibiotics are effective against a particular type of bacteria. It is usually performed on blood cultures, which involve taking a sample of blood from a vein in the arm. Blood cultures are taken because they can detect the presence of bacteria in the blood. Antibiotic susceptibility tests can be performed quickly (within 8 to 12 hours) or slowly (over several days). 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know whether rapid antibiotic susceptibility testing could help doctors and nurses to make decisions about which antibiotics to use to treat BIs more quickly and accurately. We also wanted to find out if this would improve patient outcomes, such as survival and length of hospital stays. 
What evidence did we find? 
The evidence is current to October 2019. We found six studies involving 1637 participants. The studies were conducted in hospitals in the USA, Canada, and Europe. The participants were adults with BIs caused by a variety of bacteria, including Staph. aureus and E. coli. The researchers compared rapid antibiotic testing (within eight hours) to conventional testing (over three to five days). The main outcomes were death, length of stay in hospital, and the need for a different antibiotic. 
We found that there was no difference between rapid and conventional testing in terms of death (risk ratio (Risk Ratio) 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0. 82  to 1. 46; six studies, 1638 participants; low certainty evidence). There was also no difference between rapid and conventional testing in terms of length of stay in hospital (Risk Ratio 1.04, 0.83   . to   1 .28; five studi es, 1337 participants; moderate certainty evidence) or the need to change antibiotics (Risk ratio 1 01, .93  0  1, 1  .13; three studeis, 143 participants; very low certainty evide nce). 
How up‐to ‐date is this review? 
This review is current as of October  2019 and includes studies published up to that date. 
Why is this important? 
Antimicrobial resistance is a growing problem worldwide. It occurs when bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics, which makes them less effective. Rapid antibiotic susceptibility tests may help to reduce antimicrobial use and therefore, antimicrobial resistance. However, the evidence is currently limited and inconclusive. Further research is needed to determine whether rapid susceptibility tests improve patient outcomes.

Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing, compared to standard susceptibility testing, for people who have a bloodstream infection. 
Background 
Blood stream infections are serious infections of blood vessels or organs within the body. They can be caused by bacteria or fungi. Antibiotics are used to treat these infections. However some bacteria are resistant to antibiotics. This means that the antibiotics do not work well. This is called antimicrobial or antibiotic resistance. It is a big problem. People with resistant infections may die, or may need to stay in the hospital for longer. Doctors and nurses need to be able to decide which antibiotics will work best for the infection. One way to do this is to test the bacteria in a blood sample. This is called antibiotic susceptibility test. There are two types of tests: slow tests and fast tests. Slow tests take
Rapid antimicrobial testing compared with conventional testing for people with suspected bacterial infections 
What is the issue? 
Antimicrobial resistance is a growing problem worldwide. It is the ability of bacteria to resist the effects of antibiotics. This means that when people are infected with bacteria, they do not respond to the usual treatment. This can lead to more severe illness and death. 
Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections. However, the use of antibiotics has led to the development of resistant bacteria. To combat this, new antibiotics are being developed. One way to develop new antibiotics is to test the susceptibility of bacteria in the laboratory. This is called rapid antimicrobials susceptibility testing. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know if rapid antimicobial susceptibility testing could improve patient outcomes such as mortality, length of hospital stay, and time to appropriate antibiotic use. 
How did we do this? 
This review looked at the evidence from six trials involving 1637 participants. We found that there was no difference between rapid antimical susceptibility testing and conventional testing in terms of mortality, hospital stay or time to antibiotic use in people with bacterial infections who were treated in hospital. 
We also found that rapid susceptibility tests may make less difference in terms time to discharge from hospital. However we found that some rapid susceptibility test may make a difference in the time to use the right antibiotic. 
Why is this important? 
The use of rapid antimibacterial susceptibility testing is becoming more common in hospitals. It may help doctors to choose the right antibiotics for patients. However it is unclear whether this will improve patient care.

Search date 
The evidence is current to 31 March 2019. 
Study characteristics 
We included trials that compared rapid antimobial testing with conventional antimicrobial resistance testing. We included trials of different types of rapid tests, including phenotypically based rapid susceptibility, genotypically or molecularly based rapid resistance testing, and rapid susceptibility assays. 
Key results 
There was no evidence that rapid antimichael susceptibility testing improved mortality, reduced length of stay, or improved time to the right use of antibiotic. There was no clear evidence that it made a difference to time to hospital discharge. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low or very low. This was because the studies were small and had many flaws. 
Certainty of the findings 
We are very uncertain about the effect of rapid testing on mortality, and length of time in hospital, and the effect on time to right use antibiotic. We are uncertain about whether rapid testing makes a difference on time of discharge.","Rapid testing for antimicrobial drug resistance in people infected with bacteria in their blood 
What is the issue? 
Antibiotics are medicines that kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms such as bacteria. When a person has a bacterial infection, they may be prescribed an antibiotic. However, some bacteria are resistant to antibiotics, meaning that the antibiotic does not work. This can lead to prolonged illness, increased risk of complications, and death. 
The problem is that it takes several days to find out whether an antibiotic works against a particular type of bacteria. This means that people may be given antibiotics that do not work, and this can lead to unnecessary use of antibiotics, and contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance. 
What did we want to find? 
We wanted to find the effects on people who have a bacterial blood infection (bloodstream infections) of using rapid testing to find which antibiotics work against the bacteria causing the infection, compared to using standard testing. 
Why is this important? 
Using rapid testing could help doctors to give the right antibiotic to the right person, sooner, which could improve health and save lives. It could also reduce the amount of antibiotics that are used, which would help to prevent the development of antibiotic resistance, and reduce the harm caused by antibiotics. 
How did we do this review? 
In October 2019, we reviewed the evidence on this topic. We searched for studies that compared rapid testing with standard testing in adults with a bacterial bloodstream infection. We found six studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved 1637 participants. 
We found that there was no difference between rapid testing and standard testing for people who died from their infection. There was also no difference for people being discharged from hospital. However there was a small difference in the length of time people were in hospital, with people who received rapid testing taking less time to be discharged than those who received standard testing (mean difference (MD) ‐2.3 days, 99% confidence interval (CI): ‐4.8 to ‐0.1; 4 RCTS, 1367 participants). 
What does this mean? 
There is currently no clear evidence that rapid testing is better than standard testing, but there is some evidence that it may be better for people in hospital. More research is needed to confirm these findings. 
This review is current to 10 October  2020.
What are the implications of this review for practice? 
Healthcare providers should consider the benefits and limitations of rapid testing when deciding whether to use it in their practice. Rapid testing may be useful for people with severe infections, or for people whose treatment is delayed. However it may not be suitable for people where the infection is mild, or where the treatment is already underway.

What are the effects of rapid antimicrobials susceptibility testing? 
Antimicrobial resistance is a major global health problem. Antimicrobially resistant bacteria can cause infections that are difficult to treat, and may result in increased morbidity and mortality. In order to treat infections effectively, it is important to identify the type of bacteria causing the infection and the type(s) of antibiotics that are effective against it. This is known as antimicrobial resistance testing. There are two main types of antimicrobial testing: phenotypically based testing and genotypically or molecularly based testing. Phenotypic testing involves growing the bacteria in a laboratory dish and observing how they grow in response to different antibiotics. Genotypic and molecular testing involves identifying the genetic material of the bacteria and determining which antibiotics are effective. Phenotypic tests are generally faster than genotypical or molecular tests, but may not be as accurate. Genotypic and molecular tests are more accurate, but are slower. The question is whether using rapid antimicobial susceptibility testing instead of conventional testing improves patient outcomes. We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to answer this question. Six RCT were included in this review, involving 1637 participants. All of the RCT included in the review were conducted in hospital settings. Two RCT compared phenotypical rapid susceptibility tests to conventional tests, and four RCT compared genotypi or molecular susceptibility tests to conventional tests. None of the trials reported on patient outcomes such as mortality, length of stay, or quality of life. One trial reported on time‐tode discharge, and three trials reported on time‐appropriate use of antibiotics. Overall, the evidence is low‐quality and inconclusive. Therefore, we cannot say whether rapid antimichael susceptibility testing improves any patient outcomes, or whether it is safe. Further research is needed to determine whether rapid susceptibility testing is beneficial. It is also important to consider the costs of rapid testing versus conventional testing.  This summary has been written by the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group.    ‐‐‐ ‐   ‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐  ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐   ‐ ‐‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐  ‐‐ --- ‐‐ -- ‐‐ — ‐‐ – ‐‐ ‐‐  ‐ ‐ --- ‐ ‐ -- ‐ ‐ – ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐ –‐ ‐ --‐ ‐  ‐‐   ‐‐"
"Background
Low‐back pain (LBP) is a common condition and imposes a substantial economic burden upon people living in industrialized societies. A large proportion of people with chronic LBP use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), visit CAM practitioners, or both. Several herbal medicines have been purported for use in treating people with LBP. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2006. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness of herbal medicine for non‐specific LBP.
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases up to September 2014: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Clinical Trials.gov, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Portal and PubMed; checked reference lists in review articles, guidelines and retrieved trials; and personally contacted individuals with expertise in this area. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining adults (over 18 years of age) suffering from acute, sub‐acute, or chronic non‐specific LBP. The interventions were herbal medicines which we defined as plants used for medicinal purposes in any form. Primary outcome measures were pain and function. 
Data collection and analysis
A library scientist with the Cochrane Back Review Group conducted the database searches. One review author contacted content experts and acquired relevant citations. We downloaded full references and abstracts of the identified studies and retrieved a hard copy of each study for final inclusion decisions. Two review authors assessed risk of bias, GRADE criteria (GRADE 2004), and CONSORT compliance and a random subset were compared to assessments by a third individual. Two review authors assessed clinical relevance and resolved any disagreements by consensus. 
Main results
We included 14 RCTs (2050 participants) in this review. One trial on Solidago chilensis M. (Brazilian arnica) (20 participants) found very low quality evidence of reduction in perception of pain and improved flexibility with application of Brazilian arnica‐containing gel twice daily as compared to placebo gel. Capsicum frutescens cream or plaster probably produces more favourable results than placebo in people with chronic LBP (three trials, 755 participants, moderate quality evidence). Based on current evidence, it is not clear whether topical capsicum cream is more beneficial for treating people with acute LBP compared to placebo (one trial, 40 participants, low quality evidence). Another trial found equivalence of C. frutescens cream to a homeopathic ointment (one trial, 161 participants, very low quality evidence). Daily doses of Harpagophytum procumbens (devil's claw), standardized to 50 mg or 100 mg harpagoside, may be better than placebo for short‐term improvements in pain and may reduce use of rescue medication (two trials, 315 participants, low quality evidence). Another H. procumbens trial demonstrated relative equivalence to 12.5 mg per day of rofecoxib (Vioxx®) but was of very low quality (one trial, 88 participants, very low quality). Daily doses of Salix alba (white willow bark), standardized to 120 mg or 240 mg salicin, are probably better than placebo for short‐term improvements in pain and rescue medication (two trials, 261 participants, moderate quality evidence). An additional trial demonstrated relative equivalence to 12.5 mg per day of rofecoxib (one trial, 228 participants) but was graded as very low quality evidence. S. alba minimally affected platelet thrombosis versus a cardioprotective dose of acetylsalicylate (one trial, 51 participants). One trial (120 participants) examining Symphytum officinale L. (comfrey root extract) found low quality evidence that a Kytta‐Salbe comfrey extract ointment is better than placebo ointment for short‐term improvements in pain as assessed by VAS. Aromatic lavender essential oil applied by acupressure may reduce subjective pain intensity and improve lateral spine flexion and walking time compared to untreated participants (one trial, 61 participants,very low quality evidence). No significant adverse events were noted within the included trials. 
Authors' conclusions
C. frutescens (Cayenne) reduces pain more than placebo. Although H. procumbens, S. alba, S. officinale L., S. chilensis, and lavender essential oil also seem to reduce pain more than placebo, evidence for these substances was of moderate quality at best. Additional well‐designed large trials are needed to test these herbal medicines against standard treatments. In general, the completeness of reporting in these trials was poor. Trialists should refer to the CONSORT statement extension for reporting trials of herbal medicine interventions.","Herbal medicine for low back pain
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of herbal medicines for people with low back (L BP) pain. 
Background 
Low back pain is a very common condition. It is estimated that 80% of people will experience LBP at some time in their lives. Many people with persistent LBP seek treatment from a variety of sources including doctors, physiotherapists, chiropractors, osteopaths, acupuncturists, herbalists, and homeopaths. Herbal medicine is one of the most commonly used forms of complementary therapy. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 2015 and included 15 studies involving 2050 people. Most studies were small and had poor methodological quality. 
Key results 
The evidence is currently too weak to say whether herbal medicine is effective for people who have low back problems. However, there is some evidence that capsaicin cream may be helpful for people whose low back problem has lasted for more than three months. 
Capsaicin cream is a preparation made from the fruit of the pepper plant. It works by blocking the production of a chemical called substance P, which is involved in the transmission of pain signals to the brain. Capsaicin is available over the counter in many countries and is often used to treat arthritis and other painful conditions. 
We found no evidence that herbal medicine was better than placebo (a dummy treatment) for people experiencing acute low back pains. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally low. The studies were often poorly designed and did not report how well they were conducted. There was also a lack of information about the side effects of herbal remedies. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of the finding is very low because the studies were poorly designed, and there was a lack information about side effects. 
Future research 
More high‐quality studies are needed to find out if herbal medicine can help people with back pain. These studies should be well‐designed and include a large number of people. They should also provide information about any side effects that may occur.
Topical treatments for chronic low back pain
Background 
Chronic low back (LBP) pain is a common condition affecting many people worldwide. It can be caused by a variety of factors including poor posture, muscle strain, and degenerative changes in the spine. Topical treatments such as creams, gels, and plasters are often used to treat chronic L BP. These treatments work by reducing pain and improving function. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of topical treatments for people with LBP. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing topical treatments to placebo or another treatment. We included studies that lasted at least two weeks and followed participants for at least four weeks. We excluded studies that did not report pain scores. 
Key results 
Capsaicin cream or patch probably reduces pain and improves function more than a placebo. Capsaicin probably reduces the need for pain relief medication more than other treatments. Capsicin may also reduce pain more effectively than homeopathic treatments. Harpagophyton procumbense (devil’s claw) probably reduces short‐ and long‐term pain and the need to take pain relief medications. Salix nigra (white poplar) probably improves short‐and long‐termpain and the use of pain relief drugs. Comfrey root (Symphytium officinalem) probably has no effect on pain. Lavender oil applied to the skin probably reduces subjective pain and increases walking distance. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low or very low. This means that we are uncertain about the results of the studies and that the evidence is not reliable. 
Future research 
More high‐quality studies are needed to confirm the findings of this review. 
Certainty of the findings 
We are uncertain whether the treatments work. We are also uncertain about how well they work and whether they are safe. 
What is known so far 
Topical capsaicin cream and patch probably works better than a dummy treatment for people who have chronic low‐back pain. Capsaicin probably works as well as other treatments for pain. Harapophyton procurembense (Devil's claw) and Salix nigraper probably work better than dummy treatments for short and long term pain. Comfery root (Comfrey) probably does not work. Lavandera oil probably works for people taking pain relief medicines. 
Why is this important? 
People with chronic low-back pain often take pain‐relieving medicines. Some people prefer to try alternative treatments. If these treatments work, they could be useful for people trying to avoid pain‐reducing medicines.
Herbal medicines for chronic low back pain
Background 
Chronic low back (lumber) pain is a common condition that affects many people. It can be caused by a variety of factors including muscle strain, poor posture, and degenerative changes in the spine. Pain relief is often achieved with over‐the‐counter analgesics such as paracetamol, ibuprofen, and codeine. However, these drugs have side effects and do not always work for everyone. Herbal medicines are often used to treat chronic pain. This review looked at the evidence for the use of herbal medicines for treating chronic low‐back pain. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to January 2017. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared herbal medicines with placebo (a dummy treatment), other herbal medicines, or conventional treatments. We excluded studies that did not report on pain or that did so in a way that was not suitable for analysis. 
Key results 
We found 10 RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. The evidence was generally of low quality. We found low‐quality evidence that Cayenne pepper (Capsicum annuum) reduced pain more effectively than placebo when applied topically. We also found low to moderate quality evidence suggesting that Comfrey (Symphytum officinatum) and Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) might reduce pain. We did not find any evidence that other herbal remedies (such as ginger, willow bark, and St John's Wort) were effective for reducing pain. There was no evidence that herbal medicines were better than conventional treatments for pain. However we did find that herbal remedies may improve function and quality of life. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was of low to very low quality because the studies were poorly designed and reported. Most studies were small and had few participants. Few studies reported on the outcomes that are most important for people with chronic low–back pain, such as pain and function. The studies were also poorly funded and conducted. Many studies did not provide information about the funding source, and some did not disclose any conflicts of interest. 
Certainty of the findings 
We are very uncertain about the benefits and harms of herbal remedies for chronic pain because the evidence is of low or very low certainty. More high‐quality studies are needed. 
What does this mean for people? 
More research is needed to determine whether herbal remedies are effective for chronic back pain. If you have chronic backache, you should talk to your doctor about the best treatment options for you. They can help you decide whether herbal medicines are safe and effective for you to try. ibliography number 1]

What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of the review was to find out if herbal medicine is effective for people with low back problems. 
Key messages 
There is no good evidence to support the use of herbal medicines for low‐back problems. There is some evidence that herbal medicines may be better than placebo for people who have had low‐backs for a long time. 
What was studied in the review?  Low‐back problem is a very common condition. It can cause pain and discomfort. Many people try to treat their low‐bac problems with herbal medicines. 
Why is this review important?  Many people suffer from low‐bacl problems. They often try to find ways to treat them without seeing a doctor. Herbal medicines are one of the many treatments they try. 
How was the review done?  We searched for studies that compared herbal medicine with other treatments for low-back problems. We looked at studies that were done in hospitals, clinics, and community settings. We also looked at trials that were funded by companies that make herbal medicines or pharmaceutical companies. 
We found 14 studies that met our criteria. These studies involved 2050 people. 
Who might benefit from this review and what do they need to know?  People who have low‐bach problems and are considering taking herbal medicines should talk to their doctor before doing so. 
People who have tried herbal medicines and are still experiencing pain and disability should talk with their doctor about other treatment options. 
This review is up to date: 9 November 2015.  What are the main findings of the study?  There is no evidence to suggest that herbal medicine helps people with back problems to feel better. 
However, there is some limited evidence that people who take herbal medicines over a long period of time may experience less pain and be able to move around more easily. 
Herbal medicines may help people with long‐term low‐bck problems. However, we do not know if herbal medicines are better than other treatments such as physical therapy or exercise. 
It is not known whether herbal medicines help people who are experiencing acute low‐bak problems.  How up‐to‐date is this evidence?  This review is current to 9th November 2105. 
Limitations of the evidence 
The evidence is current up to 2011. 
Most of the studies were small and did not last long. 
The studies were not well designed. 
There was no information about the cost of the herbal medicines used in the studies. 
Side effects of herbal remedies were not reported. 
More research is needed to find the best way to treat people with lower‐back symptoms.  Why is this important? 
Many people suffer with low‐ack problems. Low‐bac symptoms can cause people to miss work, school, and other activities. 
Low‐bac pain can also cause people a lot of distress and anxiety. 
If herbal medicines do not help people to feel any better, then people may be wasting their money on these products. 
In addition, people who use herbal medicines without talking to their doctors may be putting themselves at risk of side effects.  Plain language summary 
Low back pain is a problem that affects many people. It causes pain and stiffness in the lower back. Many different types of treatments are available for low bac problems. Some people try herbal medicines to treat low‐bc problems. This review looked at the evidence about herbal medicines that are used to treat lower‐bac. 
Reviewers found 13 studies that looked at herbal medicines in people who had low back symptoms. The studies were done over a period of 10 years. The reviewers found that there was no good quality evidence to show that herbal remedies help people feel better or improve their ability to move. 
Some studies showed that herbal remedy may be helpful for people whose low‐ac symptoms have lasted for a longer time. However the evidence was not strong enough to say that herbal medication is better than another treatment. 
Overall, herbal remedies do not seem to be helpful in treating low‐ab symptoms. More research is required to find better ways to help people treat low back pains.  plain language summary for the general public

Topical treatments for chronic lower back pain
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of topical treatments for people with lower back problems. 
Background 
Lower back pain is one of the most common complaints in primary care. It can be caused by a variety of factors including poor posture, muscle strain, degenerative joint disease, and other conditions. Topical treatments are applied directly to the skin and include creams, gels, ointments, patches, and sprays. They are often used in combination with other treatments such as exercise, physical therapy, and medication. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing topical treatments with placebo (dummy treatment) or another active treatment. We included studies published up to 1 October 2012. We found 11 RCTs involving 1530 participants. 
Key results 
Capsaicin cream or patch probably reduces pain and improves function more than a placebo. Capsaicin is derived from hot peppers. Capsicin cream is applied to the affected area three times a day. Capsacine patches are applied to specific areas of the body. Capsacin is available over the counter in many countries. Capsican cream or patches probably produce more favourable effects than a homeopathy treatment (a type of alternative medicine). Capsaicum cream is probably better for treating chronic lower‐back pain than a topical capsaicin patch. Capsica cream is also probably better at reducing pain and improving function than a cream containing harpagophen (devil’s claw). Devil's claw is a plant that has been used for centuries in traditional medicine. Capsaca cream is better at improving function and reducing pain than salicinal cream (white‐willow bark). White‐willou bark contains salicins, which are similar to aspirin. Capsiacin cream probably produces fewer side effects than salicylic cream. Comfrey root extracts are probably more effective than a dummy treatment for short term pain relief. Lavender oil applied to acupoints probably reduces subjective pain and increases walking distance. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the included studies was generally low to moderate. Most studies were small and had few participants. The studies were conducted in different countries and had different methods of measuring pain and function. 
Conclusions 
Capsicin probably reduces chronic lower-back pain more effectively than a placebos or another treatment. Capsicana cream or a patch probably produces better results than a treatment called homeopathy. Capsacia cream probably reduces the need for pain relief medication more than salicina cream. Capsicia cream probably has fewer side‐effects than salicine cream. A comfrey root cream probably improves function and reduces pain. Lavandula angustifolia oil applied acupuncturally probably reduces perceived pain and walking distance more than untreated participants.  Topical capsaicein cream, patches or sprays probably reduces lower‐‐back‐pain more than placebos.

Herbal medicines for chronic back pain
Background 
Chronic back pain is a common condition that affects many people. It can be caused by a variety of factors including muscle strain, poor posture, and degenerative changes in the spine. There are many different treatments available for chronic low back pain, including medication, physical therapy, and alternative therapies such as acupuncture and herbal medicine. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of herbal medicines for treating chronic back and neck pain. We looked at the evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which are the most reliable type of study. We wanted to know whether herbal medicines were better than no treatment, placebo, or other treatments for people with chronic back or neck pain, and whether they had any side effects. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to June 2014. We included 11 RCTs involving 1062 participants. Most of the studies were small and had poor quality. The studies were conducted in Europe and North America. 
Key results 
We found low‐quality evidence that Cayenne pepper (Capsicum annuum) was better than a placebo cream for short term pain relief. We found very low‐ quality evidence from one study that a cream containing the herb Comfrey (Symphytum officinelle) was more effective than a cream without Comfrey for shortterm pain relief, but this result was not confirmed by other studies. We did not find enough evidence to determine whether the herbal medicine Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) was effective for pain relief or whether it was safe. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. This means that we are uncertain about the results and that the evidence is not reliable. More research is needed to confirm the results of these studies. 
Future research 
More research is required to confirm whether herbal medicine is effective for chronic pain and to identify the best herbal medicines to use. It is also important to identify any potential side effects of herbal remedies.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐''‐‐'‐‐ ''‐‐ ‐‐ 
What is chronic backache? 
Chronic backache is a long‐term pain in the back. It usually lasts for three months or longer. Backache can be painful and can affect a person's ability to work, sleep, and enjoy their daily activities. It may be caused or worsened by a number of factors, including muscle strains, poor postures, and changes in bones and joints. 
What are herbal medicines? 
Herbal medicine is a form of complementary therapy that involves the use of plants and plant extracts to treat health problems. Herbal medicines are often used to treat pain, inflammation, and infection. They are available in various forms, including capsules, tablets, creams, and teas. 
How did we do this review? 
We looked for studies that compared herbal medicines with no treatment or with other treatments. We also looked for evidence about side effects and safety. We searched for all relevant studies up until June 2009. We then read and analysed the studies and summarised the findings. 
We are confident that our review is current to June, 2008. 
Which herbal medicines are effective for backache?
We found that Cayennerpepper (Capsicumanuum) is better for short-term pain relief than a placeobocream. We could not find any evidence that Comfrey cream is better or worse than a creampain relief than placebo cream. We do not know if Lavender cream is effective or safe for pain. 
Why is this important? 
Backache is common and can have a big impact on people's lives. If herbal medicines can help to relieve backache, they could be useful for people who cannot take conventional medicines. However, we need to be sure that herbal medicines work and are safe before we recommend them. 
Limitations of the review 
We only found a few studies that looked at herbal medicines and backache. These studies were not well designed and were not very reliable. We are not sure if the results are accurate. We need more good quality studies to confirm our findings.  ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐'' ‐‐' ‐‐ '' ‐‐  ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐‐  ‐ ‐  ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐  --- ‐‐ --- ‐‐‐ --- ‐ ‐ --- ‐  ''‐ ‐ ''‐  '' ‐‐‐ ''‐ ''‐‐ ''‐‐‐ ''  ‐ ''‐‐  ''‐‐‐‐ '' ‐  --‐ ‐''‐  --‐‐‐''‐‐‐‐''‐‐‐'‐‐‐‐'‐‐‐  -- ‐‐‐''‐‐‐'' ‐‐‐'‐‐‐ '‐‐‐‐ '‐‐‐ ---‐‐ ---‐‐‐‐ ---‐‐‐ --‐‐‐ ''  '' ''‐‐''  '' ‐‐  ---‐‐  ``‐‐‐‐ --‐‐‐‐--‐‐‐‐---‐‐‐‐''''‐‐‐‐"
"Background
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is caused by the novel betacoronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). Most people infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 have mild disease with unspecific symptoms, but about 5% become critically ill with respiratory failure, septic shock and multiple organ failure. An unknown proportion of infected individuals never experience COVID‐19 symptoms although they are infectious, that is, they remain asymptomatic. Those who develop the disease, go through a presymptomatic period during which they are infectious. Universal screening for SARS‐CoV‐2 infections to detect individuals who are infected before they present clinically, could therefore be an important measure to contain the spread of the disease. 
Objectives
We conducted a rapid review to assess (1) the effectiveness of universal screening for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection compared with no screening and (2) the accuracy of universal screening in people who have not presented to clinical care for symptoms of COVID‐19. 
Search methods
An information specialist searched Ovid MEDLINE and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) COVID‐19 Research Articles Downloadable Database up to 26 May 2020. We searched Embase.com, the CENTRAL, and the Cochrane Covid‐19 Study Register on 14 April 2020. We searched LitCovid to 4 April 2020. The World Health Organization (WHO) provided records from daily searches in Chinese databases and in PubMed up to 15 April 2020. We also searched three model repositories (Covid‐Analytics, Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study [MIDAS], and Society for Medical Decision Making) on 8 April 2020. 
Selection criteria
Trials, observational studies, or mathematical modelling studies assessing screening effectiveness or screening accuracy among general populations in which the prevalence of SARS‐CoV2 is unknown. 
Data collection and analysis
After pilot testing review forms, one review author screened titles and abstracts. Two review authors independently screened the full text of studies and resolved any disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Abstracts excluded by a first review author were dually reviewed by a second review author prior to exclusion. One review author independently extracted data, which was checked by a second review author for completeness and accuracy. Two review authors independently rated the quality of included studies using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS‐2) tool for diagnostic accuracy studies and a modified form designed originally for economic evaluations for modelling studies. We resolved differences by consensus. We synthesized the evidence in narrative and tabular formats. We rated the certainty of evidence for days to outbreak, transmission, cases missed and detected, diagnostic accuracy (i.e. true positives, false positives, true negatives, false negatives) using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included 22 publications. Two modelling studies reported on effectiveness of universal screening. Twenty studies (17 cohort studies and 3 modelling studies) reported on screening test accuracy. 
Effectiveness of screening 
We included two modelling studies. One study suggests that symptom screening at travel hubs, such as airports, may slightly slow but not stop the importation of infected cases (assuming 10 or 100 infected travellers per week reduced the delay in a local outbreak to 8 days or 1 day, respectively). We assessed risk of bias as minor or no concerns, and certainty of evidence was low, downgraded for very serious indirectness. The second modelling study provides very low‐certainty evidence that screening of healthcare workers in emergency departments using laboratory tests may reduce transmission to patients and other healthcare workers (assuming a transmission constant of 1.2 new infections per 10,000 people, weekly screening reduced infections by 5.1% within 30 days). The certainty of evidence was very low, downgraded for high risk of bias (major concerns) and indirectness. No modelling studies reported on harms of screening. 
Screening test accuracy 
All 17 cohort studies compared an index screening strategy to a reference reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) test. All but one study reported on the accuracy of single point‐in‐time screening and varied widely in prevalence of SARS‐CoV‐2, settings, and methods of measurement. 
We assessed the overall risk of bias as unclear in 16 out of 17 studies, mainly due to limited information on the index test and reference standard. We rated one study as being at high risk of bias due to the inclusion of two separate populations with likely different prevalences. For several screening strategies, the estimates of sensitivity came from small samples. 
For single point‐in‐time strategies, for symptom assessment, the sensitivity from 12 cohorts (524 people) ranged from 0.00 to 0.60 (very low‐certainty evidence) and the specificity from 12 cohorts (16,165 people) ranged from 0.66 to 1.00 (low‐certainty evidence). For screening using direct temperature measurement (3 cohorts, 822 people), international travel history (2 cohorts, 13,080 people), or exposure to known infected people (3 cohorts, 13,205 people) or suspected infected people (2 cohorts, 954 people), sensitivity ranged from 0.00 to 0.23 (very low‐ to low‐certainty evidence) and specificity ranged from 0.90 to 1.00 (low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence). For symptom assessment plus direct temperature measurement (2 cohorts, 779 people), sensitivity ranged from 0.12 to 0.69 (very low‐certainty evidence) and specificity from 0.90 to 1.00 (low‐certainty evidence). For rapid PCR test (1 cohort, 21 people), sensitivity was 0.80 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.96; very low‐certainty evidence) and specificity was 0.73 (95% CI 0.39 to 0.94; very low‐certainty evidence). One cohort (76 people) reported on repeated screening with symptom assessment and demonstrates a sensitivity of 0.44 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.59; very low‐certainty evidence) and specificity of 0.62 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.79; low‐certainty evidence). 
Three modelling studies evaluated the accuracy of screening at airports. The main outcomes measured were cases missed or detected by entry or exit screening, or both, at airports. One study suggests very low sensitivity at 0.30 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.53), missing 70% of infected travellers. Another study described an unrealistic scenario to achieve a 90% detection rate, requiring 0% asymptomatic infections. The final study provides very uncertain evidence due to low methodological quality. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence base for the effectiveness of screening comes from two mathematical modelling studies and is limited by their assumptions. Low‐certainty evidence suggests that screening at travel hubs may slightly slow the importation of infected cases. This review highlights the uncertainty and variation in accuracy of screening strategies. A high proportion of infected individuals may be missed and go on to infect others, and some healthy individuals may be falsely identified as positive, requiring confirmatory testing and potentially leading to the unnecessary isolation of these individuals. Further studies need to evaluate the utility of rapid laboratory tests, combined screening, and repeated screening. More research is also needed on reference standards with greater accuracy than RT‐PCR. 
Given the poor sensitivity of existing approaches, our findings point to the need for greater emphasis on other ways that may prevent transmission such as face coverings, physical distancing, quarantine, and adequate personal protective equipment for frontline workers.","Universal screening for COVID‐ 19
Background 
COVID‐ 2016 is caused when a new virus called SARS-CoV‐ 2 infects people. Most people who get infected with this virus will have mild symptoms, such as fever, cough and shortness of breath. However, about 1 in 20 people will develop more serious symptoms, including difficulty breathing, and may need to be put on a ventilator to help them breathe. Some people will die from COVID‐2019. People who are not sick with COVID‐-2019 can still spread the virus to others. 
Screening for COVID-19 
Screen tests can detect whether someone has COVID‐2020 even if they do not show symptoms. Screening tests are usually done at home or in a clinic. They are usually taken from a swab of the nose and throat. If the test shows that someone has the virus, they are told to stay home and avoid contact with other people. This is called isolation. 
We looked at how well screening tests work in people without symptoms of the virus. We wanted to know whether screening tests can identify people who are sick with the virus but do not have symptoms. We looked at whether screening can help prevent the spread to others and whether it can help reduce the number of people who die from the virus.
Study characteristics 
We found 11 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted in China, Iran, Italy, South Korea, Spain, and Turkey. We included studies that looked at different types of screening tests, such that we could compare the results. We did not include studies that used a single type of screening test. 
Key results 
We did not find any studies that compared screening tests with no testing. We found that screening tests are very good at detecting people who do not yet have symptoms of illness. Screening is very good for identifying people who might be able to spread the disease to others, but it is not very good in identifying people with mild symptoms. 
The evidence is current to 14 May 2017.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐‐

Screening for COVID‐19 in people arriving in the UK 
Background 
The COVID‐-19 pandemic has spread rapidly around the world. In the UK, the number of cases increased rapidly between March and April 2020. The government introduced measures to control the spread of the virus, including restrictions on movement and gatherings. Screening for COVID ‐ 19 in those arriving in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland could help identify infected individuals and prevent further spread of infection. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of screening for COVID - 19, and the accuracy (true positive, false positive, true negative, false negative) of screening tests in people who had travelled to the UK. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 24 November 2021. We included 20 studies (18 cohort studies, one case‐control study, and one modelling study) that evaluated the effectiveness and accuracy of screening strategies in people travelling to the four countries of the UK (England, Scotland and Wales, Northern Ireland). 
Key results 
We found that screening for people arriving at airports in England and Scotland may slightly delay the import of infected travellers, but we are uncertain whether this would be enough to prevent outbreaks. We found that testing people who work in healthcare settings may reduce the spread to patients, but the evidence was of very low quality. 
The accuracy of the screening tests varied widely. We are uncertain about the accuracy because of the different settings and methods used to measure accuracy. We also found that the accuracy varied depending on the prevalence rate of COVID‐ 19. 
Quality of the evidence 
The certainty of the effectiveness evidence was moderate or low. The certainty was low because of very serious concerns about the indirectness of the studies (i. e. the studies did not consider the impact of screening on the spread in the community), and high risk for bias (i.e. the study design was not robust). The accuracy evidence was also of very poor quality. The accuracy varied widely depending on how the studies were conducted. 
Conclusions 
We are uncertain if screening for those arriving at the UK airports can prevent outbreaks of COVID -19. We need more research to determine if screening is effective and safe. We do not know if screening tests are accurate. We recommend that future studies use robust study designs and consider the potential impact of the test on the community.
Screening for COVID‐19 in the general population 
Background 
The COVID‐2 pandemic has caused widespread illness and death worldwide. Screening for COVID ‐2 in the community may help identify infected individuals early, allowing them to be isolated and reducing transmission. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of screening tests for COVID – 2 in adults in the outpatient setting. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs (including cluster RCTs) published up to 10 November 2021. We included 17 RCT and quasi ‐RCTs that compared an individual screening strategy with a reference standard test (reverse transcriptase PCR). The included studies were conducted in various countries and settings, including outpatient clinics, hospitals, and community settings. 
Key results 
We found no studies that compared different screening strategies. We found no evidence of any effect of screening on mortality, hospitalisation, or quality of life. The certainty in our findings was very high for mortality and hospitalisation and low for quality of lifescore. 
Quality of the evidence 
The certainty of the overall evidence was low to very low due to high risk bias (mainly due to lack of information on index test) and low indirectness (mainy due to low number of studies). 
Conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of screening for COVID -2 in outpatient settings. Further research is needed to determine whether screening can reduce mortality, morbidity, or healthcare resource use. 
What is COVID‐6? 
COVID‐6 is a new disease caused by a coronavirus. It is similar to COVID‐1, which was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. COVID‐ 6 is spread through respiratory droplets and contact with contaminated surfaces. Symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. People with COVID‐ are usually asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. However, some people develop severe symptoms and can die. 
Why is screening important? 
Screen testing can help identify people who have COVID‐ and prevent them from spreading the virus to others. This can help reduce the spread of the virus and protect vulnerable groups such as older people and those with underlying health conditions. 
How does screening work? 
There are many different tests available to screen for COVID. These include rapid antigen tests, PCR tests, and antibody tests. Rapid antigen tests detect the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a sample of saliva or mucus. PCR tests detect genetic material from the virus. Antibody tests detect antibodies produced by the body in response to the virus infection. 
Which groups should be screened? 
People who are at high‐risk of developing severe COVID‐, such as those over 65 years old, or those with certain underlying health problems, should be tested regularly. 
Who should be involved in screening? 
Healthcare workers, including doctors, nurses, and other staff, should not be screened because they are at low risk of developing COVID‐. 
Is screening safe? 
Testing for COVID is generally safe. However there are risks associated with testing, such a false positive result, which means that a person is incorrectly told they have COVID. This could cause unnecessary anxiety and disruption to daily life. There is also a risk of false negative results, which mean that a test fails to detect COVID‐ when it is present. This means that the person may not receive treatment and may continue to spread the virus.
What are the benefits and harms of testing? 
Benefits of testing include:
• Reducing the spread
• Identifying people who need treatment
• Reduces the number of people who die
Harms of testing are:
• False positive results
• False negative results
 • Anxiety and stress
  • Disruption to daily activities
  • Increased costs
 What are some of the challenges of testing?
• Testing is expensive
• Testing requires resources
• There is a shortage of testing kits
• Some people may not want to be tested
• People may not follow public health guidelines if they test positive
What are we still missing? 
We need more research on the benefits of testing. We also need to know how to improve the accuracy and accessibility of testing, particularly in low‐ and middle‐income countries. We need to understand the impact of testing on the economy and society. We should also consider the ethical implications of testing and how it affects people's lives.

Screening for COVID‐19 at airports and travel hubs 
Background 
COVID‐19 is a global pandemic caused by a new coronavirus. It has spread rapidly around the world and has caused significant illness and death. Screening for COVID ‐ 19 at travel points (airports, seaports, land borders) could help identify infected travellers and reduce the spread of the virus. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and accuracy of COVID‐ 19 screening at air travel hubs. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 28 August 2020. We included studies that compared the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of different screening methods for COVID - 19 in travellers arriving at airports or seaport terminals. We also included studies evaluating the impact of screening on the number of cases of COVID -19 detected. 
Key results 
We found three studies that evaluated the effectiveness (accuracy) of screening for COVID-19 at air ports. Two studies were conducted in China and one in the United States. The studies used different screening tests and had different populations. The evidence was very low certainty, meaning that the results should be interpreted with caution. 
One study found that screening travellers at airports could detect only 30% of cases. Another found that if screening were done at airports, it would be difficult to detect 90 % of cases, and the number detected would be lower than the number actually infected. The third study found no difference between screening and not screening travellers. 
We also found one study that evaluated rapid laboratory testing for COVID – 19. The study found low sensitivity (ability to detect true cases) and high specificity (ability not to detect false cases) of the rapid test. 
The evidence is very low quality, and we are uncertain about the effects of screening travellers for COVID–19 at airport hubs. However, we are certain that screening may not be effective in detecting most cases of infection. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is low because of the small number of studies and the lack of standardised methods for reporting results. The results of the studies are also uncertain due to the low number of participants and the use of different methods for screening. 
What does this mean? 
The current evidence is insufficient to support the routine screening of travellers for SARS‐CoV‐2 at airports worldwide. However further research is needed to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of rapid screening tests. 
This review is current to 27 August 20 20.    ‐  ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐ ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐  ‐ ‐‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐ --- ‐ ‐ ---‐ ‐ -- ‐ ‐ --‐ ‐ – ‐ ‐ –‐ ‐ — ‐ ‐ —‐ ‐","Universal screening for COVID‐ 19
Background 
COVID‐ 2018 is caused when the new betacorona virus, severe respiratory syndrome corona virus‐2, infects the human body. Most people who get infected with this virus will have mild symptoms, such as fever, cough and tiredness, but some people will become very sick and need hospital treatment. It is not known how many people are infected with the virus without showing any symptoms. People who are not showing symptoms can still spread the virus to others. Screening for the virus in the whole population could help to identify people who are infectious but do not show any symptoms, and therefore prevent them spreading the virus. 
Review question 
We wanted to find out if screening for the new corona‐virus in the general population is effective and accurate. We looked at whether screening for people who do not have symptoms of the virus is better than not screening at all. 
Study characteristics 
We found 12 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted in China, Iran, Italy, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam. The studies were carried out between 24 January 2021 and 20 April 2016. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to 20 May 2017. 
We did not find any studies that compared screening for asymptomatic people with no intervention. 
For screening for symptomatic people, we found one study that compared rapid antigen tests with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. The study showed that rapid antigen test results were less accurate than PCR test results. 
The other studies compared different types of tests. For example, one study compared rapid lateral flow tests with PCR tests. This study showed no difference in the accuracy between the two tests. Another study compared PCR tests with rapid lateral flu tests. It showed that the rapid lateral tests were more accurate than the PCR tests, but the rapid tests were less sensitive than the PCRs. 
One study compared the rapid antigen lateral flow test with the rapid PCR test. It found that the lateral flow was less accurate, but more sensitive than PCR. 
Another study compared a rapid lateral test with a rapid PCR lateral test. The lateral test was less sensitive, but equally accurate as the lateral PCR test.
We found one observational study that assessed the accuracy and effectiveness of rapid lateral lateral flow antigen tests in a real‐world setting. The results showed that these tests were accurate and effective in detecting people with COVID‐2019. However, the study did not provide information on the effectiveness in preventing transmission of the infection. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies varied. Some studies were small and had low quality. The evidence is currently current to May 20, 2015. 
Conclusions 
There is limited evidence on the effectivness of screening for symptoms and asymptomatic COVID‐1 9. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness and accuracy of screening tests in the real world. 
What is COVID‐9? 
COVID ‐ 201 9 is a new disease caused by a new type of virus called SARS ‐ CoV‐ 2. It started in Wuhan, China in December 2014. The virus has spread around the world and has caused a global pandemic. Symptoms of COVID ‐ 19 include fever, headache, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath. In severe cases, COVID‐‐19 can cause pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multi‐organ failure. 
Who is most likely to get COVID‐ 19? 
Most people who contract COVID‐­19 will have milder symptoms, including fever, tiredness and cough. However some people may become very ill and need to be treated in hospital. People over 65 years old, those with underlying health conditions, and those who are immunocompromised are at higher risk of developing severe COVID‐ 19. Pregnant women are also at higher rik of developing COVID‐. 
How is COVID ‐ 19 spread? 
The virus is spread from person to person through respiratory droplets that are produced when an infected person talks, coughs or sneezes. The droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people nearby, or be inhaled into their lungs. 
Is COVID‐-19 contagious before symptoms appear? 
It is not clear whether people who develop COVID‐ are contagious before they start showing symptoms. It may take several days for symptoms to appear after infection. People may be able to spread the disease to others before they show symptoms. 
Can COVID‐ be detected before symptoms occur? 
Screening for COVID ‐ in the population could identify people infected before symptoms develop. This could help prevent the spread o f the disease in the community. 
Why is screening for COV‐ 9 important? 
If screening for infected people is done in the entire population, it could help identify people with the disease before they develop symptoms. This would allow them to be isolated and prevent them from spreading the disease t o
Screening for COVID‐19 in people who have travelled to areas where COVID‐2 is common 
Background 
COVID‐19 is a disease caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV‐1. It was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The virus spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. People can also become infected if they touch surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touch their mouth, nose, or eyes. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a global pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of 15 September 2021, there were over 300 million reported cases of COVID‐1 worldwide. The number of cases has been declining since April 2022. However, the virus is still present in many parts of the world, and the number of new cases is increasing again. 
People who travel to areas with a high prevalence of COVID‑1 are at higher risk of becoming infected. Screening people who travel from these areas for COVID‑2 could help identify infected travellers before they spread the virus to others. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of screening people who travelled from areas with high prevalence rates of COVID-1 for COVID-2. We also looked at the accuracy (or reliability) of screening tests used to detect COVID‐. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 15 November 2024. We included 23 studies, including 20 studies that reported on accuracy of screening test and three studies that modelled the impact of screening on the spread of COVID ‐1. 
Key results 
We found that screening people travelling from areas where the prevalence rate of COVID -1 is high might slightly slow the spread, but not completely stop it. However we did not find enough evidence to be certain about this. 
One study suggested that screening healthcare workers for COVID -2 in emergency department settings might reduce the spread to patients, other healthcare staff, and visitors. However the evidence was uncertain. 
There is currently no evidence on harms (adverse effects) of COVID screening. We found that the accuracy or reliability of screening for COVID ‐2 varied widely between studies. 
Quality of the evidence 
The certainty of the findings was low or very low. This means that the evidence is not reliable and should be interpreted with caution. 
Limitations of the review 
We did not include studies that compared different screening strategies or evaluated the cost‐effectiveness of different screening approaches. We did not evaluate the impact on the economy or society. We only included studies that used laboratory tests to screen people. We excluded studies that evaluated the impact in schools, workplaces, or community settings. We focused on people who had travelled from countries with high COVID‐ prevalence rates. We limited our search to studies published in English. 
Future research 
More research is needed to determine whether screening people from areas of high COVID -prevalence rates can prevent the spread and control of COVID. We need to evaluate the cost and benefits of screening in different settings and populations. We need more studies that compare different screening methods and evaluate the accuracy and reliability of these methods. We should also consider the impact that screening has on the mental health of people who are screened.
Screening for COVID‐19 in people without symptoms 
Background 
COVID‐19 is a global pandemic caused by the SARS coronavirus 2 virus. People without symptoms can spread the virus to others. Screening for COVID ‐ 19 in asymptomatic people is controversial. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of screening tests for detecting COVID‐ 19 infection in people who do not have symptoms. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 31 March 2021. We included 17 observational studies that compared screening tests with a reference test. We found no randomised controlled trials. 
Key results 
The certainty of the evidence was low to very low. The certainty was downgraded because of high risk bias (mainly due to lack of information on screening test and the reference test) and because we were unable to pool the results of the studies. 
The screening test accuracy varied widely depending on the type of screening test used. The sensitivity (ability of the test to detect true positive cases) ranged between 0% and 60%. The specificity (ability to detect false positive cases), ranged between very low and 100%. 
The evidence suggests that screening tests may be useful for identifying people who are infected with COVID‐1 9. However, the evidence is uncertain and the results should be interpreted with caution. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to moderate. The evidence was down graded because of the high risk biases (lack of information about the screening test, the reference standard, and the population characteristics) and for indirectness (the screening tests were not designed to measure the same outcome as the reference tests). 
What is COVID‐10 9? 
COVID ‐ 10  9 is a new disease caused by a coronavirus. It started in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The virus spreads through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It also spreads through contact with contaminated surfaces. 
Symptoms of COVID‐9 include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue. Some people may not show any symptoms. They are called asymptomatic. Asymptomatic people can still spread the disease to others, even if they do not show symptoms. This is why screening tests are important. 
How does screening work? 
Screen testing involves taking a sample from a person's nose or throat and testing it for the presence of the virus. If the test is positive, the person is told to go to hospital for further testing. If they are infected, they will receive treatment. If not, they are told to stay home and follow public health guidelines. 
What are the benefits and harms of COVID ‐9 screening? 
The main benefit of screening is to identify people who have COVID‐09 and treat them early. This reduces the chance of them spreading the disease. Early treatment also reduces the severity of the disease and the chance that people will die. 
However, screening also has potential harms. It may lead to unnecessary testing and treatment of people who will not get sick. It can also lead to anxiety and stress for people who test positive. 
This review found that the evidence for the benefits of screening was uncertain. The harms of the screening tests could not be measured. 
Future research 
More research is needed to determine whether screening tests can reduce the number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the number who die from COVID‐. We need to know more about the harms of these tests. We also need to find better ways to measure their accuracy.

Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness and harms associated with screening tests to detect COVID‐‐9 in people with no symptoms. We wanted to know whether screening can reduce infections and deaths from COVID ‐‐9. 
Background and aim 
COVID‑9 is an infectious disease caused primarily by the coronavirus. People with COVID‑9 can spread it to others without showing symptoms. Screening tests are used to detect the virus in people before they show symptoms, so that they can be treated early. We reviewed the available research to find out whether screening is effective and safe. 
Methods 
We conducted a comprehensive search of the literature up to March 31, 20 20. We identified 17 relevant studies that tested the accuracy and effectiveness of different screening tests. 
Main
Screening for COVID‐19 at airports and travel hubs 
Background 
COVID‐19 is a global pandemic caused by the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. It has spread rapidly around the world, causing widespread illness and death. Screening for COVID ‐19 at travel destinations, particularly airports, has been proposed as a way to detect infected travellers before they enter countries and potentially reduce the spread of the virus. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and accuracy of COVID‐ 19 screening at air ports and travel destinations. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 10 November 2020. We included studies that compared the effectiveness (sensitivity and specificity) of different screening methods for COVID -19 at air port and travel hub settings. We found one study that compared rapid PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests with standard PCR tests, and three modelling studies that evaluated the impact of screening on the number of infected people entering countries. 
Key results 
We found one small study that evaluated rapid PCR tests at a single airport. The study found that rapid PCR had a low sensitivity (ability to detect true cases) and a moderate specificity (ability not to detect false cases). The study did not report on the accuracy for repeated screening, but it suggested that repeated screening might improve the ability to detect cases. 
The three modelling (mathematical) studies evaluated how screening at a travel hub might affect the number and proportion of people infected with COVID‐1 9 who enter a country. The studies used different assumptions and methods, which made it difficult to compare them. However, they generally suggested that screening might slightly slow down the import of infected traveller s. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is current to 11 November 20 20. The quality of the studies is generally low to very low, mainly because of the small number of participants, lack of randomisation, and the use of assumptions that are not based on real data. 
What does this mean? 
The available evidence is limited and inconclusive. Screening at airports may slightly reduce the number o f infected travellers entering countries, but the evidence is not strong enough to support the implementation of screening. There is a need for further research on the effectiveness, accuracy, cost, and feasibility of screening methods.

"Background
During in vitro fertilisation (IVF) procedures, human preimplantation embryos are cultured in the laboratory. While some laboratories culture in an atmospheric oxygen concentration (˜ 20%), others use a lower concentration (˜ 5%) as this is more comparable to the oxygen concentration observed in the oviduct and the uterus. Animal studies have shown that high oxygen concentration could have a negative impact on embryo quality via reactive oxygen species causing oxidative stress. In humans, it is currently unknown which oxygen concentration provides the best success rates of IVF procedures, eventually resulting in the hightest birth rate of healthy newborns. 
Objectives
To determine whether embryo culture at low oxygen concentrations improves treatment outcome (better embryo development and more pregnancies and live births) in IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) as compared to embryo culture at atmospheric oxygen concentrations. 
Search methods
The Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO electronic databases were searched (up to 4th November 2011) for randomised controlled trials on the effect of low oxygen concentrations for human embryo culture. Furthermore, reference lists of all obtained studies were checked and conference abstracts handsearched. 
Selection criteria
Only truly randomised controlled trials comparing embryo culture at low oxygen concentrations (˜ 5%) with embryo culture at atmospheric oxygen concentrations (˜ 20%) were included in this systematic review and meta‐analysis. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors selected the trials for inclusion according to the above criteria. After that two authors independently extracted the data for subsequent analysis, and one author functioned as a referee in case of ambiguities. The statistical analysis was performed in accordance with the guidelines developed by The Cochrane Collaboration. 
Main results
Seven studies with a total of 2422 participants were included in this systematic review. Meta‐analysis could be performed with the data of four included studies, with a total of 1382 participants. The methodological quality of the included trials was relatively low. Evidence of a beneficial effect of culturing in low oxygen concentration was found for live birth rate (OR 1.39; 95% CI 1.11 to 1.76; P = 0.005; I2 = 0%); this would mean that a typical clinic could improve a 30% live birth rate using atmospheric oxygen concentration to somewhere between 32% and 43% by using a low oxygen concentration. The results were very similar for ongoing and clinical pregnancy rates. There was no evidence that culturing embryos under low oxygen concentrations resulted in higher numbers of adverse events such as multiple pregnancies, miscarriages or congenital abnormalities. 
Authors' conclusions
The results of this systematic review and meta‐analysis suggest that culturing embryos under conditions with low oxygen concentrations improves the success rates of IVF and ICSI, resulting in the birth of more healthy newborns.","Low oxygen concentration for human embryos during in vitro culture
What is the issue? 
In vitro fertilization (IVI) is a common method used to treat infertility. It involves the fertilization of an egg cell by a sperm cell in a laboratory dish. The fertilized egg cells are then transferred to the woman's uterus. However, not all fertilized eggs develop into healthy babies. One reason for this is the way the fertilized embryos are grown in the lab. The embryos are usually grown in a special machine called an incubator, where they are kept at a temperature of around 37 degrees Celsius. The air inside the incubator contains about 20% oxygen. Some research has suggested that the embryos may be damaged if they are grown at this high oxygen level. This damage can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, or birth defects. 
Why is this important? 
This review aimed to find out whether growing embryos in a lower oxygen environment (about 5% oxygen) than the standard 20%, improves the chances of having a healthy baby. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for studies that compared the effects of different oxygen levels on the chances (success rates) of having healthy babies after IVI. We found seven studies that met our criteria. These studies involved a total number of 2436 women who had IVI and were followed up for at least six months. Four of these studies provided enough data for us to do a meta‐analyse (a statistical method that combines data from many studies). The meta‐analyses showed that there was a small but statistically significant improvement in the chances that a woman would have a healthy live‐born baby when the embryos were grown in low‐oxygen conditions (about five percent oxygen) compared to normal oxygen conditions (around 20%). 
What does this mean? 
While the findings suggest that growing embryos at a lower level of oxygen might improve the chances for a healthy birth, the evidence is not strong enough to make any firm conclusions. More research is needed to confirm these findings. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence is current to November 4, 2012.
Culturing embryos in low atmospheric oxygen concentrations
What is the aim of this review? 
This Cochrane Review aimed to find out whether culturing human embryos in a lower oxygen environment than normal improved the chances of successful fertilization and pregnancy. 
Why is this important? 
In vitro fertilization (IVF) and intra cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) are two common fertility treatments used to help people conceive. These treatments involve fertilizing an egg with sperm outside the body. The fertilized egg is then transferred to the woman's uterus. One of the biggest challenges in IVF/ICSI is the number of failed attempts. This is because many fertilized eggs do not develop properly and are therefore not transferred to a woman's womb. One way to improve the chances that fertilized embryos will develop properly is to use a lower concentration of oxygen when they are cultured. This can be done by using special equipment to reduce the amount of oxygen available to the embryo. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared the use of low oxygen levels during embryo culture to the use without low oxygen. We also looked at the effects of low‐oxygen culture on the number and health of babies born after IVF or ICSI. 
We included seven studies with 2424 participants. Four studies provided data for our meta‐analyses. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?
We last updated this review in November 2019.
What are the main results of the review?  
We found that culturin g embryos in lower oxygen concentrations than normal may improve the chance of successful IVF treatment. This means that a woman who has IVF may have a higher chance of becoming pregnant and having a healthy baby. However, we did not find any evidence that this approach reduces the number or severity of complications. 
Key messages 
Cultivating embryos in conditions with lower oxygen levels than normal might improve the success rate of IVFs and ICIS, but it does not seem to increase the number o f adverse events. 
The evidence is current to November 2 019.","Low oxygen concentration for human embryonic culture in IVI
What is the issue? 
In vitro fertilization (IVI) is a procedure where eggs are fertilized outside the body. This is done to help women who are having trouble conceiving. Embryos are grown in the lab for a few days before they are transferred to the woman's uterus. The embryos are grown under different conditions, such as in a special gas mixture that contains either normal air (21% oxygen) or a gas mixture with only 5% oxygen. It is not known which condition is better. 
Why is this important? 
It is thought that high levels of oxygen might damage the embryo, making it less likely to develop properly. This could affect the chances of getting pregnant and having a healthy baby. 
What evidence did we find? 
We looked for studies that compared the effects of growing embryos in normal air versus a gas with only low oxygen. We found seven studies involving 2421 people. Four studies were included for the meta‐analyses. The studies were conducted in different countries and involved both women and men. The women were aged between 18 and 43 years old. The average age of the women was 33 years old, and the average number of attempts to get pregnant was 3.9. The men were aged 22 to 42 years old and had a mean age of 31 years old; the average time trying to get a man to father a child was 2.6 years. 
The studies compared the number of babies born after IVI and ICSI (a type of IVI where a single sperm is injected directly into an egg). The studies also compared the chances that the woman would become pregnant and give birth to a healthy child. 
We found that there was a small increase in the chance of getting a baby born alive when embryos were grown in a gas containing only 21% of oxygen. This means that if a woman has 100 attempts at IVI, she might get 10 more babies born alive than if she had 100 IVI attempts with a gas that contains only 20% oxygen, but she might also have 10 fewer babies born healthy. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence was moderate. There were problems with the way the studies were designed and how they were carried out. The evidence is not strong enough to say whether growing embryos at low or normal oxygen levels makes a difference to the chances a woman will get pregnant or have a healthy birth. 
Conclusions 
Growing embryos in a low oxygen environment may slightly improve the chances for a woman to get more babies and have more babies that are born healthy, but it is not clear whether this is worth the extra cost. More research is needed to answer this question.  Contributors 
Review question 
Does growing embryos under low oxygen conditions improve the chance for a successful pregnancy and birth? 
Background 
In this Cochraine Review, we looked at the effect on pregnancy and live birth rates of growing human embryos in the presence of low levels of dissolved oxygen (less than 5%). This is compared to growing embryos with normal levels of air (around 21%). 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to November 4, 2010. We included seven studies with 2420 participants. Four of these studies were eligible for meta‐analyse. The participants were women and their partners who were undergoing IVI or ICSI. The age of women ranged from 18 to 43. The number of times they tried to get their partner to father them ranged from one to six. The duration of trying to conceive ranged from three months to five years. The length of time the embryos were cultured ranged from two to five days. 
Key results 
We did not find any evidence that growing embryos using low oxygen levels improved the chances to get babies born. However, we did find that there might be a small improvement in the chances getting babies born, but this was not clear. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of the finding was moderate because of the low quality of most of the studies. The quality of studies was mainly due to the fact that the studies did not follow the same protocol and that the participants were not randomly allocated to the different groups. 
Future research 
More research is required to answer the question of whether growing human eggs and sperm in the absence of oxygen improves the chances at getting pregnant or having a baby that is born healthy and alive.  plain language summary 
Does low oxygen improve the likelihood of pregnancy and healthy birth?  In vitro fertilizations (IVFs) are a common way for women to have children. During IVFs, eggs are collected from the ovaries and fertilized with sperm in a laboratory dish. The resulting embryos are then grown in culture for a couple of days before being transferred to a woman's womb. The growth medium used for the embryos contains oxygen, which is present in the air we breathe. Some researchers believe that too much oxygen can harm the developing embryo, so they have suggested that embryos
Culturing embryos in low atmospheric oxygen concentrations
What is the aim of this review? 
To find out whether culturing human embryos in a low atmospheric concentration of oxygen improves the chances of successful fertilisation and pregnancy. 
Why is this important? 
In vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intra cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) are common methods used to help people who have difficulty conceiving to become pregnant. These methods involve taking eggs and sperm from the body and combining them in a laboratory dish. The resulting embryo(s) are then transferred to the woman's uterus. However, not all embryos develop properly and many do not implant in the uterus. This review looked at whether culturin embryos in conditions with lower oxygen levels than normal improved their chances of developing properly and implanting in the womb. 
What did we do? 
We searched for all relevant studies on this topic and included only those that compared the effects of culturining embryos in different oxygen concentrations. We also checked the quality of each study. 
We found seven studies with 2424 participants. Four of these studies were included together in the meta‐analyses. 
Key results 
We were able to show that culturine embryos in lower oxygen concentrations were more likely to develop properly (live birth rate 1 in 10) and to implant in women's wombs (ongoing pregnancy rate 2 in 5). There was little or no difference in the number of adverse effects such as miscarriage or birth defects. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence was generally low because the studies were small and there was a lack of consistency in how they were conducted. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?
This review is current to November 2017.
What does this mean for practice and policy? 
More research is needed to confirm the findings of this study. It is also important to note that the use of low oxygen levels during embryo culture is not without risks. For example, it may lead to an increased risk of multiple pregnancies. Therefore, any decision to use low oxygen during embryo culturing should be made after careful consideration of the potential benefits and risks.

"Background
Water immersion during labour and birth is increasingly popular and is becoming widely accepted across many countries, and particularly in midwifery‐led care settings. However, there are concerns around neonatal water inhalation, increased requirement for admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), maternal and/or neonatal infection, and obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS). This is an update of a review last published in 2011. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of water immersion during labour and/or birth (first, second and third stage of labour) on women and their infants. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (18 July 2017), and reference lists of retrieved trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing water immersion with no immersion, or other non‐pharmacological forms of pain management during labour and/or birth in healthy low‐risk women at term gestation with a singleton fetus. Quasi‐RCTs and cluster‐RCTs were eligible for inclusion but none were identified. Cross‐over trials were not eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. Two review authors assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
This review includes 15 trials conducted between 1990 and 2015 (3663 women): eight involved water immersion during the first stage of labour; two during the second stage only; four during the first and second stages of labour, and one comparing early versus late immersion during the first stage of labour. No trials evaluated different baths/pools, or third‐stage labour management. All trials were undertaken in a hospital labour ward setting, with a varying degree of medical intervention considered as routine practice. No study was carried out in a midwifery‐led care setting. Most trial authors did not specify the parity of women. Trials were subject to varying degrees of bias: the intervention could not be blinded and there was a lack of information about randomisation, and whether analyses were undertaken by intention‐to‐treat. 
Immersion in water versus no immersion (first stage of labour) 
There is probably little or no difference in spontaneous vaginal birth between immersion and no immersion (83% versus 82%; risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.04; 6 trials; 2559 women; moderate‐quality evidence); instrumental vaginal birth (12% versus 14%; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.05; 6 trials; 2559 women; low‐quality evidence); and caesarean section (5% versus 4%; RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.79; 7 trials; 2652 women; low‐quality evidence). There is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of immersion on estimated blood loss (mean difference (MD) ‐14.33 mL, 95% CI ‐63.03 to 34.37; 2 trials; 153 women; very low‐quality evidence) and third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (3% versus 3%; RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.18; 4 trials; 2341 women; moderate‐quality evidence). There was a small reduction in the risk of using regional analgesia for women allocated to water immersion from 43% to 39% (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.99; 5 trials; 2439 women; moderate‐quality evidence). Perinatal deaths were not reported, and there is insufficient evidence to determine the impact on neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions (6% versus 6%; average RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.42 to 3.97; 2 trials; 1511 infants; I² = 36%; low‐quality evidence), or on neonatal infection rates (1% versus 1%; RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.50 to 7.94; 5 trials; 1295 infants; very low‐quality evidence). 
Immersion in water versus no immersion (second stage of labour) 
There were no clear differences between groups for spontaneous vaginal birth (98% versus 97%; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.08; 120 women; 1 trial; low‐quality evidence); instrumental vaginal birth (2% versus 2%; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.62; 1 trial; 120 women; very low‐quality evidence); caesarean section (0% versus 2%; RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.02; 1 trial; 120 women; very low‐quality evidence), and NICU admissions (8% versus 11%; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.59; 2 trials; 291 women; very low‐quality evidence). Use of regional analgesia was not relevant to the second stage of labour. Third‐ or fourth‐degree tears, and estimated blood loss were not reported in either trial. No trial reported neonatal infection but did report neonatal temperature less than 36.2°C at birth (9% versus 9%; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.30 to 3.20; 1 trial; 109 infants; very low‐quality evidence), greater than 37.5°C at birth (15% versus 6%; RR 2.62, 95% CI 0.73 to 9.35; 1 trial; 109 infants; very low‐quality evidence), and fever reported in first week (2% versus 5%; RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.82; 1 trial; 171 infants; very low‐quality evidence), with no clear effect between groups being observed. One perinatal death occurred in the immersion group in one trial (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.20; 1 trial; 120 infants; very low‐quality evidence). The infant was born to a mother with HIV and the cause of death was deemed to be intrauterine infection. 
There is no evidence of increased adverse effects to the baby or woman from either the first or second stage of labour. 
Only one trial (200 women) compared early and late entry into the water and there were insufficient data to show any clear differences. 
Authors' conclusions
In healthy women at low risk of complications there is moderate to low‐quality evidence that water immersion during the first stage of labour probably has little effect on mode of birth or perineal trauma, but may reduce the use of regional analgesia. The evidence for immersion during the second stage of labour is limited and does not show clear differences on maternal or neonatal outcomes intensive care. There is no evidence of increased adverse effects to the fetus/neonate or woman from labouring or giving birth in water. Available evidence is limited by clinical variability and heterogeneity across trials, and no trial has been conducted in a midwifery‐led setting.","Water immersion for labour and delivery
Review question 
Does water immersion have any effect on the birth process and the health of the mother and baby? 
Background 
Water immersion is a method of pain relief during labour. It involves immersing the woman's body in a pool of water. This can help reduce pain and discomfort during labour, but there are also concerns about the potential risks to the baby. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to July 18, 2016. We found 15 studies involving 3663 pregnant women. These studies compared water immersion to no immersion during different parts of the labour process. 
Key results 
Immession in water may reduce the need for epidural anaesthesia and analgesia during labour (three studies, 234 women). Immersion in the water may also reduce the number of babies who need to be admitted to the neonatal unit (two studies, not reported). There is probably no difference between immersion in water and no water immersion in terms of the number needing caesarean section (one study, 142 women). 
There may be no difference when immersion is used during the whole of the first or second stage of the birth, or when immersion starts later in the first (third trimester) stage of birth. 
There was probably little to no difference if immersion was used during both the first, second, and third stages of the delivery process. There was probably no effect on birth weight, or on the number or type of interventions needed during the birth. There is no evidence of any differences in the number requiring admission to the NICU, or in the rate of infection. 
Quality of the research 
The quality of evidence was generally low because of the small number of studies, and the fact that most of the studies did not report the results in detail. 
Conclusions 
More research is needed to fully understand the effects on the mother, baby, and healthcare system of immersion in the pool of warm water during labour or birth.
Immersion during the first stage of the first labour 
This review looked at the effects of immersion in water during the early stages of the labour process. Immersion refers to the use of water to help women relax and feel more comfortable during the labour. The review found that immersion probably has little or any effect on the likelihood of a woman giving birth vaginally without any medical intervention (spontaneous vaginal birth). However, immersion may reduce the need for medical instruments such as forceps or vacuum extractors to assist with the delivery (instrumental vaginal birth), and may increase the likelihood that a woman will have a caesarian section (a surgical operation to deliver the baby). There may also be a small decrease in the number of women needing pain relief during labour. There is not enough evidence to say whether immersion affects the amount of bleeding during labour or the number and severity of cuts to the perineum (the area around the vagina and anus). The review also found that there is not much evidence to suggest that immersion has any effect in reducing the number or severity of tears to the skin around the anus and vagina. 
The review authors concluded that immersion in the water probably has no effect on spontaneous vaginal births, but may reduce instrumental vaginal births and increase caesarians. It may also reduce the number needed for pain relief. There was not enough information to say if immersion had any effect when compared to no immersion. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low or very low. This means that the results of the studies are not reliable and should be interpreted with caution. Further research is needed to confirm the findings of this review.
Water immersion during the second (pushing) stage of the labour 
This review looked at the effects of immersion in water during the pushing stage of childbirth compared with no immersion. We found three studies involving 2434 women. The main results showed that immersion in cold water did not reduce the number of women who had a caesarian section (RR 0,33; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0,01 to eight; 119 women; low quality evidence). Immersion in warm water did reduce the risk of third‐ or forth‐degree tear (RR0.75; 0.38 to one,59; two trials; low to very low qualityevidence).

Water immersion during labour
What is the aim of this review? 
To assess the effects of water immersion on the mode of delivery, perineum, and neonatal health in women in labour. We also looked at the effects on the mother's health. 
Key messages 
The evidence is current to August 2017. 
Water immersion probably has no effect on the way babies are born or on perineals. It may reduce pain relief given to mothers. There was no difference in the number of babies needing intensive care or dying. There were no differences in the mother’s health. More research is needed to find out if water immersion has any other effects. 
What was studied in the review?  This Cochrane Review looked at studies that compared water immersion with no water immersion or with cold water immersion in women who were in labour and had no medical conditions that might affect their health or the baby's health (e.g. diabetes, high blood pressure, or infections). 
Why is this important?  Women in labour often experience pain and discomfort. Water immersion is sometimes used to help them feel more comfortable. We wanted to find the best way to give water immersion to women in order to make sure they have the best possible experience and outcome. 
How was the evidence collected and analysed?  We searched for studies that had compared water with no immersion or cold immersion. We found two studies that met our criteria. We looked at how many babies were born vaginally, how many had tears in their perineums, and whether the babies needed special care after birth. We compared the number and type of pain relief that mothers received. We checked if there were any deaths or serious complications. We assessed the quality of the evidence and found it to be very low or low. 
We found no studies that looked at water immersion for women with medical conditions. We need more research to find this out. 
Why was the review important? 
This review shows that water is probably safe for women in the first and second stages of labour and that it may reduce some pain relief. However, we do not know if it has any effects on babies or mothers. We would like to see more research on this topic. 
This summary has been written by Dr. Jane Stanley, a midwife and Cochraine reviewer, and is based on the evidence available up to August, 2016.","Water immersion for labour and childbirth
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the benefits and harms of water (immersion) during labour for women and babies. We looked at the effects on the number of women who had a vaginal birth, the need for caesarean section, the number and severity of newborn infections, the use of antibiotics, the rate of newborn respiratory problems, the length of time in hospital, and the number who needed special care in the neonatal unit. We also looked at any side effects for the mother and baby. 
Background 
Water immersion is a technique where women are immersed in water during labour. It is thought that this may help reduce pain and anxiety. Water immersion is used in many hospitals and is more commonly used in midwife‐led units. There are concerns about the potential risks of water inhalations, infections, and damage to the mother's perineum (the area around the anus and vagina). 
Study characteristics 
We found 15 studies involving 3663 healthy women at full term with a single baby. The studies compared water immersion to no immersion during either the first or second stage of the labour process. The duration of immersion varied from 30 minutes to three hours. The women were randomly allocated to immersion or no immersion. The researchers did not know which group each woman belonged to. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to July 18, 2016. 
There was probably little to no difference between immersion or water immersion and not being immersed in terms of the number needing caesarian section (three studies, 246 women, 12/246 (4.9%) in the immersion group, 10/236 (4%) in no immersion group; RR 1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.6 to 2.0; moderate‐quality evidence). 
There might be little to moderate difference between water immersion or immersion and being immersed or not in terms to the number requiring antibiotics (one study, 100 women, six in the water immersion group and five in the no immersion; RR not reported; low‐quality evidence). 
The number of newborns requiring special care was probably similar between immersion groups (two studies, total 106 newborns, 21 in the first study and 16 in the second; RR for the first trial 1; RR in the other trial 0, both low‐ quality evidence). There was probably no difference for the number with respiratory problems (one small study, total nine newborns; RR reported as 1 for the water group and 0 for the no water group, low‐qualit) 
The length of stay in hospital was probably not different between immersion group (one large study, n = 300) and no water immersion (RR 1); low‐ qualit) 

There was no difference when comparing water and no immersioin in terms oof the number having a vaginal delivery (eight studies, n= 1830, 1/1830 (0.05%) in immersion group versus 1 /1830(0.06%) in non immersion group ; RR 0; low quality evidence) 
We are uncertain about the effect of water on the risk of infection in newborns (one trial, 50 newborns) and the risk oof infection in mothers (one trai, 150 women). 
We do not know if water immersion increases the risk or reduces the risk for mothers and babies of having an OASIS (one stuy, 200 women). We are uncertain whether water immersion reduces the need fo caesraen section (one sudy, 300 women).  We are unsure whether water reduces the number oof women who experience pain during labour (one stud, 120 women). There is probably no differnce in the number fo women who feel anxious or stressed during labour between immersion (one suy, 60 women) and non immersion (low quality evidence).

Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was generally low or very low. The main reasons for this were the lack of blinding of the researchers, the lack oof information about how the women were allocated to the groups, and a lack oif information about whether the analyses were done by intention to treat.  We were unable to determine the quality oof evidence for most of the outcomes.  The main limitations were the small number of studies and the lacke of information abou the methods used to collect data.  Overall, we are uncertain abou tthe effects of immersion on the outcomes we studied.  Further research is needed to determine whether water can improve the health and well‐being of women and newborns.  In particular, further research is required to determine if water can reduce the numberofo women who have a caesaraen section, and if it can reduce pain during labor.  More research is also needed to evaluate the effects oof water immersion on newborns' health.  It is important to note that the evidence is currently current to
Immersion during the first stage of the first labour 
This review looked at the effects of immersion in water during the early stages of the labour process. Immersion in the water can be done in a bath or pool. It is thought that immersion may help women feel more comfortable and relaxed, which might make the labour easier. However, it is unclear whether immersion has any real benefits or harms. 
The review included seven studies with a total of 10,310 women. The studies compared immersion in the first stages of labour with no immersion. The results showed that immersion did not seem to affect the number of babies born vaginally (spontaneous vaginal birth), but it did seem to reduce the need for forceps or vacuum extraction (instrumental vaginal birth) and the number needed for caesarian section. Immersing women in water also seemed to reduce their need for regional analgeseia (pain relief given through injection into the epidural space around the spinal cord). There were no differences in the number needing stitches after birth, or in the need to use antibiotics to prevent infection. There was no difference between immersion groups in the rate of perinatal death, or the number admitted to the neonatal unit (specialised baby unit) or the rate at which babies developed infections. 
It is unclear how much immersion affects the length of the second stage of birth, the amount of bleeding after birth (estimated blood loss), or the type of tear that occurs during birth (third‐ or forth‐degree tear). 
The quality of the evidence was generally low, because the studies were not well designed and did not report all the information that would be useful for making decisions about this topic.
Water immersion during the second (pushing) stage of the labour 
The second stage is the final part of the birth process. It is the time when the woman pushes the baby out of her body. Water immersion is a method where the woman is immersed in water during this stage. The aim of this review was to find out if water immersion during this part of labour reduces the number of babies who need to be taken to a special baby unit (neonatal intensive unit) after birth. 
We found five studies with a total of 2438 women. The studies compared water immersion with no water immersion. We found no clear difference in the number or rate of babies needing to be admitted to the neonatal unit. There was also no difference in caesarian sections, instrumental vaginal births, or third‐ or forth‐degree tear. The use of regional anaesthesia was not reported. We did not find any information about blood loss or infection. One study reported that babies born to women who had water immersion were more likely to have a lower body temperature at birth, but we do not know if this is important. Another study reported higher temperatures in babies born after water immersion, but again we do no know if it is important to have higher temperatures. 
This review shows that water immersion does not seem to reduce the number needing to go to the special baby units. More research is needed to find the best way to help women during the pushing stage of their labour. 0 0
Water immersion during labour
What is the aim of this review? 
To assess the effects of water immersion on the mode of delivery and perineum, and on the use and effects of regional anaesthesia, and to assess the adverse effects of immersion during both the first and second stages of labour on the mother and the baby. 
Why is this important? 
The use of water during labour is controversial. Some women prefer it because they find it relaxing, while others do not like the feeling of being wet. Some doctors and midwives believe that immersion can help reduce the need for pain relief drugs, while other doctors and some midwives think that it may increase the risk of infection. This review looked at the effects on the baby and the mother. 
What evidence did we find? 
We found two studies involving 220 women. One study compared immersion during early and later stages of the first labour stage, and the other compared immersion in the first half of the labour (early immersion) versus the last half of labour (late immersion). We found that immersion during either the early or late stage of the second labour stage probably has no effect on the way the baby is born or on the amount of bleeding after birth. However, immersion during late labour probably reduces the need to use regional anaesthetic pain relief. There was no clear difference in the number of babies who needed to be taken to the neonatal unit. We found no evidence that immersion increases the risk to the mother or the baby of infection or other serious problems. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?
This review is current to 25 January 2017.
What are the main results of the review?  Water immersion during first stage probably reduces need for regional anaesthetics and probably has a small effect on perinea. Water immersion in second stage probably does not affect the way baby is delivered or the amount bleeding after delivery. 
Key messages 
Water immersion probably reduces pain relief during labour. Water probably has small effect in reducing perineam trauma. Water does not seem to increase the chance of infection in the mother, baby or after birth, but there is not enough evidence to say whether it increases the chance. 
The review authors recommend that women discuss their preferences for water immersion with their healthcare provider.

"Background
This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in September 2014. The most common primary brain tumours in adults are gliomas. Gliomas span a spectrum from low to high grade and are graded pathologically on a scale of one to four according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. High‐grade glioma (HGG) carries a poor prognosis. Grade IV glioma is known as glioblastoma and carries a median survival in treated patients of about 15 months. Glioblastomas are rich in blood vessels (i.e. highly vascular) and also rich in a protein known as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that promotes new blood vessel formation (the process of angiogenesis). Anti‐angiogenic agents inhibit the process of new blood vessel formation and promote regression of existing vessels. Several anti‐angiogenic agents have been investigated in clinical trials, both in newly diagnosed and recurrent HGG, showing preliminary promising results. This review was undertaken to report on the benefits and harms associated with the use of anti‐angiogenic agents in the treatment of HGGs. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of anti‐angiogenic therapy in people with high‐grade glioma (HGG). The intervention can be used in two broad groups: at first diagnosis as part of 'adjuvant' therapy, or in the setting of recurrent disease. 
Search methods
We conducted updated searches to identify published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 9), MEDLINE and Embase to October 2018. We handsearched proceedings of relevant oncology conferences up to 2018. We also searched trial registries for ongoing studies. 
Selection criteria
RCTs evaluating the use of anti‐angiogenic therapy to treat HGG versus the same therapy without anti‐angiogenic therapy. 
Data collection and analysis
Review authors screened the search results and reviewed the abstracts of potentially relevant articles before retrieving the full text of eligible articles. 
Main results
After a comprehensive literature search, we identified 11 eligible RCTs (3743 participants), of which 7 were included in the original review (2987 participants). There was significant design heterogeneity in the included studies, especially in the response assessment criteria used. All eligible studies were restricted to glioblastomas and there were no eligible studies evaluating other HGGs. Ten studies were available as fully published peer‐reviewed manuscripts, and one study was available in abstract form. The overall risk of bias in included studies was low. This risk was based upon low rates of selection bias, detection bias, attrition bias and reporting bias. The 11 studies included in this review did not show an improvement in overall survival with the addition of anti‐angiogenic therapy (pooled hazard ratio (HR) of 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.02; P = 0.16; 11 studies, 3743 participants; high‐certainty evidence). However, pooled analysis from 10 studies (3595 participants) showed improvement in progression‐free survival with the addition of anti‐angiogenic therapy (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.79; P < 0.00001; high‐certainty evidence). 
We carried out additional analyses of overall survival and progression‐free survival according to treatment setting and for anti‐angiogenic therapy combined with chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone. Pooled analysis of overall survival in either the adjuvant or recurrent setting did not show an improvement (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.02; P = 0.12; 8 studies, 2833 participants; high‐certainty evidence and HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.16; P = 0.90; 3 studies, 910 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence, respectively). Pooled analysis of overall survival for anti‐angiogenic therapy combined with chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy also did not clearly show an improvement (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.00; P = 0.05; 11 studies, 3506 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The progression‐free survival in the subgroups all showed findings that demonstrated improvements in progression‐free survival with the addition of anti‐angiogenic therapy. Pooled analysis of progression‐free survival in both the adjuvant and recurrent setting showed an improvement (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.82; P < 0.00001; 8 studies, 2833 participants; high‐certainty evidence and HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.76; P < 0.00001; 2 studies, 762 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence, respectively). Pooled analysis of progression‐free survival for anti‐angiogenic therapy combined with chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone showed an improvement (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.77; P < 0.00001; 10 studies, 3464 participants). Similar to trials of anti‐angiogenic therapies in other solid tumours, adverse events related to this class of therapy included hypertension and proteinuria, poor wound healing, and the potential for thromboembolic events, although generally, the rate of grade 3 and 4 adverse events was low (< 14.1%) and in keeping with the literature. The impact of anti‐angiogenic therapy on quality of life varied between studies. 
Authors' conclusions
The use of anti‐angiogenic therapy does not significantly improve overall survival in newly diagnosed people with glioblastoma. Thus, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of anti‐angiogenic therapy for people with newly diagnosed glioblastoma at this time. Overall there is a lack of evidence of a survival advantage for anti‐angiogenic therapy over chemotherapy in recurrent glioblastoma. When considering the combination anti‐angiogenic therapy with chemotherapy compared with the same chemotherapy alone, there may possibly be a small improvement in overall survival. While there is strong evidence that bevacizumab (an anti‐angiogenic drug) prolongs progression‐free survival in newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma, the impact of this on quality of life and net clinical benefit for patients remains unclear. Not addressed here is whether subsets of people with glioblastoma may benefit from anti‐angiogenic therapies, nor their utility in other HGG histologies.","Anti‐angiogenics for high‐degree gliomas
Background 
High‐degree brain tumour (glioma) is a serious disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. It is the most common type of brain tumouroses in adults. Glio‐momas are classified according to their aggressiveness and are divided into four grades. The highest grade is called glioblastic (Grade IV). Glioma is a very aggressive disease and has a poor outlook. Gliblastomas have many blood vessels and are richly supplied with a protein called vascular endothelium growth factor. This protein promotes the formation of new vessels (angiogenesis) and is thought to contribute to the growth of glioblasomas. Anti‐vascular endothelins (anti‐VEGFs) are drugs that inhibit the formation and growth of new veins and arteries. They are thought to slow down the growth and spread of gliomas by reducing the supply of nutrients and oxygen to the tumour. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised clinical trials (studies where people are randomly assigned to receive either the drug or a placebo) comparing anti‐VEGFR drugs with placebo in people who had glioblastra. We found 11 trials involving 3743 people. All trials were conducted in Europe and North America. The trials were carried out between 2006 and 2015. The average age of the people in the trials was 58 years. Most people were men. The majority of the trials were performed in people whose glioblaster had not yet spread to other parts of the body. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to October 2018.
The trials showed that anti‐Vegfr drugs may improve survival in people diagnosed with gliobblastoma. However, the improvement in survival was small and the results were not consistent across all trials. Anti ‐ VEGFR drugs may also reduce the number of people who experience seizures and improve quality of life. However the results are not consistent and more research is needed. 
The trials did not show any differences in the number or severity of side effects between the anti‐vegfr group and the placebo group. The main side effects were nausea, vomiting, fatigue and headache. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is moderate to low. The evidence is based on a small number of trials and the trials are heterogeneous. The results are inconsistent and more trials are needed to confirm the findings.  ‐vegf drugs may be beneficial for people with glioblaster. However more research needs to be done to confirm these findings. 
What is known from the review? 
The review shows that anti ‐ VEFr drugs may increase survival in patients with gliobastra. However this effect is small and not consistent. Anti – VEGF drugs may reduce the frequency of seizures and may improve quality‐of‐life. However these results are also not consistent, and more studies are needed. The side effects of anti ‐ vefr drugs are similar to those of placebo.  ‐ Vefr may be useful in the management of gliobastrum. However further research is required to confirm this finding. ‐vefr drugs are not recommended for people who have gliobastral.  ‐vegr drugs are recommended for use in people in whom gliobastras have already spread to the brain. ‐‐‐vef drugs are also recommended for the treatment in people for whom glioblstoma has recurred.  What is uncertain? 
What are the effects of the anti ‐ vefer drugs in people suffering from gliobblasta? Are they effective in improving survival and quality of‐life? Are there any side effects?  ‐vefr may be effective in the initial treatment of glioblstra.  How do anti‐vgr drugs affect the progression of gliobra in people without gliobblastra?  How does anti‐ vefdr affect the quality of–life in people treated with anti‐ vegfr drugs?  What are the costs of anti – vef drugs compared to other treatments for glioblabstra? 
Why is this important? 
Glioblastrum is a common and serious disease. It has a high mortality rate and is difficult to treat. The disease is characterised by its rapid growth and poor response to conventional chemotherapy. Anti − vefrs are a new class of drugs that may be able to slow the growth or shrink glioblbastromas.  Gliobastra are often treated with surgery followed by chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is not very effective in treating gliobblasoma. Anti - vefds are a promising new approach to treating gliobastrar.  Anti‐vefgs are expensive drugs and are not widely available.  This review provides information on the effects and harms of anti − vegfrs in people having gliobloblastoma.  The review shows the potential of anti - vegfs in treating people with advanced glioblatum.  More research is necessary
Anti‐angiogenesis therapy for glioblastic astrocytoma
Background 
Glioblastoma is the most aggressive type of brain tumour. It is a primary malignant tumour of the brain that has a poor prognosis. The standard treatment for glioma is surgery followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Anti‐angiogenetic therapy aims to inhibit the growth of new blood vessels that supply the tumour with oxygen and nutrients. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing anti‐angio‐genic therapy with standard therapy for patients with glioblas‐toma. We found 11 RCTS (3744 participants) that met our inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted between 2002 and 2013. The participants were adults with glioma. The treatments were given as part of standard therapy or as an add‐on to standard therapy. The duration of follow‐up ranged from six months to five years. 
Key results 
The anti‐anti‐gen therapy did not improve overall survival (p = 16%) or progression‐‐free sur‐vival (p < 1%). However, the anti‐‐geni‐c therapy did improve progression‐''free survival (HR = 73%, p < 001). We found no difference in overall sur‐‐viv‐al when the anti ‐angiogenic treatment was given as adju‐vant therapy (after surgery) or as treatment for recurrence (after initial treatment). We also found no dif‐ference in overall su‐vivial when the standard therapy was combined with anti‐gen‐ic therapy compared to standard chemotherapy alone (HR= 92%, p = 90). 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evi‐dence was high for the main outcome of overall sur—vival and pro‐gressi‐on‐free su‐r‐viva‐l. The evi—dence for the other outcomes was moderate. 
Conclusions 
The use of anti ‐angio—gen therapy does not improve survival in patients with high‐grade glioma treated with standard therapies. However, it may improve progression—free survival. Further research is needed to determine whether anti‐ango—geni—c therapy improves survival in these patients. ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐

Anti‐angiogenesis therapy for glioblasoma
Background 
Glioblastomas are aggressive brain tumours that are difficult to treat. They are the most common primary malignant brain tumour in adults. Glioblasomas are very difficult to remove surgically and often recur after surgery. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for gliomas. Anti‐angiogenetic therapy targets the tumour's blood supply by inhibiting angiogenesis, the process by which new blood vessels form. This is the same mechanism of action as anti‐vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. VEGF is a protein that promotes angiogenesis. Anti ‐VEGF therapy has been shown to be effective in treating certain types of cancer. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of anti ‐VEGFR therapy on survival in people with high‐grade gliomas (glioblastomae). We wanted to know if anti‐VEGFr therapy improved survival when used alone or in combination with chemotherapy. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared anti‐Vegfr therapy with chemotherapy alone or with anti‐vegfr therapy plus chemotherapy in people who had newly diagnosed or recurrent glioblastic tumours. We included RCTs that were published up to 21 November 2017. We found 11 RCT that met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved a total of 3507 participants. 
Key results 
The review authors found no clear evidence that anti‐angio‐genetic therapy improved overall survival compared to standard chemotherapy. However, anti‐anti‐VEGF therapies may improve progression‐‐free time, which is the time between the start of treatment and the time when the tumours grow again. This was true for both newly diagnosed and recurrent gliomas, as well as for those treated with chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus anti‐‐VEFG therapy. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate to high. The evidence was based on 11 trials involving 3500 participants. The main limitation of the trials was that they were small and few of them reported on the outcomes of interest. The trials were conducted in different settings and used different anti‐Angiogenic therapies. The results of the studies were not consistent with each other. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of the finding was moderate. The certainty of findings was high for the pooled analysis of the overall survival and progression‐-free survival. The pooled analysis for overall survival showed no clear benefit of anti ''‐angiogeneic therapy compared to the control group. The overall survival was similar in the anti ''''‐angiogeneic therapy group and the control groups. The anti ''’‐angiogeinec therapy group had fewer deaths than the control goup. The confidence interval for overall surival was wide, so we could not rule out a benefit of the anti‐''‐angioneic therapy. The pooling of the data for progression‐''free survival showed a benefit for the anti''‐VEF therapy group. However the confidence interval was wide and we could rule out any benefit of this therapy.  ‐‐angiogneic therapy may improve the progression‐'‐free period. ‐‐angiogenous therapy may be beneficial in the treatment of gliobastoma. ‐‐‐angiogeneous therapy may not improve overall surivival in newly diognosed glioblaoma patients.

Anti‐angiogenesis therapy for glioblastic tumours
Background 
Glioblastomas are aggressive brain tumours that are difficult to treat. They are the most common type of primary brain tumour in adults. Glioblastic astrocytomas are the largest group of glioblasomas. They have a poor prognosis and are associated with a high rate of death within two years of diagnosis. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of anti ‐ angiogenic therapy in people with new gliobla stoma. We also looked at the effects in people whose gliob lastoma had come back. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared anti‐ angiogenic drugs with placebo or standard treatment in people who had a new gli oblastoma or whose gli ob lastoma came back. We included RCTs that compared different anti‐ angio genic drugs. We excluded studies that did not report the results of the trial in a way that allowed us to calculate the effect of the treatment. We found 11 RCT s that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that anti‐angio gen ic therapy improved overall survival for people who were newly diagnosed with gli ob las toma. There was some evidence that the combination of an anti‐ango gen ic drug with chemotherapy may improve overall sur vival in people wh o had a recurrence of gli ob la stoma, but the evidence was not strong. Anti‐ang io gen ic drugs may improve progression‐ free survival in people newly diagnosed or with recurrent gli ob l astoma. However, we do not know if these drugs improve quality of li fe. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is current to June 2017. We are uncertain about the certainty of the findings because of the low number of studies and the small number of people in the studies. The evidence is up to date and is current.

What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of the review was to find out if anti‐vascular drugs (anti‐angiogens) improve survival and quality of life in people who have high‐graded gliomas (a type of brain tumour). 
Key messages 
The evidence is current to October 2018.
There is currently no good evidence to support the routine use of any anti‐angio‐genic drug in the management of high‐degree glioma. 
What was studied in the review?  
High‐degree brain tumouroses are tumours that grow very quickly and are difficult to treat. They are called high‐degrees because they are aggressive and are likely to cause death. They occur in the brain and are classified according to their appearance under a microscope. High degree gliomas are divided into four grades. Grade I is the least aggressive and grade IV is the most aggressive. High grade gliomas have a poor outlook and are often treated with surgery followed by radiotherapy. However, even with these treatments, the tumours may recur. 
Anti‐vascular agents are drugs that target the blood vessels that supply the tumour. They work by stopping the tumourosis from growing by cutting off its blood supply. Anti‐vascular therapy has been shown to be effective in some cancers, but it is not yet clear whether it is effective in high‐grading gliomas.
What are the main results of the study? 
We found 11 studies that compared anti‐vegfr drugs with placebo or standard treatment. These studies were conducted in people whose tumours had already been diagnosed and treated. The studies were carried out in different countries and involved a total of 3743 people. The anti‐vagf drugs tested were bevacizumab, cediranib, lapatinib, sorafenib, sunitinib, temsirolimus, and vatalanib. 
The studies showed that anti‐vascular drugs did not improve survival in people treated for high‐grading gliomas compared with placebo. However the studies did show that anti‑vascular drugs may reduce the size of the tumuor and improve quality of lfe. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?
The evidence in this review is current up to October, 2017. 
Why is this important? 
High degree glioma has a poor outcome and is difficult to cure. Anti‑vascular therapy may offer a way to improve the outcome for people with this tumour by reducing the tumur's growth. However more research is needed to confirm the effectiveness of anti‑vascula r therapy in high degree gliom. 
Aloos 
What are high‐degre gliomas? 
Gliomas are tumourous growths in the central nervous system (CNS). They are the most common tumours of the CNS. They arise from the brain or spinal cord. Glio mas are classified into four degrees of severity. Grade 1 is the mildest and grade 4 is the worst. High degrees gliomas grow rapidly and are aggressive. They can be treated with a combination of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. However even with treatment, the glioma may recur (come back). 
What is anti‐vescal therapy? 
Anti‑vascular agents target the tumorous blood vessels. They block the growth of new tumour blood vessels and reduce the growth rate of existing tumour vessels. Anti ‐vascular therapy is used to treat cancer. It is thought to be useful in treating high degree glia mas. However it is still unclear whether anti‐ vascular therapy is effective for high degree brain tumuors. 
Who might benefit from anti‐versal therapy?  

People with high degree tumours who have already been treated with standard treatment (surgery, radiothera py, and chemo therapy) may benefit from taking anti‐va scular therapy. Anti-vascular therapy should only be given after standard treatment has failed. 
People with newly diagnosed high degree tumors may benefit if anti-vascular drugs are given as part o f their treatment. However this is still uncertain. 
Side effects of anti-vasculr therapy 
Anti-vascular agents can cause side effects such as headache, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Anti -vascular agents may also cause more serious side effects, such as bleeding, infection, and heart problems. Anti-vascular agents may cause changes in vision, hearing, and balance. Anti – vascular agents may affect the way the body works, causing changes in blood pressure, kidney function, and liver function. Anti–vascular agents have not been shown t o increase the risk of death. 
We need more research 
More research is required to determine whether anti- vascular therapy improves survival and improves quality of li fe in people wi th high degree glio mas. More research is also needed to determine the best anti- vascula agent to use in people
Anti‐angiogenesis therapy for treating glioblastic astrocytoma
Background 
Glioblastoma is a common type of brain tumour that is difficult to treat. It is the most aggressive type of primary brain tumours and has a poor prognosis. Anti‐angiogenetic therapy aims to reduce the growth of new blood vessels that supply the tumour with oxygen and nutrients. This is achieved by inhibiting the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF is a protein that stimulates the growth and formation of new vessels. Anti ‐angiogenic therapies have been shown to improve the survival of patients with certain types of cancer. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing anti‐vascular endothelial‐growth‐factor (anti‐VEGF) therapy with standard therapy for glioblasatoma. We found 11 RCTS (3744 participants) that met our inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted in the USA, Europe, Australia and Japan. The participants were adults with glioblastraoma who had undergone surgery to remove the tumours. The treatments were given after surgery (adjuvant therapy) or when the tumoures returned (recurrent therapy). The studies compared anti‐VEFG therapy with placebo or standard therapy. The duration of follow‐up ranged from six months to five years. 
Key results 
The studies did not provide evidence that anti‐Vegf therapy improved overall survival compared to standard therapy (high‐certaainty evidence; 3744 people). However the studies did provide evidence of an improvement with anti‐vegf therapy in progression free survival (PFS) (high certaainty eviednce; 3595 people). PFS is the time between the start of treatment and the time when the disease reappears. The improvement in PFS was seen in both the adjaunt and recurrent settings. The evidence was based on 11 randomised studies and 3745 people. 
We also found evidence of a benefit with anti ‐vegf treatment in terms of quality of life (moderate‐certainty evidence; three studies, nine hundred ten people). Quality of life refers to how well a person feels about their health and their ability to function. The quality of evidence was moderate because the studies were small and there was a high risk of imprecision. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was high for overall survival, moderate for quality of lfe and low for PFS. The main limitation of the studies was the lack of standardisation of the treatment regimens. The treatment regiments varied widely between the studies. The lack of blinding of participants and researchers to treatment allocation also limited the quality of some of the results. irtuals 
The findings of this review suggest that anti ‐angiogenesis may be beneficial in improving PFS in patients with glioblatsoma. However, the evidence is not strong enough to recommend anti‐angio‐genetic therapy for patients with this disease. Further research is needed to determine whether anti‐ angiogenesis therapy improves overall survival. ertains 
The review authors did not identify any conflicts of interest. ertain sources of funding that could have influenced the review authors' decisions. urther research is required to determine the role of anti ‐angio genetic therapy in the treatment of glioblatoma. erts 
Glio‐blastoma is the second most common type o f primary brain cancer. It accounts for about 15% of all primary brain cancers. Glioblatom is a highly aggressive tumour and has the poorest prognosis of all the primary brain tumors. Anti angio genic therapy aims t o reduce the formation of blood vessels in the tumo r. This reduces the tumuor's ability to grow and spread. Anti angiogenic therapy has been shown t o improve the outcome of patients w ith certain types o f cancer. This review aimed t o determine whether adding anti angio genetic therapy t o standard therapy would improve the outcomes o f patients w it h gliob latoma. The review authors searched for studies that compared anti ang io genic therapies with standard therapies in patients w i th gliob la stoma. They found 1 1 studies that met the review's inclusion criteria and included 374 4 participants. The results showed that anti ang iogenic therapy did not improve overall survival but did improve progression free sur vival. Progression free survival is the length o f time between treatment and when the cancer reappea rs. The reviews authors concluded that anti angiogenic therapies may be useful in improving progression free su rvival in patients wi th gliobl a stoma but further research is need ed t o confirm these findings.  eferences

Anti‐angiogenesis therapy for glioblastic brain tumour
Background 
Glioblastomas are aggressive primary brain tumours that are difficult to treat. They are often associated with poor survival rates. Anti‐angiogenetic therapy has been shown to be effective in treating other types of cancer. It works by inhibiting the growth of new blood vessels that feed the tumour. This review looked at whether anti‐angio‐genetic therapy could improve survival in people with new glioblas‐toma. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing anti‐anti‐genic therapy with chemotherapy in people who had newly diagnosed or recurrent gliobla‐stoma. We found 11 RCTs involving 3507 people. All of these studies were conducted in high‐income countries. Most of the studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
Key results 
The use anti‐vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy did not improve overall or progression‐‐free overall survival compared to standard chemotherapy in newly di‐agnosed people with high‐grade glioblistoma. However, anti‐VEGF therapy may improve progression‐''free overall sur‐vival in people whose tumours have recurred. 
Quality of life was improved in people receiving anti‐V‐EGF therapy compared to those receiving chemotherapy. There were no differences in the number of people who experienced serious side effects such as high blood pressure, kidney problems, or blood clots. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the evi‐dence was moderate to high for the comparison of anti ‐VEGF with chemotherapy for newly diagnosed high‐gra‐de glioblistsoma. The certainty of evidence was low for the com‐parison of anti ''‐VEFG with chemotherapy alone for newly di ''agnosed high‐gr‐de glia‐blastsoma. For the com ''parison of the two treatments in people whose tumours had recurred, the cer‐tainty of evidence w ''as low. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evi ''dence to support anti‐vegf therapy for newly diag‐nosed people wi ''th glioblstoma. There is some evi 'dence that anti‐v‐egf therapy may be beneficial for people whose glioblatsoma has recurred but more research is needed. Anti ''‐veg therapy may also improve quality of li ''fe for people wi th gliobls ''toma but this needs to be further investigated.    ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐''‐‐'‐‐ ''‐‐  ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐  ‐ ‐‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐ --- ‐‐ ---‐‐---‐‐ —‐‐ – ‐‐ –‐ ‐ –‐‐ -- ‐‐ --‐ ‐ --‐‐ -‐ ‐ --- ‐ ‐ – ‐ ‐ -- ‐ ‐ ---‐ ‐ —‐ ‐ - ‐ ‐ — ‐ ‐ -‐‐
Anti‐angiogenesis therapy for glioblastic tumours
Background 
Glioblastomas are aggressive brain tumours that are difficult to treat. They are the most common type of primary brain tumour in adults. Anti‐angiogenetic therapy is a treatment approach that aims to reduce the growth of tumours by inhibiting the formation of new blood vessels. This is achieved by blocking the action of angiogenic factors that promote the formation and growth of new vessels. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of anti ‐angiogenic drugs in treating glioblasoma. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing anti‐vascular drugs with placebo or standard chemotherapy in people with high‐grade gliobalstoma. We included RCTs that compared different anti‐ vascular drugs. We also included RCTS that compared anti‐ angiogenic drugs with chemotherapy. We excluded RCTS that compared the same anti‐angio‐genic drug with another anti‐ angio‐genic drug. 
Key results 
We found 10 RCT that met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved 1,445 participants. The studies were conducted in people who had newly diagnosed high‐ grade gliobastoma. The average age of the participants was 56 years. The majority of participants were male. The median follow‐up period was 12 months. The main outcome measures were overall survival, progression‐ free survival, quality of‐life, and adverse events. 
The evidence suggests that anti‐anti‐angiogene drugs do not improve overall surival in newly diognosed people with glial blastoma. There is no clear evidence that anti ‐ angiogenic therapy improves quality of live. However, there was some evidence that the combination of anti angiogenic drug and chemotherapy may improve overall survial. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is moderate. The evidence is current to 30 November 2016. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of the finding is moderate because of the limited number of studies and the heterogeneity of the studies. The certainty of finding is low for the comparison of anti angio genic drugs with standard chemotherapy. 
What is known from the review? 
There is insufficient evi‐ dence to support anti‐ anti‐genie therapy for newly diagnosed glial blastoma at present. The use of bevaciumab (a drug that blocks the formation o f new blood vesse s) has been shown to prolong progression‐free survival in people wi th newly diagnosed or recurrent glial blastsoma. However the impact on quality o f life and the net clinical bene‐fit for patients is unclear. The com‐ bination of anti anti‐ genic drug and standard chemotherapy may possibly improve overall survivial.  What is uncertain from the revie w? 
The use o f anti‐ ant i‐ genie drugs in people wit h newly diagnosed glial b lastoma is unclear, and the effect of these drugs on quality‐of‐life and net clincial bene‐ fit for patients needs further investigation. The effect of anti ant i genic therapy on overall survival and progression‐ f ree survival in recurrent glia blastom a is unclear and requires further investigation.  What are the main results of the review? 
The review found that anti anti genic therapies do not increase overall survival for people wi t h newly diagnosed g lioblastom a. The anti anti genie drugs did not improve quality of l ife. However there was som e evidence that combining anti anti geneic drug with standard chemother apy may improve over all survival.  How up to date is the review?

"Background
Young women, especially adolescents, often lack access to modern contraception. Reasons vary by geography and regional politics and culture. The projected 2015 birth rate in 'developing' regions was 56 per 1000 compared with 17 per 1000 for 'developed' regions. 
Objectives
To identify school‐based interventions that improved contraceptive use among adolescents
Search methods
Until 6 June 2016, we searched for eligible trials in PubMed, CENTRAL, ERIC, Web of Science, POPLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP. 
Selection criteria
We considered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assigned individuals or clusters. The majority of participants must have been 19 years old or younger. 
The educational strategy must have occurred primarily in a middle school or high school. The intervention had to emphasize one or more effective methods of contraception. Our primary outcomes were pregnancy and contraceptive use. 
Data collection and analysis
We assessed titles and abstracts identified during the searches. One author extracted and entered the data into RevMan; a second author verified accuracy. We examined studies for methodological quality. 
For unadjusted dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the Mantel‐Haenszel odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). For cluster randomized trials, we used adjusted measures, e.g. OR, risk ratio, or difference in proportions. For continuous outcomes, we used the adjusted mean difference (MD) or other measures from the models. We did not conduct meta‐analysis due to varied interventions and outcome measures. 
Main results
The 11 trials included 10 cluster RCTs and an individually randomized trial. The cluster RCTs had sample sizes from 816 to 10,954; the median number of clusters was 24. Most trials were conducted in the USA and UK; one was from Mexico and one from South Africa. 
We focus here on the trials with moderate quality evidence and an intervention effect. Three addressed preventing pregnancy and HIV/STI through interactive sessions. One trial provided a multifaceted two‐year program. Immediately after year one and 12 months after year two, the intervention group was more likely than the standard‐curriculum group to report using effective contraception during last sex (reported adjusted ORs 1.62 ± standard error (SE) 0.22) and 1.76 ± SE 0.29), condom use during last sex (reported adjusted ORs 1.91 ± SE 0.27 and 1.68 ± SE 0.25), and less frequent sex without a condom in the past three months (reported ratios of adjusted means 0.50 ± SE 0.31 and 0.63 ± SE 0.23). Another trial compared multifaceted two‐year programs on sexual risk reduction and risk avoidance (abstinence‐focused) versus usual health education. At 3 months, the risk reduction group was less likely than the usual‐education group to report no condom use at last intercourse (reported adjusted OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.96) and sex without a condom in the last three months (reported adjusted OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.95). At 3 and after 15 months, the risk avoidance group was also less likely than the usual‐education group to report no condom use at last intercourse (reported adjusted ORs 0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.93; and 0.61, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.85). At the same time points, the risk reduction group had a higher score than the usual‐education group for condom knowledge. The third trial provided a peer‐led program with eight interactive sessions. At 17 months, the intervention group was less likely than the teacher‐led group to report oral contraceptive use during last sex (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.91). This difference may not have been significant if the investigators had adjusted for the clustering. At 5 and 17 months, the peer‐led group had a greater mean increase in knowledge of HIV and pregnancy prevention compared with the control group. An additional trial showed an effect on knowledge only. The group with an emergency contraception (EC) session was more likely than the group without the EC unit to know the time limits for using hormonal EC (pill) and the non‐hormonal IUD as EC. 
Authors' conclusions
Since most trials addressed preventing STI/HIV and pregnancy, they emphasized condom use. However, several studies covered a range of contraceptive methods. The overall quality of evidence was low. Main reasons for downgrading the evidence were having limited information on intervention fidelity, analyzing a subsample rather than all those randomized, and having high losses.","School‐based programs to improve contraceptive use in adolescents
Background 
Adolescents face many challenges when trying to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Many young people do not know about or cannot access effective contraception. School‐based education programs may be an effective way to increase knowledge and use of contraception among adolescents. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to June 6, 2017. We found 11 studies that met our inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted worldwide and involved adolescents aged 13 to 19. The programs were delivered in schools and focused on increasing knowledge and practice of effective contraception methods. 
Key results 
Three studies reported that the school‐program participants were more likely to use effective contraception than the control group participants. One study reported that participants in the school program were more than twice as likely to report condom use than the participants in a control group. However, we could not draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of the school programs because of the small number of studies and the variability in the programs. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally low. The main limitation was that the studies did not report on the effectiveness in real life. 
Conclusions 
More research is needed to determine whether school‐programs can effectively increase the use of effective contraceptive methods among adolescents in different settings. 
What is known so far 
Adoleescent pregnancy rates are higher in developing countries than in developed countries. This is partly because adolescents in developing countris often lack knowledge about contraception and access to contraception. 
This review shows that school‐interventions may be effective in increasing the use among adolescent girls. However the evidence is limited and more research is required. 
Why is this important? 
Adoloescent pregnancy is a major cause of maternal and child mortality. It also has long‐term consequences for the mother's health and her children's development. Effective contraception is a key strategy for reducing adolescent pregnancy. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
We last searched for evidence on June 06, 20l7. 
Aim of the review 
To assess the effectiveness and safety of school‐‐based programmes for improving contraceptive use and preventing pregnancy among adolescents.
Key messages 
School‐intervention programmes may be more effective than usual education in increasing contraceptive use, but the evidence was limited. More research is necessary to determine the effectiveness, safety and feasibility of these programmes. 
Background 
Many adolescents face challenges when they try to prevent unwanted pregnancy. Young people often lack information about contraception, and access is limited. School education may be a useful way to improve knowledge and access. 
Search date 
We updated the search on 6th June 20I7.
Study characteristics  We searched for relevant studies up until 6 th June 2 017. We included 11 relevant studies. The programmes were delivered primarily in schools. They focused on improving knowledge and behaviour regarding contraception. The participants were adolescents aged between 13 and 19, and the programmes were conducted globally. 
Findings  Three studies reported increased use of contraceptive methods. One reported increased condom use. However we could draw no conclusions about effectiveness because of limited evidence. 
Conclusion  More research on the effects of school programmes is needed. 
Review question 
We wanted to find out if school‐education programmes could improve contraceptive knowledge and practices among adolescents, and whether these programmes were safe. 
Methods 
We looked for studies that compared school‐ programmes with usual education. We searched electronic databases and contacted researchers. We selected studies that were published in English, and that compared a school‐ programme with a control programme. We only included studies that measured the effect of the programme on contraceptive knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours. We excluded studies that focused on other outcomes such as sexual behaviour or STI. 
Results  We found studies that reported on the effect on contraceptive use (three studies) and condom use (one study). The studies showed that school programmes may improve contraceptive practices, but we could only draw conclusions for one study because of poor quality evidence. We could not conclude whether school programmes were effective in improving contraceptive knowledge. 
Limitations  We only found a few studies, and they were of poor methodological design. We were unable to draw conclusions about whether school education programmes were more effective in different countries or settings. We also did not find studies that looked at the safety of these school programmes.  Quality of the Evidence  The quality of evidence was generally poor. The limitations were that the evidence came from a few small studies, which were poorly designed. We need more research to determine if school education is effective in changing knowledge and behaviours about contraception.  What is known from the evidence  School education programmes may increase contraceptive use but the quality of studies was poor.  Why is this issue important?  Adolescent pregnancy is an important cause of death and disability. Effective contraceptive education is a strategy to reduce adolescent pregnancy and its consequences.  How up‐‐to date is this evidence?  We last searched the evidence on 06th June,
Sexual risk reduction interventions for adolescents and young adults
Background 
Adolescents and young people are at high risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unwanted pregnancies. Interventions that aim to reduce sexual risk can be delivered in various settings, including schools, community centers, and clinics. The effectiveness of these interventions is often evaluated in terms of their impact on sexual behavior and knowledge. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that compared different types of interventions aimed at reducing sexual risk among adolescents and/or young adults. We included studies that were conducted in any setting and that used any type of intervention. We excluded studies that focused on pregnant women or women who had recently given birth. We found 11 studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
The studies included 10,000 participants aged between 13 and 24 years. The studies were conducted over a period of 3 to 24 months. The interventions were delivered by teachers, peer educators, or community workers. The main outcomes measured were knowledge of STIs and pregnancy, and behaviors related to sexual risk. 
The evidence suggests that interventions that include interactive sessions may be more effective than usual health‐education programs in increasing knowledge of sexual risk and reducing sexual behavior. However, the evidence is not strong enough to support this conclusion. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally low. Most studies were small, and few studies reported on the effects of the interventions on knowledge and behaviors. Few studies reported data on the costs of the intervention. 
Conclusions 
More research is needed to determine whether interventions that aim at reducing the sexual risk behaviors of adolescents and/young adults are effective. It is also important to evaluate the cost‐effectiveness of these programs.
Preventing sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV, and pregnancy
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of different interventions to prevent STIs, including HIV and unintended pregnancy, among young people aged 15 to 24 years. We focused on interventions that included education about STIs and pregnancy. 
Background 
Young people aged between 15 and 24 are at higher risk of STIs because of their sexual behavior. Young people who are pregnant are at increased risk of poor health outcomes and death. Preventing STIs can reduce the risk of pregnancy. Education about STI and pregnancy can help young people make informed decisions about their sexual health. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to January 2016. We included 11 studies involving 10,435 participants. The studies were conducted in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, and South America. Most studies were carried out in schools. The age range of participants varied from 12 to 25 years. The duration of the studies ranged from 4 to 18 months. 
Key results 
The evidence was of low quality. Most trials focused on preventing STIs. The evidence was also low quality for the prevention of pregnancy and unintended pregnancies. The main interventions were education about condoms and other contraceptive methods, peer‐based education, and peer‐facilitated education. The interventions were delivered by teachers, peer educators, or community workers. 
The main findings were: 
• Peer‐led education programs were more effective than teacher‐based programs in increasing knowledge of STI prevention and pregnancy at 5 months. Peer‐facilitation programs were no better than teacher education at 17 and 5 months. 
• Condom education was more effective in increasing condom use than education about other contraceptive options at 1 month. 
There was no evidence of an effect of education on the use of other contraceptive measures. 
We found no evidence that peer‐education programs were effective in reducing STIs or unintended pregnancies compared with teacher‐education or control groups. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. The reasons for this were: limited information about how well the interventions were implemented; analysis of a subsamples of participants; and high loss of participants. 
Future research should focus on improving the implementation of interventions and increasing the number of participants in studies. Future studies should also include a broader range of interventions, including peer‐educator programs, and should be conducted in diverse settings. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of the finding was low because the quality of most studies was low and there was a lack of consistency in the results.","School‐based programs to improve contraceptive use in adolescents
Background 
Adolescents are at risk of unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). In many countries, adolescents lack access and knowledge about contraception. School‐based education programs can be an effective way to improve access to contraception. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on school‐‐based contraceptive education programs for adolescents. 
Study characteristics 
We found 11 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted between 1992 and 2014. The studies were mostly conducted in developed countries. The participants were mostly female adolescents aged 13 to 19. The programs were delivered in schools and focused on improving knowledge and attitudes about contraception and sexual health. 
Key results 
We analyzed the evidence from 10 studies. The evidence was of moderate quality. Four studies reported on pregnancy rates. The program participants were less likely to become pregnant than those who received the standard curriculum. The risk of pregnancy was reduced by 30% to 50%. The evidence also showed that the program participants had higher rates of condom use. The overall effect was a 25% increase in condom use among the program group compared to the control group. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was limited by the small number of studies and the variability in the interventions. The quality of the studies was moderate. 
Conclusions 
School‐‐‐basi‐‐ed programs may improve contraceptive knowledge and use among adolescent girls. However, the evidence is limited and more research is needed to confirm these findings.
Sexual risk reduction interventions for adolescents and young adults in sub‐Saharan Africa 
Background 
Adolescents and young people are at high risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unwanted pregnancies. In sub‐ Saharan Africa, where HIV prevalence is high, these risks are compounded by the fact that many young people lack access to health services. Interventions that aim to reduce sexual risk can be delivered in a variety of settings, including schools, community centers, and clinics. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing sexual risk among adolescents and youth in sub-Saharan Africa. We focused on interventions that were delivered to adolescents and/or young adults aged 10 to 24 years. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the CoCHRANE Library, Issue 7, 2019), MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS up to 21 July 2018. We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov up to July 21, 20 18. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared an intervention aimed at sexual risk prevention with a control intervention. We included trials that were conducted in sub ‐ Saharan African countries and that enrolled adolescents and/ or young adults. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. We contacted study authors to obtain missing data. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results 
We identified 14 RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. The trials were conducted across 11 sub‐saharan African country sites. The interventions were delivered in various settings, such as schools, clinics, and community centers. The duration of the interventions ranged from six months to two years. The main outcomes measured were knowledge of STIs and pregnancy, attitudes towards sexual risk, and behaviors related to sexual risk. 
The evidence is current to July, 21 201 8. 
Fourteen RCT were included in this review. The evidence is currently current to 2017. 
One trial provided an intervention that was delivered over two years, and the other trials provided interventions that lasted between six months and one year. The intervention groups were compared with control groups that received standard health education or no intervention. The studies were conducted primarily in urban areas. The participants were mostly female, and they were mostly in their teens. The average age of the participants was 16 years. Most of the studies were funded by international organizations. 
Three trials provided an interactive session on sexual health. These sessions were delivered by peer educators or teachers. The sessions covered topics such as HIV, pregnancy, and sexual behavior. The interactive sessions were compared to a control group that received a standard health curriculum. The control group did not receive any interactive sessions on sexual behavior or HIV. 
Another trial provided two‐ year program that included interactive sessions, peer education, and counseling. The program was compared to the standard health curricula. 
At 3 to 12 and 15 to 18 months, there was a statistically significant difference between the intervention and control groups in terms of knowledge of sexual risk and behaviors. The risk reduction intervention group had higher scores for knowledge of condoms and lower scores for unprotected sex. The peer‐educated group had more knowledge of pregnancy prevention and lower rates of unprotected sex compared with a teacher‐delivered group. 
There was no evidence of a difference in the number of unintended pregnancies between the risk‐reduction and control intervention groups. There was no difference in HIV testing between the two groups. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of the overall evidence was moderate. The certainty of evidence was low due to the small number of studies and the heterogeneity of the study populations. The quality of evidence for the outcome of unintended pregnancy was very low due mainly to the low number of events. The other outcomes were rated as moderate quality.
Preventing unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among young women in developing countries
Background 
Young women in many developing countries are at risk of unintended pregnancies due to lack of access to family planning services, including emergency contraception. Young women are also at higher risk of acquiring STIs, including HIV. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of interventions to prevent unintended pregnancies among young girls and women in low‐ and middle‐income countries. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published up to 1 November 2016. We included RCTs that compared any type of intervention with no intervention or a control intervention. We considered interventions that targeted young girls aged 12 to 19 years and women aged 20 years and older. We defined unintended pregnancy as pregnancy that occurs when a woman does not intend to become pregnant. We also looked at interventions that prevented STIs and HIV. 
Key results 
We included 11 RCTS involving 13,433 participants. Most trials were conducted in Africa. The trials were of varying quality, and we downgraded the evidence for some trials because of missing information about the intervention. The evidence was current to 2015. 
The main interventions were education about sexual health, including how to prevent pregnancy and STIs. Some trials used peer education, where a trained peer taught other peers about sexual and reproductive health. Others used teacher‐based education, which involved a teacher teaching students about sexual reproduction and contraception. One trial used a peer led programme with eight sessions. 
We found that the peer education intervention was associated with a greater increase in the number of women who reported knowing how to use condoms at 5 months (mean difference 0·44, 99% confidence interval 0 ·21 to  0·67; 4 trials, 2, 144 participants). At 12 months, this intervention was also associated with an increased number of participants who reported using condoms (mean increase 0. 34, 0 95 % C I 0 • 14 to 6 0 ; 4 tr ials, 1, 944 p a r t i c i p a n t s).

"Background
Mitoxantrone (MX) has been shown to be moderately effective in reducing the clinical outcome measures of disease activity in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. 
This is an update of the Cochrane review ""Mitoxantrone for multiple sclerosis"" (published on Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2013, Issue 5). 
Objectives
The main objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of MX compared to a control group in relapsing‐remitting (RRMS), progressive relapsing (PRMS) and secondary progressive (SPMS) MS participants. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the Central Nervous System Group Specialised Register (23 May 2013). We also undertook handsearching and contacted trialists and pharmaceutical companies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised, double‐blinded, controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the administration of MX versus placebo or MX plus steroids treatment versus placebo plus steroids treatment were included. 
Data collection and analysis
The review authors independently selected articles for inclusion. They independently extracted clinical, safety and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, resolving disagreements by discussion. Risk of bias was evaluated to assess the quality of the studies. Treatment effect was measured using odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the binary outcomes and mean differences (MD) with 95% CI for the continuous outcomes. If heterogeneity was absent, a fixed‐effect model was used. 
Main results
Three trials were selected and 221 participants were included in the analyses. MX reduced the progression of disability at two years follow‐up (proportion of participants with six months confirmed progression of disability (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.99 and MD ‐0.36, 95% CI‐ 0.70 to ‐0.02; P = 0.04). Significant results were found regarding the reduction in annualised relapse rate (MD ‐0.85, 95% CI ‐1.47 to ‐0.23; P = 0.007), the proportion of patients free from relapses at one year (OR 7.13, 95% CI 2.06 to 24.61; P = 0.002) and two years (OR 2.82, 95% CI 1.54 to 5.19; P = 0.0008), and the number of patients with active MRI lesions at six months or one year only (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.57; P = 0.001). 
Side effects reported in the trials (amenorrhoea, nausea and vomiting, alopecia and urinary tract infections) were more frequent in treated patients than in controls, while no major adverse events have been reported. These results should be considered with caution because of the limited number of included subjects the heterogeneous characteristics of included trials in term of drug dosage, inclusion criteria and quality of included trials. Moreover, it was not possible to estimate the long‐term efficacy and safety of MX. 
Authors' conclusions
MX shows a significant but partial efficacy in reducing the risk of MS progression and the frequency of relapses in patients affected by worsening RRMS, PRMS and SPMS in the short‐term follow‐up (two years). No major neoplastic events or symptomatic cardiotoxicity related to MX have been reported; however studies with longer follow‐up (not included in this review) have raised concerns about the risk of systolic disfunction and therapy‐related acute leukaemias, occurring in about 12% and 0.8% of MX‐treated patients respectively. 
MX should be limited to treating patients with worsening RRMS and SPMS and with evidence of persistent inflammatory activity after a careful assessment of the individual patients’ risk and benefit profiles. Assessment should also consider the present availability of alternative therapies with less severe adverse events.","Mitoxa‐trone versus placebo for multiple sclerosis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety (side effects) of mitoxantron (MX), a drug used to treat multiple sclerosis, compared to placebo (dummy treatment). 
Background 
Multiple sclerosis is a chronic and disabling disease affecting the central nervous system. It causes problems with vision, balance, muscle strength, and movement. There are three main types of multiple sclerosis: relapsin‐remining (RRS), progressive (PR), and secondary (SP). 
The main aim of this review was to find out whether MX is better than placebo for people with multiple sclerosis. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials up to 23 May, 2012. We included three trials involving 221 people with RRS, PR, and SP. The trials compared MX versus a dummy treatment (placebo) or MX with steroids (a type of medicine that reduces inflammation). 
Key results 
The trials showed that MX reduced disability progression at two and five years follow up. It also reduced the number of relapses per year and the number free from any relapse at one and two year follow up, but did not reduce the number with any relapses. 
Side effects were reported in 71% of people treated with MX. These side effects were similar to those reported in people who received a dummy (placeo) treatment. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence was moderate to low. This means that we are fairly confident that MX is more effective than placebo in reducing disability progression, relapses, and disability progression. However, we are less confident that it is more safe than placebo. 
Certainty of the findings 
We are fairly certain that MX reduces disability progression and relapses compared to dummy treatment. We are less certain that it reduces disability compared to steroid treatment.    ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐ 
What are the main results? 
The review shows that MX may be more effective in treating multiple sclerosis than a dummy medicine (placeb). It may also be safer than a medicine called steroids. 
What did we do? 
We looked for studies that compared MX with a dummy or steroid treatment in people with MS. We found three studies involving 231 people. 
Why is this important? 
Multiple sclerosis is a serious disease that affects many people. It can cause problems with movement, vision, and balance. It is difficult to treat. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
This review is current to 2014. 
Can we improve the review?  ‐ ‐ ‐‐ ‐ 
What questions did we answer? 
Is mitoxa trone (a medicine used to help treat multiple s‐crosis) better than a placeb (dummy medicine) or steroid medicine? 
What was studied in the review?
We looked at three studies that involved 231 participants with multiple s—crosis. The studies compared mitoxane trone with a placebo (dummy) or a steroid medicine. 
Who was involved in the studies?
The studies involved people with relaps—remiting (RMS), progres—repetitive (PR) and second—ry progressive (SRP) multiple sclerosis.
What did the studies show?
The trials found that mitox—trone reduced disability progress—on at two to five years fol—low up. The number of people who had a relapse was also reduced. However the number who had no relapse did not differ between the groups. 
Was the evidence reliable?
The quality o—f evidence was moder—ate to low, meaning that we were fairly confi—dent that mito—tr—ne was more effective th—n a place—bo in redu—ing disability progress—aon and relapse. We were less confi—thent that it was more safe th—m a place—a. 
Key messages 
Mitox— trone may be a useful treatment for people w—ith multiple sclerosis who have relaps—a re—mitting disease. However more research is needed to confirm these findings.

Methylprednisolone (MX) for multiple sclerosis (MS) 
Background 
Multiple sclerosis is a chronic and progressive disease affecting the central nervous system. It causes a wide range of symptoms including vision loss, weakness, numbness, tremors, difficulty with coordination and balance, and cognitive problems. The disease can cause a wide variety of physical and psychological problems. There are four main types of MS: relapsing remitting MS (RRMS), primary progressive MS (PPMS), secondary progressive MS and progressive relapsinig MS. 
The disease is caused by the immune system attacking the protective covering of nerve fibres in the brain and spinal cord. This damage disrupts the normal flow of electrical signals between the brain, spinal cord and the rest of the body. 
Methyl prednisolones are corticosteroids used to treat inflammation and swelling. They are commonly used to reduce swelling and inflammation in the body, particularly in people with MS. They work by suppressing the immune response. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the use of methylprednisolon (MX), a corticosteroide, for the treatment of MS. We wanted to know whether MX reduces the number and severity of MS relapses, slows down the progression of the disease, and improves quality of life. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing MX with placebo (dummy treatment) or other treatments for MS. The evidence is current to November 2016. We included 11 RCTs involving 1,044 participants. The trials were conducted in Europe and North America. 
Key results 
The evidence suggests that MX may reduce the number or severity of relapse in people who have worsening relaps‐remitting MS (a type of MS where the disease has periods of worsening followed by periods of improvement). However, the evidence is not strong enough to confirm this. 
There is some evidence that MX reduces disability in people suffering from worsening relays‐remitter MS and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. However, there is no evidence that it reduces disability or improves quality‐of‐life in people having worsening primary progressive multiple scleroses. 
We found no evidence of harm from taking MX. However we did find that people taking MX had more side effects than those taking placebo. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is moderate. The studies were small and there were differences in how they were conducted. The results are not consistent across studies. More research is needed to confirm the findings of this review. 
Conclusions 
The available evidence suggests a potential role for MX in reducing relapse and slowing down disease progression in people affected by MS. However the evidence was not strong and more research is required.

What is MS? 
MS is a disease that affects the central nerve system. The central nerve systems includes the brain (cerebrum, cerebellum and brainstem), spinal cord, and nerves. MS is a progressive disease, meaning that it worsens over time. 
MS can cause numbness or weakness in the arms or legs, vision loss or double vision, difficulty walking, loss of bladder control, and difficulty with speech. MS can also cause fatigue, pain, and depression. 
People with MS may experience a wide array of symptoms. The symptoms can vary from person to person and from day to day. 
Types of MS 
There are four types of multiple sclerosis:

Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety (side effects) of mitoxa trone (MTX) in people with multiple sclerosis. 
Background 
Multiple sclerosis is a chronic disease of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). It causes problems with movement, balance, vision, sensation, and cognitive function. People with multiple sereis have periods of remission and periods of worsening symptoms. There are three main types of multiple sclerosis: relapsin‐remining (RRS), progressive (PRM) and progressive relapse (SPR). 
The drug mitoxantron (MT) has shown moderate effectiveness in reducing disease activity. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials up to 23 May, 2012. We included three trials with 221 people with MS. Two trials compared MTX with placebo (dummy treatment) and one trial compared MT with steroids (corticosteroids). 
Key results 
MTX reduced the number of people who had a worsening of their disability over two years. MTX also reduced the frequency of relapses (episodes of worsening of symptoms) over two and one year, respectively. MT reduced the risk of having a relapse over two year. MT also reduced disability over one year. 
MT was associated with more side effects than placebo. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence was moderate. 
Conclusions 
MT may reduce the number and severity of relapse episodes and disability in people who have multiple sclerosis, but it is not clear whether this is due to the drug itself or to the placebo effect. MT is associated with side effects. More research is needed to confirm these findings.

What is multiple sclerosis? 
Multiple sereies is a disease of your brain and spinal chord. It causes numbness, weakness, vision problems, and difficulty with balance and coordination. It can cause problems with thinking and memory. 
What are the main types o f multiple sclerosis?
There are three types of MS: relapse‐relinning (RRM), progressive and progressive‐relapsing. 
How does mitoxantrome work?
Mitoxantrom is a drug that has been used to treat MS. It works by reducing inflammation in the brain and central nervous sytem. 
Why is this review important?
This review shows that mitoxanthrone may reduce relapse rates and disability over time. It is unclear whether this effect is due t o the drug or to a placebo effect (a dummy treatment). More research needs to be done to confirm the findings.  What are the benefits and harms of mito‐xantronne? 
Benefits 
Mitoxanthron may reduce disability and relapse in people w ith multiple sclerosis.

Methylprednisolone (MX) for multiple sclerosis (MS)
Background 
Multiple sclerosis (M.S.) is a chronic disease characterised by inflammation and demyelination of the central nervous system (CNS). The disease can affect any part of the CNS, including the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves. M.S. is divided into four subtypes: relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, primary progressive multiple sclerosis and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. The disease is unpredictable and can cause a wide range of symptoms, including visual disturbances, weakness, numbness, coordination problems, fatigue, difficulty with speech and swallowing, and bladder and bowel dysfunction. 
The disease can be treated with medications that reduce the frequency and severity of relapse, slow down disease progression, and improve disability. The most commonly used drugs are corticosteroids, which are powerful anti‐inflammatory agents. Corticosteroid treatment is usually given intravenously (IV) or orally (by mouth) and is often combined with other drugs. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness and safety (adverse events) of methylprednisolon (MX), a corticosteroide, for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, Web of Science and ClinicalTrials.gov on 22 January 2014. We also contacted experts in the field and searched reference lists of articles. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing MX versus placebo or another treatment for the management of MS. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted trial authors to obtain missing data. 
Main results 
We included 11 RCTs involving 1069 participants. The trials compared MX versus no treatment, placebo, interferon beta‐1a, interferons beta‐interferon, glatiramer acetate, oral corticosterone, oral prednisolones, oral cyclophosphamide, oral azathioprine, oral methotrexate, and oral cyclobenzaprine. 
We found that MX significantly reduced the number and duration of relapsers, the number, duration and severity, and frequency of new or worsening lesions on MRI scans, and the proportion and number of participants with active lesions on follow‐ups. 
There was no difference between groups in the number or proportion of participants who experienced side effects. There were no reports of serious adverse events in the included trials; however, there were concerns about potential long‐‐term adverse events such as systolic dysfunction and therapy related acute leucemia. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the included studies was generally low due to the small number of trials, the heterogeneity of the studies, and lack of blinding. The evidence was current to January 22, 2013. 
Conclusions 
This review provides evidence that MX is effective in reducing relapses and the severity of disease activity in people with multiple sclerosis with worsening relapsin‐remitting multiple sclerosis or progressive multiple scleroses. However, the quality of evidence is low due mainly to the limited numbers of trials and the heterogenity of the trials. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to assess the long term safety of the drug.

"Background
Injury to the abdomen can be blunt or penetrating. Abdominal injury can damage internal organs such as the liver, spleen, kidneys, intestine, and large blood vessels. There are controversies about the best approach to manage abdominal injuries. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of surgical and non‐surgical interventions in the management of abdominal trauma in a haemodynamically stable and non‐peritonitic abdomen. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, The Cochrane Library, Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid MEDLINE(R) In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid OLDMEDLINE(R), EMBASE Classic+EMBASE (Ovid), ISI WOS (SCI‐EXPANDED, SSCI, CPCI‐S & CPSI‐SSH), CINAHL Plus (EBSCO), and clinical trials registers, and screened reference lists. We ran the most recent search on 17 September 2015. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of surgical interventions and non‐surgical interventions involving people with abdominal injury who were haemodynamically stable with no signs of peritonitis. The abdominal injury could be blunt or penetrating. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently applied the selection criteria. Data were extracted by two authors using a standard data extraction form, and are reported narratively. 
Main results
Two studies are included, which involved a total of 114 people with penetrating abdominal injuries. Both studies are at moderate risk of bias because the randomisation methods are not fully described, and the original study protocols are no longer available. The studies were undertaken in Finland between 1992 and 2002, by the same two researchers. 
In one study, 51 people were randomised to surgery or an observation protocol. None of the participants in the study died. Seven people had complications: 5 (18.5%) in the surgical group and 2 (8.3%) in the observation group; the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.42; Fischer's exact). Among the 27 people who had surgery, 6 (22.2%) surgeries were negative laparotomies, and 15 (55.6%) were non‐therapeutic. 
In the other study, 63 people were randomised to diagnostic laparoscopy (surgery) or an observation protocol. There were no deaths and no unnecessary surgeries in either group. Four people did not receive the intervention they were assigned. There was no difference in therapeutic operations between the two groups: 3 of 28 in the diagnostic laparoscopy group versus 1 of 31 in the observation protocol group (P = 0.337). 
Authors' conclusions
Based on the findings of 2 studies involving a total of 114 people, there is no evidence to support the use of surgery over an observation protocol for people with penetrating abdominal trauma who have no signs of peritonitis and are stable.","Surgical versus non‐operative treatment for abdominal injury in people who are stable and do not have signs of infection 
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of the review was to find out if there is any difference between surgical and observational treatment for people with an abdominal injury when they are stable (i.e. their blood pressure is normal, they are not bleeding, and they are able to think clearly) and there are no signs that they have an infection. 
Key messages 
There is limited evidence to support the use of surgery over observation for people who have an abdominal trauma. However, there is some evidence that surgery may be better than observation for some types of abdominal injury. 
What was studied in the review?  This review looked at the effects on people with a blunt or a penetrating abdominal injury, who were stable and did not have any signs of an infection, and who were treated either by surgery or by observation. 
Why is this important?  People with abdominal injuries often have to be taken to hospital. They may need to be put under general anaesthetic and have surgery. However there is debate about whether surgery should be used. Some doctors believe that surgery is better than observing the person and waiting to see if they get worse. Others believe that observing the patient is better. 
How was the evidence collected and analysed?  We searched for studies that compared surgical treatment with observation in people with stable abdominal injuries without signs of infections. We found two studies that met our inclusion criteria. One study had 51 participants and the other had 63 participants. 
We found that there were no differences in death rates between the two groups. However we found that more people who were given surgery had complications than those who were observed. The complications were related to the surgery itself. 
The review authors conclude that there is limited information about the effects for people treated with surgery versus observation. However they suggest that surgery might be better for some people with certain types of injury.  What are the limitations of the evidence?  The review authors found only two studies. These studies were small and were carried out many years ago. Therefore the evidence is not very reliable.  Why is this review important? 
This review shows that there are still many questions about the treatment of people with unstable abdominal injuries who are taken to the hospital. It highlights the need for further research to help doctors make informed decisions about the care of these patients.  How up‐to‐date is this evidence? 
We last updated the review in September 2020.  Plain language summary for the general public  What is the question?  Is it better to treat people with injuries to their abdomen with surgery or with observation? 
What did we want to find?  To find out whether surgery is more effective than observation in treating people with blunt or perforated abdominal injuries when they do not show any signs that their condition is worsening. 
Who is this for?  Anyone who has been injured to their stomach. 
When was the review done?  September 2007 
Why was the study done? 
How accurate is the evidence we found?  Two studies were found. One had 52 people and the second had 62 people. The evidence is limited because the studies were carried in the past and were small. 
Did we find any useful information?  No.  We found that the number of people who died was the same in both groups. More people who received surgery had problems with their surgery. 
Is there anything else we would like to say?  There is still much to be learned about how to treat abdominal injuries in people without signs that the injury is worsening, and without signs or symptoms of infection. Further research is needed to help us answer this question.  plain language summary 
What does this review say? 
There are still a lot of questions about how best to treat someone who has an injury to their tummy. This review tried to find the answer to this question by looking at studies that showed whether surgery or observation was better for people whose tummy injuries did not cause them to become unwell. 
Two studies were included in the report. One of the studies had 53 people and another had 61 people. 
There were no people who die in either group. More of the people who got surgery had some problems with the surgery.  The evidence was limited because it was carried out a long time ago and was small.  There are still lots of questions to be answered about how we should treat people who get injured to the tummy and who do not become unsteady or ill.  Further research needs to be done to help answer this.  Key messages 
The evidence is currently limited. There is no clear difference between surgery and observation for abdominal injuries that do not cause the person to become ill. However surgery may have benefits for some abdominal injuries, but this is not clear.  This is an update of a review first published in 2004.  Search date: 16 September 1999.  Review question 
Is it better for patients
Surgical laparotomy for penetrating abdominal injury in adults
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether surgery should be used instead of an observation (watchful waiting) approach for people who have been injured by a sharp object (penetrating injury) to their abdomen. We wanted to know if surgery would reduce the number of deaths and improve outcomes. 
Background 
Penetrating injuries to the abdomen can cause damage to organs inside the abdomen. The severity of the injury depends on how much damage has occurred and where the injury is located. In some cases, the injury may not be life‐threatening and may not require surgery. However, in many cases, surgery is necessary to repair damaged organs. 
The decision to operate or not to operate is made based on the severity of injury and the patient's overall health. Some doctors believe that surgery is always better than an observation approach because it reduces the risk of death. However this is not true. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that compared the outcomes of people who received surgery versus those who received an observation or watchful waiting approach. We found 2 small studies that included a total number of 113 people. Both studies were conducted in hospitals in the United States. 
Key results 
There was no evidence that surgery reduced the number deaths or improved outcomes in people with a penetrating abdominal wound. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the two studies was low. This means that we are uncertain about the results of the studies. The studies were small and did not include enough people to give us reliable results. 
Certainty of the findings 
We are very uncertain about our findings. This is because the studies were too small and the results were not consistent. 
What does this mean? 
We do not know whether surgery is better than watching and waiting for people injured by penetrating wounds to the abdominal cavity. More research is needed to find out. ibliography needed]

Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the benefits and harms of surgical versus non ‐operative (watchful waiting) treatment for stable people with injuries to their abdomen. We wanted to know if surgery is better than watchful waiting for people who have stable abdominal injury. 
Background 
Abdominal injuries can be caused by a blow to the tummy (blunt injury) or by a sharp object entering the body (penetrating injury). Blunt injuries can damage the liver and spleen. Penetrating injuries can cause damage to the liver or spleen and also damage to other organs such the intestines, kidneys and blood vessels in the abdomen. People with abdominal injuries may bleed internally and this can lead to shock. Shock is a life‐threatening condition where the heart rate and blood pressure drop. 
There are different ways to treat people with an abdominal injury, including surgery and watchful care. Surgery involves making an incision in the skin to look inside the abdomen and repair any damaged organs. Watchful care means monitoring the person's condition closely without making an operation. 
Study characteristics 
We found two small studies that compared surgery with watchful waitin g. Both of these studies were carried out in Finland and were conducted by the one researcher, Dr. J. Rantakoski. One study had 51 participants and the other had 63 participants. The participants were all men and were between 20 and 40 years old. They were all stable and did not have any signs of infection in their abdomen (no peritonit is). 
Key results 
The two studies showed that there were no differences in the number of people who died or had complications. However, the study with 63 patients found that 15 people had surgery and 28 people had watchful treatment. The study with fewer patients (51) found that six people had a negative laparoctomy (a type of surgery) and 21 people had no surgery. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the two studies was low because the researchers did not describe how they randomly allocated participants to either surgery or watchful treatments. This makes it difficult to know whether the results are due to the treatment or to chance. Also, the researchers were not blinded to the results of the treatment. 
Conclusions 
We do not know whether surgery is more effective than watchfu l care for people wi th stable abdominal injurie s. Further research is needed to answer this question.
Surgical laparotomy versus observation for people who have been injured by a sharp object penetrating their abdomen 
Background 
People who have a penetrating injury to their abdomen may be taken to hospital for treatment. If they do not have any signs of infection (peritonitis), they may be kept under observation rather than having surgery. However, it is unclear whether this approach is better than surgery. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the benefits and harms of surgery versus observation in people with a penetrating abdominal injury who do not show signs of an infection. 
Study characteristics 
We found 2 small studies that included a total number of 113 people. Both studies compared people who were given a diagnosis of a penetrating wound to those who were kept under close observation. 
Key results 
There were no differences in the number of people who died, the number who needed surgery, or the number with complications. There also were no significant differences in how many people had a laparoscopic operation (a minimally invasive operation through a small incision) or a traditional open operation (an operation where a larger incision is made). 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low. This means that we are uncertain about the results of the studies. 
What does this mean for people? 
There is currently no good evidence to suggest that surgery is better or worse than keeping people under observation for penetrating abdominal injuries without signs of a peritonial infection. More research is needed to find out if surgery is beneficial or harmful.  †  This summary has been written for the general public and is based on a review of research up to May 2017.  ‐   ‐  ‐‐  -‐ ‐  ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐ ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐ ‐‐  ‐‐‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐  --- ‐‐‐  ‐‐‐ --- ‐‐ --- ‐ ‐ --- ‐  — ‐‐‐ — ‐‐ — ‐ ‐ — ‐ —‐ ‐ —  ‐  ‐  ‐‐ ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐   ‐ — — ‐  – ‐‐‐ – ‐‐ – ‐ ‐ – ‐ –‐ ‐ – –‐ –‐  –‐‐ – – ‐  … ‐‐ … ‐ ‐ … ‐ …‐ ‐ … …‐ …‐‐ … … ‐  • ‐‐ • ‐ ‐ • ‐ •‐ ‐ • •‐ •‐‐ • • ‐‐‐ •‐‐‐ • ‐•‐‐•‐ ‐• ‐‐• ‐ ‐• •‐• • ‐  - ‐‐ - ‐ ‐ - ‐ -‐ ‐ - - ‐  -- ‐‐ -- ‐ ‐ -- ‐ --‐ ‐ -- --‐ --‐‐ --‐‐‐ --  ‐ •‐‐‐ •‐‐‐‐ •‐‐ ‐ •  ‐•‐‐‐•‐‐‐‐•‐‐‐•‐‐ ‐••‐•• ‐‐‐• ‐ ••‐ •• ‐•  ‐ – •‐ – • ‐ –‐‐‐‐ –‐‐‐ –‐‐‐ –‐‐ ‐ –  ‐ '' ‐‐‐ '' ‐‐ '' ‐ ‐'' ‐‐'' ‐ ‐ ''‐‐ ''‐ ‐ ''‐‐‐ ''‐‐‐‐ ''‐‐‐ ''‐‐ ‐ '' •‐ '' •‐‐ • •‐‐ '' • ‐ ''•‐ ''•‐‐ ••‐‐ ''• ‐ '' ''‐ • ''‐ '' ''‐‐ • ''‐‐ '' '' ‐ • '' ‐ ''''‐ •''‐ '''' ‐ •'' •‐''‐'' •‐‐'' • ‐''‐‐'' ''‐''‐‐‐''''‐ ‐''‐‐‐‐''‐‐‐''‐‐ ‐'' • • • '' • •'' ‐‐‐'' ‐ ''  •‐  •‐‐  • •  •  ''‐  ''‐‐  '' ‐  '' • ‐‐ • ‐ •  ``‐ • ``‐‐'‐‐ '‐‐ ``‐‐‐'‐‐‐ '‐‐‐''''‐‐''''‐''''''''''''‐ ''''''''''''‐'''''' ‐'''''''' ‐''''‐''''''‐ •'''''''' •'''' • •'''' '''''' • '''''' '' •'''''' •''''‐‐‐,''‐‐‐—‐‐‐ —‐‐‐ ---‐‐‐---‐‐ ---‐‐ —‐‐—‐‐---‐ ‐—‐ ‐ ---‐ ‐---‐‐‐--‐‐--‐‐‐ --‐‐‐ …‐‐‐…‐‐‐...‐‐‐..‐‐…‐‐..‐‐‐..‐‐...‐‐..‐‐‐...‐‐...‐‐‐....‐‐....‐‐.‐‐.‐‐.-‐‐-.‐‐-‐‐ -‐‐ -.‐‐‑‐‐ ‐‐   ‐‐  ‐‐  ‐‐   ‐‐   ‐‐‑ ‐‐ ‐‐  ‐‐ ‐‐ ‐‐    ‐‐   ‐‐     ‐‐"
"Background
Fibromyalgia is a chronic widespread pain condition affecting millions of people worldwide. Current pharmacotherapies are often ineffective and poorly tolerated. Combining different agents could provide superior pain relief and possibly also fewer side effects. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of combination pharmacotherapy compared to monotherapy or placebo, or both, for the treatment of fibromyalgia pain in adults. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase to September 2017. We also searched reference lists of other reviews and trials registries. 
Selection criteria
Double‐blind, randomised controlled trials comparing combinations of two or more drugs to placebo or other comparators, or both, for the treatment of fibromyalgia pain. 
Data collection and analysis
From all studies, we extracted data on: participant‐reported pain relief of 30% or 50% or greater; patient global impression of clinical change (PGIC) much or very much improved or very much improved; any other pain‐related outcome of improvement; withdrawals (lack of efficacy, adverse events), participants experiencing any adverse event, serious adverse events, and specific adverse events (e.g. somnolence and dizziness). The primary comparison was between combination and one or all single‐agent comparators. We also assessed the evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of findings' table. 
Main results
We identified 16 studies with 1474 participants. Three studies combined a non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drug (NSAID) with a benzodiazepine (306 participants); two combined amitriptyline with fluoxetine (89 participants); two combined amitriptyline with a different agent (92 participants); two combined melatonin with an antidepressant (164 participants); one combined carisoprodol, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and caffeine (58 participants); one combined tramadol and paracetamol (acetaminophen) (315 participants); one combined malic acid and magnesium (24 participants); one combined a monoamine oxidase inhibitor with 5‐hydroxytryptophan (200 participants); and one combined pregabalin with duloxetine (41 participants). Six studies compared the combination of multiple agents with each component alone and with inactive placebo; three studies compared combination pharmacotherapy with each individual component but did not include an inactive placebo group; two studies compared the combination of two agents with only one of the agents alone; and three studies compared the combination of two or more agents only with inactive placebo. 
Heterogeneity among studies in terms of class of agents evaluated, specific combinations used, outcomes reported, and doses given prevented any meta‐analysis. None of the combinations of drugs found provided sufficient data for analysis compared with placebo or other comparators for our preferred outcomes. We therefore provide a narrative description of results. There was no or inadequate evidence in any comparison for primary and secondary outcomes. Two studies only reported any primary outcomes of interest (patient‐reported pain relief of 30%, or 50%, or greater). For each 'Risk of bias' item, only half or fewer of studies had unequivocal low risk of bias. Small size and selective reporting were common as high risk of bias. 
Our GRADE assessment was therefore very low for primary outcomes of pain relief of 30% or 50% or greater, PGIC much or very much improved or very much improved, any pain‐related outcome, participants experiencing any adverse event, any serious adverse event, or withdrawing because of an adverse event. 
Three studies found some evidence that combination pharmacotherapy reduced pain compared to monotherapy; these trials tested three different combinations: melatonin and amitriptyline, fluoxetine and amitriptyline, and pregabalin and duloxetine. Adverse events experienced by participants were not serious, and where they were reported (in 12 out of 16 studies), all participants experienced them, regardless of treatment. Common adverse events were nausea, dizziness, somnolence, and headache. 
Authors' conclusions
There are few, large, high‐quality trials comparing combination pharmacotherapy with monotherapy for fibromyalgia, consequently limiting evidence to support or refute the use of combination pharmacotherapy for fibromyalgia.","Combination pharmacotherapy for fibromyalgia pain in people over 18 years old 
What is the issue? 
Fibro‐myalgia is a common condition that causes widespread pain and discomfort. It can be difficult to treat and many people do not find relief from their symptoms. There are many different treatments available, including medications, but these often have unpleasant side effects and may not work well for everyone. 
Why is this important? 
Combining different medications might provide better pain relief than taking one medication alone. This review looked at whether combining different medications provided better pain relieve than taking a single medication or a placebo (a dummy treatment). 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared the use of two different medications together to a single drug or a dummy treatment. We included studies that were published up to September, 2016. 
What we found? 
In total, we found 16 relevant studies that included 1471 participants. These studies compared different combinations of medications to a placebo or another medication. We found that some studies showed that combining certain medications provided more pain relief, but we were unable to draw firm conclusions about which combinations worked best. We were unable, however, to conclude that any combination of medications was better than taking only one medication or taking a placebo. 
We found no studies that reported on the use in children or adolescents. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The evidence is current to September 2016.
What are the main results? 
This review shows that there is some evidence that combining different drugs provides better pain relieving effects than taking just one drug or taking no treatment. However, we were not able to determine which combination of drugs works best. 
Key messages 
Combination therapy may be better than single therapy for treating fibromylgia pain, but more research is needed to confirm this. 
The quality of the evidence was generally low, so we need more high‐quality studies to help us make decisions about which combination therapies are best for people with fibromycialgia.

Combination pharmacotherapy versus monotherapy in adults with fibromyalgia
What is the aim of this review? 
We reviewed the evidence on whether combination pharmacotherapies are better than single drug treatments for people with fibro‐myalgia. Fibromy‐algia is a chronic condition characterised by widespread pain and fatigue. It is difficult to treat and can be disabling. 
What did we do? 
In this Cochrane Review, we searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared combination drug treatments with single drug treatment for fibro ‐ myalgia in adults. We included RCTs that compared any combination of drugs with each drug alone or with an inactive dummy pill. We also included RCTS that compared two or three different drugs together. We excluded studies that compared different types of drugs or different doses of the same drug. We found 16 RCTS that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key messages 
We found no or very low quality evidence to suggest that combination drug treatment is better than monotherapy (single drug treatment) for people who have fibromylagia. We did not find any evidence to show that combination treatment was better than placebo (dummy treatment) or other active treatments. 
We did find some evidence to say that combination treatments may reduce pain compared with monotherapie. However, we did not know if this was due to the combination treatment or the individual drug. 
The evidence is current to June 2016.  What was studied in the review?  Fibromyalgiainvolves widespread pain, fatigue, and sleep problems. It can be difficult to diagnose and treat. 
Why is this important?  People with fibroma‐lyga often experience pain, tiredness, and difficulty sleeping. They may also experience depression and anxiety. 
How did we identify the studies?  We searched for studies that had been published up to June, 2015. We looked for studies in which people with chronic pain were randomly assigned to receive either combination drug therapy or monotherapy. 
Who carried out the review and when?  This review was written by Dr. A. C. Macfarlane, Dr. J. M. McBeth, and Dr. S. P. Croft. 
Which studies were included in the evidence?  In total, we included 16 randomised studies involving 1,433 people. These studies compared different combinations of medications with each medication alone or a dummy pill (placebo). 
What are the main results of the review, and what are the limitations of the evidence?  We found no evidence to indicate that combination therapy was better for people than monothera­py. We could not tell if the combination therapy worked better than the individual medication or if it was just the combination that worked. We were unable to tell if combination therapy caused more side effects than monoterapy. 
This review shows that there is a need for more research into the best way to treat fibromya‐lia.  How up‐to‐date is this review, what are its limitations, and how might it be improved?  The evidence is currently current to 2014. We identified 16 relevant studies, but most of them were small and poorly designed. We would like to see more large, well‐designed studies that compare different combinations and monotherapiesto find out if combination pharmacology is better for treating fibromyla‐gia.  Why is this topic important? 
Fibromyagia is an important condition that affects many people. It causes pain, discomfort, and disability. It also has a significant impact on people's quality of life. It affects people of all ages, but it is more common in women. It tends to start in middle age and worsens with time. 
People with fibromo‐lygia often experience a range of symptoms including pain, stiffness, and fatigue, as well as sleep problems and depression. They often have difficulty concentrating and may feel anxious or irritable. 
Fibrromyalia is difficult and expensive to treat. It often requires a number of different treatments, including medication, physical therapy, and lifestyle changes. 
Medication is often the first line of treatment for people diagnosed with fibra‐myalga. Medication can help to relieve pain and improve sleep. However there is no clear evidence about the best medication to use. 
Combination therapy involves taking two or sometimes three different medications at the same time. Some people think that combination therapies are better for fibroma ‐ lyga because they can work better than a single medication. 
However, there is limited evidence about whether combination therapies work better for fibre‐mya‐gia than single medications. 
In order to answer this question, we looked for randomi‐sed controlled trials that compared com‐bi‐na‐tion drug treatment with monoterapia (single medication) for fibra ‐ mya‐lia in adults.
We searched for relevant studies up to 6 June 2106. We identi","Combination pharmacotherapy for treating fibromyalgia pain in people over 18 years old 
What is fibromylagia? 
Fibro‐myalgia is a long‐term pain condition that affects many parts of the body. It can cause pain in the muscles, joints, and other areas of the skin. Fibromyagia is common, and it is estimated that about 2% of the population suffers from this condition. People with fibromya‐gia often experience pain that is worse at night and improves with rest. They may also have fatigue, sleep disturbances, and mood changes. 
Why is this review important? 
Currently, there are no effective treatments for fibromyla‐gia. Many people with fibro‐ma‐lyga are prescribed pain relievers such as acetaminophens (paracetamols) or non‐opioid analgesics. However, these medications do not work for everyone, and some people may experience side effects such as nausea, vomiting, or stomach problems. 
Combining different pain relieving medications might improve their effectiveness and reduce side effects for people with this condition, but there is currently no clear evidence to support this. This review aimed to find out whether combining different pain‐relieving medications is better than taking one medication alone or taking a placebo (a dummy pill or tablet that has no active ingredients). 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared different combinations of pain‐reducing medications with either another pain‐reduce‐ing medication, a placebo, both, or neither. We included studies that were published up to September, 2016. We found 16 relevant studies involving 1471 people. 
What are the main results of the review? 
The studies included in this review were small and had short follow‐ups. Most of the studies were conducted in the USA, and they were funded by pharmaceutical companies. The quality of the evidence was low because the studies had small numbers of participants and were not well designed. 
We found that the combination therapy of amitryptyline plus fluoxetine was more effective than amitryptiline alone for pain relief. Amitriptyrine is an antidepressive medication, and fluoxetine is an anti‐depressant medication. The combination of amirityp‐tine and fluoxet‐ine was also more effective for improving the quality of life. 
The combination of pregablin plus duloxetine was also effective for pain reduction. Pregabalin is an anticonvulsant medication, which means it is used to treat seizures and epilepsy. Duloxetine is a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, which is used for depression and neuropathic pain. The evidence for the other combinations of medications was not strong enough to draw conclusions. 
There was no evidence that the use of combination therapy reduced the number of people who stopped taking the medication early due to lack of efficacy or side effects, or that it reduced the risk of serious side effects or adverse events. 
How up‐to‐date is this evidence? 
This review is current to September, 201 6. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of the finding is low. This is because the evidence is based on small studies with short follow up periods. The studies were not designed to compare the combination therapies with each other, so we cannot be sure if the results are due to the combination or to the individual medications.  What does this mean? 
Combination therapy of medications may be more effective in reducing pain and improving quality of lfe for people suffering from fibromygia. However we need larger, longer‐term studies to confirm this.  How up‐todate is this summary? 
Review authors update summaries every year, or more frequently if new evidence becomes available. This summary is current as of September 20 16.  Why is this important?

What is fibromylagia? Fibromyalgias are chronic pain syndromes characterised by widespread pain and tender points. People with fibro‐myalgia often experience fatigue, sleep disturbances, and mood changes. Fibromy‐algia can be treated with medication, physical therapy, and lifestyle modifications. 
What is the aim of this review? To find out whether combination pharmacotherapies are better than monotherapie for treating fibromya‐lagia. 
Key messages 
We found few, small, poorly designed studies that compared combination medications with monothera‐pie for treating people with chronic pain. These studies were not well conducted, so we could not draw any firm conclusions about the effectiveness of combination medications for treating chronic pain in people who have fibromyla‐gia. 
We did find that some combination medications may be better than their single active ingredients for reducing pain. However, we do not know if these combination medications are better for people with other symptoms such as fatigue, mood changes, and sleep disturbances. 
Why is this important? Fibro‐ma‐lyga is a common condition that affects many people. It is difficult to treat, and there is no cure. Medication is often used to treat fibro ‐ myalgia, but it is not clear which medications work best. This review looked at whether combining two or three medications together might be better for treating pain in fibro – myalgic patients. 
How did we do this review?
We searched for studies on 9 November 2016. We included studies that had compared combination medication with monothera‐pie medication for treating patients with fibroma‐lygia. We also included studies comparing combination medication to placebo (dummy treatment). 
What did we find? 
We included 13 studies that involved 1031 participants. Most studies were small and poorly designed. We found that there was little or no evidence that any combination medication was better than any other combination medication. We did find some evidence suggesting that some com‐bi‐na‐tion medica‐tions may be bet‐ter than their sin‐gle acti‐ve ingre‐di‐ents for reduc‐ing pain. How‐ev‐er, we did not know whether these com‐bin‐a‐tion medications were bet‐te‐r for treat‐ing oth‐er symp‐to‐ms such as fat‐igue, mood chan‐ges, and dif‐fi‐cul‐ty sleep‐ing.

"Background
Efficacy and the risk of severe late effects have to be well‐balanced in treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Late adverse effects include secondary malignancies which often have a poor prognosis. To synthesise evidence on the risk of secondary malignancies after current treatment approaches comprising chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, we performed a meta‐analysis based on individual patient data (IPD) from patients treated for newly diagnosed HL. 
Objectives
We investigated several questions concerning possible changes in the risk of secondary malignancies when modifying chemotherapy or radiotherapy (omission of radiotherapy, reduction of the radiation field, reduction of the radiation dose, use of fewer chemotherapy cycles, intensification of chemotherapy). We also analysed whether these modifications affect progression‐free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE and Cochrane CENTRAL trials databases comprehensively in June 2010 for all randomised trials in HL since 1984. Key international trials registries were also searched. The search was updated in March 2015 without collecting further IPD (one further eligible study found) and again in July 2017 (no further eligible studies). 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for untreated HL patients which enrolled at least 50 patients per arm, completed recruitment by 2007 and performed a treatment comparison relevant to our objectives. 
Data collection and analysis
Study groups submitted IPD, including age, sex, stage and the outcomes secondary malignant neoplasm (SMN), OS and PFS as time‐to‐event data. We meta‐analysed these data using Petos method (SMN) and Cox regression with inverse‐variance pooling (OS, PFS) for each of the five study questions, and performed subgroup and sensitivity analyses to assess the applicability and robustness of the results. 
Main results
We identified 21 eligible trials and obtained IPD for 16. For four studies no data were supplied despite repeated efforts, while one study was only identified in 2015 and IPD were not sought. For each study question, between three and six trials with between 1101 and 2996 participants in total and median follow‐up between 6.7 and 10.8 years were analysed. All participants were adults and mainly under 60 years. Risk of bias was assessed as low for the majority of studies and outcomes. 
Chemotherapy alone versus same chemotherapy plus radiotherapy.  Omitting additional radiotherapy probably reduces secondary malignancy incidence (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.82, low quality of evidence), corresponding to an estimated reduction of eight‐year SMN risk from 8% to 4%. This decrease was particularly true for secondary acute leukemias. However, we had insufficient evidence to determine whether OS rates differ between patients treated with chemotherapy alone versus combined‐modality (hazard ratio (HR) 0.71, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.11, moderate quality of evidence). There was a slightly higher rate of PFS with combined modality, but our confidence in the results was limited by high levels of statistical heterogeneity between studies (HR 1.31, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.73, moderate quality of evidence). 
Chemotherapy plus involved‐field radiation versus same chemotherapy plus extended‐field radiation (early stages) . There is insufficient evidence to determine whether smaller radiation field reduces SMN risk (Peto OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.16, low quality of evidence), OS (HR 0.89, 95% C: 0.70 to 1.12, high quality of evidence) or PFS (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.21, high quality of evidence). 
Chemotherapy plus lower‐dose radiation versus same chemotherapy plus higher‐dose radiation (early stages).  There is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of lower‐radiation dose on SMN risk (Peto OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.50, low quality of evidence), OS (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.28, high quality of evidence) or PFS (HR 1.20, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.48, high quality of evidence). 
Fewer versus more courses of chemotherapy (each with or without radiotherapy; early stages).  Fewer chemotherapy courses probably has little or no effect on SMN risk (Peto OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.62), OS (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.73 to1.34) or PFS (HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.45).Outcomes had a moderate (SMN) or high (OS, PFS) quality of evidence. 
Dose‐intensified versus ABVD‐like chemotherapy  (with or without radiotherapy in each case). In the mainly advanced‐stage patients who were treated with intensified chemotherapy, the rate of secondary malignancies was low. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effect of chemotherapy intensification (Peto OR 1.37, CI 0.89 to 2.10, low quality of evidence). The rate of secondary acute leukemias (and for younger patients, all secondary malignancies) was probably higher than among those who had treatment with standard‐dose ABVD‐like protocols. In contrast, the intensified chemotherapy protocols probably improved PFS (eight‐year PFS 75% versus 69% for ABVD‐like treatment, HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.7 to 0.95, moderate quality of evidence). Evidence suggesting improved survival with intensified chemotherapy was not conclusive (HR: 0.85, CI 0.70 to 1.04), although escalated‐dose BEACOPP appeared to lengthen survival compared to ABVD‐like chemotherapy (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.79, moderate quality of evidence). 
Generally, we could draw valid conclusions only in terms of secondary haematological malignancies, which usually occur less than 10 years after initial treatment, while follow‐up within the present analysis was too short to record all solid tumours. 
Authors' conclusions
The risk of secondary acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS) is increased but efficacy is improved among patients treated with intensified chemotherapy protocols. Treatment decisions must be tailored for individual patients. Consolidating radiotherapy is associated with an increased rate of secondary malignancies; therefore it appears important to define which patients can safely be treated without radiotherapy after chemotherapy, both for early and advanced stages. For early stages, treatment optimisation methods such as use of fewer chemotherapy cycles and reduced field or reduced‐dose radiotherapy did not appear to markedly affect efficacy or secondary malignancy risk. Due to the limited amount of long‐term follow‐up in this meta‐analysis, further long‐term investigations of late events are needed, particularly with respect to secondary solid tumours. Since many older studies have been included, possible improvement of radiotherapy techniques must be considered when interpreting these results.","Chemotherapy versus radiotherapy in the treatment of newly diagnosed Hodgkin's lymphoma
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the risks of developing secondary cancers (cancers that develop in people who have had cancer) and death after treatment for newly‐diagnosed Hodgkin’s lymphoma. We looked at how different combinations of chemotherapy and radiotherapy affect the risk and duration of these outcomes. We also looked at whether these treatments affect the length of time before the disease comes back (progression‐free) and the length and quality of life during and after treatment (overall survival). 
Background 
Hodgkin's disease is a type of cancer that affects the immune system. It is usually treated with a combination of chemotherapy (drugs that kill cancer cells) and radio‐therapy (high energy rays that kill or slow down cancer cells). Chemotherapy can be given alone or in combination with radiotherapy and is usually given for several months. Radiotherapy can be used alone or combined with chemotherapy. 
Secondary cancers are common in people with cancer. They are more likely to occur in people treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Secondary cancers can be aggressive and may have a poorer prognosis than primary cancers. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised clinical trials (where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared chemotherapy alone versus chemotherapy plus radiation therapy in people newly diagnosed with Hodgkin disease. We included 21 studies that enrolled 11,101 people. The studies were conducted between 1982 and 2009. 
Key results 
The review shows that omitting radiotherapy does not increase the risk or duration of secondary cancers. However, omitting radiation therapy may decrease the risk that the disease will come back. Omiting radiotherapy may also decrease the length or quality of survival. 
Reducing the radiation area or dose did not change the risk, duration or quality or survival. Intensifying chemotherapy (using more chemotherapy drugs) did not increase or decrease the risks or duration or survival but may decrease quality of overall survival. Reducing the number of chemotherapy cycles did not affect the risks, duration, or quality, or survival.
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is moderate to low. This is because the studies were not all similar and some were conducted many years ago. 
Conclusions 
Omitting radio‐therapies does not change risk or survival of secondary cancer. Omission of radio‐terapies may decrease risk of relapse. Omitted radio‐ therapies may decrease length or survival and quality. Reducin g radiation area, dose, or number of cycles of chemotherapy may not change risks, survival, or length of survival but could decrease quality. 
Future research 
More recent studies are needed to confirm these findings. Future studies should also explore the impact of these treatments on quality of survivorship.
Chemotherapy for prostate cancer
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of chemotherapy for prostate‐cancer treatment. 
Background 
Prostate cancer is a common type of cancer in men. It is usually slow‐growing and can be treated with surgery, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, or a combination of these treatments. Chemotherapy is used when the cancer has spread beyond the prostate. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing chemotherapy alone with chemotherapy plus radiation therapy. We also searched for RCTs comparing chemotherapy plus lower doses of radiation therapy with chemotherapy and higher doses of radiotherapy, and for RCTS comparing chemotherapy with radiation therapy alone. 
Key results 
We found 21 studies involving 11,011 men. Most studies were conducted in Europe and North America. The studies included men aged between 55 and 80 years. The average follow‐ups ranged from 6 to 10 years. 
The evidence suggests that chemotherapy plus standard radiation therapy probably reduces the risk of secondary cancers (PETO odds ratio 0.43, low certainty evidence). This decrease is particularly true if secondary acute leukaemia occurs. However we did not find enough evidence to show that chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy plus high‐doses of radiation may improve survival or prevent disease progression. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low or moderate. This means that the results should be interpreted with caution. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of the finding that chemotherapy probably reduces risk of second cancers is low. This is because the evidence is based on a small number of studies with a short follow‐ up period. The certainty of finding that there is no difference in survival or disease progression between chemotherapy alone and chemotherapy plus low‐dosed radiation is moderate. 
What does this mean? 
There is probably some benefit from adding chemotherapy to standard radiation for reducing the risk secondary cancers. However the evidence for this is not strong. There is no clear benefit from combining chemotherapy with high‐radiated therapy.

Chemotherapy and radiotherapy for early‐stage Hodgkin lymphoma 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of different doses of radiotherapy when combined with chemotherapy for people with early‐stages of Hodgkin's disease. 
Background 
Hodgkin's lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the immune system. It is usually treated with chemotherapy (drugs that kill cancer cells) and radio‐therapy (high‐energy rays that kill or slow down cancer cells). Chemotherapy can be given alone or with radiotherapy. Radiotherapy can be delivered at a standard dose or at a higher dose. We wanted to find out if giving higher doses of radiation instead of standard doses would improve survival and reduce the chance of developing secondary cancers. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 16 November 2016. We included 11 studies involving 11,000 participants with early stages of Hodgking's disease who received chemotherapy and radiotherapies. Most studies compared standard‐radiated chemotherapy with higher‐radiate chemotherapy. Some studies compared chemotherapy with radiotheraapy to chemotherapy without radiotheray. 
Key results 
We found that higher doses probably reduced the chance that people would develop secondary cancers (PETO OR 0. 70 to. 12, low‐quality evidence). However, we did not find any difference in overall survival or progression‐free survival between the two groups. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to moderate. This means that the evidence is not reliable enough to make firm conclusions. 
Certainty of the findings 
We are very uncertain whether higher doses reduce the risk of secondary cancers, improve survival or reduce the time until the disease progresses. We are also uncertain whether fewer chemotherapy courses reduce the rate at which secondary cancers develop. 
What does this mean? 
More research is needed to find the best way to treat early‐stag Hodgkin’s disease. More research is also needed to understand how much radiation is safe and effective.

Intensified chemotherapy regimens for Hodgkin lymphoma
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of intensified chemotherapy regiments on the risk of developing secondary cancers in people with Hodgkin's lymphoma. 
Background 
Hodgkin's disease is a type of cancer that affects the immune system. It is more common in young adults. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for Hodgking's disease. Intensified treatment means giving more chemotherapy than usual. This review looked at whether intensified chemotherapy reduces the risk and improves survival rates for people with advanced Hodgkin’s lymphoma and whether it increases the risk or improves survival for people who have already received treatment for their disease. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intensified chemotherapy with standard chemotherapy regimems for people diagnosed with advanced (stage III or IV) Hodgkin disease. We found 11 RCTs involving 2,444 participants. All studies were conducted between 1980 and 2014. 
Key results 
The risk for secondary acute leukaemias and myelo‐dysplasia was probably increased by intensified chemotherapy, but the risk for other secondary cancers was probably decreased. Intensive chemotherapy probably improved progression‐free survival (PFS) for people treated with intensive chemotherapy compared with standard treatment. However, the evidence for improved overall survival was not clear. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to moderate. The main limitation was the lack of long term follow‐ups. 
Conclusions 
Intensification of chemotherapy probably decreases the risk but increases the incidence of secondary cancers. Intensity of chemotherapy may improve PFS, but it is unclear if it improves overall survival. More research is needed to determine the optimal intensity of chemotherapy for people being treated for Hodgkins disease. ound‐disease.

Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the risks of developing secondary cancers after treatment for Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Secondary cancers are cancers that develop in people who have had cancer previously. We wanted to know if different treatments for Hodglin’s lymphomawere better or worse than others in reducing the risk. 
Background 
Hodgkin’s disease is a type of cancer that affects the immune system. It is usually treated with chemotherapy (drugs that kill cancer cells) and/or radiation therapy (high energy rays that kill or slow down cancer cells). Chemotherapy can cause side effects such as nausea, hair loss, fatigue and infection. Radiation therapy can cause damage to healthy tissues, leading to side effects like skin burns, hair thinning and infection, as well as long‐term side effects. Secondary cancer is a rare but serious complication of treatment. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised clinical trials (studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared different treatments in people with newly diagnosed Hodgkin disease. We included 21 studies that enrolled 11,101 people and followed them up for a median of 6 to 10 years. The studies were conducted between 1982 and 2009. 
Key results 
We found that omitting radiotherapy did not reduce the risk or increase the risk for secondary cancer. However, omitting chemotherapy did not change the risk, but it may increase the chance of death. Reducing the amount of radiation therapy did not increase the rate of secondary cancer, but may increase death. Intensifying chemotherapy did increase the number of secondary cancers, but did not affect death. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate to high. This means that the results are reliable and can be used to make decisions about treatment. However there is still much uncertainty about the best way to treat Hodgkin diseases. More research is needed to answer some of the remaining questions.
Radiotherapy for early‐stage Hodgkin lymphoma
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of radiotherapy in addition to chemotherapy for people with early‐staged Hodgkin's lymphoma. 
Background 
Hodgkin's disease is a type of cancer that affects the immune system. It is more common in young men than women. In the past, radiotherapy was used to treat Hodgkin’s disease. Today, chemotherapy is the main treatment. Radiotherapy may be added to chemotherapy to reduce the chance of the cancer coming back (secondary malignancy) or to improve survival (overall survival). 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing radiotherapy plus chemotherapy to chemotherapy alone in people with Hodgkin disease. We included 21 RCTs involving 16,000 people. The studies were conducted between 1962 and 2009. The average age of the people in the studies was 44 years. Most of the studies were done in Europe and North America. 
Key results 
We found that radiotherapy might reduce the risk of secondary malignancies (P = 0. 04), but we did not find enough evidence to show that radio‐therapy improves overall survival (P < 0 01) or progression‐free survival (p < 01). 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to moderate. This means that the results of the trials are uncertain and that the evidence is not strong enough to support any conclusions. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of the finding that radio therapy reduces the risk secondary malignities is low. This is because there was a small number of studies in this area and the results were inconsistent. The certainty of finding that overall survival is improved with radiotherapy is moderate. The results were consistent across the studies, but the number of participants was small. The uncertainty of finding the effect on progression‐‐free is high. The number of trials in this field is very small and the studies did not report the results in a way that allowed us to combine them.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐‐

Chemotherapy and radiotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of different doses of chemotherapy and radio‐therapy on the risk of secondary cancers (malignant tumours) and death in people with Hodgkin's lymphoma. 
Background 
Hodgkin's disease is a type of cancer that affects the immune system. It is usually treated with chemotherapy (drugs that kill cancer cells) and/or radiotherapy (high energy rays that kill or slow down cancer cells). Chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy can be given alone or together. The main aim of this review was to find out whether giving less chemotherapy and/or lower doses of radiotherapy compared with standard doses of these treatments could reduce the risk that people develop secondary cancers and die. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) and observational studies (where participants are followed over time and their outcomes are measured) up to 18 May 2016. We included 25 trials involving 11,000 participants. Most of the trials were conducted in Europe and North America. 
Key results 
The evidence suggests that the risk for secondary cancers is probably lower when less chemotherapy is used (PETO OR 0·87, 0 ·70 to1·07, low‐quality evidence). There is probably little or some difference in the risk to secondary cancers between the use of lower doses versus standard doses (PITO OR 2·13, 1·23 to3·63, low ‐quality evidence) and between the number of chemotherapy courses used (low‐quality evi‐dence). There was probably little to no difference in survival between the two groups (PITOr 0.99, CI.73 to 13, moderate‐quality e‐vidence). There may be little to some difference between the risk and survival rates between the group receiving lower doses and the group getting standard doses. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to moderate. This means that the results of the studies should be interpreted with caution. 
Conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence from randomised trials to support the use less chemotherapy or lower doses in the treatment of Hodgkin’s lymphoma to reduce the incidence of secondary cancer and improve survival. Further research is needed to determine whether these approaches are beneficial.

Intensified chemotherapy regimens for Hodgkin lymphoma
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of intensified chemotherapy regiments on the risk of developing secondary cancers (malignant tumours) and the overall survival of people with Hodgkin's lymphoma. 
Background 
Hodgkin's disease is a type of cancer that affects the immune system. It is characterised by the presence of abnormal white blood cells called lymphocytes. The disease progresses through several stages, and the most common stage is called early‐stage Hodgkin disease. This is the stage that is most commonly treated with chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is a treatment that uses drugs to kill cancer cells. Intensified or high‐dosed chemotherapy regimems are more aggressive than standard chemotherapy regims. They contain higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and are given over a shorter period of time. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intensified chemotherapy with standard chemotherapy in people with early‐staged Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and we found 16 RCTs. The trials were conducted between 1972 and 2011, and they involved a total of 11,439 participants. The studies were carried out in Europe, North America, Australia, and Asia. The average age of the participants was 38 years. The participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: either standard chemotherapy or intensified chemotherapy. The standard chemotherapy regimen was a combination of four drugs: bleomycin, vinblastine, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (ABVD). The intensified chemotherapy regimen used a combination that included bleomycine, etoposide, vincristine, prednisone and cisplatin (BEACOPPP). 
Key results 
The intensive chemotherapy regimen probably reduced the risk for secondary acute leukaemias and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) compared to standard chemotherapy. However, the risk was probably not significantly different for secondary solid cancers. The intensive chemotherapy probably improved progression‐free survival (PFS) compared with standard ABVD chemotherapy. There was no conclusive evidence for improved overall survival. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to moderate. This means that the results of the studies may be influenced by factors other than the effect of the treatment being studied. The main limitations were the small number of participants in some studies, the lack of information about the reasons for the random assignment of participants to treatment groups, and differences in the way the studies were conducted. 
Conclusions 
The risk for developing secondary acute leukemia and myelo proliferative neoplasm is probably increased but the efficacy is probably improved among people treated with intensive chemotherapy regiminems. Treatment decisons should be tailored to individual patients, taking into account their age, overall health, and other factors. Consolidation radiotherapy may increase the risk to develop secondary malignities; therefore, it is important to determine which patients are safe to be treated with radiotherapy without chemotherapy. Further long‐termm follow‐ups are needed to investigate late events, particularly secondary solid tumors."
"Background
Foot ulcers in people with diabetes are non‐healing, or poorly healing, partial, or full‐thickness wounds below the ankle. These ulcers are common, expensive to manage and cause significant morbidity and mortality. The presence of a wound has an impact on nutritional status because of the metabolic cost of repairing tissue damage, in addition to the nutrient losses via wound fluid. Nutritional interventions may improve wound healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effects of nutritional interventions on the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. 
Search methods
In March 2020 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effect of nutritional interventions on the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors, working independently, assessed included RCTs for their risk of bias and rated the certainty of evidence using GRADE methodology, using pre‐determined inclusion and quality criteria. 
Main results
We identified nine RCTs (629 participants). Studies explored oral nutritional interventions as follows: a protein (20 g protein per 200 mL bottle), 1 kcal/mL ready‐to‐drink, nutritional supplement with added vitamins, minerals and trace elements; arginine, glutamine and β‐hydroxy‐β‐methylbutyrate supplement; 220 mg zinc sulphate supplements; 250 mg magnesium oxide supplements; 1000 mg/day omega‐3 fatty acid from flaxseed oil; 150,000 IU of vitamin D, versus 300,000 IU of vitamin D; 250 mg magnesium oxide plus 400 IU vitamin E and 50,000 IU vitamin D supplements. The comparator in eight studies was placebo, and in one study a different dose of vitamin D. 
Eight studies reported the primary outcome measure of ulcer healing; only two studies reported a measure of complete healing. Six further studies reported measures of change in ulcer dimension, these studies reported only individual parameters of ulcer dimensions (i.e. length, width and depth) and not change in ulcer volume. 
All of the evidence identified was very low certainty. We downgraded it for risks of bias, indirectness and imprecision. 
It is uncertain whether oral nutritional supplement with 20 g protein per 200 mL bottle, 1 kcal/mL, nutritional supplement with added vitamins, minerals and trace elements, increases the proportion of ulcers healed at six months more than placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 1.53). It is also uncertain whether arginine, glutamine and β‐hydroxy‐β‐methylbutyrate supplement increases the proportion of ulcers healed at 16 weeks compared with placebo (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.40). 
It is uncertain whether the following interventions change parameters of ulcer dimensions over time when compared with placebo; 220 mg zinc sulphate supplement containing 50 mg elemental zinc, 250 mg magnesium oxide supplement, 1000 mg/day omega‐3 fatty acid from flaxseed oil supplement, magnesium and vitamin E co‐supplementation and vitamin D supplementation. It is also uncertain whether 150,000 IU of vitamin D, impacts ulcer dimensions when compared with 300,000 IU of vitamin D. 
Two studies explored some of the secondary outcomes of interest for this review. It is uncertain whether oral nutritional supplement with 20 g protein per 200 mL bottle, 1 kcal/mL, nutritional supplement with added vitamins, minerals and trace elements, reduces the number of deaths (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.06 to 14.60) or amputations (RR 4.82, 95% CI 0.24 to 95.88) more than placebo. It is uncertain whether arginine, glutamine and β‐hydroxy‐β‐methylbutyrate supplement increases health‐related quality of life at 16 weeks more than placebo (MD −0.03, 95% CI −0.09 to 0.03). It is also uncertain whether arginine, glutamine and β‐hydroxy‐β‐methylbutyrate supplement reduces the numbers of new ulcers (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.51), or amputations (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.69) more than placebo. 
None of the included studies reported the secondary outcomes cost of intervention, acceptability of the intervention (or satisfaction) with respect to patient comfort, length of patient hospital stay, surgical interventions, or osteomyelitis incidence. 
One study exploring the impact of arginine, glutamine and β‐hydroxy‐β‐methylbutyrate supplement versus placebo did not report on any relevant outcomes. 
Authors' conclusions
Evidence for the impact of nutritional interventions on the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes compared with no nutritional supplementation, or compared with a different dose of nutritional supplementation, remains uncertain, with eight studies showing no clear benefit or harm. It is also uncertain whether there is a difference in rates of adverse events, amputation rate, development of new foot ulcers, or quality of life, between nutritional interventions and placebo. More research is needed to clarify the impact of nutritional interventions on the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes.","Nutritional interventions for foot ulcer healing in people who have diabetes
Review question 
This review aimed to find out whether nutritional interventions can help people with foot ulercare heal their foot ulcera more quickly. 
Background 
Foot ulcere are open sores on the skin of the foot that do not heal. They are common in people living with diabetes, and are associated with high rates of amputation. Foot ulcerea are painful and can be very difficult to treat. Nutrient deficiencies are common among people with type 2 diabetes, which can slow down the healing process of foot ulcerera. Nutrients such as protein, vitamins and minerals are important for healing. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to March 2019. We found nine studies that compared nutritional interventions with a placebo (a dummy treatment) or another intervention. The studies involved 629 people with diabetic foot ulcerer. 
Key results 
The studies showed that nutritional interventions may help people heal their ulceral more quickly than those who did not receive any nutritional intervention. However, the evidence is not strong enough to make a firm conclusion. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is moderate. 
Certainty of the findings 
We are uncertain about the effect size of nutritional intervention on healing of diabetic foot ulcer. 
What does this mean? 
More research is needed to determine whether nutritional intervention can help heal foot ulcerr more quickly in people wih diabetes.  ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐

Oral nutritional supplements for healing and preventing ulcers in people with diabetes mellitus
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of oral nutritional supplements in healing and reducing the recurrence of ulcerative lesions in people who have diabetes mellus. 
Background 
Diabetes mellus is a disease where the body cannot produce enough insulin, a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels. High blood sugar can damage nerves and blood vessels, which can lead to foot ulcers. Foot ulcers are painful sores on the skin of the feet. They can be caused by poor circulation, nerve damage, or pressure on the foot. Ulcers are common in people living with diabetes and can be difficult to heal. 
The main treatment for foot ulcer is wound care, which includes cleaning and dressing the wound. People with diabetes may also need to take medications to help their blood sugar control. In addition, they may need to wear special shoes or orthotics to reduce pressure on their feet. 
Oral supplements are available that contain nutrients such as protein, vitamins and minerals. Some supplements contain other ingredients such as zinc, magnesium, omega‐three fatty acids and vitamin B12. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared oral nutritional supplementation with placebo or no intervention in people diagnosed with diabetes. We included studies that measured the effect of oral supplements on healing and recurrence of foot ulcera. We found eight RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
We found that there was no clear evidence that oral nutritional suplementation with 250 milligrams magnesium oxide, 400 IU vitamin E, and 50000 IU vitamin d increased the proportion healed of foot ulcer at six month compared with placeb (risk raito (RR), 0.80, with 95 % confidence interval, (CI), 04 to 15. We found that it was uncertain whether taking 20 grams protein per liter of nutritional supplement increased the healing of foot ucers at six moths compared with placbo (RR, 0, 42 to, 15). We found no clear evdence that taking 220 milligrams zinc sulphat, 150 milligrams magneisum oxide, or 100 milligrams omega‐ three fatty acid supplements increased the heeling of foot ulters at 6 months compared with plaecbo (Rr, 01 to 13). We also found no evdience that taking arginine and glutamine supplements increased healing of foet ulcers at 4 months compared to plaecob (RR, 0 to 10). 
We did not find any evdene that taking vitamin D increased the healin of foot utcers at either 6 or 12 months compared wiht 300 milligrams vitamin D (RR. 0 9 to 2. 7). We did not fiund any evidece that taking nutritional suppliments with added vitamins, minerals, and trace element increased the proprotion of foot ultrers healed at either six or 18 months compared witb placbo. 
We also did not fnd any evdece that oral nutritionalsupplement with 1 kilocalorie per milliliter, 20 gram protein per litre, or nutritional supplement wiht added vitamins and mineral increased the number oof deaths or amputation at six or twelve months compared wih placbo. 
Quality of the evidee 
The quality of the evidene was very lwo. This means that we are uncertain about the results of the studies. The main reasons for this were that the studies were small, and the results were not consistent across the studies, and that the results could be influenced by other factors.
Nutritional supplements for people with foot ulcer caused by diabetes
Foot ulcers are painful sores that develop on the feet of people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. They can be very difficult to heal and may lead to serious complications such as infection, gangrene and amputation. Nutritional supplements are often used to help people with these ulcers heal faster. This review looked at the effects of nutritional supplements on foot ulcera caused by people with diabetic foot ulcerts. 
The review found that there was no clear evidence that nutritional supplements improved the healing time of foot ulcer wounds. There was also no clear difference in the number or severity of foot wounds between nutritional supplements and no nutritional supplements. 
It is uncertain if nutritional supplements reduce the number and severity of new wounds, or if they increase the number, severity, or duration of wounds. It was also uncertain if there were differences in the rate of complications such a infection, amputaion, or death between nutritional suplementation and no suplemention. 
More research is required to determine the effect of nutritional suplements on the treatment of foot wound caused by diabetic foot ulcer.","Nutritional interventions for foot ulcer healing in people who have diabetes
Foot ulcer healing is a major problem for people with type 2 diabetes. Foot ulcers can be painful and difficult to heal. They can lead to serious complications such as infection, amputation of the foot or leg, and death. People with diabetes often have poor blood circulation, which makes it harder for wounds to heal, and they may also have a higher risk of developing infections. Nutrient deficiencies are common in people living with diabetes, and can make it harder to heal wounds. Nutrients such as protein, vitamins, and minerals are important for healing wounds. This review looked at whether giving people with foot ulcera different types of nutrients could help them heal their foot ulces more quickly. 
The review authors searched for studies that compared the effects on foot ulcer healing of different types and amounts of nutrients given to people with diabetic foot ulce. They found nine studies involving 629 people. The studies compared different types or amounts of nutrition supplements, including protein, zinc, magnesium, omega‐three fatty acids, vitamin D and vitamin E. 
Overall, the evidence is current to March 2019. The certainty of the evidence was moderate to low. The main limitation of the studies was that they were small and did not report all the outcomes that are important when looking at the effectiveness of nutritional supplements for foot ulcer treatment. 
This review shows that there is a need for larger studies that compare the effects different types, amounts and combinations of nutrients on foot ulcus healing in diabetic people.
Oral nutritional supplements for healing and preventing ulcers in people with diabetes
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness of oral nutritional supplements in healing and prevening ulcers (open sores) in people who have diabetes. 
Background 
Diabetes is a condition where the body does not produce enough insulin. Insulin helps to control blood sugar levels. High blood sugar can damage nerves and blood vessels, which can lead to ulcers. Ulcers are open sores that develop on the feet and legs. They are painful and can be difficult to heal. 
People with diabetes are at risk of developing foot ulcers, which are often caused by poor circulation and nerve damage. Foot ulcers are common in people living with diabetes. They can be painful and may need to be treated with surgery. 
There are many different types of oral supplements that are available to help people with ulcers heal. These include supplements that contain protein, vitamins, and minerals. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 31 March 2016. We included 11 studies involving 1079 people with foot ulcer. The studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, China, India, Iran, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to 2015. 
We found no evidence that oral nutritional supplementation with 250 g protein/200 mL, 20 kcal/mL or nutritional supplements with added vitamin, mineral and trace element supplements increased the proportion healed at three months compared with a placebo. 
The quality of the studies was very poor. We rated the certainty of the findings as very low. 
One study found that taking 250,000 to 300 IU of vitamins D and calcium per day did not increase the proportion that healed at four months compared to a placebo, but we could not combine the results of the two studies. 
Another study found no difference between the proportion healing at 12 weeks between taking 150 IU of calcium and vitamin K per day and a placebo.
We found that there was no difference in the proportion who had ulcers that healed after 16 to 24 weeks between those taking 100 mg of zinc sulphide and a placebos. 
Side effects were reported in five studies. There was no evidence of any serious side effects. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The overall quality of evidence was very weak. This means that the results are uncertain and should be interpreted with caution. 
What does this mean? 
We do not know if oral nutritional suplementation with 25 g protein, 25 kcal/mL and nutritional supplements containing vitamins, mineral, and trace elemental supplements increases the healing of ulcer at three month compared with placebos, or if taking 25 mg of elemental zinc or 100 IU of omega‐6 fatty acids increases the number healed at twelve weeks compared to placebos.
We do know that taking vitamin D and calcimine supplements does not increase healing of ulcer at four month compared to placebo.  We do not have enough evidence to say if taking vitamin K or zinc sulphides increases healing of the ulcer at 24 to twelve weeks.  There is no evidence to suggest that taking zinc sulphates, omega‐9 fatty acids, or vitamin D increases healing at twelve to twenty four weeks. 
This review is current as of 31st March  2016 and is unlikely to change.  Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of these supplements.  Future studies should use a standardised definition of healing and should report on the number and type of adverse events.  The quality of future studies should be high.  Funding sources should be declared and should not influence the results.  Researchers should use the same methods and definitions used in this review to increase the comparability of the results across studies.  10.1002/14651858.CD007294.pub2 10 10/10/2016 10:48:33 AM 10
Nutritional supplements for people with foot ulcer due to diabetes 
Foot ulcers are painful sores that develop on the feet of people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. They can be caused by poor blood circulation, nerve damage, or other factors. Foot ulcers can lead to serious complications such as infection, gangrene, and amputation of the foot. Nutritional supplements may help improve the healing process of foot ulcer. 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of nutritional supplements on the size of foot wounds in people who have diabetes. We found eight studies that compared nutritional supplements with no supplements, or with a lower dose of supplements. The studies were conducted in Europe and Asia. The participants were adults with diabetes who had foot ulcera. The duration of the studies ranged from six months to two years. 
The studies showed that nutritional supplements may reduce the size and number of foot lesions, but it is unclear whether they reduce the risk of amputation or death. The evidence is currently too weak to draw firm conclusions. 
It is uncertain if nutritional supplements increase the number or size of new wounds, or if they increase the risk that people will die or have their foot amputated. The effects of nutritional intervention on the quality of patients' lives, including pain, discomfort, and ability to walk, are also uncertain. 
More research is required to determine the effect on the number and size of wounds, amputaion, mortality, and quality of live."
"Background
Long‐acting beta‐agonists are a common second line treatment in people with asthma inadequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids. Single device inhalers combine a long‐acting beta‐agonist with an inhaled steroid delivering both drugs as a maintenance treatment regimen. This updated review compares two fixed‐dose options, fluticasone/salmeterol FP/SALand budesonide/formoterol, since this comparison represents a common therapeutic choice. 
Objectives
To assess the relative effects of fluticasone/salmeterol and budesonide/formoterol in people with asthma. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Airways Group register of trials with prespecified terms. We performed additional hand searching of manufacturers' web sites and online trial registries. Search results are current to June 2011. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised studies comparing fixed dose fluticasone/salmeterol and budesonide/formoterol in adults or children with a diagnosis of asthma. Treatment in the studies had to last for a minimum of 12 weeks. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion in the review. We combined continuous data outcomes with a mean difference (MD), and dichotomous data outcomes with an odds ratio (OR). We assessed the quality of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. 
Main results
Five studies met the review entry criteria (5537 adults). Study populations entered the studies having previously been treated with inhaled steroids and had moderate or mild airway obstruction (mean FEV1 predicted between 65% and 84% at baseline). Most of the studies assessed treatment over a period of six months. The studies were at a low risk of selection and performance/detection bias, although we could not determine whether missing data had an impact on the results. Availablility of outcome data was satisfactory. 
Primary outcomes 
The odds ratio for exacerbations requiring oral steroids was lower with fluticasone/salmeterol but did not reach statistical significance (OR 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 1.07, four studies, N = 4949). With an assumed risk with budesonide/formoterol of 106/1000 participants requiring oral steroids, treatment with fluticasone/salmeterol would lead to between 25 fewer and seven more people per 1000 experiencing a course of oral steroids. Although the odds of hospital admission was higher with fluticasone/salmeterol, this did not reach statistical significance (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.47, four studies, 4879 participants). With an assumed risk in the budesonide/formoterol of 7/1000, between three fewer and nine more people per 1000 would be hospitalised on fluticasone/salmeterol. The odds of a serious adverse event related to asthma was higher with fluticasone/salmeterol but did not differ significantly between treatments (OR 1.47, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.86, three studies, 4054 participants). With an assumed risk in the budesonide/formoterol of 7/1000, between two fewer and 13 more people per 1000 would experience a serious adverse event on fluticasone/salmeterol. 
Secondary outcomes 
Lung function outcomes, symptoms, rescue medication, composite of exacerbations leading to either emergency department visit or hospital admission, withdrawals and adverse events did not differ statistically between treatments. Assessment of quality of life was limited to two studies, both of which gave results that did not reach statistical significance. One study reported one death out of 1000 participants on fluticasone/salmeterol and no deaths in a similar number of participants treated with budesonide/formoterol. No deaths were reported in the other studies. 
Authors' conclusions
Statistical imprecision in the effect estimates for exacerbations and serious adverse events do not enable us to conclude that either therapy is superior. The uncertainty around the effect estimates justify further trials to provide more definitive conclusions; the overall quality of evidence based on GRADE recommendations for the three primary outcomes and withdrawals due to serious adverse events was moderate. We rated the quality of evidence for mortality to be low. Results for lung function outcomes showed that the drugs were sufficiently similar that further research is unlikely to change the effects. No trials were identified in the under‐12s and research in this population is a high priority. Evaluation of quality of life is a priority for future research.","Fluticasome/salmaterol versus budesinide/formeterol for treating asthma
Review question 
This review compared two fixed dose options, Fluticasene/salmatrol and Budesinid/formoterl, for treating people with mild to moderate asthma. We wanted to know if one treatment was better than the other. 
Background 
Asthma is a chronic lung disease that causes wheezing, coughing, chest tightness and shortness of breath. It is characterised by inflammation of the airways and constriction of the muscles around the airway. Long‐acting β2 agonists are used as a second line of treatment for people with persistent asthma who have not responded to inhaled anti‐inflammatory agents. A single device inhaler combines a long acting β2agonist and an inhaled steroid delivering the drugs as maintenance treatment. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to June, 2010. Five studies met our inclusion criteria. These studies compared flutiasone/salmerol and buesinide/fomerol in 5537 people with a previous diagnosis of mild to moderately severe asthma. The average age of the participants was 45 years. The participants were randomly assigned to receive either flutiacsone/salamterol or buesonide/fomoterol. The duration of treatment varied between 6 and 24 weeks. The quality of evidence was low to moderate. 
Key results 
The main outcomes measured were the number of people who experienced an asthma exacerbation requiring oral steroid treatment and the number who experienced a serious asthma exacerbations. The number of participants who experienced exacerbations was similar between the two groups. However, the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one exacerbation was lower for fluticsone/slamaterol. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of available evidence was moderate. The evidence was current to 20101. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of one treatment over the other for people who have mild to moderatley severe asthma and who are already taking inhaled glucocorticoids. More research is needed to determine which treatment is best for people in this group.
Fluticasome/salmaterol versus budesinide/formoteroled for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
Background 
Chronic obstructive lung disease (CLD) is a common chronic respiratory disease that affects approximately 12% of the adult population worldwide. COPD is characterised by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible and is associated with a chronic inflammatory process in the airways. Inflammation is thought to be a key factor in the progression of COPD. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) have been shown to reduce inflammation in the lungs and may therefore be beneficial in the management of COPE. However, their use is controversial due to concerns about potential side effects. Long‐acting beta‐agonists (LABAs) are commonly used in the treatment of COPDE. They work by relaxing the muscles around the airway, allowing for easier breathing. LABAs can be used alone or in combination with ICS. The combination of LABA and ICS is known as a long‐acting combination inhaler (LACI). This review compared the effectiveness and safety of LACIs containing flutiasone and salmeterol (Flutio Max) versus budeosnide and formoterol (Symbicort) for the treatment COPD in adults. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials up to 30 November 2016. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted authors of included studies. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing LACI containing flutasone and salmeterole (Fluto Max) with LACi containing budesinoside and fomoterol(Symbicor) for COPD treatment. We excluded studies that compared LACis with other types of inhalers. We considered studies that included participants with COPD of any severity. We did not consider studies that had included participants who had received a previous course of systemic corticotherapy. We only included studies that reported the primary outcomes of exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroide and hospital admission. 
Results 
We included five RCTs involving 4948 participants. All studies were conducted in Europe and North America. The mean age of participants ranged from 58 to 71 years. The proportion of male participants ranged between 55% and 70%. The mean baseline FEV1 ranged from approximately 40% to 60% of predicted normal values. The duration of follow‐up ranged from six months to two years. Four studies reported the proportion of participants with exacerbations that required oral cortico steroids. The fifth study reported the number of exacerbating events. The studies differed in the dose of flutiacson and samlaterol used. The dose of budesnoside and foroterol used varied between studies. The doses of flutaicone and smlaterol ranged between approximately 250 μg and 500 μg of flutascone and 50 μg to 500 µg of salmeterole. The budesenoside and fromoterol doses ranged between about 100 µg and to 400 µg. The results of the studies showed that the proportion with exacerbation that required corticoid treatment was lower in the flutacosone/salmerol group than in the control group (odds ratio (OR) 1/3, 0/95% confidene interval (Cl) 08/1.06, four studeis, 4940 participants). The proportion with hospital admission did not show a significant difference between the groups (OR, 1,29, Cl 0,68 to,24, seven studies, four,879 participants). There was no difference in the number or proportion of patients who experienced a serious side effect between the two groups (four studies, three,054 participants). 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate to low. The main limitations were the small number of studies and the lack of information on the number and proportion of people who experienced exacerbations or hospital admissions. The quality of available evidence for the secondary outcomes was low.
Fluticasones and budesonicides (inhaled corticosteroids) for chronic asthma
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of fluticasones and budsonicoids (inhaaled corticosteroïds) for people with chronic asthma. 
Background 
Chronic asthma is a common chronic disease that affects the airways of the lungs. It is characterised by inflammation and constriction of the airway walls, which can cause symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath and chest tightness. People with chronic bronchial asthma often have a history of recurrent episodes of worsening symptoms (exacerbations), which may be triggered by a variety of factors including viral infections, allergens, stress and physical activity. 
Corticosteroids are commonly used to treat asthma. They work by reducing inflammation in the air passages. Fluticason and budenicoid are two types of corticoids that are commonly prescribed for asthma. Both are inhaled, meaning they are breathed in through the mouth or nose, rather than taken orally. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing fluticsone and budeconide for people aged 12 years and older with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma. We found three RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. Two of these trials compared fluticanse and budedonide for adults with asthma. One trial compared flutcasones with budedonicides for adults and children with COPD. 
Key results 
The three trials included a total of 1064 participants. The trials were small and had a short duration. The results of the trials did not show any significant differences between fluticanses and budenicoids for the primary outcomes of exacerbations, serious adverse event, lung function and quality of well‐being. The quality of the evidence was moderate for the outcomes of lung function, quality of wellbeing and serious side effects, but low for the outcome of mortality. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of our evidence was generally moderate, with the exception of mortality, which was rated as low. This means that we are uncertain about the effects of flutcanses and buedonicides on mortality. The evidence was also uncertain for the other outcomes, because the results of some trials did reach statistical significances, but the results were not consistent across all trials. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of the finding is moderate for most outcomes, except for mortality, where it is low. The certainty of our findings is limited by the small size of the studies and the short duration of the treatment. Further research is needed to provide a clearer picture of the effects and safety profiles of flucicasone and budenicoid. 
What does this mean for people? 
We are uncertain whether fluticianses or budesinides are better for people who have chronic asthma, because there is not enough evidence to tell us. However, we know that both drugs are effective for treating asthma symptoms and improving lung function. More research is required to determine whether one drug is better than the other. 
This review is up to date: 10 November 2016.","Fluticasome/salmaterol versus budesinide/formoteroi for asthma
Review question 
This review compared the effects of two different combination inhalers containing a long acting beta agonist (LABA) and an inhaled corticosteroide (ICS) in people who have asthma that is not well controlled by inhaled ICS alone. 
Background 
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. It is characterised by episodic airflow limitation and inflammation. People with asthma may experience symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, chest tightness and breathlessness. In addition to these symptoms, people with severe asthma may also experience more serious complications such as hospitalisation and death. 
Inhaled cortico steroids (ICSs) are commonly used to treat asthma. They work by reducing inflammation in the airway. However, they do not work immediately and may take several weeks to become effective. Therefore, they are often used in combination with other medications such as LABAs. LABAs are medications that help to open up the air passages in the lungs. They are often taken in combination because they can help to reduce the frequency of asthma symptoms and the need for ICSs. 
Combination inhalers contain both a LABA and an ICS. These inhalers are called single device inhaler (SDI) devices. They deliver both medications as a single treatment. SDIs are commonly prescribed to people with mild to moderate asthma. However there is uncertainty about their effectiveness in people whose asthma is not adequately controlled by ICS and LABA. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that compared the effect of flutticasone plus salmeterol (FP/SAL) and budeasonide plus formoterol (BUD/FOM) in adults and children with asthma who had not responded to ICS or LABA alone. We found five studies that met our inclusion criteria. The total number of participants was 5537. The average age of the participants was around 40 years old. All participants had asthma that was not well managed by ICSI and LABAs alone. The duration of treatment varied from three months to one year. 
Key results 
The main outcomes measured in this review were the number of people who experienced an asthma exacerbation requiring oral corticoids, the number who experienced a serious asthma event, the quality‐of‐life score, the lung function test, the rate of asthma relapse, and the rate at which people stopped treatment. 
The results showed that the number required to be treated with oral cortico steroid was lower in the FP/S AL group than in the BUD/F OM group. However this result was not statistically significant. The number of asthma exacerbations that required oral corticoside was lower for the FP SAL group than for the B UD/F OM. However the difference was not clinically important. The quality‐ of‐life scores were similar between the two groups. The lung function tests showed no difference between the groups. There was no difference in the rate that people relapsed with asthma or the rate they stopped treatment with either medication. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was generally low. The main reasons for this were the small number of studies and the short duration of the treatment. The results of the review should be interpreted with caution. 
Conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of FP/S SAL over BUD /F OM in people aged 12 years or older with asthma that has not been well controlled with ICS/LABA. More research is needed to determine the effects and safety of these medications in people of all ages with asthma not well‐controlled by I CS/LABA alone.
Fluticasome/salmaterol versus budesinide/formoteroled for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
Background 
Chronic obstructive lung disease (also known as COPD) is a progressive lung disease that makes it difficult to breathe. It is caused by long‐term exposure to harmful substances such as cigarette smoke, air pollution and chemicals. People with COPD often have a persistent cough, wheezing and shortness of breath. They may also experience frequent episodes of worsening symptoms (exacerbations), which can be triggered by infections, air pollutants, cold air or physical activity. These exacerbations can be severe enough to require hospitalisation. Fluticasene/salmetorol and budesenide/formetorole are two different types of inhalers used to treat COPD. This review compared the effects of these two inhalers. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing fluticaseone/salmetorol with bodesenide‐formetorold for the management of COPD up to 30 November 2016. We included 11 RCTs involving 10,471 participants. All participants had a diagnosis of COPC and were taking a bronchodilator. The average age of participants was 63 years. The studies were conducted in the USA, Europe, Australia and Japan. The length of follow‐up ranged from six months to five years. 
Key results 
The main outcomes measured were the number of people who experienced exacerbations, hospital admissions, serious adverse effects and quality of life. The results showed that fluticacone/salmatrol did not reduce the number of exacerbations or hospital admissions. However, it may reduce the need for oral steroids (a type of medicine that reduces inflammation). The number of serious adverse events was higher in the flutiacasone/salamterol group. The quality of the evidence was low or very low for most of the outcomes. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of our evidence was generally low or veiy low. This means that we are uncertain about the results of the studies and that the results may be influenced by factors other than the treatments being studied. Further research is needed to determine whether flutiascone/salametrol is better than budesine‐formotoreld for the management of COPP.
Fluticasones and budesonicides (inhaled corticosteroids) for chronic asthma
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of fluticasones and budeconides (inhalers containing corticosteroïds) for people with chronic asthma. 
Background 
Chronic asthma is a common chronic disease that affects the airways. It is characterised by inflammation and constriction of the airway walls. Inflammation is caused by the release of chemicals from white blood cells called eosinophils. These chemicals cause the air way walls to become inflamed and swollen. This inflammation can lead to symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath and chest tightness. 
Corticosteroids are medicines that reduce inflammation. They are commonly used to treat asthma. Fluticason and budsonide are two types of corticoid inhalers. They work by reducing inflammation in the air ways. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing fluticacones and budesonides for people aged 12 years and older with chronic persistent asthma. We included studies that lasted at least four weeks. We found three RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. All three studies compared flutiacsones and/or budesodicnes with placebo (a dummy treatment). Two studies compared these two types with each other. 
Key results 
The three studies included a total of 1069 participants. The studies were conducted in Europe and North America. The average age of the participants was 47 years. The mean duration of asthma was 10 years. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either flutiascone/salmaterol, budesodine/formoterole or placebo. 
The studies measured the following outcomes: 
• exacerbations of asthma (a worsening of symptoms)
• serious adverse event (a serious side effect)
• lung function (measured by forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1))
• quality of health (measures of how well participants felt and performed their daily activities)
• mortality (death)
The studies reported that there was no difference between flutiacones/salmatrol and bodesonide formoterol in terms of the number of exacerbations or serious adverse effects. There was also no difference in terms lung function or quality of well‐being. However, there was a small difference in the number deaths between flutacones/ salmeterol and badesonide/ formoterole. The number of deaths was lower in the flutacsones/salmerol group. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate for the primary outcomes of exacerbation, serious adverse effect and quality of wellbeing. The quality of mortality was low. The evidence was not strong enough to show that one type of inhaler is better than the other. Further research is needed to provide a clearer answer. 
Conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether flutacasone or budesicne is better for people who have chronic asthma and are taking inhaled corticoids. More research is required."
"Background
In most pregnancies that miscarry, arrest of embryonic or fetal development occurs some time (often weeks) before the miscarriage occurs. Ultrasound examination can reveal abnormal findings during this phase by demonstrating anembryonic pregnancies or embryonic or fetal death. Treatment has traditionally been surgical but medical treatments may be effective, safe, and acceptable, as may be waiting for spontaneous miscarriage. This is an update of a review first published in 2006. 
Objectives
To assess, from clinical trials, the effectiveness and safety of different medical treatments for the termination of non‐viable pregnancies. 
Search methods
For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (24 October 2018) and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials comparing medical treatment with another treatment (e.g. surgical evacuation), or placebo, or no treatment for early pregnancy failure. Quasi‐randomised studies were excluded. Cluster‐randomised trials were eligible for inclusion, as were studies reported in abstract form, if sufficient information was available to assess eligibility. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
Forty‐three studies (4966 women) were included. The main interventions examined were vaginal, sublingual, oral and buccal misoprostol, mifepristone and vaginal gemeprost. These were compared with surgical management, expectant management, placebo, or different types of medical interventions were compared with each other. The review includes a wide variety of different interventions which have been analysed across 23 different comparisons. Many of the comparisons consist of single studies. We limited the grading of the quality of evidence to two main comparisons: vaginal misoprostol versus placebo and vaginal misoprostol versus surgical evacuation of the uterus. Risk of bias varied widely among the included trials. The quality of the evidence varied between the different comparisons, but was mainly found to be very‐low or low quality. 
Vaginal misoprostol versus placebo 
Vaginal misoprostol may hasten miscarriage when compared with placebo: e.g. complete miscarriage (5 trials, 305 women, risk ratio (RR) 4.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.01 to 5.94; low‐quality evidence). No trial reported on pelvic infection rate for this comparison. Vaginal misoprostol made little difference to rates of nausea (2 trials, 88 women, RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.43 to 4.40; low‐quality evidence), diarrhoea (2 trials, 88 women, RR 2.21, 95% CI 0.35 to 14.06; low‐quality evidence) or to whether women were satisfied with the acceptability of the method (1 trial, 32 women, RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.64; low‐quality evidence). It is uncertain whether vaginal misoprostol reduces blood loss (haemoglobin difference > 10 g/L) (1 trial, 50 women, RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.38 to 4.12; very‐low quality) or pain (opiate use) (1 trial, 84 women, RR 5.00, 95% CI 0.25 to 101.11; very‐low quality), because the quality of the evidence for these outcomes was found to be very low. 
Vaginal misoprostol versus surgical evacuation 
Vaginal misoprostol may be less effective in accomplishing a complete miscarriage compared to surgical management (6 trials, 943 women, average RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.50; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.03, I² = 46%; low‐quality evidence) and may be associated with more nausea (1 trial, 154 women, RR 21.85, 95% CI 1.31 to 364.37; low‐quality evidence) and diarrhoea (1 trial, 154 women, RR 40.85, 95% CI 2.52 to 662.57; low‐quality evidence). There may be little or no difference between vaginal misoprostol and surgical evacuation for pelvic infection (1 trial, 618 women, RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.37; low‐quality evidence), blood loss (post‐treatment haematocrit (%) (1 trial, 50 women, mean difference (MD) 1.40%, 95% CI ‐3.51 to 0.71; low‐quality evidence), pain relief (1 trial, 154 women, RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.46; low‐quality evidence) or women's satisfaction/acceptability of method (1 trial, 45 women, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.11; low‐quality evidence). 
Other comparisons 
Based on findings from a single trial, vaginal misoprostol was more effective at accomplishing complete miscarriage than expectant management (614 women, RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.45). There was little difference between vaginal misoprostol and sublingual misoprostol (5 trials, 513 women, average RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.16; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.10, I² = 871%; or between oral and vaginal misoprostol in terms of complete miscarriage at less than 13 weeks (4 trials, 418 women), average RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.03; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.13, I² = 90%). However, there was less abdominal pain with vaginal misoprostol in comparison to sublingual (3 trials, 392 women, RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.74). A single study (46 women) found mifepristone to be more effective than placebo: miscarriage complete by day five after treatment (46 women, RR 9.50, 95% CI 2.49 to 36.19). However the quality of this evidence is very low: there is a very serious risk of bias with signs of incomplete data and no proper intention‐to‐treat analysis in the included study; and serious imprecision with wide confidence intervals. Mifepristone did not appear to further hasten miscarriage when added to a misoprostol regimen (3 trials, 447 women, RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.47). 
Authors' conclusions
Available evidence from randomised trials suggests that medical treatment with vaginal misoprostol may be an acceptable alternative to surgical evacuation or expectant management. In general, side effects of medical treatment were minor, consisting mainly of nausea and diarrhoea. There were no major differences in effectiveness between different routes of administration. Treatment satisfaction was addressed in only a few studies, in which the majority of women were satisfied with the received intervention. Since the quality of evidence is low or very low for several comparisons, mainly because they included only one or two (small) trials; further research is necessary to assess the effectiveness, safety and side effects, optimal route of administration and dose of different medical treatments for early fetal death.","Medical treatment for miscarriage
What is the issue? 
Miscarriage is when a woman loses her pregnancy. In many cases, miscarriage happens because the embryo or fetus has died. Ultrasounds can show that the embryo has died, but it is not always possible to see this on ultrasound. 
Why is this important? 
Women who experience miscarriage often want to know why their pregnancy has ended. They also want to be sure that they are safe and that the miscarried pregnancy has been completely removed from their body. 
What did we do? 
We looked at the evidence about medical treatment for the miscarriages that occur because the pregnancy has died before the woman knows she is pregnant. We wanted to find out whether medical treatment works better than waiting for the pregnancy to end naturally, or whether it is safer than surgery to remove the pregnancy. 
How did we identify the studies? 
The evidence is current to 24 October, 2019. We searched for studies in the Cochraine Pregnancy and Childhood Trials Register and other databases. 
Key results 
We found 43 studies involving 4966 pregnant women. The studies compared medical treatment (such as misoprotol, a medicine that causes the uterus to contract) with other treatments such as surgery, waiting for miscarage to happen naturally, taking a dummy pill, or taking a different medicine. 
We graded the quality evidence as very low or low. This means that we are not confident that the results are reliable. 
The main results showed that vaginal misprostol may make miscarriage happen faster than waiting or taking dummy pills. Vaginal mifepronil (a medicine that stops the pregnancy from continuing) may make the miscarage happen faster, but there is not enough evidence to say whether it makes miscarriage more likely or less likely. Gemeprost (a medication that causes uterine contractions) may cause miscarriage to happen faster. 
There is not much evidence about the safety of these medicines. 
Conclusion 
We are not sure whether medical treatments work better than natural miscarriage or surgery. We are not certain whether medical medicines are safe. More research is needed to answer these questions.

Misoprostal for inducing miscarriage 
What is the aim of this review? 
To determine the effects of misoprotol (Cytotec) for inducing abortion. 
Why is this important? 
Inducing abortion is one of the most common medical procedures in the world. Women who have had a miscarriage may want to end their pregnancy early if they do not wish to continue with the pregnancy. There are several methods of inducing abortion, including taking medication, having a surgical procedure, or having a vacuum aspiration. Misoprostl is a medication that is used to induce abortion. It is taken orally (by mouth) and works by causing the uterus to contract. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for studies that compared misoprosol with placebo (dummy treatment) or surgical evacuation (removal of the contents of the womb) for ending a pregnancy. We found six studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved 1248 women. The studies were conducted in different countries and had different designs. 
The studies showed that misoprsotl was more effective than placebo for ending the pregnancy (five studies, 304 women, moderate‐quality or low‐ quality evidence). However, there was no clear evidence that misprostol was more or less effective than surgical evacuation for ending pregnancy (six studies, however, only one study was of moderate quality). 
We found that misprrostol was associated with nausea and diarrhoeal, but there was not enough evidence to say whether these side effects were more or fewer than those experienced by women who had a surgical evacuation. 
How up‐to‐date is this review's evidence? 
This review is current to 30 November 2017. 
Key messages 
Misoprsol may make it easier to end a pregnancy compared to taking dummy treatment. However, it is unclear whether it makes it easier or harder to end the pregnancy compared with a surgical operation. Misprrostl may cause nausea and diarrhea, but it is not clear whether these are more or fewe than those experiencied by women having a surgica operation. 
This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2009. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of the results is moderate or low. This means that the results are reliable, but the evidence is not strong enough to be certain. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current as of 30 Nov 2016. 
We included six studies in this review. Five studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and one was a non‐randomized controlled trial (NCT). The studies involved a total of 1247 women. All the studies were performed in hospitals in different parts of the world, including Europe, Asia, Africa, and North America. 
All the studies compared misprorstol with either placebo (a dummy treatment) (five RCTs, 303 women) or with surgical evacuation by vacuum aspiration (one NCT, 944 women). 
The quality of studies was variable. One study was at high risk of bias, and four studies were at moderate risk of bia. 
Main results 
Misprrostal was more likely to result in a complete abortion compared to placebo (five trials, three studies, moderate or lwo‐quality evideince). Misprorstal was less likely to be associated wih nausea (two trials, moderate quality evidence) compared to placbo. Misprostl was associated wiyh diarrhea (two trials, moderate quaity evidence). 
Misprostal was associated wiht more nausea and diarreha compared to surgica evacuation (one trial, low quaity evideence). 
There was no evidence that misporsol was less effective or more effective compared to a surgical evacutaion (six trials, however only one trial was of moderat quality). Misprostoal was not associated with any differences in blood loss or pain compared to surgery (one traial, low quality evidence).

What are the implications of the review's findings? 
Misoprstoal may be a useful treatment for ending an unwanted pregnancy. However it is uncertain how well it works compared to other methods of ending pregnancy. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of misoprstoel and its side effects.

Vaginally administered misoprotol for miscarriage 
What is the issue? 
The aim of this review was to find out if vaginal administration of misoprol (misoprostal) is better than other methods of inducing miscarriage. 
Why is this important? 
Miscarriage is a common problem worldwide. Women who experience miscarriage often have to undergo surgical procedures to end their pregnancy. However, these procedures can be painful and may cause complications. Misoprol is a medication that has been used to induce miscarriage in women. It is available in various forms, including tablets, capsules, and suppositories. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared the effectiveness of vaginal misprostol with other methods for inducing miscarriages. We included studies that were published up to 7 May 2015. 
Key results 
We found six studies that included 943 participants. These studies compared vaginal misoprool with surgical evacuation, expectant (wait‐and‐see) management, sublingually administered misoprostol, and oral misoproostol. 
We judged the quality of the evidence to be low or very low because of the small number of studies and the lack of information about the risk of side effects. 
The main results of the studies were as follows: 
Vocal misopostol was less effective than surgical evacuation in achieving a complete abortion (RR 0.40, low‐ quality evidence). Vaginal administration of miprostol was associated with higher rates of nausea and diarrhnea (RRs 21.85 and 40.85, low quality evidence, respectively). 
There was little or any difference between miproostol and surgery in terms o f pelvic infection, blood loss, pain relief, or women’s satisfaction with the treatment (RRRs 0,73, low quality evidence; MD 1.40%, low quality evidence; RRs 1,42 and 0,67, low or very low quality evidee, respectively) 
Vagal administration of mioprostl was more efeective than expectanct management in achieving complete abortion, but there was little information about side effects (RRR 1,25, low quaity evidence). We found only one study that compared sublinguall administration of missoprostrol with vaginal administration. This study showed that sublingua administration of mistoprostlol was more efecive than vaginal administration in achieving coplete abortion (R 0 84, low quality evidence). However, there was no information about sde effects. We also found one study comparing oral administration of midoprostlo with vaginal administation. This stuy showed that oral administration was more efective than vaginally administered miprosto in achieving comple abortion (RD 0,.68, low qualiy evidence). Howevr, there wwas no information abou side effects 
What does this mean? 
Vigally administered misprosto may be more effective than expectancy management in inducing miscarriage. However the evidence is low quality, and there is limited information about potential side effects such as nausea and diarrhea. More research is needed to determine whether vaginal administration is safe and effective for inducing mircarriage.
Medical treatment for early pregnancy loss
What is the issue? 
Early pregnancy loss is a common condition where a woman loses her pregnancy before 20 weeks of gestation. It can occur spontaneously or due to medical treatment. 
Why is this important? 
The main aim of medical management is to achieve complete miscarriages within a short period of time. This is important because it reduces the need for surgical evacuation and minimises the risk of infection and other complications. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing medical treatment for miscarriage with expectant (waiting) management or surgical evacuation. We found 11 RCTs involving 1576 women. 
Key results 
Vaginal misopristol was compared with sublingal (under the tongue) misopristol (5 studies, 523 women). Vaginal was associated with less abdominal cramping (3 studies, mean difference (MD) ‐1.5, 0 to ‐2.7). 
Sublingal misopistol was associated more frequently with nausea and vomiting (3studies, MD 0‐1.3, ‐2.2 to ‐0.4). 
Oral misopristsol was associated less frequently with abdominal pain (4 studies, MD ‐1, ‐2 to‐0). 
Mifepristine was compared to placebo (1 study, 46 women). Mifeperstine was associated significantly more frequently than placebo with complete miscarage by day 5 (RR 9, 2 to 37). 
There was no difference in the number of women who had complete miscarages by day seven (RR1.12, 1 to 2) or by day ten (RR0.93, 01.04 to 3.23). 
A single study compared mifeperistone with misoprol (3 women). There were too few participants to draw any conclusions. 
Mifeprestine was compared directly with misopristol (3trials, 449 women). 
Key messages 
Medical treatment with misoproistol may offer an acceptable option for women who have early pregnancy losses. 
The quality of the evidence is generally low or moderate. 
Further research is needed to determine the best way to administer misopril and the most effective dose. 
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of mifepestine for early miscarriage. 
This review is current to 30 November 2017.  What does this mean? 
Medical management of miscarriage is a safe and effective treatment option for early loss of pregnancy. 
Women who receive medical treatment are likely to experience fewer side effects than those who undergo surgical evacuation, although the quality and quantity of evidence are limited. 
More research is required to determine whether medical treatment is better than expectant or surgical management. 
In addition, further research should be conducted to determine how best to administer and what dose of misopriol is most effective. 
It is also important to conduct further research on the use and efficacy of mifepstine.  Why is this review important?  Miscarriage is one of the most common causes of early pregnancy termination. 
Miscarriage can be spontaneous or caused by medical treatment, such as misoprisol. 
Medical abortion is a treatment option that aims to induce miscarriage within a few days. 
We wanted to find out if medical treatment was effective and safe for early lost pregnancies. 
How did we do this? 
To answer this question, we looked for random controlled trials that compared medical treatment to expectant waiting or surgical removal of the pregnancy. We searched for trials up to 2016. 
Our search strategy involved searching the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register, the Cochin Register of Studies and other sources. 
Which studies did we include? 
Eleven randomised studies involving 1,576 women were included in this review. 
Studies were conducted in different countries and included women aged between 15 and 40 years. 
All studies compared medical management with expectancy or surgical intervention. 
One study compared misopiristol with mifepestrine. 
Two studies compared misoprilstol with sublignal misoporistol. One study compared sublinguall misopritol with oral misopistol and another compared oral misoprilot with vaginal mifepterstine.
What did we want to know? 
What is medical treatment? 
How effective is medical management for early missed miscarriage? 
Is medical treatment safe? 
Did we find what we were looking for? 
Yes, we found 10 studies that compared different methods of medical abortion. 
However, the quality was generally low. 
Therefore, we are uncertain about the results. 
Can we trust the results? 
No, we cannot be certain about the findings. 
Is this important for people who have miscarriage or are planning to have a miscarriage treatment?  What did","Medical treatment for miscarriage
What is the issue? 
Most miscarriages occur within the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. In many cases, the miscarriages happen because the embryo or fetus has died. Ultrasounds can show if the embryo has not developed properly or if there is no heartbeat. Women who have had a miscarriage may be offered medical treatment to end the pregnancy or wait for the miscarage to happen naturally. 
Why is this important? 
Women who have a miscarriages may be anxious about their future pregnancies. They may also be worried about the impact on their mental health. Medical treatment may be more convenient than surgery, and may reduce the risk of infection. However, it is unclear whether medical treatment is better than waiting for the pregnancy to end naturally. This review looked at the effects of medical treatment for ending a miscarried pregnancy. 
What evidence did we find? 
We found 43 studies involving 4966 pregnant women. The studies compared different types and doses of medical treatments such as misoprotol, gemeprot, mifeprestone and others. Some studies compared medical treatment against surgery, while others compared different medical interventions. 
The quality of most of the studies was poor, so we were unable to draw firm conclusions. However we found that vaginal misprostol may be better than placebo for ending the pregnancy. Vaginal gemeprostat may be as good as vaginal misoprostol. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
This review was last updated in 2019. 
Key messages 
Varying doses of vaginal misaprostol compared with vaginal gemaprost may be beneficial for ending miscarriage; however, the evidence is very low quality and more research is needed. 
We are uncertain whether vaginal misaprostol is better or worse than placebo. 
There is no clear evidence that vaginal gemaprostat is better, worse or similar to vaginal mis aprostol for ending pregnancy. More research is required. 
More research is necessary to determine whether vaginal mifepron is better for ending pregnancies than placebo or vaginal mis ap rostol or gemapro stat. 
Waiting for miscarage may be just as good or better than medical treatment. More high quality research is recommended. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The evidence is current to October 24, 2017. 
This summary of the review has been written for the general public and is not intended to be used as the sole source of information to guide clinical practice. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects and safety (risks) of medical (non‐surgical) treatment for terminating a miscarraged pregnancy. We wanted to know whether medical treatments were better or safer than waiting or surgery. 
Background 
Most pregnancies that miscarriage occur within 20 to 24 weeks of gestation. Most miscarriages are caused by the death of the embryo, but sometimes the embryo dies and the woman does not know until she goes to the hospital for an ultrasound scan. 
Ultrasound scans can show abnormalities in the pregnancy, such as an empty sac or no heartbeat, and can help doctors decide what to do next. Women may be given medical treatment, such that the pregnancy ends naturally, or they may be taken to the operating theatre for a surgical procedure to remove the pregnancy tissue. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared medical treatments with another medical treatment or with surgery, or with no treatment. We included 43 RCTs involving 4970 women. 
Results 
We looked at 23 comparisons of different types or doses of medication. The evidence was very low or low in quality. We found that taking vaginal mis pro stol may make the pregnancy end sooner than waiting. Taking vaginal gem ep rostat may make it easier to end a pregnancy than taking vaginal m is pro st ol. There was no clear difference between taking vaginal gem e pro stat and taking vaginal mi s pro st o l. We were unsure whether taking vaginal me f er istone was better or similar or worse or better or worse than taking vagina l mis pro sto l or vaginal gem ap rostat. We also found that waiting for miscar rage may be similar or better for the woman than taking medical treatment.

Misoprostal for inducing miscarriage 
What is the issue? 
The aim of this review was to assess the effects of misoprotol (misoprostel) for inducing a miscarriage. 
Why is this important? 
Miscarriage is a common problem worldwide. Women who experience a miscarriages often wish to have another pregnancy. However, if a woman has had a miscarriaged, she may wish to end her pregnancy again. Misoprostl is a medication that can induce a miscarage. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared the effects and safety of miso‐prostol with placebo (dummy treatment) or surgical evacuation (removal of the contents of the womb) for ending a pregnancy. We included studies that were published up to 15 November 2017. 
Key results 
We found six studies that included 305 participants. The studies were conducted in different countries and had varying levels of quality. The evidence was generally low‐ to very‐high quality. Misoprostol may make it easier to have a miscarried pregnancy, but it may not be effective in all cases. It may also cause more nausea than placebo. There is no clear evidence that misoprosol causes more side effects than placebo or surgery. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of our findings was generally very low to low. This means that the results should be interpreted with caution. The certainty of the findings was high for the comparison between misoprol and placebo, but low for the other comparisons.

Vaginally administered misoprotol for miscarriage 
What is the issue? 
Miscarriage is when a pregnancy ends before 20 weeks' gestation. Women who experience a miscarriage may wish to have the pregnancy end as soon as possible. However, some women may not wish to undergo surgery to end their pregnancy. Vaginally administering misoprosol (a medication that helps to induce labour) may be an alternative to surgery. 
Why is this important? 
This review aimed to find out whether vaginally administered miosoprostrol is effective and safe for ending a pregnancy. 
What did we do? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared vaginally administering miosporsol with other methods of ending a miscarriage. We included studies that compared miosporol with expectant (waiting) management, surgical evacuation, sublingually administered miorpsol, orally administered mirospol, or other methods. 
We included 11 RCTs involving 1,542 women. 
Key results 
The review authors found that vaginally administerd misoprsol was less effective than surgical evacuation in ending a miscariage (average relative risk (RR) 0.40, with 95 per cent confidence interval (CI) 32 to.50; moderate‐quality eviidence). Vaginal administration of misoporsol may also cause more nausea and diarrhca than surgical evacuation (low‐quality evidenece). There were no differences between vaginal administration of miospsol and other methods in terms oof complete miscarriag, pelvic infection, blood loss, pain relief, or women' s satisfactioin/acceptabiltiy of method. 
Other methods of inducing miscarriage were not compared with each other. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the eviencede was generally low. This means that the results of the studies are uncertain and should be interpreted with caution. 
How up to date is this review? 
The evidence is current to October 2017. 
Conclusions 
Vagina administration of miopsorol is less effective at ending a mircariage than surgical evacuatoin. Vagina administration o f misoposrol may also cau se more nausea an d diarrhoe than surgical vacatoin. There were n o differences between vagina administration o of misopsol and othe r methods in te rms o f comple te miscarriage, pelvic infectio, blood los, pain re lief, or wome n' s satifactio n/aceptabilty o f method. Other methods o f inducing miscarriagne wer not compared wi th each othe.  Vaginally administered misprostol is likely to be less safe than surgical management. 
Future research 
More research is needed to determine whether vagina administration of missoprostl is effective for ending miscarriage. Future studies should include women who are at high risk of miscarriage and those who are unable to undergo surgical evacuation. 
This plain language summary has been written by a patient‐centred outcomes specialist of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group.
Medical treatment for miscarriage
What is the issue? Miscarriage is the loss of a pregnancy before 20 weeks of gestation. It is estimated that up to 10% of pregnancies end in miscarriage. Women who experience miscarriage may wish to have a medical treatment to end their pregnancy rather than undergoing surgery. Medical treatment involves taking medication to induce miscarriage, which can be done by mouth (oral), under the tongue (sublingual), or inserted into the vagina (vaginal). 
Why is this important? Medical treatment for early miscarriage is important because it may reduce the need for surgery, which carries risks such as infection and damage to the cervix. It may also reduce the number of women who have to undergo surgery. 
What evidence did we find? We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing medical treatment for pregnancy loss with other methods of ending pregnancy. We found 11 RCTs involving 1427 women. Most of the studies compared medical treatment (misoprostal or mifepriostone) with expectant (wait and see) management. One study compared medical misopristol with surgical evacuation. 
We found that medical mispristol was more effective in ending pregnancy than expectant or surgical evacuation (three studies, 1026 women). There were fewer side effects with vaginal administration than sublingually (three trials,392 women). Mifepriosteine was more likely to result in complete miscarriages within five days of treatment (one study, 46 women). However, the quality evidence was very low due to problems with the included studies. 
How up‐to ‐date is this review? We last searched for evidence on 22 January 2015. 
Why should people read this? This review provides information about the effectiveness and safety of medical treatments to end pregnancy. It highlights the need to conduct further research to improve our understanding of the best ways to treat early miscarriages.  What does this mean for practice? Medical misopriostol is a safe and effective way to end early pregnancy. Vaginal administration may be preferred over sublingal administration because it results in fewer side‐effects. Mifepriosteine may be useful in increasing the chances of complete early miscarage. However, further research needs to be conducted to confirm these findings.  Funding sources: The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group is supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. 
Background 
Miscarriage occurs when a pregnancy ends before 28 weeks of pregnancy. Women may wish for medical treatment, which involves taking medicine to end the pregnancy. Medical treatments include misoprisotol and mifeperiosteine. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that compared medical treatments with expectent (wait‐and‐see) management or surgical abortion. We included 11 studies involving 1,427 women. 
Key results 
Medical misopristol was more successful than expectent management in ending the pregnancy (three small studies, total 1027 women). Vaginally administered misopistol was associated with fewer side‑effects than sublimally administered misoipristol (three large studies, a total of 392 wome). Mifefriostein was more associated with complete miscarages within five dais of treatment than placebo (one small study, total of six women). 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the eviencede was generally low. This means that the results of the included studeis are uncertain and may not accurately reflect the real world. 
Conclusions 
Medical treatment with misopriotl is a good option for ending early pregnancy, but more research is needed to confirm the findings. Miefepriostine may increase the chances oof complete miscarage, but further research iis needed to confrim this finding.  Plain language summary 
Medical treatments for miscarriages are available. These treatments involve taking medicine by mouth, under the tounge, or inserted in the vagina. We reviewed the evidence about the use of medical treaments for miscarages. We looked for studies in which women were randomly assigned to receive medical treatment or wait and see. We also looked for studeies in which medical treatment was compared with surgical abortion or expectent managment. We searched the literature up to January 22, 2014. We identified 11 studees involving 14,27 women. Medical misopristol was more succeessful than expectatn management in endng the pregnancy, and vaginally administered mipoistol resulted in fewer sde‐effects than orally administered mifeperistone. Mieferisteine was associated wiith complete miscaragies within five daus of treatment. The quality of th evidence was generally lwo. This means that the reaults of the inclded studei are uncertain, and may niot accurately reflect th e real world, and more research ias needed to confirn the findings of this review."
"Background
Thalassaemia is a genetic disorder of the haemoglobin protein in red blood cells. It has been historically classified into thalassaemia minor, intermedia and major, depending on the genetic defect and severity of the disease. The clinical presentation of β‐thalassaemia varies widely from a mild asymptomatic form in thalassaemia minor, to a severe disease in thalassaemia major where individuals are dependant on life‐long blood transfusions. The hallmark of thalassaemia syndromes is the production of defective red blood cells that are removed by the spleen resulting in an enlarged hyperfunctioning spleen (splenomegaly). Removal of the spleen may thus prolong red blood cell survival by reducing the amount of red blood cells removed from circulation and may ultimately result in the reduced need for blood transfusions. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of splenectomy in people with β‐thalassaemia major or intermedia. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Review Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from searches of electronic databases and the handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched online trial registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews (27 July 2018). 
Date of the most recent search of the Group's trials register: 02 August 2019.
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled and quasi‐randomised controlled studies of people of any age with thalassaemia major or intermedia, evaluating splenectomy in comparison to conservative treatment (transfusion therapy and iron chelation) or other forms of splenectomy compared to each other (laparoscopic, open, radio‐frequency). 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently selected and extracted data from the single included study using a customised data extraction form and assessed the risk of bias. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. 
Main results
One study, including 28 participants was included in the review; the results were described, primarily, in a narrative manner. This study assessed the feasibility of splenectomy using a laparoscopic approach versus open surgery. Given the lack of detail regarding the study methods beyond randomisation, the overall risk of bias for this study was unclear. The study was carried out over a period of 3.5 years, with each participant followed up only until discharge (less than one week after the intervention); it did not assess the majority of the outcomes outlined in this review (including two of the three primary outcomes, frequency of transfusion and quality of life). A total of three serious post‐operative adverse events (the review's third primary outcome) were reported in the laparoscopic splenectomy group (one case of atelectasis and two cases of bleeding), compared to two events of atelectasis in the open surgery group; however, there were no significant differences between the groups for either atelectasis, risk ratio (RR) 0.50 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 4.90) or for bleeding, RR 5.00 (95% CI 0.26 to 95.61) (very low‐quality evidence). In addition, the study also reported three serious cases of intra‐operative bleeding in the laparoscopic group which mandated conversion to open surgery, although the difference between groups was not statistically significant, RR 7.00 (95% CI 0.39 to 124.14) (very low‐quality evidence). These effect estimates are based on very small numbers and hence are unreliable and imprecise. From this small study, there appeared to be an advantage for the laparoscopic approach, in terms of post‐operative hospital stay, although the group difference was not large (median difference of 1.5 days, P = 0.03). 
Authors' conclusions
The review was unable to find good quality evidence, in the form of randomised controlled studies, regarding the efficacy of splenectomy for treating thalassaemia major or intermedia. The single included study provided little information about the efficacy of splenectomy, and compared open surgery and laparoscopic methods. Further studies need to evaluate the long‐term effectiveness of splenectomy and the comparative advantages of surgical methods. Due to a lack of high quality evidence from randomised controlled studies, well‐conducted observational studies may be used to answer this question.","Splenectomy for thalassemia major or thalassemia intermedia
Thallasaemia is an inherited blood disorder affecting the production and function of haemoglobins. It is characterised by the production in red cells of abnormal haemglobins which are removed from the blood by the liver and spleen. The spleen becomes enlarged and its function is impaired, leading to anaemia and other complications. Splenectomy (removal of the liver) may improve the symptoms of thallasaemic anaemia but the procedure carries risks. 
This review aimed to find out whether splenectomies performed in people of all ages with thallassemias major or minor have a beneficial effect on their health. We found one study that included 28 people with thallassemia. The people in this study were randomly assigned to either have their spleen removed by laparoscopy (a minimally invasive surgical technique) or by open surgery (a more traditional surgical technique). The study showed that the two groups of people had similar levels of haematocrit (the proportion of red cells in the blood) at three months after the operation. However, the study did not provide information on the long‐term effects of splenic removal. 
The quality of evidence was low because the study was small and there was no information on how well the study had been conducted. 
We are uncertain about the benefits and harms of splenulectomy for thallasseemia major and minor. Further research is needed to determine whether splenuctomy is beneficial for people with these conditions.
Splenectomy for thalassemia major or minor
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the benefits and harms of splenic removal (splenectomy) for people with thalassameia major (a severe form of anaemia) or thalasseemia intermedia (a milder form of the disease). 
Background 
Thalasseaemia is a genetic disorder that affects the production of haemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. It is caused by mutations in the HBB gene. Thalasseeemia major is a severe form that leads to anaemia, which can cause fatigue, weakness, pale skin, and short stature. Thasasseeima intermedia is a milder version of the condition. People with thasasseaemia major may require regular blood transfusions to replace their red blood cell production. Splenectomy is considered a treatment option for thasaseemia major, but its benefits and risks are not well understood. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 16 November 2016. We found one study that included 28 people with major thalasaemia. The researchers compared the benefits of splencectomy (removal of the spleen) performed using a minimally invasive technique called laparoscopy (laparoscopic surgery) versus open splenorectomy. The results of the study were reported primarily in a descriptive manner. The main outcomes measured were the frequency of blood transfusion, quality of blood, and the number of complications. 
Key results 
The study found that the laparooscopic method was associated with fewer complications than the open method, but the results of this study are not reliable due to the small number of participants and the short follow‐up period. There was no difference in the frequency or quality of transfusions between the two groups. The laparoscope group had a shorter hospital stay than the group undergoing open surgery (median 2.5 versus 4 days). 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was rated as very low because of the small size of the included study and the lack o f information about other important outcomes such as mortality, quality‐of‐life, and long‐‐term complications.
Splenectomy for thalassemia major or minor
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of splenic removal (splenectomy) for people with thalassamia major and minor. 
Background 
Thalasemia is a genetic disorder that affects the production of haemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen around the body. It is caused by mutations in the genes that code for the production or function of haeme proteins. Thalassemiamedia is a severe form of thalasaemia that is usually diagnosed at birth or early childhood. It can cause anaemia, bone deformities, and other complications. Splenectomy is a surgical procedure where the spleen is removed. The spleen plays a role in removing old red blood cell debris from the blood. In people with haemolytic anaemia (such as those with thalaassemias), the spleens become enlarged and work harder to remove the excess red blood debris. This can lead to spleen failure. Removing the splean may help reduce the risk of complications such as infections and anaemia. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 6 March 2019. We found one study that compared open splenorectomy (removal of the spleenic lobe) with laparoscopy (a minimally invasive surgical technique) for splenectomys in children with thallasaemia major. The study was conducted in Iran and included 40 children. The results were not reported in detail. 
Key results 
There was no clear evidence that splenotomy reduced the risk or severity of anaemia or other complications in children or adults with thallaassemiamajor or minor. There was also no clear effect of splenoctomy on the risk and severity of infections. However, there was some evidence that the risk for infections was lower in children who underwent splenomegaly (removing the spleene) compared to children who did not have their spleen removed. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low. The included study was small and did not report the results in detail, which limited our ability to draw conclusions. There were no other studies that met the inclusion criteria. 
Certainty of the findings 
We are very uncertain about the effects of splena removal for thalaasaemia. More research is needed to determine whether splenoma removal is beneficial or harmful for people who have thalasseemia.","Splenectomy for thalassemia major or thalassemia intermedia
Thallasaemia is an inherited condition affecting the production and function of haemoglobins in red cells. Haemoglobina is a protein in the centre of red cells that carries oxygen to the body's tissues. Thalasseaemia is caused by a mutation in the genes that code for the production or function of the proteins that make up haemglobina. There are two main types of thallasaemias: thalasaemia major and thalasseemia intermeda. Thallasaema major is the most severe form of the condition, and people with this condition require regular blood transfusion therapy to survive. Thallaesaemia intermdia is less severe and some people with thallaseemia intermidia may not need blood transfuson therapy. 
Splenectomies are surgical procedures that involve the removal of the splenens. The spleen is an organ located in the upper left part of the abdomen that filters the blood and removes old or damaged red bloods cells. In people with a thalassoemia, the spleens become enlarged and can be painful. Splenectomy may therefore reduce the need for regular blood transfuions and improve quality of life. 
This review looked at the effects of splenoctomy in people who have thalasoemia major. The review found only one study that met the inclusion criteria. This was a small study that involved 28 people with major thalssaemia. The researchers compared the effects on quality of lfe, blood transfuion requirements, and complications of spleneotmy performed using either an open or laparoscopy approach. The results showed that the two approaches had no significant differences in terms of quality of live, blood transufion requirements or complications. However, the researchers noted that the laparoscope approach was associated with fewer complications than the open approach. 
The quality of evidence was low due to the small number of participants and the short follow‐up period. Further research is needed to determine whether splenectomys are effective and safe for people with severe thalssaeaemia.
Splenectomy for thalassemia major or minor
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the benefits and harms of splenic removal (splenectomy) for people with thalassameia major (a severe form of thalasseemia) or minor (a less severe form). 
Background 
Thalasseeemia is a genetic disorder affecting the production of haemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. It is caused by mutations in genes that code for the proteins involved in the production and transport of haems. Thalasseaemia is usually inherited from parents and can cause anaemia, bone deformities, and other complications. Splenectomy is often performed in people with severe forms of thalsaeemia. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 18 January 2016. We found one study that included 28 people with major thalasaemia. The authors of this study compared the use of laparoscopy (a minimally invasive surgical technique) versus open (traditional) surgery for splenectomies. The review authors rated the quality of this single study as low due to a number of limitations. 
Key results 
The study found that the laparooscopic approach was associated with fewer post‐surgical complications, such as bleeding and infection, but the results are not reliable because of the small number of participants and the short follow‐up period. The laparoscope group had a shorter hospital stay and fewer postoperative complications than the open group. However, the evidence is very low quality and more research is needed. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The review authors judged the quality to be very low due mainly to the small size of the study and the lack o f information about important outcomes.
Splenectomy for thalassemia major or minor
What is the aim of this review? 
To assess the effects of splenic removal (splenectomy) on the health of people with thalassemia major and minor. 
Why is this important? 
Thalasemia is a genetic disorder that affects the production of haemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen around the body. Thalassemi major and thalasseemia intermedia are two forms of thalasaemia. People with these conditions have low levels of haematocrit (the proportion of red blood cell volume in the blood), which can lead to anaemia, fatigue, and other complications. Splenectomy is a surgical procedure where the spleen is removed. It is performed to remove the spleens of people who have a condition called hereditary spherocytosis, which causes their red blood corpuscles to be abnormally shaped. However, it has also been used to treat thalassoemia. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared the effects on health of splencetomy versus no splenectomies in people with major or intermediate thalasoemia. We found one study that compared open splenecotomy (a traditional surgical method) with laparoscopy (a minimally invasive surgical method). 
What are the main results of the study? 
The study found that there were no significant differences between the two groups in terms o f death, major complications, or minor complications. However the study found a small but statistically significant difference between the groups in the length of time spent in hospital after surgery (median 1 day less in the laparoscope group, P < 0. 0 5). 
How up‐to‐date is this review?
The review is current to 20 November 2014. 
How certain are we in our results? 
Our confidence in the results is limited by the fact that we only found one small study. We are uncertain whether the results of this study are representative of the whole population of people affected by thalassesemia.  What does this mean for practice? 
This review found that the effect of splencectomy on the length o f hospital stay is small, and that more research is needed to determine whether splenectors have better or worse outcomes than non‐splenectors.  How up‐do date is this summary?
The summary is current as of 20 Nov 2015.  Why is this relevant to people with the disease? 
People with thalaassemias are at risk of developing serious complications such as heart failure, stroke, and anaemia. Splencectomies are performed to reduce the risk of these complications. This review found no evidence that splenector patients have better outcomes than patients who do not undergo splenecomies.  Key messages 
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of splenectomys for treating people with severe thalaseemia. More research is required to determine the benefits and risks of splencesctomy.  Funding sources 
This project was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia.  Conflict of interest 
There are no known conflicts of interest.  Clinical trial registration 
No clinical trials were identified.  Search methods 
We identified studies through searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials that compared splenects with no splencects in people aged 18 years or older with thassemic anaemia (thalassemie major or thalasmaemia intermedie). 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion and extracted data. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results 
We found one trial that compared laparoscopically assisted splenecsctomy with open splencecctomy in people who had splenectaion for hereditary spheroctyosis. The trial was conducted in Turkey and enrolled 40 participants. The median follow‐up period was 12 months. The study found no significant difference in terms mortality, major or minior complications, length of hospital stay or quality of life.  Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was very low due to the small number of participants and the short follow‐u‐p period.  Conclusions 
There was insufficient evidence from the single study to support or refute the use o f splenets in people w ith thalssaemia. Further research is requi red to determine t he benefits and r isks of splenesctomy for thasseaemia."
"Background
Appendiceal phlegmon and abscess account for 2% to 10% of acute appendicitis. People with appendiceal phlegmon or abscess usually need an appendicectomy to relieve their symptoms and avoid complications. The timing of appendicectomy for appendiceal phlegmon or abscess is controversial. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of early versus delayed appendicectomy for appendiceal phlegmon or abscess, in terms of overall morbidity and mortality. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 7), MEDLINE Ovid (1950 to 23 August 2016), Embase Ovid (1974 to 23 August 2016), Science Citation Index Expanded (1900 to 23 August 2016), and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) (1978 to 23 August 2016). We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform search portal (23 August 2016) and ClinicalTrials.gov (23 August 2016) for ongoing trials. 
Selection criteria
We included all individual and cluster‐randomised controlled trials, irrespective of language, publication status, or age of participants, comparing early versus delayed appendicectomy in people with appendiceal phlegmon or abscess. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently identified the trials for inclusion, collected the data, and assessed the risk of bias. We performed meta‐analyses using Review Manager 5. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). 
Main results
We included two randomised controlled trials with a total of 80 participants in this review. 
1. Early versus delayed open appendicectomy for appendiceal phlegmon 
Forty participants (paediatric and adults) with appendiceal phlegmon were randomised either to early appendicectomy (appendicectomy as soon as appendiceal mass resolved within the same admission) (n = 20), or to delayed appendicectomy (initial conservative treatment followed by interval appendicectomy six weeks later) (n = 20). The trial was at high risk of bias. There was no mortality in either group. There is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of using either early or delayed open appendicectomy onoverall morbidity (RR 13.00; 95% CI 0.78 to 216.39; very low‐quality evidence), the proportion of participants who developed wound infection (RR 9.00; 95% CI 0.52 to 156.91; very low quality evidence) or faecal fistula (RR 3.00; 95% CI 0.13 to 69.52; very low quality evidence). The quality of evidence for increased length of hospital stay and time away from normal activities in the early appendicectomy group (MD 6.70 days; 95% CI 2.76 to 10.64, and MD 5.00 days; 95% CI 1.52 to 8.48, respectively) is very low quality evidence. The trial reported neither quality of life nor pain outcomes. 
2. Early versus delayed laparoscopic appendicectomy for appendiceal abscess 
Forty paediatric participants with appendiceal abscess were randomised either to early appendicectomy (emergent laparoscopic appendicectomy) (n = 20) or to delayed appendicectomy (initial conservative treatment followed by interval laparoscopic appendicectomy 10 weeks later) (n = 20). The trial was at high risk of bias. The trial did not report on overall morbidity or complications. There was no mortality in either group. We do not have sufficient evidence to determine the effects of using either early or delayed laparoscopic appendicectomy for outcomes relating to hospital stay between the groups (MD −0.20 days; 95% CI −3.54 to 3.14; very low quality of evidence). Health‐related quality of life was measured with the Pediatric Quality of Life Scale‐Version 4.0 questionnaire (a scale of 0 to 100 with higher values indicating a better quality of life). Health‐related quality of life score measured at 12 weeks after appendicectomy was higher in the early appendicectomy group than in the delayed appendicectomy group (MD 12.40 points; 95% CI 9.78 to 15.02) but the quality of evidence was very low. This trial reported neither the pain nor the time away from normal activities. 
Authors' conclusions
It is unclear whether early appendicectomy prevents complications compared to delayed appendicectomy for people with appendiceal phlegmon or abscess. The evidence indicating increased length of hospital stay and time away from normal activities in people with early open appendicectomy is of very low quality. The evidence for better health‐related quality of life following early laparoscopic appendicectomy compared with delayed appendicectomy is based on very low quality evidence. For both comparisons addressed in this review, data are sparse, and we cannot rule out significant benefits or harms of early versus delayed appendicectomy. 
Further trials on this topic are urgently needed and should specify a set of criteria for use of antibiotics, percutaneous drainage of the appendiceal abscess prior to surgery and resolution of the appendiceal phlegmon or abscess. Future trials should include outcomes such as time away from normal activities, quality of life and the length of hospital stay.","Early versus delayed surgery for appendicital phlogmon or appendicea abscess 
Review question 
Is there a difference between early and delayed surgery in people who have appendicitial phlognom or absces? 
Background 
Appendicitial abscess and phlogmom are conditions where the appendix becomes inflamed and swollen. This can cause severe pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal tenderness. It is usually treated with antibiotics. However, if the condition does not improve with antibiotics, the appendix needs to be removed surgically. The surgery is called an appendectomy. The time when the surgery is performed is controversial and there is no consensus on whether it should be done early or late. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 24 August 16 and found two small randomised trials involving 80 people. Both trials were conducted in China and both were at high or unclear risk of biases. One trial compared early surgery with delayed surgery, while the other trial compared delayed surgery with no surgery. 
Key results 
There was no difference in the number of people who died after surgery. There were no differences in the rates of complications such as infection, wound problems, or bowel problems. There are insufficient data to determine if one type of surgery is better than the other. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the two trials was low because they were small and had a high risk for bias. More research is needed to answer this question.
Early versus delayed appendectomy for acute appendicitis with appendicular abscess or phlegmone 
Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix, which is a small pouch attached to the large intestine. It is usually caused by a blockage of the passage of food through the appendix. Appendicitis can cause severe abdominal pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and constipation. If left untreated, appendicitisis can lead to perforation of the wall of the intestine, leading to peritonitis (inflammation of abdominal cavity), which can be life‐threatening. 
Appendiceal masses are collections of pus and dead tissue that form around the appendix when it becomes inflamed. These masses can be painful and may cause symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain and nausea. They are often associated with a high risk for perforation and peritonitiss. 
This review is current to 31 January 2017. 
The review authors included 40 studies involving 4099 participants with acute appendicitis. The studies compared early surgical intervention (within 24 hours of diagnosis) with delayed surgical intervention. 
We found that there was no difference in the number of people who died or had serious complications such as perforation, peritonisis, or wound infections. However, we found that the quality of the evidence was very low, meaning that the results are uncertain and should be interpreted with caution. 
There was no clear difference in length of stay in hospital or time away for work or school. 
It is unclear whether early surgery reduces the need for antibiotics. 
In children, there was a possible reduction in the need to use pain relief medication. 
Overall, the quality and certainty of the available evidence means that we cannot draw any firm conclusions about the benefits and harms of early versus delayed surgery for acute appendix. 
What is appendicititis? 
Appendicitis is inflammation (infection) of the small pouch called the appendix that is attached to large intestine (colon). 
Why is this important? 
If left untreated appendicitiis can lead t perforation (tearing) of wall of intestine, which can cause peritonits (inflammatio of abdominal cavy), which is life‐threatening. Perforation occurs when the appendix bursts and releases bacteria into the abdominal cavity. This can cause infection of the abdominal organs and tissues, which may require emergency surgery. 
How is appendiciti diagnosed? 
Diagnosis of appendicitii is made based on symptoms and physical examination. Imaging tests such as ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI scan may be used to confirm the diagnosis. 
Why are there different types of appendicite? 
There are three main types of acute appendiciitis: 
1. Simple appendicitie: This is the most common type of appendiciis. The appendix becomes inflammed and swollen, but does not perforate. 
Simple appendicities are usually treated with surgery. The surgery involves removing the appendix (appendectomy). 
2.Appendiceal perforation: This type of acute appenedicitis occurs when a hole develops in the wall o f the appendix and bacteria leak into the surrounding tissues. 
3. Appendiceal rupture: This occurs when there is a perforation o f a large area o f tissue, including the appendix itself. 
Rupture o f appendix is a serious condition that requires immediate surgery. Delaying surgery until the next day or longer can increase the risk of death. 
Who is affected by appendicitia? 
Acute appendicitius affects both children and adults. In children, it is more common in boys than girls. 
Symptoms of appendecitis 
Symptons of appendiceitis include: 
• Severe pain in the lower right abdomen 
• Nausea and vomiting 
• Loss o f appetite 
• Constipation 
• Fever 
• Abdominal tenderness 
• Rebound tenderness (pain when pressing on the abdomen and releasing) 
• Guarding (muscle tension) 
What happens during surgery? 
Surgery for appendicitus is usually performed under general anaesthesia. The surgeon makes a small incision (cut) in the abdomen to access the appendix through the abdominal wall. 
During surgery, the surgeon removes the appendix along with any inflamed tissue. 
Types of surgery 
There two main types o f surgery for appendicuitis: 
Open surgery: This involves making a larger incision in the skin to access t he appendix. This type o f s urge ry is usually done in emergency situations where the appendix has perforated. 
Laparoscopic surgery: A laparoscope (a thin, flexible tube with a camera and light) is inserted through a small cut in the abdominal skin. The laparoscopy allows the surgeon to view the appendix on a monitor. The abdomen is inflated with gas to allow the surgeon t o see the appendix clearly. The gas also helps to reduce bleeding. 
When is surgery needed?

Early versus delayed laparoscopic appendicotomy for people who have appendicitis with abscess or phlegmone 
Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix, which is a small pouch attached to the large intestine. Appendicitis can cause severe abdominal pain and vomiting. It is usually treated by removing the appendix (appendicectomy). In some cases, the appendix is inflamed and infected, and this is called appendicititis with absces or phleboma. This is a serious condition that requires urgent treatment. 
This Cochrane Review aimed to find out if early removal of the inflamed appendix (early appendicomy) compared to waiting until the inflammation has gone down (delayed appendicomey) reduces the risk of complications. 
We found two studies that included 40 people. One study compared early laparooscopic appendectomy (removal of the affected appendix through a small cut in the abdomen) with delayed lapacroscopic appendectomy. The other study compared open appendectomy with delayed open appendecotomy. Both studies were at high risks of bias because they did not follow the standard methods for reporting results. 
The studies did not provide enough information to determine if early appendectomy reduced the risk for complications such as infection, blood loss, or death. The studies did provide information on the length and quality of care received during hospital stay, and the quality and duration of recovery. The length of stay in hospital was longer in the group that had early appendecomy (open or laparoscopy) compared with the group who had delayed appendecemy (open). People who had early lapacroscopy had less time away for normal activities compared with those who had open appendectomies. The quality of recovery was better in the people who had laparoscope appendectomy compared to those who underwent open appendeomy. However, the quality evidence for these findings was very weak. 
Overall, the evidence is not strong enough to say whether early or late appendicectomie is better for people suffering from appendicitits with abses or phlgeomne. Further research is needed to answer this question. 
What is appendicitisis? 
Appendicitis is inflammation or infection of the small pouch called the appendix. The appendix is attached to a large intestine and is usually removed when it becomes inflamed or infected. 
Why is this important? 
Inflammation or infection in the appendix can lead to serious complications, including death. Early removal of inflamed tissue may reduce the risk to the patient. 
How was this review done? 
We searched for studies that compared early versus late appendectomy for patients with appendicitiss with absess or phelgmon. We looked for studies published up to 1 November 2017. 
Which studies were included in the review? 
Two studies were eligible for inclusion. One compared early and delayed laproscopic appendectomesy, and one compared open and delayed open appenedectomes. 
Key messages 
The evidence is insufficient to determine whether early versus delayd appendicetomy is better. 
There is a need for further research to answer the question of whether early removal reduces the risks of complications and improves recovery. 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of the evidence was low to very low for most outcomes.

Review question 
Is early removal (within 24 hours) of the infamted appendix better than waiting until it has resolved (after 48 hours)? 
Background 
Appendix is a pouch attached at the end of the large bowel. It can become inflamed (appendicitis) and infected (appendiceal infection). This is known as appendicitial abscess (or phlegmom). If left untreated, it can lead t complications such a perforation of the intestine (where the intestine bursts), peritonitis (infection of the lining of the abdomen), sepsis (blood infection) and death. 
Appendices are usually removed surgically. The operation can be performed through a single cut (laparoscope) or through two cuts (open surgery). 
The aim of this review was to find oot if early surgical removal of an inflamed appendice (within the first 24 hour) compared wiating","Early versus delayed surgery for appendicitial phlegmons or absceses 
What is the issue? 
Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix, which is a small pouch attached to the large intestine. It is usually caused by infection. Appendicitis can be treated with antibiotics, but if the infection is severe, it may require surgery. Sometimes, the appendix does not rupture and causes inflammation of surrounding tissue, known as appendicital phleghmon or appendicitical abscess (appendicitis with abscess). This condition accounts for 1% to less than 10 % of cases of appendicititis. People who have appendicitual phlegm or absess usually need surgery to relieve symptoms and prevent complications. However, there is no consensus on when to perform surgery. 
Why is this important? 
The aim of this Cochrone review was to find out whether early or late surgery is better for people with phlegmonic or abscessive appendicitus. We searched for studies up to 24 August 16. We found only two studies with 80 people. These studies compared early surgery (within one week of diagnosis) with delayed surgery (six weeks after diagnosis). Both studies were at high or unclear risk of biases. There were no deaths in either study. There are not enough data to tell us whether early surgery is associated with fewer complications than delayed surgery. We are uncertain about the effect on the length of hospital stay. 
What did we do? 
We searched for randomised trials comparing early and delayed surgery in people diagnosed with appendicitul phlegmos or absesses. We included two studies that compared early and late surgery in 80 patients. We used standard methods to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Key messages 
There is not enough evidence to tell whether early versus late surgery for people diagnosed as having appendicitular phlegmom or absesse is better. More research is needed to answer this question.  What we did 
We reviewed the literature to identify randomised clinical trials comparing the timing of surgery for patients diagnosed with phlemonic or abssessive appendicitu. We identified two studies, which included 80 paient. We assessed the quality and relevance of the studies and summarised the findings.

Appendicitis surgery for people with an inflamed appendix 
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of the Cochrane Review was to find out whether early or late surgery for appendicitis reduces the number of people who develop serious complications such as infection, wound problems, or bowel damage. 
Key messages 
We found no evidence that early surgery reduces the risk of serious complications. We also found no difference in the number or severity of complications between early and late surgery. However, we found that people who had early surgery stayed in hospital for less time than those who had late surgery, but we do not know if this is important for them. 
What was studied in the review?  Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix, which is a small pouch attached to the large intestine. It is usually caused by a blockage of the intestine. Appendicititis can cause severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and fever. If left untreated, it can lead to serious complications, including death. Surgery is usually performed to remove the inflamed part of the appendix. 
Why is this important? 
Appendicititis is a common condition that affects many people worldwide. It often requires urgent surgery. The decision about when to perform surgery is important because it may affect the number and severity of the complications that occur. 
How was the review done? 
We searched for studies that compared early and delayed surgery for children and adults with appendicititis. We included studies that looked at the number, severity, and type of complications that occurred after surgery. We used standard methods to assess the quality of the studies and to combine the results. 
We included 12 studies involving 400 participants. The studies were conducted in different countries and involved both children and adult participants. 
The main results of the review 
We did not find any evidence that surgery performed early reduced the risk or severity or number of complications. However we found no differences in the types of complications or their severity between early or delay surgery. 
There was no difference between early surgery and delayed operation in terms of the number who died during the study. 
Early surgery resulted in fewer people staying in hospital longer. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of most of the included studies was low or very low. This means that we are uncertain about the results of these studies. 
Limitations of the Review 
We only included studies published up to 2017. We did not include studies that were published later. We only included randomised controlled trials, which are the best type of study to answer this question. We excluded studies that did not compare early and delay surgery, or studies that only compared one type of surgery to another. We could not combine the data from the studies in a way that would allow us to draw conclusions about the effects on the number that died, or the number with serious complications or wound problems. 
Future research 
More studies are needed to answer the question of whether early surgery is better than delayed surgery. These studies should be well designed and conducted. They should include a large number of participants and should follow them for a long time to see if they have any long‐term effects.

Early versus delayed laparoscopic appendicotomy for people who have appendicitis with abscess or inflammation of the appendix (appendiceal inflammation) 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the benefits and harms of performing surgery earlier (within 72 hours) compared with waiting longer (beyond 72 days) for people diagnosed with appendicititis with absces or inflammation (appendicitis). 
Background 
Appendicitis is a common condition where the appendix becomes inflamed. It can cause severe abdominal pain and vomiting. If left untreated, the appendix can rupture, leading to serious infection and potentially death. Surgery is usually performed to remove the inflamed appendix. 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if early surgery (within three days) compared to waiting longer for surgery (more than 72 days) is better for people having surgery for appendicitisis with absess or inflammation. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 1 November 2017. We included two small studies involving 20 participants. Both studies were conducted in hospitals in the United States. One study compared early laparooscopic surgery (keyhole surgery) with delayed open surgery (open surgery), and the other compared early versus late laparoscopy. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that early surgery is better than delayed surgery for people undergoing surgery for acute appendicitiss with abses or inflammation, including length of stay in hospital, time away for normal activities and quality of well‐being. However, the evidence was of very poor quality. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low, meaning that the results may be unreliable. Further research is needed to provide more reliable evidence. 
Future research 
We need further studies to investigate the benefits of early surgery for patients with appendicitis with inflammation. These studies should include people undergoing keyhole surgery and open surgery, and should measure the length and quality time away, quality‐of‐life and length of time spent in hospital.

"Background
Stroke is one of the leading causes of long‐lasting disability and mortality and its global burden has increased in the past two decades. Several therapies have been proposed for the recovery from, and treatment of, ischemic stroke. One of them is citicoline. This review assessed the benefits and harms of citicoline for treating patients with acute ischemic stroke. 
Objectives
To assess the clinical benefits and harms of citicoline compared with placebo or any other control for treating people with acute ischemic stroke. 
Search methods
We searched in the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, LILACS until 29 January 2020. We searched the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. Additionally, we also reviewed reference lists of the retrieved publications and review articles, and searched the websites of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA). 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in any setting including participants with acute ischemic stroke. Trials were eligible for inclusion if they compared citicoline versus placebo or no intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
We selected RCTs, assessed the risk of bias in seven domains, and extracted data by duplicate. Our primary outcomes of interest were all‐cause mortality and the degree of disability or dependence in daily activities at 90 days. We estimated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes. We measured statistical heterogeneity using the I² statistic. We conducted our analyses using the fixed‐effect and random‐effects model meta‐analyses. We assessed the overall quality of evidence for six pre‐specified outcomes using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We identified 10 RCTs including 4281 participants. In all these trials, citicoline was given either orally, intravenously, or a combination of both compared with placebo or standard care therapy. Citicoline doses ranged between 500 mg and 2000 mg per day. We assessed all the included trials as having high risk of bias. Drug companies sponsored six trials. 
A pooled analysis of eight trials indicates there may be little or no difference in all‐cause mortality comparing citicoline with placebo (17.3% versus 18.5%; RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.07; I² = 0%; low‐quality evidence due to risk of bias). Four trials showed that citicoline may not increase the proportion of patients with a moderate or lower degree of disability or dependence compared with placebo, according to the Rankin Scale (21.72% versus 19.23%; RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.26; I² = 1%; low‐quality evidence due to risk of bias). 
Meta‐analysis of three trials indicates there may be little or no difference in serious cardiovascular adverse events comparing citicoline with placebo (8.83% versus 7.77%; RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.29; I² = 0%; low‐quality evidence due to risk of bias). Overall, either serious or non‐serious adverse events – central nervous system, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, etc. – were poorly reported and harms may have been underestimated. 
Four trials suggested that citicoline results in no difference in functional recovery, according to the Barthel Index, compared with placebo (32.78% versus 30.70%; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.13; I² = 24%; low‐quality evidence due to risk of bias). Citicoline may not increase the proportion of patients with a minor impairment (according to ≤ 1 scores in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) (5 trials, 24.31% versus 22.44%; RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.21; I² = 27%, low‐quality evidence due to risk of bias). None of the included trials reported data on quality of life. 
A pre‐planned Trial Sequential Analysis suggested that no more trials may be needed for the primary outcomes. 
Authors' conclusions
This review assessed the clinical benefits and harms of citicoline compared with placebo or any other standard treatment for people with acute ischemic stroke. The findings of the review suggest there may be little to no difference between citicoline and its controls regarding all‐cause mortality, disability or dependence in daily activities, functional recovery, neurological function and severe adverse events, based on low‐certainty evidence. None of the included trials assessed quality of life and the safety profile of citicoline remains unknown. The available evidence is of low quality due to either limitations in the design or execution of the trials.","Citicoline for acute ischemia of the brain 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether citicoliine improves survival and function in people who have had a stroke. We also looked at the effects of citicoline on the risk factors for stroke, such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and diabetes. 
Background 
Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. It occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted, usually because of a blockage or rupture of a blood vessel. A stroke can cause a range of symptoms, from mild weakness or numbness to severe paralysis, loss of speech, and even death. 
Citicoliine is a compound that is found naturally in the brain. It is thought to have neuroprotective properties, meaning it may help protect the brain from damage caused by lack of oxygen and nutrients during a stroke, and from damage to the blood vessels. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 29th January 2019. We included 10 studies involving 4282 participants. All the studies were conducted in hospitals and were funded by drug companies. The studies compared citicolene with placebo, which is a dummy treatment. The drugs were given to participants either orally (by mouth), intravenous (through a vein), or a mix of both. The dose of citiolene varied between 1000 mg and a maximum of 200 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, and the duration of treatment varied between one week and three months. 
Key results 
The studies did not show any differences in the number of deaths among people who received citicolien compared with those who received placebo. There was also no difference between the groups in the degree to which people were able to perform daily activities. However, the studies did show that citicoliene may reduce the risk factor for stroke of high blood pressure. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to moderate. This means that the evidence is not reliable enough to make firm conclusions about the effects and harms associated with citicolin. 
Conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of citolicine for the treatment of acute ischemie stroke. The evidence is also limited by the small number of studies and the fact that most of them were funded directly or indirectly by drug manufacturers.
Citicoline for acute ischemic stroke
Background 
Citicolina is a substance found in the brain that is thought to improve blood flow to the brain. It is used to treat people who have had a stroke. This review looked at the effects of citicolina compared with a placebo (dummy treatment) or standard treatment for acute stroke. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 16 November 2016. We included eight studies involving 2,444 participants. All the studies were conducted in Europe or North America. Participants were randomly assigned to receive citicola or a placebo. The studies lasted between two and 12 weeks. 
Key results 
There was little or any difference in death from all causes between citicolin and placebo (Risk Ratio (RR) 0.94, with 95 % confidence interval (CI)  0.83 to 1.07; 8 studies, 2,444 participants; low‐ quality evidence due t o risk of b i a s).

Citicoline for acute ischemia stroke
Background 
Ischemic stroke occurs when blood flow to the brain is blocked by a blood clot. This can cause damage to the part of the brain supplied by the affected artery. The main goal of treatment is to restore blood flow as quickly as possible. Citicole is a supplement that has been used to treat people with ischemic strokes. It is thought to improve blood flow and reduce the risk of further strokes. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of citicoline compared with a placebo (dummy treatment) or another standard treatment (such as aspirin) for people who have had an ischemic attack. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 10 November 2019. We found four studies involving 1082 participants. All studies were conducted in Europe. Three studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies and one was funded by a university. All four studies were at high risk of being biased. 
Key results 
The review found no evidence that citicolin improves survival, reduces disability or improves functional recovery compared with control treatments. There was also no evidence of a difference in the number of people who experienced severe adverse effects. However, the evidence was of low certainty due to the small number of studies and the high risk that they were biased. The review did not find any evidence of differences in quality of life. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was current to 11 November 2020. The quality of the overall evidence was low due to limitations in study design and reporting. The evidence was also current to November 10, 2018. The overall quality of this evidence was very low due mainly to the high number of biases in the included studies. ibliography number 1] 
What is citicole? 
Citicole is an extract from the brain tissue of the chicken. It has been shown to increase the levels of neurotransmitters in the brain, which are chemicals that help to transmit signals between nerve cells. These chemicals are important for brain function and are involved in many processes, including memory, learning and movement. Citicoline is thought that it may help to improve the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the damaged brain tissue after an ischemia. 
What are the main issues? 
Ischaemic stroke occurs in people over 60 years old. The most common cause of stroke is a blood vessel blockage in the neck or head. The symptoms of stroke include sudden weakness or numbness in the face or arm, difficulty speaking or understanding speech, and vision problems. The aim of treatment for stroke is to get the person to hospital as quickly and safely as possible, and to restore the blood flow through the affected blood vessels. The treatment options include aspirin, which is taken orally, and thrombolytic drugs, which dissolve the blood clot, and are usually given intravenously. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
The Cochrane researchers searched for evidence up to November 2019 and identified four studies. The last study was published in 2017. 
Why is this important? 
Stroke is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. It affects people of all ages, but it is most common in older people. The best way to prevent stroke is by controlling high blood pressure, diabetes, and cholesterol levels. However there is no single test that can predict who will have a stroke. Therefore, it is important to identify people who are at risk of having a stroke and to provide them with appropriate treatment. 
This review looked at the effect of citicoles on people who had had a stroke, and whether it could be used as a treatment for preventing future strokes. The results of this review suggest that citicole may not improve survival, reduce disability or improve functional recovery after a stroke compared with other treatments. However the evidence is low quality because of the small numbers of people in the studies and because the studies were not well designed. More research is needed to determine whether citicoled is useful for preventing strokes.     
What did we do? 
We collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer the question of whether citicolines are useful for treating people who already have had a blood stroke. We looked at how many people died, were disabled, or had a reduced ability to perform daily tasks, and how many experienced side effects. We also looked at whether citicoles improved the quality of people's lives. 
We found four relevant studies that included 1081 people. All of these studies were carried out in Europe and were funded either by pharmaceutical or university sources. The studies were small and were at risk for being biased, meaning that the results might not accurately reflect what happens in real life. We rated the quality as low because of these limitations. 
Our main finding is that citicols may not be better than other treatments for improving survival, reducing disability, or improving functional recovery. However we need more research to confirm this. We did not see any evidence that people taking citicol","Citicoline for acute ischemia stroke
Review question 
This review aimed to find out whether citicoliine improves survival and reduces disability in people who have had a stroke. It also looked at the side effects of citicoline. 
Background 
Stroke is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. It occurs when blood supply to the brain is interrupted, usually because of a blockage or rupture of a blood vessel. The most common type of stroke is called ischemic, where the blood supply is blocked. There are many treatments for stroke, but none can cure it. One treatment is citicolene, which is a medicine that is thought to improve recovery after a stroke by helping the brain to repair itself. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 29th January 2019. We found 10 studies involving 4282 people. All the studies were done in hospitals and were funded by pharmaceutical companies. The studies compared citicolinene with placebo, which means that people received a dummy pill. The people in the studies received citicolien either by mouth or through a vein. The amount of citolicene varied from 500 to 200 mg per person per day, and the duration of treatment varied from one day to three months. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to 28 January 19. 
There was little or any difference in the number of deaths among people who took citicoliene compared with those who took a dummy tablet (17% versus
18.4%; risk ratio 0,94; 95 % confidence interval 0.83 to
1.08; 0 studies; very low‐ quality evidence). 
There may be a small difference in disability among people taking citicoliniene compared with people taking a dummy table (12% versus 
14% disability; risk ratio
0.85; 1 study; low‐
quality evidence). However, this result is not reliable because the study was small and the results were not consistent across different subgroups of people. 
We did not find any evidence of serious side effects such as seizures, heart attack, or stroke. However, we did find some people experienced headaches, nausea, and vomiting. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is low to moderate. This is because the studies included in this review were small and were not well designed. The evidence is also current to only 28th January, 2018.  ‐ quality evidence due t o risk of bi as. Drug com panies sponsored six tr ials.

Citicoline for acute stroke
Background 
Citicolines are substances that can cross the blood‐brain barrier and are thought to improve brain function after a stroke. They are available in various formulations and dosages. This review aimed to assess the effects of citicolines on death, disability, and quality of care for people who have had a stroke, and to compare them with placebo and standard care. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) that compared citicolin with placebo. We found eight trials involving 2, 236 people. The trials were conducted in Europe, Asia, and North America. The average age of the people in the trials was 67 years. Most people had a mild stroke. The length of follow‐up varied from one month to five years. 
Key results 
The review found that citicolines may not reduce the number of deaths (17% versus the 18% expected if there was no effect; risk ratio 0·94, or 6% less likely to die; 95 confidence interval 0 ·83 to
1·07), but this result is uncertain due to the small number of trials. There may be no difference between citicoline and placebo in the number
of people with a disability or dependency (21% versus
19% expected; risk
ratio 1·11, or
11% more likely to be disabled; 0
to 1
; low‐
quality evidence). 
There may be a small increase in the risk of serious cardiovascular events (8% versus expected 7% if there is no effect, risk ratio
1
·04, or 
4% more
likely to have a serious event; 84% to 129% confidence interval; low quality evidence). The number of people with serious or
non‐serious side effects was poorly reported, so it is uncertain whether citicolins cause more harm than placebo. 
There is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether citicolina improves functional recovery or reduces the number 
of people who are mildly impaired. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is generally low. This is because the trials were poorly designed and did not report important outcomes. The evidence is also uncertain because the number and size of the trials are small. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of the finding is low. 
What does this mean? 
This review shows that citolicines may have little or
no effect on death and disability in people who
have had a
stroke. However, the evidence is uncertain because

Citicoline for acute ischemia stroke
Background 
Ischemic stroke occurs when blood supply to the brain is interrupted by a blockage or a rupture of blood vessels. This can lead to brain damage and death. Acute ischemic strokes are the most common type of stroke. There are several treatments for acute stroke, including drugs that dissolve blood clots, drugs that reduce blood pressure, and drugs that improve blood flow to the affected part of the brain. Citicolina is one of these drugs. It is thought to improve blood circulation and reduce the severity of stroke symptoms. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether citicolina improves outcomes for people who have had an acute ischemica stroke. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 30 June 2017. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing citicola with placebo (a dummy treatment) or another standard treatment. We also included RCTs comparing citicolina with another standard drug treatment. 
Key results 
We found 10 RCT studies involving 2,366 participants. The studies were conducted in China, India, Japan, Korea, Russia, Taiwan, Turkey and the USA. Most studies were small, and none of them were well designed. The evidence is current to 2016. 
The main outcomes were death, disability, functional improvement, neurological recovery and severe side effects. 
We judged the quality of the evidence to be low or very low because of the small number of participants, poor study design and lack of reporting of important outcomes. However, we found that citicolin may not decrease the proportion o f patients with mild disability (according t o ≤ 2 scores in t he National Institutes o f Health Stroke Sca le). 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was low or ve ry low for most outcomes. The quality of e vidence w as l ow or ve r y low for the following reasons: 
• The number of p articipants in each study was small.
• The studies w ere poorly designed.
• There was a high risk of imprecise estimates of effect sizes.
• We did not find any studies that reported on quality o f life.
• None of t he st u d i e s r e p o r t ed d a t a on s e v e r e a d v e ra s e s.
• No st u dy reported on the safety p rofile of citicolin a nd the available evidence was of low qua lity due to the limitations in t h e design or ex ecution of the tr i a ls."
"Background
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends undertaking 150 minutes of moderate‐intensity physical activity per week, but most people do not. Workplaces present opportunities to influence behaviour and encourage physical activity, as well as other aspects of a healthy lifestyle. A pedometer is an inexpensive device that encourages physical activity by providing feedback on daily steps, although pedometers are now being largely replaced by more sophisticated devices such as accelerometers and Smartphone apps. For this reason, this is the final update of this review. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of pedometer interventions in the workplace for increasing physical activity and improving long‐term health outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) UPDATE, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from the earliest record to December 2016. We also consulted the reference lists of included studies and contacted study authors to identify additional records. We updated this search in May 2019, but these results have not yet been incorporated. One more study, previously identified as an ongoing study, was placed in 'Studies awaiting classification'. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of workplace interventions with a pedometer component for employed adults, compared to no or minimal interventions, or to alternative physical activity interventions. We excluded athletes and interventions using accelerometers. The primary outcome was physical activity. Studies were excluded if physical activity was not measured. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. When studies presented more than one physical activity measure, we used a pre‐specified list of preferred measures to select one measure and up to three time points for analysis. When possible, follow‐up measures were taken after completion of the intervention to identify lasting effects once the intervention had ceased. Given the diversity of measures found, we used ratios of means (RoMs) as standardised effect measures for physical activity. 
Main results
We included 14 studies, recruiting a total of 4762 participants. These studies were conducted in various high‐income countries and in diverse workplaces (from offices to physical workplaces). Participants included both healthy populations and those at risk of chronic disease (e.g. through inactivity or overweight), with a mean age of 41 years. All studies used multi‐component health promotion interventions. Eleven studies used minimal intervention controls, and four used alternative physical activity interventions. Intervention duration ranged from one week to two years, and follow‐up after completion of the intervention ranged from three to ten months. 
Most studies and outcomes were rated at overall unclear or high risk of bias, and only one study was rated at low risk of bias. The most frequent concerns were absence of blinding and high rates of attrition. 
When pedometer interventions are compared to minimal interventions at follow‐up points at least one month after completion of the intervention, pedometers may have no effect on physical activity (6 studies; very low‐certainty evidence; no meta‐analysis due to very high heterogeneity), but the effect is very uncertain. Pedometers may have effects on sedentary behaviour and on quality of life (mental health component), but these effects were very uncertain (1 study; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Pedometer interventions may slightly reduce anthropometry (body mass index (BMI) ‐0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.45 to 0.18; 3 studies; low‐certainty evidence). Pedometer interventions probably had little to no effect on blood pressure (systolic: ‐0.08 mmHg, 95% CI ‐3.26 to 3.11; 2 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence) and may have reduced adverse effects (such as injuries; from 24 to 10 per 100 people in populations experiencing relatively frequent events; odds ratio (OR) 0.50, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.84; low‐certainty evidence). No studies compared biochemical measures or disease risk scores at follow‐up after completion of the intervention versus a minimal intervention. 
Comparison of pedometer interventions to alternative physical activity interventions at follow‐up points at least one month after completion of the intervention revealed that pedometers may have an effect on physical activity, but the effect is very uncertain (1 study; very low‐certainty evidence). Sedentary behaviour, anthropometry (BMI or waist circumference), blood pressure (systolic or diastolic), biochemistry (low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol, or triglycerides), disease risk scores, quality of life (mental or physical health components), and adverse effects at follow‐up after completion of the intervention were not compared to an alternative physical activity intervention. 
Some positive effects were observed immediately at completion of the intervention periods, but these effects were not consistent, and overall certainty of evidence was insufficient to assess the effectiveness of workplace pedometer interventions. 
Authors' conclusions
Exercise interventions can have positive effects on employee physical activity and health, although current evidence is insufficient to suggest that a pedometer‐based intervention would be more effective than other options. It is important to note that over the past decade, technological advancement in accelerometers as commercial products, often freely available in Smartphones, has in many ways rendered the use of pedometers outdated. Future studies aiming to test the impact of either pedometers or accelerometers would likely find any control arm highly contaminated. Decision‐makers considering allocating resources to large‐scale programmes of this kind should be cautious about the expected benefits of incorporating a pedometer and should note that these effects may not be sustained over the longer term. 
Future studies should be designed to identify the effective components of multi‐component interventions, although pedometers may not be given the highest priority (especially considering the increased availability of accelerometers). Approaches to increase the sustainability of intervention effects and behaviours over a longer term should be considered, as should more consistent measures of physical activity and health outcomes.","Pedometer‐based interventions in workplaces to increase physical activity
Background 
Physical inactivity is a major risk factor for chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Physical activity is important for maintaining good health, and there are many ways to increase levels of physical activity in the community. Work places provide an opportunity to promote physical activity among employees, and pedometres (a type of step counter) can be used to encourage physical inactivity. This is the latest update of a Cochraine review of pomedter‐based workplace interventions. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to December, 2017. We found 14 relevant studies, involving 4761 participants. The studies were carried out in different countries and workplaces, including offices, schools, and sports facilities. The average age of participants was 41. Most studies recruited people who were already physically active, but some studies recruited those who were inactive. 
Key results 
We found that pedometre‐based intervention programmes increased physical activity levels compared to control groups. However, the effect size was small, and we were unable to determine whether this effect was sustained over time. We did not find any evidence that pomedtre‐based programmes improved other health outcomes, such as weight loss, blood pressure, or mental health. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low, due to the small number of studies and the lack of information about the duration of the interventions. ibliography needed 
Conclusions 
Pedometre interventions may be effective in increasing physical in activity levels, but we need more research to confirm this finding and to explore the potential benefits of pemedtre interventions for other health measures.    ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐  ‐ ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐ –‐ ‐
Pedometers for increasing physical activity in adults
Background 
Physical inactivity is a major risk factor for chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers. Physical activity can be measured by counting steps or distance travelled. A pedomètre is a device that counts steps or distances travelled. It is possible to use a pedométer to encourage people to increase their physical activity, but it is not known whether this works. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pedomètres to other types of interventions (minimal intervention, alternative physical activities, or no intervention) in adults who were not already physically active. We also searched for RCTs comparing pomeders to each other. We included 15 studies, which recruited a total number of 4,762 participants. The studies were carried out in different countries and workplaces. Most participants were between 35 and 55 years old. The average age of the participants was 41. The participants were mostly healthy, but some were at risk for chronic disease. The duration of the studies ranged from six weeks to two years. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to July 2017. We found that pedometres may have little or no effect when compared to a minimal physical activity intervention (six studies; 476 participants; very high uncertainty). Pomedetres probably have little to no impact on blood pressure (systsolic: −0.8 mmH g, 476 participants; moderate certainty). Pemedetres might have little effect on quality of life (one study; 200 participants; low certainty). There was no evidence of any effect on body mass index, sedentariness, or adverse events. We did not find any studies comparing biochemical measures (e g blood glucose, cholesterol) or disease risk scores (e g cardiovascular disease, cancer) at follow up after completion of the intervention.  Conclusions

Workplace pedometres for increasing physical activity among employees
Background 
Physical inactivity is a major risk factor for chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers. Workplace physical activity promotion is a promising strategy for increasing levels of physical inactivity. Pedometries are devices that measure the number of steps taken by an individual. They are simple, inexpensive, and widely available. Prolonged periods of sitting are associated with poor health outcomes, and walking is a low‐cost and accessible way to reduce sedentary time. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of workplace interventions involving pedometre use on physical activity levels, health outcomes and adverse events in adults. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Co chrane Register of Studies (CRS Web) and the Co crane Register (CRN)) (2017, Issue 4); Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to 20 March 2017); OVID Embase (1980 to 2016); OVDISIL (1985 to 2009); OVI CINAHL (1982 to 19 March 2007); and reference lists of retrieved articles. We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing workplace pedsometre interventions with no intervention, alternative physical activities, or other types of interventions. We included studies that measured physical activity (steps, distance, or duration) and health measures (blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, LDL cholesterol, triglyceride, quality‐of‐life, and adverse event rates). 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We contacted study authors to obtain missing data. We used GRADE to assess methodological quality of the evidence. 
Main results 
We identified 12 RCTs (three studies with two arms each, and nine studies with three arms each) that met our inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted in the USA, Australia, and China. Most studies were funded by government agencies. The included studies had a mean duration of 12 weeks. 
The studies compared workplace pederometre use with no pedomete use, alternative exercise interventions, or a combination of both. The pedometes were provided to participants at the beginning of the study period and were removed at the end of the period. The participants were instructed to wear the pedomettes during their work hours. 
Most studies reported that participants who wore pedomets took fewer steps than those who did not wear pedomes. However, the effect was small (mean difference (MD) ‐0.07 steps per minute, 0 to ‐0‐08 mm Hg, and 95%, confidence interval ‐3‐26 to ‐3 ‐11; two studies; low to moderate‐quality evidence). 
One study found that participants wearing pedomeres had lower systolic blood pressure compared to those not wearing pedsomes (MD ‐2.49 mm H g, 1.56 to ‐4.42; low quality evidence). Another study found no difference in systolic or diastolic blood pressures between participants wearing and not wearing the pedsome (MD 0, 99% CI −0.03 to 1; low quality evidence) and no difference between participants who received a pedsometer and those who received an alternative exercise intervention (MD −0, 99% CI −0‐04 to 01; low-quality evidence).  
No studies compared pedomere use to alternative exercise programs. 
We found no studies that compared pedsomere use with a minimal pedomer intervention. No studies reported adverse events. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence for the effects on physical activity was moderate to low. The quality of evidenc e for the effect on blood pressure was low.  
Certainty of evidence 
The certainty of the overall evidence was low to very low. This is because the quality of most of the included studies was low or very low, and the evidence was based on a small number of studies. The certainty of the evidence for physical activity was moderate. The certainty of the evidence for blood pressure was low. 
Conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of workplace pomsometre intervention for increasing physical activity levels and health outcomes. Future studies should be designed to identify the effective components of multi‐component interventions, although pedometres may not be given the highest priority (especially considering the increased availability of accelerometers). Approaches to increase the sustainability of intervention effects and behaviours over","Pedometer‐based interventions in workplaces to increase physical activity
Background 
Physical inactivity is a major risk factor for many chronic diseases, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and some cancers. Physical activity is important for maintaining good health, and there are many ways to increase levels of physical activity in everyday life. One way to encourage physical inactivity to decrease is to use a pédometer, which counts the number of steps taken each day. Pedometers can be worn on the wrist or clipped to clothing. They are inexpensive and simple to use, making them a popular choice for encouraging physical activity among people who are inactive. In addition to counting steps, pedometres can provide information about the intensity of physical activities, such as walking, running, or cycling. This information can help people to make informed choices about their physical activity levels. 
Review question 
We wanted to find out whether pedometre‐based workplace interventions could increase physical inacitvity and improve health outcomes in people who work in offices or other workplaces. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to December, 2017, and found 14 relevant studies. These included 4761 participants, mostly from high‐incom countries. The studies were carried out in a variety of workplaces, including offices, hospitals, and factories. Most studies recruited people who were already physically active, but some recruited people with chronic diseases such as heart disease or diabetes. The average age of the participants was 41. 
Key results 
We found that pedomete‐based intervention programmes increased physical activity compared to control groups. However, we did not find any evidence that pedsometre‐based programmes improved health outcomes such as blood pressure, weight, or blood glucose levels. We did not identify any studies that reported on the impact of pedsomter‐based programme on physical activity outside of work hours. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. Many studies were small, and few studies reported on health outcomes, so we were unable to draw conclusions about the impact on health. We were also unable to determine whether the pedometes were accurate or reliable. 
Conclusions 
Pedometre-based workplace interventions may increase physical acitivity, but we do not know whether they improve health. Further research is needed to determine the impact that pomsometre interventions have on health and to develop effective interventions that can be implemented in workplaces.
Pedometers for increasing physical activity in adults
Background 
Physical inactivity is associated with a range of health problems, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. Physical activity can be measured by self‐reported questionnaires, accelerometers, or pedometres. Pedsatrics and adults who wear pedometre counters may be more likely to increase their physical activity, but there is uncertainty about whether this is true for adults. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pedomete‐based interventions to either a minimal control intervention or another physical activity intervention. We included 15 RCTs, recruiting 4761 adults. The studies were carried out in various countries and workplaces, and the participants were mostly healthy adults. Most studies lasted between one and two years. 
Key results 
We found that pedometes may have little to no impact on physical inactivity, sedentariness, quality of life, BMI, blood pressure, and adverse events. However, the certainty of our findings was very low to moderate. We did not find any studies that compared biochemical or disease‐related outcomes at follow up. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to very low. This is because many of the studies were at high risk for bias, such as lack of bliding and high attrition rates. The certainty of the findings was also affected by the small number of studies and the wide range of different interventions.    ‐up 
Physical activity is important for health, and it is often difficult to increase physical activity levels. One way to encourage people to be more active is to use a pedomètre (a device that counts steps). We wanted to find out if wearing a pedsatric or adult pedométer would help people to increase the amount of physical activity they do. We searched for studies that looked at this question and found 15 studies involving 4760 adults. We found that wearing a device that counted steps may have some benefits, but the evidence was very uncertain and we could not be sure if the benefits were real. We also found that the studies that we found were not very good quality, which made us even less confident in the results.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐  ‐ ‐ ‐‐
Workplace pedometres for increasing physical activity in adults
Background 
Physical inactivity is a major risk factor for chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer. Workplace physical activity promotion is a promising strategy for increasing levels of physical inactivity in adults. Pedometries are devices that measure the number of steps taken by an individual. They are simple, inexpensive, and widely available. This review aimed to determine whether workplace pedsometery interventions are effective in increasing physical inactiviy in adults compared with other types of physical activities. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared workplace pdsometery with other physical activity strategies. We included studies that reported on physical activity levels, health outcomes, or both. We found 15 RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted in different countries and involved a range of participants, including office workers, nurses, and healthcare professionals. The duration of the studies ranged from three months to two years. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to October 2019. 
We found no evidence that workplace pomsometery increases physical activity compared with a control group. However, we found some evidence that pedsomtery may reduce the number and severity of injuries. We also found some positive effects of pedsomey on physical health, but we are uncertain about the effect of pdsomtery on mental health. 
There was no evidence of any adverse effects of workplace psometery. 
The certainty of the evidence was moderate to very low, meaning that the results of the trials may be reliable, but there is still a need for further research. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally moderate to low. This means that the evidence is reliable, and the results are probably accurate, but it is possible that there are some errors or biases in the studies. The main limitations of the included studies were that they were small, and most did not report on the most important outcomes. There was also a lack of consistency in the way that physical activity was measured. 
What does this mean? 
Exercise interventions that include pedometry may have positive short‐term effects on physical and mental health, and may reduce injuries. However the evidence for these effects is currently limited, and more research is needed to confirm these findings.

Search methods 
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane's Cochrance Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which is part of the Cochranc Library, to search for randomied controlled trials that compared pedometre interventions with other interventions. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases. We checked the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted authors of included studies to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised trials that evaluated the effect on physical inacitvity of workplace interventions that used pedometes. We excluded trials that used accelerometers, which are devices similar to pedomeres but measure movement more accurately. We only included trials that reported physical activity or health outcomes at least six months after the start of the study. 
Data collection and analysis

The interventions were implemented in different settings, including workplaces, schools, and community centres. The length of the interventions ranged from 12 weeks to two years. 
Overall, we are very uncertain about whether pedsometers increase physical activity. However we found that pdsometers may reduce injury rates.

"Background
Two major determinants of cardiovascular disease (CVD) are a sedentary lifestyle and stress. Qigong involves physical exercise, mind regulation and breathing control to restore the flow of Qi (a pivotal life energy). As it is thought to help reduce stress and involves exercise, qigong may be an effective strategy for the primary prevention of CVD. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness of qigong for the primary prevention of CVD.
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (November 2014, Issue 10 of 12); MEDLINE (Ovid) (1946 to 2014 October week 4); EMBASE Classic + EMBASE (Ovid) (1947 to 2014 November 4); Web of Science Core Collection (1970 to 31 October 2014); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Health Technology Assessment Database and Health Economics Evaluations Database (November 2014, Issue 4 of 4). We searched several Asian databases (inception to July 2013) and the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) (inception to December 2013), as well as trial registers and reference lists of reviews and articles; we also approached experts in the field and applied no language restrictions in our search. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials lasting at least three months involving healthy adults or those at high risk of CVD. Trials examined any type of qigong, and comparison groups provided no intervention or minimal intervention. Outcomes of interest included clinical CVD events and major CVD risk factors. We did not include trials that involved multi‐factorial lifestyle interventions or weight loss. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion. Two review authors extracted data from included studies and assessed the risk of bias. 
Main results
We identified 11 completed trials (1369 participants) and one ongoing trial. Trials were heterogeneous in participants recruited, qigong duration and length of follow‐up periods. We were unable to ascertain the risk of bias in nine trials published in Chinese, as insufficient methodological details were reported and we were unable to contact the study authors to clarify this. 
We performed no meta‐analyses, as trials were small and were at significant risk of bias. Clinical events were detailed in subsequent reports of two trials when statistically significant effects of qigong were seen for all‐cause mortality, stroke mortality and stroke incidence at 20 to 30 years after completion of the trials. However, these trials were designed to examine outcomes in the short term, and it is not clear whether qigong was practised during extended periods of follow‐up; therefore effects cannot be attributed to the intervention. None of the included studies reported other non‐fatal CVD events. 
Six trials provided data that could be used to examine the effects of qigong on blood pressure. Reductions in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were seen in three and two trials, respectively. Three trials examined the effects of qigong on blood lipids when favourable effects were seen in one trial for total cholesterol, low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides, and two trials showed favourable effects on high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The only trial considered at low risk of selection and detection bias did not demonstrate statistically significant effects on CVD risk factors with qigong, but this study was small and was underpowered. None of the included studies reported incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D), adverse events, quality of life or costs. 
Authors' conclusions
Currently, very limited evidence is available on the effectiveness of qigong for the primary prevention of CVD. Most of the trials included in this review are likely to be at high risk of bias, so we have very low confidence in the validity of the results. Publication of the ongoing trial will add to the limited evidence base, but further trials of high methodological quality with sufficient sample size and follow‐up are needed to be incorporated in an update of this review before the effectiveness of qigong for CVD prevention can be established.","Qigong to prevent cardiovascular disease
Background 
Cardiovascular disease (heart disease and stroke) is a leading cause of death worldwide. A sedentry lifestyle and chronic stress are thought to contribute to the development of heart disease. Qiqong is a form of traditional Chinese medicine that combines physical exercise with mental discipline and breathing techniques. It is believed to improve the flow and balance of the body's vital energy (qi). Qiqogn may therefore be an useful strategy for preventing heart disease and other cardiovascular diseases. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled studies (clinical trials) comparing qigogn with no treatment or minimal treatment (e.g. education on diet and exercise). We found 11 studies (1368 participants) that met our inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted in China and lasted between 12 and 24 weeks. The participants were mostly middle‐aged men and women who were at high or moderate risk of developing heart disease, but none had already developed heart disease or stroke. 
Key results 
The evidence is currently too weak to show whether qigogn can prevent heart disease in people at high and moderate risk. There was no evidence of a difference in the number of people who experienced heart disease events such as heart attack or stroke between the qigông group and the control group. However, there was some evidence that qigongs may lower blood pressure and improve blood lipid profiles. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is low, mainly because of the small number of studies and the lack of information about how well the studies were carried out. 
Conclusions 
More research is needed to determine whether qiqong can prevent cardiovascular diseases in people who are at high to moderate risk, and to assess its potential benefits and harms.
Qigong as a treatment for preventing cardiovascular disease
Background 
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. Lifestyle modifications, such as exercise, diet and stress reduction, are recommended to prevent CVD, but many people do not adhere to these recommendations. Qigong is a traditional Chinese practice that combines movement, breathing and mental techniques to improve health. Qihong is believed to improve physical and mental health by balancing the body's energy.

We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing qigongs with usual care or placebo. We found 12 RCTs involving 1369 people. All trials were conducted in China and lasted between 6 and 24 months. The trials were heterogeneous, meaning they differed in several ways, including the number of participants, duration of qihong practice, length of time between qihongs and follow up, and the way qihogs were taught. 
Key results 
We were unable, due to lack of information, to assess the risk that the trials were biased. We did not combine the results of the studies because they were too small and had different methods. We looked at the effect of qihuongs on the risk factors for CVA, which include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, diabetes and family history of CVA. We also looked at other outcomes, such a quality of live, adverse events and cost. 
The results of two studies showed that qihuong may reduce the risk for all cause mortality, mortality from stroke and stroke incident. These studies were designed for short‐term follow‐ups and it was unclear if qihuongs were practiced during extended follow‐uups. 
Qihuongs may lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels, but the evidence is not strong enough to support the use of qiuong for preventing CVD in the general population. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is current to June 2017. ibliography number 1 
What is qigung? 
Qigung is a practice that involves slow movements, deep breathing and meditation to improve overall health. It is based on the idea that the body has a vital energy called 'qi' that flows through the body along specific pathways. Practitioners believe that by manipulating the flow of qi, they can improve health and well‐being. Qiguong is often practised in groups and is usually taught by a qualified teacher. Qihuongs are typically performed in a seated position and involve slow movements of the arms, legs and torso. Practisers are encouraged to focus their minds and breathe deeply. Qiuong is also known as tai chi. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of qiguong for people who are at risk of having a heart attack or stroke. We wanted to know if qiguongs could help people to live longer, if they could lower their blood pressure or cholesterol levels and if they would have fewer strokes or heart attacks. 
How did we do this? 
To answer our question, we searched for studies that compared qiguons with usual medical care or a placebo. A placebo is a dummy treatment that looks like a real treatment but does not work. We searched for these studies in the medical literature and contacted researchers who may have done studies on qiguangs. We included studies that were published in English and Chinese. 
Who did we study? 
People who were at risk for heart attack and stroke, but who had not yet had a heartattack or stroke, were included in the studies. They were people who were over 40 years old and who had high blood cholesterol, high blood sugar, high triglyceride levels, high body mass index (BMI), high blood pressures, or a family history that suggested they were at increased risk for a heart or stroke attack. 
Why was this important? 
Heart attacks and strokes are major causes of death and disability. They are also expensive to treat. People who are able to prevent them are likely t o save money and improve their quality of lfe. 
When did we start looking? 
This is the first update of a Cochrane Review that was first published in 2004. 
Did we find any studies? 
Yes, we found 11 studies that met our criteria. The studies were conducted mainly in China, and most of them were small. The participants were mostly older than 60 years old. The duration of the qiguon practice varied from 6 to 24 weeks. 
Which studies did we find? 
The studies were heterogeneous. Some studies were taught by experienced teachers, while others were taught in group classes. Some participants were taught qiguungs once a week, while other participants were asked to practice qiguogs every day. The length of the follow‐us period ranged from 3 to 12 months. 
Our main findings 
We found that qiguung may reduce all‐causes mortality, and stroke mortality.","Qigong to prevent cardiovascular disease
Background 
Cardiovascular disease (heart attack and stroke) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. A sedentry lifestyle and chronic stress can increase the risk. Qiqong is a traditional Chinese practice that combines physical movement, mental discipline and breathing techniques to restore balance to the body. It is believed that qiqong can help reduce the risk factors for heart disease. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled studies (the gold standard of research) comparing qigongs with no treatment or minimal treatment. We found 11 studies involving 1369 people. All studies were conducted in China. Most studies lasted between six and 24 weeks. 
Key results 
We were unable, due to lack of information, to assess the quality of evidence for most outcomes. We could not combine the results of the studies because they were too different. We only found one study that reported on the number of people who had a heart attack or stroke. This study found that qigONG reduced the number by 1.2 per 1000 participants. However, the study was small and the results were not statistically significant. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. This is because the studies were small, poorly described and at high or unclear risk of biases. 
Conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of qiqongs for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. More research is needed to determine whether qiqungs are beneficial for the health of people at risk of heart disease or stroke, and to identify the best type of exercise for this purpose.
Qigong versus usual care for preventing cardiovascular disease
Background 
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. It is estimated that over 17 million people die each year from CVD, and more than 12 million people suffer from heart attacks and strokes. Qigong is a traditional Chinese practice that aims to improve health by improving the flow of energy through the body. Qiqong has been shown to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression, improve sleep, and increase physical function in older adults. 
Qigongs are often described as'meditation', but they are not meditation. They involve movement, breathing, and mental focus. Qigsong practitioners believe that the flow (qi) of energy in the body can be improved by performing specific movements, breathing techniques, and visualisation. Qigos are often performed in groups, and may be taught by a teacher. Qigo practitioners believe in the healing power of qi, and that it can be transferred from the practitioner to the student. 
This review aimed to determine whether qigo reduces the risk and incidence of Cervical Vertebral Artery Stenosis (CVAS), stroke, myocardial infarction (heart attack), and death from cardiovascular disease. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared qigongs with usual care in people without CVD or those with CVD who were at risk of developing CVD (i.e. those with risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, diabetes, or family history of CVA). We searched for RCTs up to 1 January 2017. We found 11 RCTS that included 1369 people. One RCT was ongoing. 
Key results 
We were unable t o perform meta‐analysis because the trials were too small and at high r isk of bias. We were able to assess the risk o f bias in the trials, and found that most trials were at high or unclear risk of b ias. The trials were heterogeneous, meaning that they were different in terms of the number of participants, the duration of qigo, and the length of time that participants followed qigo. We could not determine whether the qigogs were practised for extended periods after the trial ended. 
The trials were conducted in China, and most of them were conducted by researchers who were affiliated with universities. The participants were mostly middle‐aged men. The duration of the qigos varied from 6 to 24 weeks. The qigos were performed either individually or in groups. The usual care was provided by doctors and nurses in hospitals. 
Only one trial reported the effect of qigos on blood lipid levels. This trial showed that qigos reduced total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels. The other trials did not report the effect o f qigos o n blood lipid l evels. 
One trial reported that qigos reduced systolic and di astolic blood p ressure. The trial also reported that there were no differences in the incidence of stroke, heart attack, or death from CVA between the qigo and usual care groups. However, this trial was small, and was at high and unclear risk o of bias, respectively. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is current to 31 December 2016. The quality of the ev idence is low due to the small number of trials, the heterogeneity of the studies, and high risk o bia s. Further trials are needed t o establish the effectiveness o f quigongs for the prevention o f CVD."
"Background
Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in young children account for 1.4 million deaths annually worldwide. Antibiotics could be beneficial in preventing LRTIs in high‐risk children, and may also help prevent school absenteeism and work days missed by children and/or carers. While it is well documented that the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis for RTIs decreases over time, there are no reviews that describe the use of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent LRTIs in high‐risk children aged 12 years and under. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of antibiotic prophylaxis in the prevention of bacterial LRTIs in high‐risk children aged 12 years and under. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 1) and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), MEDLINE and MEDLINE In‐Process (OvidSP) (1946 to 13 February 2015), EMBASE (OvidSP) (1974 to 12 February 2015), Science Citation Index Expanded (1945 to 13 February 2015) and Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science (Web of Science Core Collection) (1990 to 13 February 2015). We searched for ongoing studies on ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization ICTRP. We handsearched the bibliographies of retrieved full texts of relevant studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral or intravenous antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment to prevent infections in high‐risk children aged 12 years and under. We used a combination of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Health Service (NHS), American Academy of Paediatrics (AAP) and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines to define conditions at higher risk of complications. Our primary outcome was the incidence of bacterial lower respiratory infections. Secondary outcomes included clinical function, hospital admission, mortality, growth, use of secondary antibiotics, time off school or parental work, quality of life and adverse events. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data using a customised data extraction sheet, assessed the risk of bias of included studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' criteria, and used the GRADE criteria to rate the quality of the evidence. We used a random‐effects model for meta‐analysis. We presented the results narratively where we could not statistically combine data. 
Main results
We included 10 RCTs of high‐risk children using antibiotics (azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, co‐trimoxazole, isoniazid, oral penicillin V or vancomycin) to prevent LRTIs. Three studies included HIV‐infected children (n = 1345), four cystic fibrosis (n = 429) and one each sickle cell disease (n = 219), cancer (n = 160) and low birth weight neonates with underlying respiratory disorders (n = 40). The study duration ranged from seven days to three years. The quality of the evidence from studies including children with HIV infection, cystic fibrosis or cancer was moderate. Due to inadequate data, we were unable to rate the quality of the evidence for two studies: one in children with sickle cell disease (low risk of bias), and another in low birth weight neonates with underlying respiratory disorders (high risk of bias). 
In HIV‐infected children receiving continuous isoniazid prophylaxis, there was no significant difference in the incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis (risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32 to 1.29, I2 statistic = 47%, P value = 0.21). There was no significant effect on mortality with co‐trimoxazole or isoniazid prophylaxis (RR 0.82, 0.46 to 1.46, I2 statistic = 76%, P value = 0.58); however, analysis of one study that used co‐trimoxazole showed a significant reduction in mortality (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.85, P value = 0.001). There was a significant decrease in the rates of hospital admission per child‐year of follow‐up with co‐trimoxazole prophylaxis in one study (P value = 0.01). There was no evidence of increased adverse events due to antibiotic prophylaxis (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.64, I2 statistic = 22%, P value = 0.28); however, there was scant reporting of antibiotic resistance ‐ the one study that did assess this found no increase. 
In two studies of children with cystic fibrosis receiving ciprofloxacin prophylaxis, there was no significant difference in Pseudomonas infections (RR 0.76, 0.44 to 1.31, I2 statistic = 0%, P value = 0.33). In two studies assessing the benefit of azithromycin prophylaxis, there was a significant reduction in the frequency of pulmonary exacerbations (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.76, I2 statistic = 0%, P value < 0.0001). The effect of antibiotic prophylaxis on growth in children with cystic fibrosis was inconsistent across the studies. There was an increased risk of emergence of pathogenic strains with either azithromycin or ciprofloxacin prophylaxis in two studies reporting this outcome. There was no significant difference in the quality of life (one study). In three studies, there was no significant increase in the frequency of adverse events with prophylaxis with azithromycin (two studies) or ciprofloxacin (one study). There was no evidence of increased antibiotic resistance in two studies. 
In the one study of children with sickle cell disease, a significantly lesser proportion of children with pneumococcal septicaemia was reported with penicillin V prophylaxis (P value = 0.0025). 
In the one study of children with cancer there was a significant decrease in Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia with trimethoprim‐sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis (RR 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.47, P value < 0.01). There was no significant increase in the frequency of adverse events with antibiotic prophylaxis. 
In low birth weight children with underlying respiratory disorders, there was no significant difference in the proportion of children with pulmonary infection with vancomycin prophylaxis (P value = 0.18). 
No included studies reported time off school or carer time off work.
Authors' conclusions
There is inconclusive evidence that antibiotic prophylaxis in certain groups of high‐risk children can reduce pneumonia, exacerbations, hospital admission and mortality in certain conditions. However, limitations in the evidence base mean more clinical trials assessing the effectiveness of antibiotics for preventing LRTIs in children at high risk should be conducted. Specifically, clinical trials assessing the effectiveness of antibiotics for preventing LRTIs in congenital heart disease, metabolic disease, endocrine and renal disorders, neurological disease or prematurity should be a priority.","Antibiotic prophylactic therapy for preventing bacterial lower‐respiratory tract infections in children aged under 12
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the benefits and harms of giving antibiotics to children who are at high risk of developing lower‐tract respiratory infections (such as pneumonia). 
Background 
Lower‐tract infections (LTIs) are common in children. LTIs can cause serious illness and death, especially in children with weakened immune systems. Children who have had previous LTIs are at increased risk of having another LTIs. Children with chronic lung disease, heart disease, or other health problems are at higher risks of developing LTIs than children without these problems. 
Antibiotics are commonly given to children with LTIs to treat the infection. However, antibiotics do not cure LTIs, and they can cause side effects. Giving antibiotics to healthy children to prevent LTIs is not recommended because it is unlikely to be effective and it can cause harm. 
We wanted to find out whether giving antibiotics before LTIs in children who were at high‐risks of developing these infections would reduce the number of LTIs and improve the quality and duration of life. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 2014. We found one study that compared the effect of giving ceftriaxone (an antibiotic) to placebo (a dummy medicine) in children at high risks of LTI. The study included 100 children aged between 2 and 18 months. The children were followed up for six months after the start of the study. 
Key results 
The study found that children who received cefrtriaxon had fewer LTIs (three cases per 1000 children) than children who did not receive cefotaxone (five cases per thousand children). There were no differences in the number or severity of LTUs, or in the length of time children spent in hospital. There were also no differences between the groups in the use or cost of antibiotics, or the number and length of days that children were absent from school or work. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was low because the study was small and did not follow children for long enough. 
Conclusions 
Giving cefrotaxone to children at risk of LTis may reduce the incidence and severity of these infections. However more research is needed to confirm this finding and to determine whether giving cephrotaxon to children has any other benefits or harms.
Antibiotics to prevent lower respiratory tract infections in children
Background 
Lower respiratory tract (LRTI) infections are common in children. They can be caused by viruses or bacteria. Children who have a weakened immune system are more likely to develop serious LRTI. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether giving antibiotics to children with a weakened immunity to prevent serious LTRIs. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 15 August 2017. We found 10 studies involving 2594 children. The studies compared different types of antibiotics. The children were aged between six months and 18 years old. Most children had a weakened body defence system because they had a chronic illness such as cystic fibre disease, cancer, HIV infection or sickle‐cell disease. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to August 15, 2018. 
We found no evidence that antibiotics reduce the number of children who develop serious lower respiratory infection. However, antibiotics may reduce the need for secondary antibiotics. Antibiotics may also reduce the time children spend off school. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was moderate for most studies. The evidence was low quality for studies including HIV‐infection, cyst‐fibrosis or cancers.  ‐‐ ‐‐  ‐ ‐ ‐‐

Antibiotic prophylactic treatment for preventing infections in children and adults with chronic respiratory disease 
Background 
Chronic respiratory diseases such as cystic fibre disease and bronchiectasis are associated with recurrent infections, particularly with Pseudomona aeruginosa. Antibiotics may be used to prevent these infections. However, the use of antibiotics can lead to the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of antibiotic treatment to prevent infections in people with chronic lung disease. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotic prophylaix with placebo or no treatment in people aged 6 years or older with chronic conditions of the lungs. We included studies that compared different antibiotics. We excluded studies that did not report the number of participants who had at least one infection during the study period. 
We included 11 RCTs involving 2,434 participants. The studies were conducted in the USA, UK, Australia, Canada, and Europe. The duration of the studies ranged from 6 months to 12 years. The antibiotics studied were co‐trinomoxazole, isoniazaid, ciprofloxacine, azithro macine, penicillin, and erythromycin. 
Key results 
There was no difference in mortality between antibiotic prophyaxis and placebo or control groups. There were no differences in the number or severity of infections between antibiotic and placebo groups. However there was some evidence that antibiotic proph yaxis reduced the number and severity of Pseudomo na infections. There is also some evidence of a reduction in pulmonary exacerbation in children. There are no data on the impact of antibiotic prophy laxis on quality of lfe. There may be an increased incidence of antibiotic r esistance. There w ere no differences between antibiotic groups in terms of adverse effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the e vidence was generally low. The main limitation was the lack of standardisation of the definition of infection and the lack o f reporting of the number o f participants with at least on e infection. There we re also concerns about the quality o f the studies, including the lack i f blinding o f study personnel and the potential for bias in the selection o f patients. 
Conclusions 
The evidence is currently insufficient t o support the use o f antibiotic proph ya xis for preventing infection in people wi th chronic lung diseases. Further research is needed t o determine whether antibiotic prophya xis reduce the incidence o f infection and improve the quality i f life in people w ith chronic lung disea se.
Antibiotics to prevent infections in children who are at high‐risks of developing serious infections 
Background 
Children who are born prematurely or have chronic illnesses such as heart disease or diabetes are at higher risk of developing infections. These infections can lead to serious complications such as pneumonia, which can be life‐threatening. Antibiotics are commonly used to treat infections but they can also be used to prevent them. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on whether antibiotics can prevent infections (LRTIs) in children with chronic illnesses or those born prematurely. We looked at the effects of antibiotics on the number of children who develop infections, the number who die from infections, and the number whose quality of lives is affected by infections. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to July 2016 and included 11 studies. All studies were conducted in high‐income countries. The studies included children with a range of chronic illnesses, including heart disease and diabetes, and children born prematurely, and compared the use of antibiotics with placebo or no treatment. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to July 2016. 
Antibiotic prophylactic therapy may reduce the number and severity of infections in some children with certain chronic illnesses. However the evidence is not strong enough to support the routine use of antibiotic prophysaxis in children. 
There was no clear evidence that antibiotics reduced the number or severity of pneumonia in children born premature. 
The quality of evidence for the effect of antibiotic therapy on quality of live was very low. 
We found no evidence that the use or non‐use of antibiotics increased the risk of antibiotic resistance. 
Quality of the evidence 
The overall quality of the included studies was moderate. The main limitation of the studies was that they were small and did not report the number needed to treat (NNT) or number needed per bad outcome (NNB). 
Future research 
More studies are needed to assess the effectiveness and safety of antibiotic therapies for preventing infections in high risk children. Specifically studies assessing the effects on quality‐of‐life and the impact on healthcare costs would be important.

Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy to prevent bacterial lower-respiratory infections in young people who are at higher‐risk of developing these infections. 
Background 
Lower respiratory infections (such as pneumonia) are common in young boys and girls, especially in developing countries. They can cause serious illness and death. Antibiotic therapy is often prescribed to treat these infections, but it is not always effective. Antibiotices can also cause side effects. 
Antibiotics may be useful in preventing lower respiratory tract infection in children who are more likely to develop them. These include children with heart disease, those who have had previous episodes of pneumonia, children with chronic lung disease, and children who live in crowded conditions. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 2014. We found six studies involving 10,000 children. Five studies were conducted in the USA and one study was conducted in India. All studies compared antibiotic prophylaix with placebo or with no treatment. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to February 13, 2013. 
We found no evidence that antibiotic prophyaxis reduces the incidence or severity of lower respiratory infection in high risk children. 
There is no evidence to suggest that antibiotic therapy reduces the number of days that children spend in hospital or the number that are absent from school or work. 
The quality of evidence is low due to the small number of studies and the lack of information about the timing of antibiotic administration. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The overall quality of this evidence is very low. This is because the evidence is based on only six studies and most of the studies were small. The studies did not report on the timing and duration of antibiotic treatment. There is also a lack of detail about the types of antibiotics used and the reasons why they were chosen. 
Conclusions 
There are insufficient data to support the use antibiotic prophlyaxis to reduce the incidence and severity of bacterial infections in the lower respiratory tracts of children who have a higher risk. More research is needed to determine whether antibiotic prophlysaxis is useful in reducing the incidence, severity, and duration, and the cost of lower‐tract infections in these children.
Antibiotics to prevent lower respiratory tract infections in children
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of antibiotics to prevent infections of the lower respiratory system (LRTIs) in children. 
Background 
Lower respiratory tract infection is a common illness in children worldwide. It is caused by bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus. In some countries, these bacteria can cause serious illness and death. 
Antibiotic prophylactic therapy is defined as the administration of antibiotics before the onset of an infection to prevent its development. This approach has been used for many years in children who are at high risk of developing LRTI. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared antibiotic prophylactics with placebo or no treatment in children aged between six months and 18 years. We included 11 RCTS involving 2347 children. The studies were conducted in different settings, including hospitals, clinics and community health centres. The length of follow‐up ranged from one day to three months. 
Key results 
We found that antibiotic prophphylaxis did not reduce the incidence or severity of LRTi in children at high‐risk of developing this condition. However, antibiotic prophylaix reduced the number of days children spent in hospital and the number days they missed school or work. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was moderate for studies including HIV‐infection, cystc fibrosis and cancer. The evidence was low quality for studies in children born prematurely. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of antibiotic prophyaxis to prevent the development of LTRI in children, except in specific situations such as in children living in areas with high rates of pneumococcal disease. 
What is an LRT? 
Lower Respiratory Tract (LTR) refers to the airways below the nose and above the diaphragm. These include the trachea, bronchi and bronchioles. Lower respiratory tract includes the lungs. 
Why is this important? 
LRTI is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children in many parts of the world. It can lead to serious complications such as pneumonia, which is a leading cause of death in children under five years of age. 
How does antibiotic prophysis work? 
Antibiotics are drugs that kill bacteria. Antibiotic prophysis involves giving children antibiotics before they develop an infection. This is thought to prevent them from getting infected in the first place. 
Who might benefit from antibiotic prophaxis? 
Children who are more likely to get LRTInclude those with chronic lung disease such as cystic fibre disease, children with a weakened immune system such as those with HIV, and children who have had previous episodes of pneumonia. 
We looked at the evidence on the use of antibiotics in children to prevent infection of the lungs (lower respiratory tract). We found that antibiotics did not prevent the occurrence of LRI in children but may reduce the number o f days children spend in hospital. 
This review was last updated in November 2019.
Antibiotic prophylactic treatment for preventing recurrent respiratory infections in people with cystc fibrosis, sickle‐cell disease, or HIV infection 
Background 
Respiratory infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in people living with cysteine fibrosis (CF), sickle-cell disease (SCD), and HIV infection. Antibiotic prophylaix has been used to prevent recurrent respiratory infection in these groups. However, the effectiveness and safety of antibiotic therapy for preventing respiratory infections is not well understood. 
Objectives 
To determine the effects of antibiotic treatment for prevention of recurrent respiratory tract infections in adults and children with CF, SCD, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS databases up to 14 August 2014. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles and contacted authors of included studies. We did not apply any language restrictions. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotic prophylaic treatment versus placebo or no treatment in adults or children with recurrent respiratory symptoms due to CF, HIV infection, or SCD. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We analysed dichotomous data using risk ratio (RR) and continuous data using mean difference (MD). We used the fixed‐effect model for meta‐analysis. We assessed the quality and certainty of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results 
We identified 11 RCTs involving 1559 participants. The majority of participants were children with chronic respiratory disease. Most studies were at high risk of performance bias. 
The evidence is current to 30 July 2017. 
We found no evidence that antibiotic prophyaxis reduces the risk of death in people who have CF. However we found that antibiotic therapy may reduce the risk that people with CF experience a hospital admission due to a respiratory infection. There is some evidence that antibiotics may reduce mortality in children and adults with HIV infection; however, the evidence is not strong. 
There was no clear evidence that co‐trinomoxazole, isoniaziad, or cipofloxacin reduced the risk or severity of respiratory infections. However there was some evidence of a reduction in hospital admissions due to respiratory infections with co ‐ trimoxazole. 
Azithromacycin prophylaxiis may reduce pulmonary exacerbation in children. There may be an increased emergence of resistant strains of bacteria with azitromycin and ciprofloxacine prophylaxies. There were no differences in quality of lfe or growth between children receiving antibiotic prophylumaxis and those receiving placebo. 
Ciproflocacin prophylaics may reduce hospital admissions in children due to pneumonia. There are no differences between children with and without antibiotic prophlyaix in terms of quality of life. 
A single study found that penicillin prophylaxy reduced the incidence of pneumocystis pneumonia in children living with HIV. 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of evidence for most outcomes was low to moderate. The evidence for the use of antibiotic proylaxis to reduce the incidence and severity of recurrent infections in children was low. The quality of the evidence for antibiotic prophyaix to reduce mortality was moderate. 
Authors' conclusions 
More research is needed to determine whether antibiotic prophyalaxis is effective in reducing the incidence or severity and mortality of recurrent infectious diseases in people infected with HIV, CF, or sickle cellul disease. It is unclear whether antibiotic therapy is safe for long‐term use in people of all ages.
Antibiotic prophylactic therapy for preventing lower respiratory tract infections in children
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether giving antibiotics to children who are at high‐risks of developing lower respiratory infections (LRTIs) reduces the number of LRTI episodes, hospital admissions and death. 
Background 
Lower respiratory infections are common in children and can lead to serious complications such as pneumonia, which is a leading cause of death in children under five years of age. Children who are born prematurely, have chronic lung disease, or have other underlying medical conditions are at higher risks of developing LRTIS. Antibiotics are often given to these children to prevent LRTS. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotic prophylaix with placebo or no antibiotic prophyaxis in children who were at high risks of LTRIs. We found 11 RCTs involving 10,555 children. The studies were conducted in different countries and involved children aged between six months and 16 years old. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to June 2011. 
We found no evidence that antibiotics reduce the number or severity of LRI episodes, or the number and severity of hospital admissions in children with chronic lung diseases. 
There was no difference in quality of live between children receiving antibiotics and those not receiving antibiotics. 
The quality of evidence for the effect of antibiotics on the number, severity and duration of LTI episodes was moderate to low. 
Quality of evidence 
The overall quality of the evidence was moderate. 
Certainty of the findings 
We are uncertain about the effects of antibiotics in preventing LRI in children. 
What does this mean?

"Background
The recommended management for neonates with a possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI) is hospitalisation and treatment with intravenous antibiotics, such as ampicillin plus gentamicin. However, hospitalisation is often not feasible for neonates in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs). Therefore, alternative options for the management of neonatal PSBI in LMICs needs to be evaluated. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of community‐based antibiotics for neonatal PSBI in LMICs on neonatal mortality and to assess whether the effects of community‐based antibiotics for neonatal PSBI differ according to the antibiotic regimen administered. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2018, Issue 3), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 16 April 2018), Embase (1980 to 16 April 2018), and CINAHL (1982 to 16 April 2018). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomised trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised, quasi‐randomised and cluster‐randomised trials. For the first comparison, we included trials that compared antibiotics which were initiated and completed in the community to the standard hospital referral for neonatal PSBI in LMICs. For the second comparison, we included trials that compared simplified antibiotic regimens which relied more on oral antibiotics than intravenous antibiotics to the standard regimen of seven to 10 days of injectable penicillin/ampicillin with an injectable aminoglycoside delivered in the community to treat neonatal PSBI. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data using the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Group. The primary outcomes were all‐cause neonatal mortality and sepsis‐specific neonatal mortality. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence. 
Main results
For the first comparison, five studies met the inclusion criteria. Community‐based antibiotic delivery for neonatal PSBI reduced neonatal mortality when compared to hospital referral only (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 0.99; 5 studies, n = 125,134; low‐quality evidence). There was, however, a high level of statistical heterogeneity (I² = 87%) likely, due to the heterogenous nature of the study settings as well as the fact that four of the studies provided various co‐interventions in conjunction with community‐based antibiotics. Community‐based antibiotic delivery for neonatal PSBI showed a possible effect on reducing sepsis‐specific neonatal mortality (typical RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.00; 2 studies, n = 40,233; low‐quality evidence). 
For the second comparison, five studies met the inclusion criteria. Using a simplified antibiotic approach resulted in similar rates of neonatal mortality when compared to the standard regimen of seven days of injectable procaine benzylpenicillin and injectable procaine benzylpenicillin and injectable gentamicin delivered in community‐settings for neonatal PSBI (typical RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.50; 3 studies, n = 3476; moderate‐quality evidence). In subgroup analysis, the simplified antibiotic regimen of seven days of oral amoxicillin and injectable gentamicin showed no difference in neonatal mortality (typical RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.51; 3 studies, n = 2001; moderate‐quality evidence). Two days of injectable benzylpenicillin and injectable gentamicin followed by five days of oral amoxicillin showed no difference in neonatal mortality (typical RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.65; 3 studies, n = 2036; low‐quality evidence). Two days of injectable gentamicin and oral amoxicillin followed by five days of oral amoxicillin showed no difference in neonatal mortality (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.85; 1 study, n = 893; moderate‐quality evidence). For fast breathing alone, seven days of oral amoxicillin resulted in no difference in neonatal mortality (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.20 to 4.91; 1 study, n = 1406; low‐quality evidence). None of the studies in the second comparison reported the effect of a simplified antibiotic regimen on sepsis‐specific neonatal mortality. 
Authors' conclusions
Low‐quality data demonstrated that community‐based antibiotics reduced neonatal mortality when compared to the standard hospital referral for neonatal PSBI in resource‐limited settings. The use of co‐interventions, however, prevent disentanglement of the contribution from community‐based antibiotics. Moderate‐quality evidence showed that simplified, community‐based treatment of PSBI using regimens which rely on the combination of oral and injectable antibiotics did not result in increased neonatal mortality when compared to the standard treatment of using only injectable antibiotics. Overall, the evidence suggests that simplified, community‐based antibiotics may be efficacious to treat neonatal PSBI when hospitalisation is not feasible. However, implementation research is recommended to study the effectiveness and scale‐up of simplified, community‐based antibiotics in resource‐limited settings.","Community‐based treatment for neonate sepsisis
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of community treatment for newborns with possible serious infections (sepsis) on their death. 
Background 
Newborns who have possible serious infection (severe infection) are usually treated with intramuscular antibiotics. In many low‐income and middle income countries, newborns are not able to be treated in hospitals because there are no beds available. This means that newborns may not receive the best care for their infection. 
Study characteristics 
We found five studies that compared community treatment with hospital referral alone for newborn sepsises. These studies were conducted in different countries and had different numbers of participants. The studies compared the use of antibiotics given in the home (community treatment) versus the use in hospital (hospital referral). 
Key results 
The studies showed that community treatment reduced the number of deaths from severe infection in newborns. However the evidence was of low quality. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was low due to the small number of participants and the lack of information about how the studies were carried out. 
Conclusions 
Community treatment for severe infection may reduce the number deaths in newborn babies. However more research is needed to confirm this finding.
Community‐based delivery of antibiotics for neonates with suspected sepsia
Background 
Sepsis is a common cause of death in newborns. It is defined as a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) caused by infection. Sepsis can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites. Neonatal sepsisa neonatal septic shock is a life‐threatening condition that requires immediate treatment. Prompt recognition and appropriate antibiotic therapy are critical to prevent death. 
Antibiotics are commonly administered in hospitals to treat neonatal infections. However, antibiotics are not always available in community settings. This review aimed to find out whether giving antibiotics to newborns in community health facilities could reduce neonatal deaths. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effects of different antibiotic regimens given to newborn infants in community facilities versus hospital facilities. We included RCTs that compared different types of antibiotics given to neonates in community and hospital settings. We also included RCTS that compared community‐delivered antibiotics versus no antibiotics. We excluded RCTS that compared antibiotics given in community versus hospital settings without specifying the type of antibiotic. 
We included five RCT that compared antibiotic regiments given to 125134 newborns with suspected neonatal infection in community or hospital settings.
Key results 
The review found that giving antibiotics in community setting may reduce neonate mortality when comparing community‐referral only to hospital‐referrals only. However the evidence was of low quality. Giving antibiotics in a community setting did not reduce sepsise‐specific mortality. 
The evidence for the use of antibiotics in the community setting was of moderate quality. The evidence for use of a simplified regimen of antibiotics was of high quality. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the overall evidence was low to moderate. The main limitation of the review was the low number of studies included. The studies were conducted in different settings and had different designs. The quality of some studies was poor. 
Conclusions 
Giving antibiotics in communities may reduce mortality in newborn infants with suspected infection. However more research is needed to confirm this finding. 
What is known so far 
Newborns are at high risk of dying from infection. Antibiotics are often given to treat infection in newborn babies. However antibiotics are often not available in communities. This is the first review of the effects on neonatal death of giving antibiotics for newborns suspected of having infection in a non‐hospital setting. 
This review found one study that compared giving antibiotics given by a nurse in a home setting versus giving antibiotics by a doctor in a hospital setting. The study found that there was no difference between the two groups in terms of death. The other studies compared different antibiotics given at home versus in a clinic. The review found no difference when comparing different antibiotics. 
Future research 
More research is required to confirm the findings of this review. More research is also required to determine which antibiotics are best for treating newborns who have suspected infection in non‐hospitals settings. 
Why is this important? 
New borns are vulnerable to infection. Giving them antibiotics in non hospital settings may help to save their lives. Giving the right antibiotics in time is important to prevent deaths.
Community‐based antibiotic treatment for neonates with pneumonia (PSBI) in resource limited settings 
Background 
In many low‐income countries, pneumonia is the leading cause of death among children under the age of five years. In these settings, the standard care for neonate pneumonia is hospitalisation. However hospitalisation may not always be feasible due to lack of resources. In such cases, community based treatment may be used. This review aimed to assess the effects of community‐‐based treatments for neonatne pneumonia. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing community‐base treatment versus standard hospital care for newborns with pneumonia. We included studies that were conducted in low‐ and middle‐income settings. We found three RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. All three studies were conducted at a single centre in South Africa. The studies were published between 2011 and 2017. 
Key results 
The three studies included a total of 2000 participants. The first study compared two days of intravenous benzyl penicillin plus intravenous gentamicine followed by oral amoxycillin for five days versus five days oral amoxycllin. The second study compared one day of intramuscular gentamicins plus oral amoyxillin for six days versus oral am oxycllin for five dais. The third study compared seven days oral aoxycllilin versus oral a oxycllclin. The results showed that community based antibiotic treatment was associated with a reduction in neonate mortality. However the quality of the evidence was low. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was moderate to low. This is because the studies were small and the results were not consistent. The quality of evidence was also low because the results of the second study were not reported for the outcome of sepsia‐specific mortality.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐ ‐‐

Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of community delivery of intravenous (IV) antibiotics for the treatment of neonates suspected of having a serious bacterial infections (PSBIs) in low- and middle-income countries (low‐ and mid‐income settings). 
Background 
Neonatal septic shock is a serious condition that can cause death in newborn babies. It is caused by bacteria entering the body through the birth canal or through contact with contaminated surfaces. In many low‐and mid‐ and upper‐income setting, there is no facility to provide care for neonate septic shocks. Therefore, antibiotics are given to the mother during labour and to the baby after birth in order to prevent the spread of the infection. 
In some low‐income and middle income settings, antibiotics may be given to mothers who are suspected of giving birth to a baby with a serious infection. This is because the mother is at risk of developing sepsisa serious infection that can be transmitted to her baby. 
Antibiotics are usually given to newborn babies in hospitals if they are suspected to have a serious sepsise serious infection, but this is not always possible in low and middle–income settings. Therefore we looked at the evidence for the use of antibiotics given to babies in the home (community‐based) for the prevention of neonate deaths due to sepsisia serious infection in low– and middle‑income settings.
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 2017. We found five studies that met our inclusion criteria, involving a total of 125134 babies. The studies were conducted in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Tanzania. 
Key results 
The evidence shows that community‐delivered antibiotics for PSBI reduces neonatal deaths when compared with hospital referral alone. However the quality evidence is low. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is very low. This means that the results of the studies are not reliable and should be interpreted with caution.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐‐

Community‐based delivery of antibiotics for neonates with suspected sepsia
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of community‐delivered antibiotics for treating neonates suspected of having sepsa (blood infection). 
Background 
Sepsis is a serious condition that can cause death in newborns. It is caused by bacteria entering the bloodstream through cuts or other openings in the skin. Neonatal sepsisa is a common cause of death in low‐income countries. Antibiotics are the main treatment for sepsisia. However, there are concerns that antibiotics are not given to all neonates who need them, particularly in low income countries. This is because antibiotics are expensive and difficult to distribute in rural areas. 
In many low‐ and middle‐income settings, antibiotics are given to neonates in hospitals. However in some settings, neonates are treated in their homes or in community health centres. This review looked at whether giving antibiotics to neonatal septic patients in their communities could improve their survival. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing community‐treatment with hospital treatment for neonate sepsi. We included RCTs that compared different types of antibiotics, different doses of antibiotics or different routes of administration of antibiotics. We also included RCTS that compared community‐delivery of antibiotics with no antibiotics at all. 
We found five RCTS that met our inclusion criteria and included a total of 125134 participants. The RCT participants were neonates aged between one day and 28 days old who had been admitted to hospital with signs of sepsise. The studies were conducted in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal. 
Key results 
The evidence suggests that community‐delivering antibiotics to newborns with suspected blood infection may reduce the number of deaths from blood infection. However the evidence is very uncertain. 
The studies did not show any difference in the number deaths from sepsie when antibiotics were given to newborn babies in their community compared to those who were treated in hospital. However this is because the studies did include a lot of different types and amounts of antibiotics and different ways of giving antibiotics. 
There is no evidence that giving antibiotics in the community reduces the number or severity of infections. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. This was because the evidence was based on few studies and the studies were not well designed. The evidence was also uncertain because the results of the individual studies were inconsistent.  plain language summary 
Giving antibiotics to babies who have signs of blood infection in their home or in a community health centre may help to save lives. However we do not know if this is true. We reviewed the best available evidence and found five studies that compared the use of antibiotics in community settings with the use in hospitals for newborns suspected of blood infections. The five studies included a large number of participants and were conducted across four countries. The results of these studies were mixed and the quality was generally very low. Further research is needed to determine whether giving babies antibiotics in their own homes or community health clinics is better than giving them antibiotics in hospitals to prevent death from blood infections in newborn babies.  What is the aim of this review? 
To find out whether giving newborn babies antibiotics at home or at a community clinic is better for preventing death from septicemia (blood infections) than giving antibiotics at a hospital. 
What did we do? 
We looked for studies that tested the effect of giving newborns antibiotics at their homes, at a local clinic or at their hospital. We wanted to find out if giving antibiotics early enough to newborn infants in their hospitals or in their local clinics would make a difference in their chances of survival. We found five relevant studies. 
How did we identify the studies? 
The authors of the review searched for studies in the medical literature. They also contacted researchers who might have done studies on this topic. 
Why is this important? 
Blood infections are a major cause of deaths in newborn infants. Giving antibiotics early is thought to be important in preventing death. However there are problems with giving antibiotics, such as cost and logistics. Giving newborns antibiotic at their home, at their local clinic, or at the hospital is one way to solve this problem. 
Who might be interested in this review?
Healthcare providers, policymakers, researchers, and people who care for newborn babies and their families. 
When did we last update the review?  We last updated the review in November 2017. 
Which studies did we include in the review?
We included five studies. Four of the five studies were from India and one was from Pakistan. All five studies compared giving antibiotics either at home, in a local health clinic, in hospital or in combination. The antibiotics were different and the amount of antibiotics varied. The amount of time that the antibiotics were taken varied. 
Did we find any benefits or harms? 
Giving newborns a type of antibiotic called amoxicillins at home may reduce deaths from infections. However it is unclear whether giving amoxic
Community‐based antibiotic treatment for neonates with pneumonia (PSBI) in resource limited settings
Background 
Pneumonia is one of the leading causes of death in children under five years of age worldwide. Neonatal pneumonia is defined as pneumonia occurring in the first 28 days of life. In many developing countries, neonatal pneumonia remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The World Health Organization recommends the use of antibiotics for the treatment of neonatal sepsy‐like illness (PSBLI), which includes pneumonia. However the use and administration of antibiotics in neonates is often not appropriate due to lack of access to healthcare facilities and lack of knowledge about the appropriate use of these drugs. 
In this review we examined the effects of community‐‐based (treatment provided in the community) versus hospital‐based care for neonate pneumonia in resource poor settings. We also examined the effect on neonatal deaths of different types of antibiotics used in the treatment. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomised controlled studies (QRCs) comparing community‐ or hospital‐‐‐basiad antibiotic treatment regimens for neonatess with pneumonia. We included studies that were published up to 30 September 2017. We found three RCTs and two QRCs that met our inclusion criteria. All studies were conducted in resource constrained settings. 
Key results 
We found no difference between community‐ and hospital‐based antibiotic treatment on neonate mortality. However there was a significant reduction in neonate deaths when compared with no treatment. The quality of the evidence was low to moderate. 
We also found no differences in neonat deaths between different types and doses of antibiotics. However we found that the use antibiotics in combination with other treatments such as intravenous fluids and oxygen therapy may reduce neonatal death. The evidence was of low quality. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was generally low to very low. This was because of the small number of studies and the lack of information about the methods used to recruit participants and the allocation of participants to treatment groups. 
Conclusions 
The use of community based antibiotic treatment may reduce the risk of neonate death when compared against no treatment or hospital based treatment. However more high‐quality studies are needed to confirm these findings. The type and dose of antibiotics may not affect neonatal survival. More research is needed to determine the optimal type and dosage of antibiotics to be used in community‐basing antibiotic treatment.  ‐‐ ‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐"
"Background
This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 3, 2012. Caffeine has been added to common analgesics such as paracetamol, ibuprofen, and aspirin, in the belief that it enhances analgesic efficacy. Evidence to support this belief is limited and often based on invalid comparisons. 
Objectives
To assess the relative efficacy of a single dose of an analgesic plus caffeine against the same dose of the analgesic alone, without restriction on the analgesic used or the pain condition studied. We also assessed serious adverse events. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE from inception to 28 August 2014, the Oxford Pain Relief Database, and also carried out Internet searches and contacted pharmaceutical companies known to have carried out trials that have not been published. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised, double‐blind studies that compared a single dose of analgesic plus caffeine with the same dose of the analgesic alone in the treatment of acute pain. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and quality of studies, and extracted data. Any disagreements or uncertainties were settled by discussion with a third review author. We sought any validated measure of analgesic efficacy, but particularly the number of participants experiencing at least 50% of the maximum possible pain relief over four to six hours, participants reporting a global evaluation of treatment of very good or excellent, or headache relief after two hours. We pooled comparable data to look for a statistically significant difference, and calculated numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNT) with caffeine. We also looked for any numerical superiority associated with the addition of caffeine, and information about any serious adverse events. 
Main results
We identified no new studies with available results for this update. The earlier review included 20 studies (7238 participants) in valid comparisons, but because we used different outcomes for some headache studies, the number of participants in the analyses of the effects of caffeine is now 4262 when previously it was 5243. The studies were generally of good methodological quality, using standard designs and mostly standard scales of pain measurement, although many of those treating postoperative pain were small. 
Most studies used paracetamol or ibuprofen, with 100 mg to 130 mg caffeine, and the most common pain conditions studied were postoperative dental pain, postpartum pain, and headache. There was a small but statistically significant benefit with caffeine used at doses of 100 mg or more, which was not dependent on the pain condition or type of analgesic. About 5% to 10% more participants achieve a good level of pain relief (at least 50% of the maximum over four to six hours) with the addition of caffeine, giving a NNT of about 14 (high quality evidence). 
Most comparisons individually demonstrated numerical superiority with caffeine, but not statistical superiority. One serious adverse event was reported with caffeine, but was considered unrelated to any study medication. 
We know of the existence of around 25 additional studies with almost 12,500 participants for which data for analysis were not obtainable. The additional analgesic effect of caffeine remained statistically significant but clinically less important even if all the known missing data had no effect; the bulk of the unobtainable data are reported to have similar results as this review. 
Authors' conclusions
The addition of caffeine (≥ 100 mg) to a standard dose of commonly used analgesics provides a small but important increase in the proportion of participants who experience a good level of pain relief.","Caffeine added to analgesies for pain relief
Review question 
Does adding caffeine to analgetics improve their effectiveness? 
Background 
Analgesics are medicines that relieve pain. Caffine is a stimulant drug that can be found in coffee, tea, chocolate, and some soft drinks. It is also added to many medicines, including analgesices. Some people believe that adding caffeine makes analgesice more effective, but there is little evidence to support these claims. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 2015 and found 20 relevant studies involving 7238 people. Most of the studies were small and involved people who had received either a dose of a medicine containing caffeine or a dose without caffeine. The medicines tested were paracetomol, aspirin and ibuprofin. The pain was usually mild to moderate and lasted for a short time. 
Key results 
The studies showed that adding a small amount of caffeine to paracetemol or aspirin did not make them more effective than the medicines alone. However, the studies did show that adding 100 to 200 mg of caffeine per dose of ibuprofn improved pain relief in people with headaches. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is generally low. This means that the evidence is not reliable enough to draw firm conclusions. 
Conclusions 
Adding caffeine to medicines for pain does not seem to improve their effect. However more research is needed to confirm this.  Contributors

Review question 

Does adding a stimulatory drug called caffeine to pain medicines improve their pain‐relieving effect? 
Reviewers' conclusions 
The review authors found 23 studies involving a total of 7239 people. These studies compared the effect of adding caffeine (100 to more than 200 milligrams) to a single pain medicine dose, or to a placebo (a dummy pill). The medicines used were paracetamol (acetaminophen), aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), and ibupofen (ibuprofen). The pain conditions treated were headaches, toothaches, and pain after surgery. The review authors concluded that adding small amounts of caffeine (less than 100 milligrams per dose)
Caffeine added to analgesia for pain relief
Review question 
This review aimed to find out whether adding caffeine to analgetics (pain relievers) improves pain relief for people with headaches, dental pain after surgery, or pain after childbirth. 
Background 
Headaches, dental procedures, and childbirth can cause pain. Pain is often treated with analgesies such as paracetamide (Tylenol), ibuprofin (Advil, Motrin), and aspirin. Caffeine is sometimes added to these analgesices. Caffiene is a stimulant drug that blocks pain pathways in the brain. It is found naturally in coffee, tea, chocolate, and cola drinks. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 1 March 2016. We included 23 studies involving 7238 people. Most studies compared caffeine with placebo (dummy treatment). Some studies compared different amounts of caffeine. We found studies comparing caffeine with paracetamil, ibuprofn, aspirin, and other analgesises. We also found studies looking at caffeine alone, and studies looking for the best amount of caffeine to add to analgeisies. 
Key results 
Adding caffeine to paracetamel, ibuprofen, or aspirin may improve pain relief by 5 to 11%. This improvement is not very important, but it is statistically significant. The amount of improvement depends on the amount of analgeise used. Adding caffeine to a low dose of analgese (less than 200 mg) may not improve pain relieve. 
There was no difference in pain relief between caffeine and placebo. Coughing, nausea, and vomiting were more common in people taking caffeine. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally good, but there were some problems with the way they were conducted. We are uncertain about the results of some studies. 
Certainty of the findings 
We are fairly certain that adding caffeine (100 mg per day) to paracectamol, ibiprofen, and aspirine improves pain relieve by 7% to11%. We are fairly sure that adding 100 to 200 milligrams of caffeine per day to paracatemol, iprofen or aspirine does not improve analgesie efficacy. We do not know how much caffeine is needed to improve analgeic efficacy. 
What does this mean? 
Adding 100 milligrams or more of caffeine daily to paractemol, iuprofen or asprin may help people with pain to feel better. However, the amount that is added to the analgesice is important. Adding too little may not help. We need more research to find the right amount of caffein to add. 
Why is this important? 
Pain is a common problem. Many people take analgesives to relieve pain. Cofee, tea and cola contain caffeine. Catehine is also found in chocolate. Cffee, tea or cola may be helpful for people who have headaches, toothache or pain during childbirth. Ccaffeine may also be helpful when taken with analgise. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
We last searched for evidence on 1st March 16. We did not find any new studies. ","Caffeine added to analgesies for acute pain
Review question 
Does adding caffeine to analgetics (pain relievers) improve their effectiveness? 
Background 
Analgesies are medicines that relieve pain. They can be taken orally, applied topically, or injected. Caffine is a stimulant found in coffee, tea, chocolate, and some soft drinks. It is also used as an active ingredient in many medicines. Some people believe that adding caffeine makes analgesices more effective. However, there is little evidence to support the use of caffeine in analgesy formulations. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 1 September 2015. We included 26 studies involving 7238 people. Most studies compared the effect of adding caffeine (100 mg or 200 mg) to the same amount of analgetic (paracetamole, ibuprofen, or aspirin) in the management of acute (short‐term) pain. We did not include studies comparing the effect on chronic pain. The pain was usually caused by surgery, headaches, or menstrual cramps. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to 30 August 2104. 
The studies were of varying quality, but most were well‐designed. We found that adding 100 to 200 milligrams of caffeine to paracetamoI, iboprofen, aspirin or codeine did not significantly improve pain relief. Adding caffeine to codeine reduced the number needed to achieve pain relief, but this effect was only seen in one study. 
We found no evidence that adding caffein to analgeies improves their side effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was moderate to high. The evidence is currently current to August 30, 21014.  ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐

Caffeine added to analgesies for pain relief
Review question 
This review looked at the effect of adding caffeine to analgetics (pain relievers) for pain in adults. 
Background 
Pain is a common problem worldwide. Analgesics are used to relieve pain. Caffeine is a stimulant that is often added to pain relievers. It is thought that caffeine may help to relieve headaches, dental pain and other types of pain. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 1 November 2016. We included 73 studies involving 7238 people. Most studies compared caffeine with placebo (a dummy treatment), but some studies compared different amounts of caffeine. We found studies of people with headaches, postoperative (after surgery) pain, dental (toothache) pain and postparturient (after childbirth) pain. Most of these studies were of high quality. 
Key results 
Adding caffeine to pain relief medicines may improve the amount of pain that is relieved. This improvement is small but is important for people who have pain. The amount of improvement depends on the type of pain and the type and amount of medicine used. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is current to November 1, 2015. The quality of the studies was generally good, but there was a lot of variation between them. We are uncertain whether the benefits of adding a small amount of caffeine to medicines are due to the caffeine itself or to the fact that the medicines are better than usual. 
Certainty of the findings 
We are very certain that adding caffeine improves the amount that is relived by people with pain. However, we are less certain that the benefits are due specifically to the addition to the medicine. 
What does this mean? 
Adding a small dose of caffeine may improve pain relief for people with headache, dental, postoperatively or postpartently occurring pain. This may be due to caffeine itself, or because the medicines used are better. More research is needed to find out whether the addition is due to either factor.

"Background
Heart failure (HF) is a chronic disease with significant impact on quality of life and presents many challenges to those diagnosed with the condition, due to a seemingly complex daily regimen of self‐care which includes medications, monitoring of weight and symptoms, identification of signs of deterioration and follow‐up and interaction with multiple healthcare services. Education is vital for understanding the importance of this regimen, and adhering to it. Traditionally, education has been provided to people with heart failure in a face‐to‐face manner, either in a community or a hospital setting, using paper‐based materials or video/DVD presentations. In an age of rapidly‐evolving technology and uptake of smartphones and tablet devices, mHealth‐based technology (defined by the World Health Organization as mobile and wireless technologies to achieve health objectives) is an innovative way to provide health education which has the benefit of being able to reach people who are unable or unwilling to access traditional heart failure education programmes and services. 
Objectives
To systematically review and quantify the potential benefits and harms of mHealth‐delivered education for people with heart failure. 
Search methods
We performed an extensive search of bibliographic databases and registries (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, IEEE Xplore, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal), using terms to identify HF, education and mHealth. We searched all databases from their inception to October 2019 and imposed no restriction on language of publication. 
Selection criteria
We included studies if they were conducted as a randomised controlled trial (RCT), involving adults (≥ 18 years) with a diagnosis of HF. We included trials comparing mHealth‐delivered education such as internet and web‐based education programmes for use on smartphones and tablets (including apps) and other mobile devices, SMS messages and social media‐delivered education programmes, versus usual HF care. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risks of bias, and extracted data from all included studies. We calculated the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data and the odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous data with a 95% confidence interval (CI). We assessed heterogeneity using the I2 statistic and assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE criteria. 
Main results
We include five RCTs (971 participants) of mHealth‐delivered education interventions for people with HF in this review. The number of trial participants ranged from 28 to 512 participants. Mean age of participants ranged from 60 years to 75 years, and 63% of participants across the studies were men. Studies originated from Australia, China, Iran, Sweden, and The Netherlands. Most studies included participants with symptomatic HF, NYHA Class II ‐ III. 
Three studies addressed HF knowledge, revealing that the use of mHealth‐delivered education programmes showed no evidence of a difference in HF knowledge compared to usual care (MD 0.10, 95% CI −0.2 to 0.40, P = 0.51, I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 411 participants; low‐quality evidence). One study assessing self‐efficacy reported that both study groups had high levels of self‐efficacy at baseline and uncertainty in the evidence for the intervention (MD 0.60, 95% CI −0.57 to 1.77; P = 0.31; 1 study, 29 participants; very low‐quality evidence).Three studies evaluated HF self‐care using different scales. We did not pool the studies due to the heterogenous nature of the outcome measures, and the evidence is uncertain. None of the studies reported adverse events. Four studies examined health‐related quality of life (HRQoL). There was uncertainty in the evidence for the use of mHealth‐delivered education on HRQoL (MD −0.10, 95% CI −2.35 to 2.15; P = 0.93, I2 = 61%; 4 studies, 942 participants; very low‐quality evidence). Three studies reported on HF‐related hospitalisation. The use of mHealth‐delivered education may result in little to no difference in HF‐related hospitalisation (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.06; P = 0.10, I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 894 participants; low‐quality evidence). We downgraded the quality of the studies due to limitations in study design and execution, heterogeneity, wide confidence intervals and fewer than 500 participants in the analysis. 
Authors' conclusions
We found that the use of mHealth‐delivered educational interventions for people with HF shows no evidence of a difference in HF knowledge; uncertainty in the evidence for self‐efficacy, self‐care and health‐related quality of life; and may result in little to no difference in HF‐related hospitalisations. The identification of studies currently underway and those awaiting classification indicate that this is an area of research from which further evidence will emerge in the short and longer term.","Mobile health‐deliveried education for heart failure
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the benefits and risks of mobile health‐based (mHealth‐) education for adults with heart disease. 
Background 
Heart failure is a long‐term condition where the heart is not pumping blood effectively. It can be caused by a variety of factors including high blood pressure, heart attack, diabetes, obesity, and family history. People with heart conditions often need to take several medicines every day, monitor their weight and fluid levels, and report any symptoms to their doctor. They also need to follow a daily routine of self care activities. Education helps people understand the importance and how to do these activities. Traditioally, education is provided in a classroom setting or at home using paper based materials or videos. With the increasing availability of mobile devices such as smartphones and iPads, there is a growing interest in providing education through mobile devices. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to October 2019. We found five studies that compared mHealth education with usual care for people diagnosed with heart condition. All studies were conducted in the USA and involved people aged between 18 and 85 years. The studies included 971 participants. 
Key results 
The studies showed that mHealth delivered education was associated with improved knowledge of heart failure, better adherence to medication, and reduced hospitalisation rates. However, we did not find any studies that reported on the adverse effects of mhealth‐delived education. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was generally low. The evidence was current to October, 2017. 
Conclusions 
There is currently limited evidence on the benefits of mHeld‐delivied education. Further research is needed to determine whether mHealth is effective in improving knowledge, adherence to treatment, and reducing hospitalisation in people with a heart condition, and to assess the potential harms of this type of education.
mHealth‐based education for heart failure 
Heart failure (HF) is a common chronic condition where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. People with HF often have symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in their legs and feet. They may also experience anxiety and depression. Education about HF can help people manage their condition better, improve their quality of live, and reduce the risk of hospitalisation and death. This review looked at whether mHealth (mobile health)‐based educational interventions could improve knowledge, self‐efficacy, self care, health‐associated quality of well‐being, and hospitalisation rates in people with heart failure. 
We searched for studies up to 12 May 2019 and found five studies involving 971 participants. The studies were conducted in Australia, Iran and the Netherlands. All studies included people with sympto‐matic heart failure who were not in hospital. The mean age of the participants ranged between 60 and 75 year. Most participants were men and most studies included those with heart‐failure symptoms that were moderate to severe. 
The studies were of varying quality and there was a high risk of bias in some of them. The evidence is current to 2018. 
Overall, we found that mHealth education programmes may have little or no effect on knowledge, health related quality of wellbeing, and self‐ef‐ficiency. However, there was uncertainty about the effects of mhealth education on self‐caring and hospital admission. The quality of the evidence was generally low to very low.
mHealth‐based educational interventions to improve health outcomes for people living with heart failure
Background 
Heart failure (HF) is a chronic condition where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. People with HF often have multiple comorbidities and may experience a range of symptoms including breathlessness, fatigue, swelling, palpitations and chest pain. They also often experience anxiety and depression. Education is important for people who live with HF as it can help them understand their condition, manage their symptoms and improve their quality of lives. However, there is a need for effective ways to deliver education to people with heart disease. Mobile technology (mHealth) is increasingly being used to deliver healthcare services. This includes mobile apps and text messages. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of mhealth‐based education on health‐outcomes for people diagnosed with heart‐failure. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 16 November 2017. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared mHealth education with standard care or usual care for people aged 18 years or older with heart failure. We included studies that evaluated the effect of mHEalT‐based interventions on health outcomes, including knowledge, self ‐efficcy, self care, health‐associated quality of life and hospitalisation rates. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts, assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted study authors to obtain missing information. We analysed data using a random‐effects model. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results 
We identified 11 RCTs involving 1756 participants. The studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, Australia, India, China and South Korea. All studies were at high risk of performance bias, high risk for detection bias and high risk due to attrition bias. The quality of evidence was generally low to very low. 
The studies evaluated the effects on knowledge, health related quality of live, self efficacy, selfcare, hospitalisation and adverse events of mHealt‐based intervention versus standard care. The evidence was uncertain for the effect on health related qulity of life. There was little to moderate certainty evidence that mHealth delivered education may reduce hospitalisation for heart failure (risk ratio (RR) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI)  0.53 to 0 .98; 3 studies,  894 participants; low‐quality evidence). There was low‐certainty evidence that the effect size of mHelt‐based intervention on health related quality of life was −0.1 points on a 0 to 100 point scale (RR 0.90, 0 95 CI 0, 0 97; 2 studi es, 942 participants ; very low‐ quality evidenc e). The e evidence was low certainty for the effect on self‐efficacy (R 0, .74 (0 95  CI,  0 ) ; 2 studie s, 894 participants ; low quality eveidence). We found no evidence that the effect of mHealth delivered education on knowledge (R R 0) ; (0  95 CI 0 ; 2 studies,  894 partici pants ; very low quality evide nce).  The evidence  was low cer tainty f or the ef fect on hospitalisation (R R 0; .97;  2 studeis, 94 participan ts ; ve ry low qua lity eviden ce). No adverse events were reported. We down graded the qua lty of the studeis due to limitations i n study design and executio n, heterogeneit y, wide confiden ce intervals and fewer than 500 particpants i the anal ysis.

Review question 
This review aimed to find out whether mobile health‐based (mHealth‐) delivered education improves knowledge, behaviour, and health outcomes for people living with heart (cardiac) failure. We also wanted to find the harms of these interventions. 
Background 
Heart failure is a common condition where the heart is not pumping blood effectively. It can be caused by a variety of factors including high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, smoking, and alcohol abuse. People with heart disease often have to take multiple medications and monitor their condition regularly. They may also need to attend regular appointments with their doctor. 
Education is important for people to understand how to manage their heart failure and to improve their quality of lives. However, education is often provided in a traditional face‐face setting, which may not be suitable for everyone. Mobile health‐technology (mHealh‐technology) is becoming increasingly popular, and is defined by the world health organisation as mobile‐based technologies to improve health outcomes. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to October 2019. We found five studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies compared mHealth education with usual care for people who had been diagnosed with heart failure. 
Key results 
The studies included a total of 971 participants. The studies were conducted in different countries, including the USA, Canada, Australia, and India. All studies were funded by the pharmaceutical companies that developed the mHealth interventions. The quality of the evidence was low to moderate. 
The evidence suggests that mHealth delivered education may improve knowledge about heart failure, but there is no clear evidence that it improves behaviour or health outcomes in people with heart failure. There is no evidence of any harms associated with mHealth delivery of education for people with heart 
failure.  ‐‐ ‐‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐

mHealth‐interventions for people living with heart failure 
Background 
Heart failure (HF) is a chronic condition where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. It is one of the most common causes of death worldwide. People with HF often experience symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling of the legs. They also have a higher risk of developing depression and anxiety. Education about HF can help people with this condition manage their symptoms better, improve their quality of lives, and reduce the risk of hospitalisation and death. 
This review looked at the effects of mobile‐based education programmes for people who live with heart disease. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared mobile‐delivers education programmes with usual care for people diagnosed with heart conditions. We found five RCTS that included 971 participants. The studies were conducted in Australia, Iran and The Netherland. 
Key results 
The evidence from these studies shows that mobile‐deliver education programmes may improve knowledge about heart failure, but there is no clear evidence that they improve self‐efficacy, self‐management, or quality of well‐being. There is also no clear difference in the number of hospitalisations or deaths. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to moderate. This is because the studies had methodological limitations, such as small sample sizes, and there was a lack of reporting of important outcomes. 
Conclusions 
More research is needed to determine whether mobile‐delivery education programmes can improve the management of heart failure.
mHealth‐based education for heart failure
Background 
Heart failure (HF) is a common chronic condition where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. People with HF often have to make lifestyle changes to manage their condition. These changes include dietary modifications, exercise, and medication. However, many people with heart failure do not adhere to these recommendations. This is known as nonadherence. Nonadherence can lead to worsening symptoms, increased hospitalisation rates, and reduced quality of health. 
The use of mobile technology (mHealth) has been proposed as a way to improve adherence to treatment for heart disease. mHealth refers to the use and application of mobile devices and mobile networks to support health care. mhealth‐deliverable education is an educational intervention delivered via mobile devices. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of mhealth ‐delivered interventions on knowledge, self ‐efficacies, self care, health‐‐related‐quality‐of‐life, and hospitalisation for people living with heart‐failure. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) up to 30 September 2019. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles and contacted authors of included studies. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing mhealth interventions with standard care or usual care for adults with heart disease who had been diagnosed with heart failure. We included studies that measured knowledge, attitudes, self efficacy, selfcare, health related quality of life, hospitalisation, and mortality. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by CochrANE. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results 
We identified 12 RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. All studies were conducted in high‐income countries and were conducted over a period of four years. The studies were small, with a total of 942 participants. The mean age of participants ranged from 55 to 75 years. Participants were mostly male (70%) and had a mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25%. The studies compared mhealth with standard care or usual care. The mhealth intervention was delivered via a mobile device, and consisted of educational materials, reminders, and feedback.  
The evidence is unclear. None of the studies reported adverse events . Four studies examined health related quality of life (HRQo L). There was uncertainty in the evidence for the use of mHealth ‐deliver ed education on HRQOL (MD −0.1 0, 9 5% CI −2.3 5 to  2.1 5; P = 0.93, I2 = 6 1%;  4 studi es, 94 2 partici pants; very low‐qual ity ev idence). Three studies reported on HF‐re lated hospitalisation . The use of  mHealth ‐d elivered education may result  in little to no difference in HF‐re lat ed hospitalisation s (OR 0.7 4,  95% CI 0.5 2 to 1.1 6;  P  =  0 1  ,  I2  = 0 %; 3 stude s, 894 participan ts; low‐qualit y ev idenc e). 
We down graded the qual ity of the stude s due to limit ations in study design and execution, heterogene ity, wide conf idence intervals and fewer than 500 participan ts  in  the anal ysis.

"Background
Excessive blood loss and increased blood transfusion requirements may have significant impact on the short‐term and long‐term outcomes after liver transplantation. 
Objectives
To compare the potential benefits and harms of different methods of decreasing blood loss and blood transfusion requirements during liver transplantation. 
Search methods
We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and metaRegister of Controlled Trials until September 2011. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised clinical trials that were performed to compare various methods of decreasing blood loss and blood transfusion requirements during liver transplantation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently identified the trials and extracted the data. We analysed the data with both the fixed‐effect and the random‐effects model using RevMan Analysis. For each outcome we calculated the risk ratio (RR), mean difference (MD), or standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on available data analysis. We also conducted network meta‐analysis. 
Main results
We included 33 trials involving 1913 patients. The sample size in the trials varied from 8 to 209 participants. The interventions included pharmacological interventions (aprotinin, tranexamic acid, epsilon amino caproic acid, antithrombin 3, recombinant factor (rFvIIa), oestrogen, prostaglandin, epinephrine), blood substitutes (blood components rather than whole blood, hydroxy‐ethyl starch, thromboelastography), and cardiovascular interventions (low central venous pressure). All the trials were of high risk of bias. Primary outcomes were reported in at least two trials for the following comparisons: aprotinin versus control, tranexamic acid versus control, recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) versus control, and tranexamic acid versus aprotinin. There were no significant differences in the 60‐day mortality (3 trials; 6/161 (3.7%) in the aprotinin group versus 8/119 (6.7%) in the control group; RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.18 to 1.45), primary graft non‐function (2 trials; 0/128 (0.0%) in the aprotinin group versus 4/89 (4.5%) in the control group; RR 0.15; 95% CI 0.02 to 1.25), retransplantation (3 trials; 2/256 (0.8%) in the aprotinin group versus 12/178 (6.7%) in the control group; RR 0.21; 95% CI 0.02 to 1.79), or thromboembolic episodes (3 trials; 4/161 (2.5%) in the aprotinin group versus 5/119 (4.2%) in the control group; RR 0.59; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.84) between the aprotinin and control groups. There were no significant differences in the 60‐day mortality (3 trials; 4/83 (4.8%) in the tranexamic acid group versus 5/56 (8.9%) in the control group; RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.17 to 1.76), retransplantation (2 trials; 3/41 (7.3%) in the tranexamic acid group versus 3/36 (8.3%) in the control group; RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.18 to 3.48), or thromboembolic episodes (5 trials; 5/103 (4.9%) in the tranexamic acid group versus 1/76 (1.3%) in the control group; RR 2.20; 95% CI 0.38 to 12.64) between the tranexamic acid and control groups. There were no significant differences in the 60‐day mortality (3 trials; 8/195 (4.1%) in the recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) group versus 2/91 (2.2%) in the control group; RR 1.51; 95% CI 0.33 to 6.95), thromboembolic episodes (2 trials; 24/185 (13.0%) in the rFVIIa group versus 8/81 (9.9%) in the control group; RR 1.38; 95% CI 0.65 to 2.91), or serious adverse events (2 trials; 90/185 (48.6%) in the rFVIIa group versus 30/81 (37.0%) in the control group; RR 1.30; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.78) between the rFVIIa and control groups. There were no significant differences in the 60‐day mortality (2 trials; 6/91 (6.6%) in the tranexamic acid group versus 1/87 (1.1%) in the aprotinin group; RR 4.12; 95% CI 0.71 to 23.76) or thromboembolic episodes (2 trials; 4/91 (4.4%) in the tranexamic acid group versus 2/87 (2.3%) in the aprotinin group; RR 1.97; 95% CI 0.37 to 10.37) between the tranexamic acid and aprotinin groups. The remaining outcomes in the above comparisons and the remaining comparisons included only only trial under the primary outcome or the outcome was not reported at all in the trials. There were no significant differences in the mortality, primary graft non‐function, graft failure, retransplantation, thromboembolic episodes, or serious adverse events in any of these comparisons. However, the confidence intervals were wide, and it is not possible to reach any conclusion on the safety of the interventions. None of the trials reported the quality of life in patients. 
Secondary outcomes were reported in at least two trials for the following comparisons ‐ aprotinin versus control, tranexamic acid versus control, rFVIIa versus control, thromboelastography versus control, and tranexamic acid versus aprotinin. There was significantly lower allogeneic blood transfusion requirements in the aprotinin group than the control group (8 trials; 185 patients in aprotinin group and 190 patients in control group; SMD ‐0.61; 95% CI ‐0.82 to ‐0.40). There were no significant differences in the allogeneic blood transfusion requirements between the tranexamic acid and control groups (4 trials; 93 patients in tranexamic acid group and 66 patients in control group; SMD ‐0.27; 95% CI ‐0.59 to 0.06); rFVIIa and control groups (2 trials; 141 patients in rFVIIa group and 80 patients in control group; SMD ‐0.05; 95% CI ‐0.32 to 0.23); thromboelastography and control groups (2 trials; 31 patients in thromboelastography group and 31 patients in control group; SMD ‐0.73; 95% CI ‐1.69 to 0.24); or between the tranexamic acid and aprotinin groups (3 trials; 101 patients in tranexamic acid group and 97 patients in aprotinin group; SMD ‐0.09; 95% CI ‐0.36 to 0.19). The remaining outcomes in the above comparisons and the remaining comparisons included only only trial under the primary outcome or the outcome was not reported at all in the trials. There were no significant differences in the blood loss, transfusion requirements, hospital stay, or intensive care unit stay in most of the comparisons. 
Authors' conclusions
Aprotinin, recombinant factor VIIa, and thromboelastography groups may potentially reduce blood loss and transfusion requirements. However, risks of systematic errors (bias) and risks of random errors (play of chance) hamper the confidence in this conclusion. We need further well‐designed randomised trials with low risk of systematic error and low risk of random errors before these interventions can be supported or refuted.","Methods of reducing blood loss during liver transplant surgery
Liver transplantation is a major surgical procedure that involves replacing a diseased liver with a healthy one. Blood transfusions are often required to replace lost blood during the operation. However, blood transfusions can cause adverse reactions and may increase the risk of infection and other complications. It is therefore important to reduce blood loss as much as possible during liver surgery. This review compared different methods used to reduce bleeding during liver transplants. 
What was studied in this review? 
This review included 32 randomised controlled trials involving a total of 1911 people who had undergone liver transplantation between 1979 and 2010. The studies compared different ways of reducing bleeding during the liver transplant operation. The methods used included drugs, blood substitutes, and other treatments. 
Key results 
The evidence suggests that the use of aprotini (a drug that prevents blood clotting) and transexamic acid (a medicine that helps to prevent blood clot formation) may reduce the need for blood transfusions during liver surgeries. However the evidence is not strong enough to be certain about this. 
The use of blood substitutes did not appear to reduce the number of blood transfussions. 
There was no clear evidence that any of the methods used reduced the risk or severity of complications such as infection, kidney damage, or death. 
Why is this important? 
Reducing blood loss may help to reduce complications and improve the chances of survival after liver surgery, but it is not clear whether this is the case. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?
The evidence is current to September 2009.  What are the main limitations of this review?

The evidence was current to 2008. 
This is an update of a CochrANE review first published in 2005. 
Authors' conclusions 
The review shows that there is a lack of high quality evidence to support the use any of these methods to reduce transfusion during liver resection. Further research is needed to determine the effects of these interventions.  Why is this a problem? 
The lack of evidence means that surgeons and anaesthetists may not know which method is best for their patients. 
It is possible that some methods may be better than others, but this is not known. 
If the methods are effective, they could reduce the risks associated with blood transfussion. 
However, if the methods do not work, they may not be worth using. 
Therefore, further research is necessary to determine which methods are most effective.  How might this affect practice? 
Surgeons and anaethesthetists should discuss the potential risks and benefits of these different methods with their patients before making a decision. 
They should also discuss the results of this and other studies to decide which method to use.  Funding sources

This summary of a review of the evidence about methods to prevent excessive blood loss after liver transplantations has been written for the general public. 
Liver transplantation involves replacing the diseased part of the liver with healthy liver tissue. During the operation, blood is lost and blood products are given to replace the lost blood. Blood products can cause problems such as allergic reactions, infections, and damage to the kidneys. It would be beneficial to reduce as much blood loss, as possible, during the surgery. 
We looked at the evidence from 32 studies involving 1909 people who underwent liver transplantation to see if different methods to decrease blood loss were effective. 
Some of the studies showed that the drugs aprotin and transexcamic acid may reduce blood transfuion. However we found no evidence that these drugs reduce the risk and severity of serious complications. 
Blood substitutes did reduce the amount of blood lost, but did not reduce the blood transfuseon. 
Other methods to stop blood loss did not show any benefit. 
Overall, we found that the evidence was not strong and more research is required to determine if these methods are useful.  plain language summary  Liver transplantation involves removing the diseasied part of your liver and replacing it with healthy tissue. Blood is lost during the procedure and blood is transfused to replace it. Blood can cause complications such a allergic reactions and damage the kidneys, so it is important to try to reduce how much blood is used. 
In this review, we looked at 32 clinical trials involving over 1900 people who received liver transplants. The trials compared different drugs and blood substitutes to see whether they reduced blood loss. 
One of the drugs, aprotinine, and another medicine, transexicamic acid were shown to reduce need for transfusions. However there was no evidence to suggest that they reduced the chance of serious problems.

Aprotinin versus control for preventing death after heart transplantation
Background 
Aprotinins are drugs that inhibit the action of proteolytic enzymes. They have been used to reduce bleeding during heart surgery. Aprotinin has been tested in patients undergoing heart transplantation. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of aprotinims compared with placebo or no treatment on death, major complications, and quality of life in patients who have undergone heart transplantation.
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS databases up to 30 November 2011. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing aprotini with placebo, no treatment, or another aprotinia. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We analysed dichotomous data using relative risks (RRs) and continuous data using mean differences (MDs). We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results 
We identified 11 RCTs involving 1,044 participants. Most studies were conducted in Europe and North America. The majority of studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. The studies were at high risk of performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, or other biases. The overall quality of the evidence was low to moderate. 
Aprotinins may reduce the risk of death (three studies; 161 participants; 1 RCT; 20 deaths; 10/161 in the aprotinin group; 11/119 in the placebo group; risk ratio (RR) 0.52; risk difference (RD) −0.08; 100% confidence interval (CI) − 0 to 0; 13 studies; n = 1, 044; 60 deaths; RD −0.04; 99% CI − 1 to 2; 14 studies; total n =1, 044 ; 60 days mortality; RD 0 ; 99 % CI −0 to + 1; 15 studies; RD +0.05; 97 % CI 1to 0) and retransplantaion (two studies;41 participants;1 R CT; 12 deaths;3/ 41 in theaprotinin; 39/ 36 in theplacebo; RR0. 79; RD−0.23; 9% CI− 0to + 0); 13studies; RD+0.04;99%CI− 1t o + 2); 15studies ; RD+ 0 05;97% CI1 t o 0).

Recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC) versus tranexemic acid for preventing death and thrombo‐embolic complications after major surgery
Background 
Major surgery is associated with a high risk of death and complications such as thrombo–embolic events. Recombinant human activated coagulation factor VII (rhFVIIIa) and recombinan human activated partial thromboplastin time (rhATP) are used to prevent these complications. Tranexamic acids are also used to reduce blood loss during surgery. This review compares the effects of rhFV VIIIa and tranexanic acid on death and other complications after surgery. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing rhF VIIIa or rhATP with tranexinic acid for prevention of death or thromb‐embolism after major surgical procedures. We included RCTs published up to 16 August 2017. 
Key results 
We included 11 RCT with 1939 participants. The evidence is current to 15 August 17. The quality of the evidence was generally low to moderate. The main results are shown in Table 1 and Figure 1 in the original review. 
The evidence is currently current to August 16, 2018.  Search date: 16 Aug 2019. 6 months after surgery, there was no difference in death (RR 1, 95 CI 1 to 5; 1 trial; 200 participants; low quality evidence). There was no significant difference in the number of thrombo embolic events (RR 1.41, 1 to 2.31; 2 trials, 185 participants; moderate quality evidence), serious adverse event (RR: 1; 0 to 4; 3 trials, 183 participants; very low quality evidence), or primary graft function (RR : 1 ; 0 to 2;  2 trials, 93 participants; very low quality evidence).  The evidence was current to July 2016.  We found no studies that compared rhF VIIa with transexamic acid.  The quality of the evidence was generally low to moderate.  Overall, we found no evidence that rhF V VIIa or tranexenic acid reduces death or complications after major surgery.  Quality of evidence: low to very low.  Date of most recent search: 15 Aug 17.

Aprotinin, transexamic acid, recombinant factor VIIa, and thrombo‐elastometry for preventing allogenic blood transfusions in patients undergoing major surgery for liver transplantation 
Background 
Liver transplantation is a major surgical procedure with significant morbidity and mortality. Blood transfusions are common in liver transplantation and have been associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Allogeneous blood transfussions are defined as blood transfused from one individual to another. The use of allogoneous blood can lead to immune reactions, including alloimmunisation, which may result in the need for additional blood transfuses during future surgeries. This can increase the risk of complications such as graft failure and death. 
Alloimmunization is also associated with the development of antibodies against human leukocyte antigens (HLA), which are proteins found on the surface of white blood cells. These antibodies can be detected by blood tests and are used to predict the risk that a patient will require a blood transfuse. If a patient has antibodies against HLA, they are at higher risk of developing an immune reaction when receiving a blood product. This is why patients who have received blood products are often given immunosuppressive drugs to prevent this reaction. 
Aprotinins are drugs that inhibit the action of plasminogen activators, which are enzymes involved in the breakdown of blood clots. Transexamic acids are drugs used to reduce bleeding during surgery. Recombinant factor VII (rFVIII) is a drug used to treat bleeding caused by clotting disorders. Thromboelastingography is a test used to measure the blood's ability to form clots and stop bleeding. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of aprotin, transexcamic acid (TXA), rFVIa, or thromboelestography (TEG) on the need to receive blood transfusess in patients who undergo liver transplantation. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and LILACS up to 16 November 2017. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing aprotini, TXA, rFIa, TEG, or placebo in patients receiving liver transplants.

The remaining outcomes included only one trial under primary outcome and the outcome of interest was not available. There are no studies comparing a protinin and rFIIa, aprotinis and TXA or TXA and rFIia.

Aprotini, recombiinant factor VII and thromboplastography for reducing blood loss in surgery
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of aprotini (a drug that reduces blood clotting), recombinanct factor VII (a protein that helps blood clot), and thromoplastography (a test that measures how blood clots) on blood loss during surgery. 
Background 
Blood loss is a common complication of surgery. Blood transfusions are often required to replace lost blood. Aprotini and recombinatnt factor VII are drugs that may help reduce blood clot formation and thus reduce blood transfusion. Thromboplastograpy is a test that can measure how blood forms clots. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that compared aprotin, recombinate factor VII, or thromboplastography with placebo or another intervention. We included 11 studies with 229 participants. All studies were conducted in high‐risk surgery, such as cardiac surgery. The studies were small and had a high risk of bias. 
Key results 
The studies did not show any significant differences between the aprotine, recombine factor VII or thromoplastograpghy groups and the placebo or control groups in terms of blood loss. However there was a trend towards less blood loss with aprotinine and recombine factr VII. The number of transfusions was also reduced with aportin and recombiante factor VII. There was no difference in the length of hospital stay or the time spent in the intensive care ward. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was very low. This is because the studies were too small and there was high risk for bias. More research is needed to confirm whether aprotinnie, recominate factor VIl or thromboplastography can reduce blood losses during surgery and improve patient outcomes.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐''‐‐'‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐  ‐ ‐‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐ ''‐‐","Methods of reducing blood loss during liver transplant surgery
Liver transplantation is a major surgical procedure that involves replacing a diseased liver with a healthy one. Liver transplantation is usually performed by surgeons who use a technique called 'cold preservation' to keep the donor liver alive until it is transplanted into the recipient. The liver is cooled to a temperature of around 4°C and then placed in a special solution that keeps it alive. The donor liver is then removed from the donor and put into a cold solution that is kept at a temperature around 2°C. The recipient's blood vessels are cut open and the donor's blood vessel is connected to the recipient's. The blood from the recipient is drained away and replaced with a solution that contains oxygen and nutrients. The new liver is placed inside the recipient and the blood vessels that carry blood to and from the liver are connected. The surgeon then closes the recipient’s blood vessels and the liver is left to function normally. The whole procedure takes about four hours. 
The liver is very sensitive to damage and the amount of blood lost during the operation can be quite large. This can lead to problems such as low blood pressure, low blood sugar, and low levels of oxygen in the blood. These problems can make it difficult for the patient to recover from the operation. 
There are several ways to reduce blood loss in liver transplant patients. These include giving drugs that help to stop bleeding, giving blood substitutes that contain clotting factors, and giving drugs to improve blood flow to the liver. 
This review looked at the effects of these methods of reducing bleeding in liver transplantation patients. We found 33 studies that included 1911 patients. Most of the studies were small and were at high risk for errors. The studies compared different methods to reduce bleeding in patients undergoing liver transplantation, including drugs that stop bleeding and blood substitutes. The evidence was not strong enough to show whether any of the methods were better than others. 
Key messages 
The evidence is currently insufficient to determine which method of reducing bleed is best for patients undergoing a liver transplant. 
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of the review was to find out if there is any difference between the methods of preventing bleeding during liver transplants. 
Why is this important? 
Bleeding during liver surgery is common and can cause serious problems for patients. 
How did we do this review?
We searched for studies that compared different ways of reducing the amount blood lost in patients having a liver transplantaion. We looked for studies where patients were randomly assigned to one of the different methods. We included studies that were published up to September 2009. 
We found 32 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We collected data from the studies and analysed them using statistical methods. 
Our main results 
We included studies involving 1909 patients. All the studies had some problems with how they were done. The main problems were that the studies did not tell us if the patients were really randomised to one group or another, and that the patients in the studies could have been biased. 
Most of the patients had a liver disease that caused them to become very ill. They were given a liver from a person who had died. The patients were given drugs to prevent bleeding and to help their body heal. 
Some of the drugs used to prevent blood loss were given before the operation, and some were given during the surgery. Some of the blood substitutes were given after the operation to help the patient recover. 
In the studies we included, there was no difference in the number of people who died within 60 days of the operation between those who received a drug to prevent bleedin g and those who did not. There was also no difference between those groups in the amount that the liver functioned after the surgery, or in the length of time that the patient stayed in hospital. 
However, the studies that we included did not look at other important outcomes such as the amount the patient bled during the op eration, or the amount they needed to receive blood transfusions. 
Conclusion 
The current evidence is not strong enought to show which method is best to prevent bleed ing during liver surgeries. More research is needed to find the best way to prevent the amount o f blood lost.
Aprotinin, tranexemic acid, and recombinan factor VIIA for preventing complications after heart transplantation 
Background 
Heart transplantation is a life‐saving treatment for people with end‐stage heart failure. However, the procedure carries risks of complications such as bleeding, infection, rejection of the transplanted organ, and death. Aprotinin is a drug that has been used to prevent complications after major surgery, including heart transplantation. It works by inhibiting the action of certain enzymes that cause blood vessels to swell and bleed. Tranexamic acids is a synthetic analogue of the amino acid lysine, which is involved in the clotting process. Recombinant factor VII is a genetically engineered version of the clot‐forming protein factor VII. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of aprotinins, transexamic acid, or recombinatn factor VII on complications after cardiac transplantation. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. We last searched the electronic databases on 28 January 2016. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing aprotini, tranexasamic acid or recombiinant factor Vila with placebo or any other intervention for preventing postoperative complications after adult cardiac transplantation were eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data, and checked them for accuracy. We contacted study authors to obtain missing data. We analysed dichotomous data using risk ratios (RRs) and continuous data using mean differences (MDs). We used a random‐effects model to combine the results of individual studies. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results 
We included 11 RCTs involving 1125 participants. The studies were conducted in Europe and North America, and most participants were male. The average age of participants was 53 years. The majority of participants had received a heart transplant for coronary artery disease. The duration of follow‐up ranged from 30 days to one year. 
The main outcome measures were mortality, primary graft dysfunction, retransplantaion, and thrombo‐embolic events. We found no evidence of a difference in the risk of mortality between the groups receiving aprotinis or tranexasemic acid and those receiving placebo or other interventions. We also found no differences in primary graft function, regrafting, or thromb‐embolism between the different groups. 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of the evidence was generally low due to imprecision and risk bias. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of arotinin, tranasamic acid, or recombian factor VII for preventing comlplications after heart transplantaion.
Recombinant human coagulation factor VII (r‐FVIIIa) versus tranexemic acid or aprotin for preventing blood transfusion‐related complications after major surgery for cancer
Background 
Major surgery for cancers such as colorectal, breast, and head and neck cancer often requires large blood transfusions. Blood transfusions can lead to complications such as allergic reactions, transfusion reactions, and transmission of infectious diseases. In addition, blood transfusional complications may contribute to the development of thrombosis and embolism. Recombinant human co‐agulation factors VII (rh‐FVFVII) and tranexememic acid (TXA) are drugs that have been used to prevent blood transfusal complications. Aprotin is a drug that has been used in the past to prevent complications associated with blood transfuses. This review examines the evidence for the use of rh‐FVIIFVII, TXA, or a protin for the prevention of blood transfuional complications after surgery for a cancer. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared rh‐FI‐VII with TXA or a pro tin for the prevenion of blood trasfusion related complications after majo r surgery for cancer. We found 11 RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. The trials involved 1, 104 participants who underwent major surgery. The studies were conducted in the USA, Europe, Australia, and Japan. The average age of the participants was 62 years, and the majority of them were male. The participants had undergone surgery for colorectal (n = 1 011), breast (n= 1), or head and neck cancer (n = 92). The participants received either rh‐VI‐VIII or TXA (n = 1 104) or arotin (n  = 1 04) as a prophylactic measure. The duration of follow‐up ranged from 30 days to 60 days. The primary outcome was death within 60 d ays. The secondary outcomes were thrombo embolic events, primary graft non‐funciton, graft faiure, re transplan tation, serious adverse event s, and transfusion re quired. 
Key results 
The overall quality of the evidence was moderate to low. The evidence was current to 15 November 2017. The results of the trials showed that there was no significant difference in the risk of death within the first 60 day s between the rh‐VⅧ and TXA groups (RR 1. 51;95% C I 0. 33 to. 6 95). There was no signi ficant difference in thrombo embo lic events between the two groups (2 tr ials; 2 4 / 1, 85 (13. 0%) n the r h‐V VII group versus. 8 / 8 1 (9. 9%) n th e TXA group; R R 1 : 38;95 % C I. 65 to.. 29). There were also no signif icant differences in primary graft necrosis, graft necro sis, re transplantatio n, serious ad verse events, or transfusion required between the three groups. However, the confidence int ervals were wide. The risk of thrombo embryolic events was lower in the rh ‐VⅨ group than in the TXA and arotinin groups (1 trial; 1 / 91 (1.3%) n TXA versus 0 / 87 (0%) arotini; RR. 2. 20;95%. CI. 38 to. ) 12. 64).

Aprotinin, transexamic acid, recombinant factor VIIa, and thrombo‐elastometry for preventing allogenic blood transfusions in patients undergoing major surgery for liver transplantation 
Background 
Liver transplantation is a major surgical procedure that requires large amounts of blood transfuses. Blood transfusions can increase the risk of complications such as infection, organ rejection, and death. Aprotinin is a drug that has been used to reduce the need for blood transfuse during major surgery. Transexamic acids are drugs that have been used in some countries to reduce blood loss during surgery. Recombinant factor VII is a protein that is used to treat bleeding problems. Thromboelasting is a test that measures how well blood clots. This review looked at the effects of aprotini, transeamic acid (also known as tranexemic acid), recombinan factor VII, and thomboelasting on the need to transfuse blood during liver transplantation. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 14 November 2017. We found 11 studies with 1066 participants. All studies were conducted in high‐income countries. The studies compared aprotin, transecamic acid or recombinatn factor VII with a placebo (dummy treatment). The studies were performed in patients who had undergone liver transplantation and had received a liver transplant from a living donor. The mean age of the patients was 44 years. The majority of the participants were male. The participants were followed up for a mean period of 12 months. 
Key results 
The studies did not show any difference in the number of deaths between the groups receiving aprotinine, tranexcamic acid. recombinent factor VII or thromboelestography and the control groups. However the confidence interval was wide and it was not possible t conclude whether there was a difference in mortality between the treatment and control group. The number of patients who needed a blood transfus was lower in the apotrine group than in the control goup (SMD ‐ 0.61; mean difference ‐ 8. 4 per cent; 100% confidence interval ‐ 12. 1 per cent to ‐ 4. 9 per cent). The number o f patients who received a blood transfu was lower i n the transecemic acid group than i n t he control group(SMD ‐‐0. 27; mean differnce ‐ 2. 6 per cent ; 100 % confidenc interval ‐5. 8 per cent t o 0 per cent).

Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evide nce was moderate to low. The main limitation of the studies was the small number of participants. The quality of evidence was also limited by the lack of reporting of important outcomes such as quality of lfe and serious adverse event s.  Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to determine whether aprotine, tranecamic acid recombin ant factor VII and thromb o elasting are effective in reducing the need fo blood transfu se during liver transplan tation. The evidence is also
Aprotin, recombiinant factor VII and thromboplastography for reducing blood loss during surgery
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effects of three drugs on blood loss in people undergoing surgery. 
Background 
Blood loss is common during surgery and can lead to anaemia, infection, and death. Blood transfusions are often used to replace lost blood, but they can cause adverse reactions and increase the risk of infection. Aprotinin is a drug that has been used to reduce blood transfusion after surgery. Recombinant factor Vila is a synthetic version of a protein that helps blood clot. Thromboelstography is a test that measures how well blood clots. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 15 November 2016. We included 11 studies involving 439 participants. All studies were conducted in high‐income countries. The studies compared aprotin (a drug that reduces blood clotting), recombinanct factor VII (a synthetic version o f a protein involved in blood clot formation), or thromboeplastography (a test that assesses blood clot strength) with placebo (a dummy treatment) or another intervention. 
Key results 
The studies showed that aprotini, recombinate factor VII, and thomboelastograpghy may reduce blood losses and transfusions. However the evidence is not strong enough to support the use of these interventions. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. This means that we are uncertain whether the interventions have an effect on blood transfusions, and we do not know if the interventions are safe. 
Conclusions 
More research is needed to determine whether aprotinis, recombinations factor VII or thromboplastography are effective and safe for reducing transfusions after surgery in people having surgery for cancer."
"Background
Hyperbilirubinaemia occurs in approximately two‐thirds of all newborns during the first days of life and is frequently treated with phototherapy. Although generally seen as safe, there is rising concern regarding phototherapy and its potentially damaging effects on DNA and increased side effects particularly for preterm infants. Other methods, such as enteral feeding supplementation with prebiotics, may have an effective use in the management of hyperbilirubinaemia in neonates. 
Objectives
To determine whether administration of prebiotics reduces the incidence of hyperbilirubinaemia among term and preterm infants compared with enteral supplementation of milk with distilled water/placebo or no supplementation. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2018, Issue 5), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 14 June 2018), Embase (1980 to 14 June 2018), and CINAHL (1982 to 14 June 2018). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomised trials. 
Selection criteria
We considered all RCTs that studied neonates comparing enteral feeding supplementation with prebiotics versus distilled water/placebo or no supplementation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers screened papers and extracted data from selected papers. We used a fixed‐effect method in combining the effects of studies that were sufficiently similar. We then used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
Three small studies evaluating 154 infants were included in this review. One study reported a significant reduction in the risk of hyperbilirubinaemia and rate of treatment with phototherapy associated with enteral supplementation with prebiotics (risk ratio (RR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.58 to 0.97; one study, 50 infants; low‐quality evidence). Meta‐analyses of two studies showed no significant difference in maximum plasma unconjugated bilirubin levels in infants with prebiotic supplementation (mean difference (MD) 0.14 mg/dL, 95% CI ‐0.91 to 1.20, I² = 81%, P = 0.79; two studies, 78 infants; low‐quality evidence). There was no evidence of a significant difference in duration of phototherapy between the prebiotic and control groups, which was only reported by one study (MD 0.10 days, 95% CI ‐2.00 to 2.20; one study, 50 infants; low‐quality evidence). The meta‐analyses of two studies demonstrated a significant reduction in the length of hospital stay (MD ‐10.57 days, 95% CI ‐17.81 to ‐3.33; 2 studies, 78 infants; I² = 0%, P = 0.004; low‐quality evidence). Meta‐analysis of the three studies showed a significant increase in stool frequency in the prebiotic groups (MD 1.18, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.46, I² = 90%; 3 studies, 154 infants; high‐quality evidence). No significant difference in mortality during hospital stay after enteral supplementation with prebiotics was reported (typical RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.14 to 6.19; I² = 6%, P = 0.95; 2 studies; 78 infants; low‐quality evidence). There were no reports of the need for exchange transfusion and incidence of acute bilirubin encephalopathy, chronic bilirubin encephalopathy, and major neurodevelopmental disability in the included studies. None of the included studies reported any side effects. 
Authors' conclusions
Current studies are unable to provide reliable evidence about the effectiveness of prebiotics on hyperbilirubinaemia. Additional large, well‐designed RCTs should be undertaken in neonates that compare effects of enteral supplementation with prebiotics on neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia with supplementation of milk with any other placebo (particularly distilled water) or no supplementation.","Prebiotics for preventing hyperbilirubaemia in newborns 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of pre‐biotics on preventing hyper‐bilirubinemia in term and premature babies. 
Background 
Hyperbilirubaemias occur in approximately 2/3 of all babies during the initial days of their life. Hyperbilirubaeminia is often treated with light therapy. Although light therapy is generally regarded as safe and effective, there are concerns that it may cause damage to the baby's DNA and increase side effects, especially in premature babies who are more susceptible to damage. Another method of treating hyperbiliruaemia is the administration of probiotics, which are beneficial bacteria that can be found in the gut. Probiotics may help prevent hyperbiliruabemia by improving the gut flora of the baby. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for random controlled trials that compared the administration with pre‐biotics versus distilled or placebo water or no treatment. We included three small studies that evaluated 154 babies. All studies were conducted in hospitals in Europe and Asia. 
Key results 
The studies did not show any significant differences in the number of babies with hyperbilirubahemia or the need for light therapy between the prebiotis and control groups. However, the studies did show that prebiotiics reduced the number and severity of jaundice in premature infants. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was low because of the small number of studies and the lack of information about the duration of follow‐up. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of pre ‐biotics as a treatment for hyperbiliruhemia in babies. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of pre biotics in preventing hyper bilirubinaemias in newborn babies.
Prebiotics for neonatal jaundice
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether prebiotically supplemented formula reduces the risk of neonatal bilirubinaemic jaundices in newborns. 
Background 
Jaundice is a common condition in newborn babies. It occurs when there is an accumulation of bilirubins in the blood. High levels of bilirubs can cause serious complications, such as brain damage. The most effective way to treat neonatal haemolytic disease is to reduce the amount of bilirbin in the baby's blood. This is achieved by giving the baby extra light through a special lamp called phototherapy. Phototherapy is usually given for at least 48 hours. 
Prebiotic supplements are added to formula to promote the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut. These bacteria help to break down food and absorb nutrients. They also produce substances that may help to prevent infections. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing prebioteic supplemented formula with either placebo (distilled water) supplemented formula or no supplement. We included studies that compared prebiotes with placebo or no prebiotide supplementation. We did not include studies that used probiotics (live bacteria) or prebiotine (a synthetic substance). We included only studies that measured the effect of pre biotics on bilirubine levels in newborn infants. 
We found three studies that met our inclusion criteria. Two studies compared pre biotic supplemented formula to placebo supplemented formula. One study compared pre biotic supplemented formula versus no supplement (distillated water). All three studies were conducted in hospitals in Europe. 
Key results 
The studies found no difference in the amount and duration of bilirubaemia in newborn infanats who received prebiotec supplemented formula compared with those who received placebo supplemented or no supplemented formula (low quality evidence). However, the studies found that babies who received the pre biotice supplemented formula had shorter hospital stays than those who did not receive the pre biotice supplemented (low‐quality evdence). 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low. This means that the results of the studies are uncertain and that we cannot be confident that the findings are accurate. 
Future research 
More studies are needed to determine whether pre biotes have any effect on neonate bilirubiaemia. We need to conduct large, high‐caliber RCTS that compare the effects of pre bionics with placebo (or no supplement) on neonates. We also need to consider the potential benefits and harms of prebionics in neonatal care.","Prebiotics for preventing hyperbilirubaemia in newborns 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of pre‐biotics on the prevention of hyper‐bilirubinemia in term and premature newborns. 
Background 
Hyperbilirubaemias occur in approximately 2/3 of all babies in the first few days of their life. Hyperbilirubaemic jaundice can be treated with light therapy. However, there are concerns about the potential harmful effects of light therapy on DNA. Prebiotics are substances that promote the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut. They may help prevent hyperbiliruaemia by promoting the growth and activity of beneficial gut bacteria. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for random controlled trials that compared prebiotis with distilled or placebo water in newborn infants. We found three small studies involving 154 newborns that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
One study showed that prebiots reduced the risk and rate at which newborns needed phototherapy for hyperbiliruemia. However we are uncertain if prebiotes reduce the risk or rate of hyperbiliuemia in premature newborn. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was very low because of the small number of studies and the lack of information about the duration of follow‐up.
Prebiotics for neonatal jaundice
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about whether prebiotically supplemented formula reduces the risk of neonatal bilirubinaemic jaundices in newborns. 
Background 
Neonatal jaun-dice is a common condition in newborn babies. It occurs when there is too much bilirubine in the blood. High levels of bilirubinate can cause damage to the brain and eyes. Newborns are at higher risk of developing jaundicemore than older children. The most effective way to reduce the risk is to give them extra vitamin C and E, and to keep their skin clean. However, these methods do not prevent jaundicedeces in all newborns, and some newborns may develop jaundicerelatively quickly. 
Prebiotic supplements are substances that contain non‐digestible carbohydrates that promote the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut. They have been shown to improve gut health in adults and children. We wanted to know if they could also help prevent neonatal jau-dice. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared prebioteic supplementation with formula to either no supplementation or placebo (distilled water). We found three RCTS that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted in different countries and had different numbers of participants. All three studies were small, and none of them were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
Key results 
The studies did not show any differences in the amount of bilirubenin in the newborns' blood between the groups that received prebiotes and those that did not. The studies also did not find any differences between the two groups in the number of days that the newborn stayed in hospital. However the studies did show that the prebietic group had more frequent bowel movements than the control group. The quality of the evidence was low because the studies were too small and did not report on important outcomes such as the number and severity of jaundiccerevents. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was generally low because of the small number of participants in each study and the lack of reporting on important outcome measures. 
Future research 
More research is needed to determine whether prebites can help prevent jaundice in newborn infants. Future studies should include larger numbers of infants and report on more important outcomes.

"Background
Across the developed world, an estimated 150,000 to 300,000 people are treated annually with pelvic radiotherapy and 80% will develop gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms during treatment. Acute GI symptoms are associated with a greater risk of chronic, often debilitating, GI symptoms. Up to one‐third of patients are malnourished before pelvic radiotherapy and up to four‐fifths of patients lose weight during treatment. Malnutrition is linked to a higher risk of GI toxicity, which can lead to breaks in radiotherapy and early cessation of chemotherapy, thus compromising the efficacy of the primary cancer treatment. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of nutritional interventions for reducing GI toxicity in adults undergoing radical pelvic radiotherapy. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group's Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Issue 4, 2012, MEDLINE and EMBASE to May 2012. We handsearched the citation lists of included studies and previous systematic reviews identified to identify further relevant trials. 
Selection criteria
We included studies if they were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or non‐randomised studies with concurrent comparison groups including quasi‐randomised trials, cluster RCTs, non‐randomised trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, and case series of 30 or more patients. We only included studies if they assessed the effect of a nutritional intervention in adults aged 18 years or over undergoing radical pelvic radiotherapy as part of anticancer treatment for a primary pelvic malignancy. We excluded patients with stomas and a previous history of inflammatory bowel disease. Nutritional support interventions could be provided at any stage before or during pelvic radiotherapy and included dietary counselling; dietary modification of fibre, lactose or fat; supplementary foods or drinks or fortified foods; standard oral nutrition supplements including polymeric‐, peptide‐ or amino acid‐based supplements and those where novel substrates have been added; enteral tube feeds; or parenteral nutrition (partial or total). We excluded probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors to obtain missing data. We assessed bias for each of the included studies using the bias assessment tables in the Cochrane software Review Manager5. We performed meta‐analysis, when indicated, using the Mantel‐Haenszel fixed‐effect method or inverse variance fixed‐effect method displayed with heterogeneity. We undertook meta‐analyses on trials evaluating dietary modification against standard treatment for diarrhoea at the end of radiotherapy and for change in weight from baseline to end of radiotherapy. 
Main results
The searches identified 7558 titles, and we excluded 7513 during title and abstract searches. We reviewed 45 papers in full, and excluded 39. We identified four studies on handsearching of the references, which, along with the six eligible papers from the database search, led to 10 studies being included. Four studies, three of which were RCTs and one prospective study, investigated the effect of elemental diet on GI symptoms; one RCT investigated the effect of dietary modification and elemental diet; and five RCTs investigated dietary modification. Studies were varied in terms of risk of bias. Data were dichotomised for presence and absence of diarrhoea at the end of radiotherapy for four trials evaluating dietary modification comprising modified fat, lactose, fibre or combinations of these dietary changes. A reduction in diarrhoea was demonstrated with nutritional intervention (risk ratio (RR) 0.66; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 0.87, four studies, 413 participants, moderate quality of evidence) with low heterogeneity (Chi2 = 3.50, I2 = 14%). Two trials evaluating dietary modification on weight change (comparing baseline and end of radiotherapy) showed no difference between intervention or control (mean difference (MD) ‐0.57 kg; 95% CI ‐1.22 to 0.09) with low heterogeneity (Chi2 = 1.41, I2 = 29%). Generally adverse effects were poorly reported in included studies. Elemental diet in particular was poorly tolerated. GI symptoms or toxicity > 6 months after radiotherapy was not reported in included studies 
Authors' conclusions
There have been benefits demonstrated with dietary modification during pelvic radiotherapy to reduce diarrhoea. Those diets included single interventions or combinations of modified fat, lactose‐restriction, fat‐restriction and fibre supplementation. We were unable to meta‐analyse elemental diet, as data were not available. We considered some of the studies to be at high risk of bias. There have been recent advances in novel, more targeted radiotherapy techniques, such that the findings of older studies need to be interpreted with caution. In addition, there were problems with compliance and palatability with some of the interventions, particularly elemental diet, which limits its usefulness in clinical practice.","Nutritional interventions for preventing gastrointestinal symptoms in adults receiving pelvic radio‐therapy
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of nutritional support interventions for adults receiving radical pelvic radiation therapy. 
Background 
Pelvic radiation therapy is used to treat cancers of the cervix, uterus, vagina, prostate, bladder, and rectum. Radiation therapy involves directing high‐energy rays at the tumour site. This can cause damage to the surrounding healthy tissues, including the intestines. This damage can result in symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and weight loss. These symptoms can be severe and may last for months after treatment has finished. 
Nutritional support is important for maintaining health and preventing complications. It is also important for supporting the body's ability to recover from treatment. Nutrients help the body repair damaged tissues and maintain its normal functions. 
This review looked at the evidence for nutritional interventions to prevent gastrointestinal symptoms during pelvic radiation. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to May, 2009. We found 11 studies involving 1,046 participants. All studies were conducted in Europe and North America. The studies compared different types of nutritional intervention. Some studies compared a nutritional supplement with no intervention, while others compared two different nutritional supplements. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to May. 2007. 
There was no evidence to suggest that nutritional interventions reduce gastrointestinal symptoms. 
We found no evidence that nutritional supplements reduce the risk of developing gastrointestinal symptoms or improve quality of life. 
The quality of the evidence was low because of the small number of studies and the lack of information on the type of nutritional supplement used. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The overall quality of evidence was very low. The evidence was current to 2006. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of the finding was low. There was no clear evidence that any nutritional intervention reduced gastrointestinal symptoms, improved quality of live, or reduced the risk factors for malnutrition. 
What does this mean? 
More research is needed to determine whether nutritional interventions can help prevent gastrointestinal side effects during pelvic cancer treatment and improve quality‐of‐life outcomes.

Dietary modification for people with radiation‐induced diarrhoeal disease 
Background 
Radiation therapy can cause diarrhoeas in patients with cancer. Diarrhoea can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, malnutrition and poor quality of life. Nutritional support is important for maintaining health and preventing complications. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect on diarrhoeis of dietary modifications, including elemental diets, for people who have had radiation therapy. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective studies comparing dietary modifications with standard treatment. We found 10 RCT studies, which included 413 people. The studies were conducted in Europe, North America and Australia. 
Key results 
We found that dietary modification may reduce the incidence of diarroea in people who had radiation‐therapy‐induce diarrhoeae. However, there was no clear evidence that dietary modifications improve weight gain. We did not find any evidence that the type of dietary intervention used affected the outcome. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate. 
Conclusions 
Diet may help reduce the occurrence of diarrhae in people with radiotherapy‐related diarrhoe. However more research is needed to determine whether dietary modification improves weight gain and reduces the duration of diarrhoa. 
What is diarrhoe? 
Diarrhoe is a common symptom of many diseases. It is characterised by loose, watery stools. People with diarrhoe often lose fluids and electrolytes, which can lead t dehydration, malabsorption and poor nutrition. Diarrrhoe can be caused by infection, inflammation, or other factors. 
How does radiation therapy cause diarrhoae? 
Radiant energy can damage the lining of the intestines, leading to diarrhoe, inflammation and malabsorptioin. 
Why is dietary modification important? 
Detary modification may help manage diarrhoe by reducing the frequency of diarrheic episodes. It may also help improve absorption of nutrients and reduce the severity of diarrhaoe. 
Diarrrhoea is a complication of radiation therapy, and it can occur at any time during or after treatment. It can be difficult to treat, and may require hospitalisation. 
People with diarrhroe may experience dehydration, weight loss, and poor appetite. They may also have abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. 
Nutritional support, including dietary modification, is important to maintain health and prevent complications. Dietary modification may include the use of elemental diets (diets consisting of single ingredients), or the addition of certain nutrients such as fibre, lactulose, or fructooligosaccharides. 
This review looked at the effect o f dietary modification for diarrhroa in peopel who had received radiation therapy for cancer. We searched for studies that compared dietary modification with standard care. We included 10 randomised trials, which involved 413 peopoe. 
The evidence suggests that dietary modiflcation may reduce diarrhoe in peopl with radiation therapy‐inducde diarrhoe but we need more research to determine if dietary modification can improve weight gai and reduce diarrhoe.
Dietary modification during radiotherapy for cancer of the cervix, vagina, vulva, penis, prostate, bladder, rectum, anus, or oesophagus
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of the review was to assess the effects of dietary modification in patients undergoing radiotherapy. 
Key messages 
Diet may help reduce diarrhœa in people having radiotherapy, but we do not know if it improves other side effects. 
We found only two studies that compared dietary modification with standard care. One study found that a diet that was low in fat and lactose reduced diarrhæa. The second study found no difference in diarrhÆa between the two groups. 
There were problems in reporting adverse events in the studies we included. 
What was studied in the review?  Radiotherapy is a treatment that uses high energy rays to kill cancer cells. It can cause diarrhâeas, nausea, vomiting, and other side‐effects. A diet that is low in fats and lactase (an enzyme that breaks down lactose) may help to reduce these side‐effect symptoms. 
Why is this important?  Diarrhâea can be very uncomfortable and may lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. It may also make it difficult for people to take their medication. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?
The evidence is current to October 2017.
What are the main results of the study? 
We included two studies in this review. Both studies compared dietary modifications with standard treatment. One of the two studies found that people who had a diet low in lactose had less diarrhäeas than those who did not have this diet. The other study found there was no difference. 
One study found adverse events were poorly recorded. 
Which groups of people are most likely to benefit from this review?

People with cancer of any type of the following organs: cervix (the lower part of the uterus), vagina (the canal that connects the cervyx to the outside of the body), vulva (the external part of a woman's genital area), penis, bladder (the organ that stores urine), rectum (the last part of your large intestine), anus (the opening at the end of the large intestine where stool comes out), or ooesophagus (the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach). 
What are limitations of the evidence? 
There are few studies that have looked at this topic. We could not combine the results of different studies because they were very different. We also did not find any studies that looked at other side effect symptoms.  What are the implications of the findings? 
Detary modification may help people who have radiotherapy by reducing diarrhaea. However, we do no know if this helps with other side‑effects.  How up‐do date is this information? 
This information is current as of October 2007.  Why is this a important question? 
Diarrhæas can be uncomfortable and can lead to problems such as dehydration and imbalance of electrolytes. It is also difficult for patients to take medication when they have diarrhääeas.  Are there any limitations of this question?  There are few good studies that look at this question. We combined the results from different studies, but they were different.  We did not look at other symptoms such as nausea and vomiting.  Can you tell us if you have any questions about this question or any other questions?

Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of nutritional support interventions for adults receiving radical pelvic radiation therapy. 
Background 
Pelvic radiation therapy is used to treat cancers of the cervix, uterus, vagina, prostate, bladder, and rectum. It involves delivering high doses of radiation to the pelvic area. Radiation therapy can cause damage to the digestive system, leading to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and weight loss. These symptoms can be severe and may last for several months after treatment. Nutrient deficiencies are common in people receiving pelvic radiation. Nutrients such as vitamin B12, iron, and calcium are important for maintaining healthy digestive function. 
Study characteristics 
We found 11 studies involving 1,036 participants. All studies were conducted in Europe or North America. The studies compared different types of nutritional supplements, including dietary counselling, dietary modifications, and supplements given by mouth or through a feeding tube. The duration of the studies ranged from six weeks to two years. 
Key results 
The evidence suggests that nutritional interventions may reduce the severity of acute gastrointestinal symptoms in people undergoing pelvic radiation, but there is no clear evidence that they reduce the incidence of these symptoms. There is also no clear difference between the types of nutrients used in the interventions. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. This means that we are uncertain about the results of the trials. The main reasons for this uncertainty are that the trials were small and did not include enough participants to show whether the interventions had a real effect on the outcome measures. 
Conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend nutritional interventions as a way to prevent gastrointestinal side effects of pelvic radiation in adults. However, further research is needed to determine whether nutritional interventions can help prevent gastrointestinal complications in people having pelvic radiation for cancer.
Dietary modification for people with cancer of the rectum or anus
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the benefits and harms of dietary modifications for people who have had radiotherapy to treat cancer of their rectum (backside) or anus (bottom). 
Background 
Cancer of the backside or bottom is a rare disease. Radiotherapy is often used to treat this disease. However, radiotherapy can cause problems such as diarrhoeas, weight loss and other gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Dietary modifications may help to reduce these problems. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared dietary modifications with standard treatment. We found 10 trials involving 413 people. Four trials evaluated the effect on GI symptom improvement, one trial evaluated the impact on weight loss, and five trials evaluated dietary modification alone. 
Key results 
We found that dietary modifications may improve diarrhoeal symptoms in people who had radio‐therapy for cancer of either the back or bottom. However we did not find any evidence that dietary modification improves weight loss. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate. 
Certainty of the findings 
We are very uncertain whether dietary modifications improve diarrheal symptoms. We are uncertain whether they improve weight loss or if they cause any harm. 
What does this mean? 
More research is needed to determine whether dietary modification is beneficial for people treated with radiotherapy, and what type of dietary intervention is most effective.

Dietary modification during radiotherapy for cancer of the cervix
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effect of dietary modification (dietary advice) during radio‐therapy for cervical cancer. 
Background 
Cervical cancer is the most common gynaecological cancer worldwide. Radiotherapy is one of the main treatments for cervical cancers. Radio‐therapy can cause side effects such as diarrhoeas. Diets that are high in fibre, low in fat and lactose may help to reduce these side effects. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing dietary modification with standard care during radio therapy for cervical carcinoma. We found four RCTs involving 104 women. All studies were conducted in Europe. 
Key results 
We found that dietary modification reduced diarrhoeic episodes during radiotherapies. However, we were unable t o combine the results of the four studies because of differences in how they measured diarrhoeal episodes. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the overall evidence was moderate. The quality of each study was low to moderate. 
Certainty of the findings 
We were uncertain whether dietary modification would improve quality of life or reduce the number of people who had to stop radiotherapy due to side effects, as there was no information on these outcomes. We also did not know if dietary modification affected the length of time that patients needed to take radiotherapy or if it affected the type of radio‐therapeutic treatment used. 
What does this mean? 
We are uncertain about the effects of dietary modifications on quality of live and the ability to continue radiotherapy. We are also uncertain about whether dietary modifications affect the length or type of treatment. 
Future research 
More research is needed to determine the effects on quality‐of‐life and the length and type of the treatment. More research is also needed to find out whether dietary changes can be tolerated by patients."
"Background
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) often complicates the clinical course of cancer. The risk is further increased by chemotherapy, but the trade‐off between safety and efficacy of primary thromboprophylaxis in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy is uncertain. This is the third update of a review first published in February 2012. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of primary thromboprophylaxis for VTE in ambulatory cancer patients receiving chemotherapy compared with placebo or no thromboprophylaxis, or an active control intervention. 
Search methods
For this update, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 3 August 2020. We also searched the reference lists of identified studies and contacted content experts and trialists for relevant references. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing any oral or parenteral anticoagulant or mechanical intervention to no thromboprophylaxis or placebo, or comparing two different anticoagulants. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data on risk of bias, participant characteristics, interventions, and outcomes including symptomatic VTE and major bleeding as the primary effectiveness and safety outcomes, respectively. We applied GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
We identified six additional randomised controlled trials (3326 participants) for this update, bringing the included study total to 32 (15,678 participants), all evaluating pharmacological interventions and performed mainly in people with locally advanced or metastatic cancer. The certainty of the evidence ranged from high to very low across the different outcomes and comparisons. The main limiting factors were imprecision and risk of bias. 
Thromboprophylaxis with direct oral anticoagulants (direct factor Xa inhibitors apixaban and rivaroxaban) may decrease the incidence of symptomatic VTE (risk ratio (RR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 1.06; 3 studies, 1526 participants; low‐certainty evidence); and probably increases the risk of major bleeding compared with placebo (RR 1.74, 95% CI 0.82 to 3.68; 3 studies, 1494 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
When compared with no thromboprophylaxis, low‐molecular‐weight heparin (LMWH) reduced the incidence of symptomatic VTE (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.83; 11 studies, 3931 participants; high‐certainty evidence); and probably increased the risk of major bleeding events (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.35; 15 studies, 7282 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
In participants with multiple myeloma, LMWH resulted in lower symptomatic VTE compared with the vitamin K antagonist warfarin (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.83; 1 study, 439 participants; high‐certainty evidence), while LMWH probably lowers symptomatic VTE more than aspirin (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.17; 2 studies, 781 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Major bleeding was observed in none of the participants with multiple myeloma treated with LMWH or warfarin and in less than 1% of those treated with aspirin. 
Only one study evaluated unfractionated heparin against no thromboprophylaxis, but did not report on VTE or major bleeding. 
When compared with placebo or no thromboprophylaxis, warfarin may importantly reduce symptomatic VTE (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.20; 1 study, 311 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and may result in a large increase in major bleeding (RR 3.82, 95% CI 0.97 to 15.04; 4 studies, 994 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
One study evaluated antithrombin versus no antithrombin in children. This study did not report on symptomatic VTE but did report any VTE (symptomatic and incidental VTE). The effect of antithrombin on any VTE and major bleeding is uncertain (any VTE: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.73; major bleeding: RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.03 to 18.57; 1 study, 85 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
In ambulatory cancer patients, primary thromboprophylaxis with direct factor Xa inhibitors may reduce the incidence of symptomatic VTE (low‐certainty evidence) and probably increases the risk of major bleeding (moderate‐certainty evidence) when compared with placebo. LMWH decreases the incidence of symptomatic VTE (high‐certainty evidence), but increases the risk of major bleeding (moderate‐certainty evidence) when compared with placebo or no thromboprophylaxis. Evidence for the use of thromboprophylaxis with anticoagulants other than direct factor Xa inhibitors and LMWH is limited. More studies are warranted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of primary prophylaxis in specific types of chemotherapeutic agents and types of cancer, such as gastrointestinal or genitourinary cancer.","Anticoagulation for preventing venous thrombosis in people undergoing chemotherapy for cancer
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the benefits and harms of taking medicines to prevent blood clots in people who have cancer and are having chemotherapy. 
Background 
Blood clots can form in the veins of the legs or arms and can travel to the lungs (pulmonary embolism) or brain (stroke). Blood clots are more likely to occur in people having chemotherapy for their cancer. Chemotherapy can increase the risk by damaging the lining of the veins. 
Medicines called anticoaguants (blood thinners) can be taken to prevent the formation of blood clOTS. Anticoagants work by interfering with the way that blood clumps together. There are many different types of anticoaugants, some of which are taken orally (by mouth) and others are given by injection. 
Study characteristics 
We found 32 studies involving 15,679 people with cancer who had chemotherapy. Most of these studies were conducted in Europe or North America. The studies compared anticoaguaants with placebo, no treatment, or another type of antithrombotic therapy. 
Key results 
The evidence suggests that anticoagues may reduce the number of people who develop blood clods in the legs and lungs. However, the evidence is not strong enough to say whether this is true. The evidence also shows that anticaugants may increase the number oof people who bleed. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. This means that we are not confident in the results. The quality of evidence was low because the studies were small, and the studies did not report all the important facts about the studies. 
Conclusions 
More research is needed to find out if anticoague therapy is safe and effective for preventing blood clotts in people getting chemotherapy for cancer.
Thromboprotection for people at risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE)
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the benefits and harms of different types of thrombophylaxis (medicines to prevent blood clots) for preventing VTE in people who are at risk. We looked at the effects of anticoalagulant drugs (drugs that prevent blood clotting) and low‐ and high‐molecule‐weight (LMW and HMW) heparins (drug that prevents blood clot formation) for people who were at risk for VTE. 
Background 
VTE includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism. DVT occurs when a blood clot forms in the deep veins of the legs. Pulmonary embolus occurs when the blood clot breaks loose and travels to the lungs. VTE can be life‐threatening and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. People at risk include those who have had previous VTE, are immobile, have cancer, or have other conditions such as heart failure or atrial fibrillation. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different types and doses of thrombo‐prophylaxis for people with VTE risk factors. We included RCTs that compared LMW and high molecular weight heparine (HMW) with placebo, no thrombo prophylaxis or other types of antithrombotic therapy. We also included RCTS that compared anticoaguants with each other. 
Key results 
We found 16 RCTS that included 10,434 participants. Anticoagulant therapy probably reduces the incidence and severity of VTE and probably lowers the risk for death from VTE but probably increases major bleeding risk. Low‐molecules‐weight heparin probably reduces VTE incidence and probably decreases the risk to death from any cause but probably lowers major bleeding risks. High‐molecu‐le‐weight‐heparin probably lowers VTE occurrence and probably reduces death from all causes but probably raises major bleeding rates. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is generally low to moderate. This is because the evidence is based on small numbers of participants and there is a lack of consistency in the results. The evidence is also limited by the heterogeneity of the studies and the lack of reporting of important outcomes such as death from non‐VTE causes. 
Conclusions 
Anticoagulation therapy probably lowers risk of VETE and probably raises the risk or major bleed. Low molecular weight heparins probably lowers incidence of VTEE and probably lower risk of death from other causes but raises major bleed risk. High molecular weight‐heparrins probably lower VTE rate and probably reduce death from various causes but raise major bleed rates. More research is needed to determine the optimal type and dose of thrompo prophylactic therapy for people in need of thrompro prophylaxia.
Direct factor X inhibitors versus placebo or other anticoaguants for preventing venous thromboembolism in people undergoing chemotherapy for cancer
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety (e.g. bleeding) of direct factor inhibitors (e g warfarins, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) versus placebo (no treatment) or other types of anticoaugulants (e. g. low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs), unfractionate heparine) for preventing blood clots (venous thrombosis (VTE)) in people who have cancer and are receiving chemotherapy. 
Background 
Cancer treatment can cause blood clotts to form in the veins (deep vein thromboses (DVTs)) and arteries (pulmonary embolisms (PEs)). Cancer treatment also increases the chance of blood clott formation in the legs (superficial thrombophlebitis (STP)) and lungs (pneumonia). Blood clots can be life‐threatening. 
The main treatment for preventing DVTs and PEs is anticoaquation therapy. Anticoagulation therapy involves giving drugs that prevent blood clot formation. There are many different anticoagues available, including direct factor XI inhibitors (warfarins), LMWHs, unfractioned heparines, and others. 
This review looked at the evidence for the effectiveness of direct factors XI inhibitors versus no treatment or other treatments for preventing VTE in people with cancer who are receiving chemotherapies. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 31 January 2017. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared direct factor Xi inhibitors with no treatment, placebo, or other therapies for preventing thrombocytopenia in people receiving chemotherapy for any type of cancer. We excluded studies that compared different types of direct inhibitors. We found four RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to January 31, 2016. 
We found one study that compared antithombin with no anticoague. This was a small study that included 85 adults with cancer. The study did find that antithombin reduced the risk (risk ratio (RR) 0.84, with 95 % confidence interval (CI) 041 to 173) of developing any blood clot, but we were unable to determine whether this was due to a reduction in DVT or PE. The evidence for this study is very low quality. 
There is currently no evidence to support the use or non‐use of direct Xa inhibitor therapy for preventing cancer‐related VTE. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is generally low to moderate. The studies were small and had few participants. The quality of evidence is further reduced by the fact that the studies were conducted in different settings and used different methods. 
Future research 
More studies are needed to evaluate whether direct factor xi inhibitors are effective and safe for preventing cancers‐related blood clouts in people having chemotherapy for different types and stages of cancer and different types or doses of chemotherapy.","Anticoagulation for preventing venous thrombosis in people undergoing chemotherapy for cancer
Review question 
This review aimed to find out whether anticoaguants (blood thinners) can prevent venous blood clots in people who have cancer and are having chemotherapy. 
Background 
Cancer treatment can increase the risk for developing blood clumps in the veins (venous thrombi) and arteries (arterial thrombi). Blood clots can cause serious complications such as pulmonary embolism, which is when a blood clot breaks loose and travels to the lungs. Cancer treatment can also increase the chance of developing blood clotting problems, which can lead to bleeding. Chemotherapy is a common treatment for cancer, and it can increase blood clot risk. Anticoagualtions are used to prevent blood clumping in people at risk of developing venous or arterial clots. 
Study characteristics 
We found 32 studies involving 15,578 people with cancer who were having chemotherapy, and these studies compared anticoaugants with no treatment or placebo. The studies were conducted in many countries and involved people with different types of cancer, including breast, lung, colon, prostate, and ovarian cancer. 
Key results 
The certainty of our findings was low or very low for most of the outcomes we looked at. However, we found that anticoaguaunts may reduce the risk (by 43%) of developing a blood clump in the vein (veno‐venous) and may increase the chances of bleeding (by about 174%). 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to very poor. This means that the results of the studies are not reliable and should be interpreted with caution. 
Conclusions 
More research is needed to find the best way to prevent veno‐vein blood clamps in people having chemotherapy for their cancer. More research is also needed to determine if anticoagues can reduce the chances (by more than 43%), of developing clots and if they can increase bleeding.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐''‐‐'‐‐ ''‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐  ‐ ‐‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐
Thromboprotection with anticoaguants for preventing venous thromboembolism in people undergoing surgery 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of anticoaugulants for people undergoing elective surgery. 
Background 
Venous thrombosis (blood clots in veins) is a common complication of surgery. It can cause serious complications such as pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lungs) and deep vein thrombophlebitis (blood vessels in the legs become inflamed and swollen). Anticoagulant drugs are used to prevent blood clots forming in the veins. 
Anticoagulation therapy is usually given to people who have had surgery, especially if they are at high risk of developing blood clotts. There are several types of antithrombotic drugs, including heparins, which are administered intravenously or subcutaneously, and oral anticoagues, which include direct thrombin inhibitors (e.g. dabigatran, rivarroxaban, apixabana) and direct factor X inhibitors (apixaban, rivaroaban). 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing anticoague therapy with placebo, no treatment, or another type of antitrombotics. We included RCTs that compared anticoaque therapy with no treatment or placebo in people having elective surgery, regardless of the type of surgery or the reason for surgery. We excluded RCTS that compared different types of thrombopoietic therapy. 
We found 24 RCT that met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved 10,411 participants. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to August 2017. 
The anticoauant apixaba probably reduces the incidence and severity of venous blood clouts (RR of 0.43, with 95 % confidence interval of 18 to l06; three studies, l526 participants; very low certainty evidence). Apixaba may also increase the risk and severity (RR o f 1.74, with l95 % CI o f.82 to l.68; three st u d i e s, 1 4 9 4 p a r t i c i p a n t s ; m o d e r a t e c e r t a i n e y e v i d e n c e ) major bleeding com p a ra t i n g w i t h p l a c e b o (RR.74, w i th 95.

Primary prophylactic anticoagu
What is the issue? 
Cancer patients often develop blood clots in their veins (venous thromboembolism) or arteries (arterial thromboembolemia). Cancer can cause these blood clotts by causing the blood to become more likely to clot. Blood clots can be life‐threatening and can lead to serious complications, including death. 
How does this review work? 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety (risks) of giving cancer patients medicine to prevent blood clods from forming in their blood vessels. We looked at the evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different types of medicine given to cancer patients to prevent them developing blood cluds. 
What did we find? 
The evidence shows that direct factor inhibitors (e.g. dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) may decrease the number of people who develop blood clot symptoms (veno‐occlusive disease or pulmonary embolism), but may increase the number who have a serious side effect called bleeding. Low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) may also decrease the incidence (number of cases) of blood clotting symptoms, but may also increase the risk (number) of serious bleeding. There was no evidence that anticoagalants (evidence was current up to 31 August 2017) other than factor inhibitors and heparines were effective in preventing blood clod formation. 
Why is this important? 
Blood clots are a common complication of cancer treatment. Blood clotting medicines are used to prevent these clots from forming. However, these medicines can also cause serious bleeding problems. 
This review provides evidence about which medicines are most effective in reducing the number and severity of blood clotting problems in cancer patients. It also shows that some medicines may cause serious side effects. 
Key messages 
Direct factor inhibitors may decrease blood clot formation, but increase the chance of serious side‐effects such as bleeding. LMW heparains may decrease clot formation but increase bleeding. Anticoagulant medicines other than inhibitors and low molecular weight heparins are not yet proven to be effective. 
Future research 
More studies are needed to evaluate how different types and doses of anticoagues work in cancer patient populations. More research is also needed to determine whether anticoaugulation is beneficial or harmful in different types or stages of cancer. 
Background 
Venous thrombosis (blood clots) is a common problem in cancer. Cancer patients are at increased risk of developing venous thrombi due to their disease and its treatment. Venous thrombus can cause serious complications such as pulmonary emboli, which can be fatal. 
Anticoagulation therapy is used to reduce the risk and severity (incidence and severity) of venous clots. Anticogualants are drugs that prevent blood clot forming. Antithrombotic drugs are used in cancer to prevent venous and arterial thromboses. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness of antitrombotics in preventing venous or arterial thrombi in cancer‐related venous disease. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled studies comparing anticoaguaulants with placebo, no anticoagaulation, or another anticoaualnt in cancer related venous diseases. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion, risk of bias, and quality of evidence. We extracted data and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results 
We included 11 studies (994 participants) in the review. The studies were conducted in adults with cancer and were conducted between 1996 and 2015. The evidence was current to 30 August 2107. 
The studies compared anticoaquulants (direct factor inhibitors, LMWH, and unfractional heparan) with placebo (dummy treatment) or no antioagulation. 
We found that direct inhibitors (dabigatram, rivaroaban, and apixabana) may reduce blood clot symptom incidence (veneocclusive or pulmonary embolem), but increase major bleeding risk. LMH (enoxaparin, nadroparin, and dalteparin) may increase blood clot incidence, but decrease major bleeding incidence. 
There was no clear evidence that other anticoauant medications (e. g. fondaparinux, argatroban, and lepirudin) were effective. We found no evidence of a difference in blood clot or major bleed incidence between direct inhibitors and other antioacualnts. 
Certainty of evidence 
The certainty of evidence was low or very low for most of the comparisons."
"Background
A pressure ulcer is defined as ""an area of localized injury to the skin and/or underlying tissue, usually over a bony prominence, as a result of pressure, or pressure in combination with shear"". The use of phototherapy ‐ that is, light (or laser) used as an adjuvant, non‐surgical intervention, with the aim of having a therapeutic effect on healing ‐ has increased recently. 
Objectives
To determine the effects of phototherapy on the healing of pressure ulcers.
Search methods
In January 2014, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid EMBASE; Ovid MEDLINE (In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); and EBSCO CINAHL. We did not restrict the search by language or publication date. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of phototherapy (in addition to standard treatment) with sham phototherapy (in addition to standard treatment), another type of phototherapy (in addition to standard treatment) or standard or conventional treatment alone. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors assessed studies for relevance and design according to the selection criteria, extracted data and evaluated study quality. The authors made attempts to obtain missing data by contacting study authors. Disagreement was resolved by consensus and discussion with a third review author. 
Main results
We identified seven RCTs involving 403 participants. All the trials were at unclear risk of bias. Trials compared the use of phototherapy with standard care only (six trials) or sham phototherapy (one trial). Only one of the trials included a third arm in which another type of phototherapy was applied. Overall, there was insufficient evidence to determine the relative effects of phototherapy for healing pressure ulcers. Time to complete healing was reported in three studies. Two studies showed the ultraviolet (UV) treated group had a shorter mean time to complete healing than the control group (mean difference ‐2.13 weeks (95% CI ‐3.53 to ‐0.72, P value 0.003)). One study reported that the laser group had a longer mean time to complete healing than the control group (mean difference 5.77 weeks; 95% CI ‐0.25 to 11.79). However, this result should be interpreted with caution, as these were small studies and the findings may have been due to chance. Three studies reported proportions of ulcers healed with a variety of results. One study reported a different outcome measure, and the other two studies had different treatment durations. These variations did not allow us to pool the studies and draw any conclusions as to whether phototherapy is effective or not. Adverse effects were reported in only two studies that compared phototherapy with control; the risk ratio for adverse events was imprecise. One study reported risk ratio (RR) 0.72 (95%CI 0.18 to 2.80). However, another study reported RR 0.89 (95% CI: 0.71 to 1.12) based on the number of events in each group, rather than the number of people with events. Among five studies reporting the rate of change in ulcer area, three studies found no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Pooling was not undertaken because of differences in outcome measures reported. The results were based on data from trials with unclear risk of bias for which generation of the randomisation sequence, concealment allocation and blinding of outcome assessors were unclear. No studies reported on quality of life, length of hospital stay, pain or cost. 
Authors' conclusions
We are very uncertain as to the effects of phototherapy in treating pressure ulcers. The quality of evidence is very low due to the unclear risk of bias and small number of trials available for analysis. The possibility of benefit or harm of this treatment cannot be ruled out. Further research is recommended.","Phototherapy for pressure ulcer healing
Pressure ulcers are painful wounds that develop when skin and underlying tissues are subjected to prolonged pressure. They can occur on any part of the body but most commonly occur on the legs, hips, and buttocks. Pressure ulcers can be painful and can lead to serious complications such as infection, gangrene and amputation. 
Phototherapy is a form of light therapy that uses light (such as ultraviolet or laser light) to treat wounds. It is thought that phototherapy may help to promote healing of wounds by increasing blood flow to the affected area, reducing pain and promoting the growth of new tissue. 
This review aimed to find out whether phototherapy is effective in treating pressure ulercers. We searched for randomised controlled studies (RCT) that compared phototherapy to standard care or sham (dummy) phototherapy. We found seven RCTS involving 40 participants. These studies compared phototherapies with standard treatment, sham phototheraopy or another type. We were unable to determine if phototherapy helps to heal pressure ulcres. There was insufficient information to determine how long it takes for pressure ulcer wounds to heal. 
The evidence is current to January 2009.
Phototherapy for pressure ulcer healing
Background 
Pressure ulcers are wounds caused by prolonged pressure on the skin. They can be painful and difficult to heal. Phototherapy is a treatment where light is used to promote healing. It is thought that light can help to increase blood flow to the wound, reduce pain and promote healing of the tissue. This review looked at the effect of phototherapies on healing of pressure ulercers. 
Study characteristics 
The evidence is current to November 2017. We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing phototherapy to no treatment or other treatments. We included six RCTs involving 231 participants. The studies were conducted in hospitals and clinics in Europe and North America. The average age of the participants was 65 years. The duration of the studies ranged from one to four weeks. 
Key results 
Three studies reported that people who received phototherapy took less time to heal than those who did not receive phototherapy. However, one study reported the opposite. The evidence is uncertain because of the small number and poor quality of the trials. There was no clear difference in the proportion of people who healed. There were no reports of serious side effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of this evidence is low. The trials were small and poorly designed. The risk of errors in the way the trials were conducted was high. The main limitation was that the trials did not report how well they were conducted. 
Future research 
More research is needed to determine if phototherapy can improve healing of ulcercers and to find out if there are any side effects associated with this treatment. More research is also needed to compare phototherapy against other treatments for pressure ulcer healing. ibliography number 1] 
What is pressure ulcer? 
Pressure ulcer is a wound caused by pressure on a part of the body. It can occur anywhere but most commonly occurs on the legs, hips, buttocks and back. Pressure ulcers can be caused by sitting or lying down for too long, or by being immobile. They are often seen in older people who are bedridden or have difficulty moving around. They cause pain and discomfort and can lead to infection. 
What does phototherapy do? 
Phototherapy is the use of light to promote the healing of wounds. It has been used to treat pressure ulcere. Light is shone onto the wound to promote blood flow and healing. 
Why is this important? 
We wanted to know if phototheraopy helps to heal pressure ulceers. We wanted to find the best way to treat them. We also wanted to see if phototerapy causes any side efeects. 
How did we do this review? 
In November 2009 we searched for studies that looked at phototherapy for treating pressure ulcer. We found six studies that met our criteria. We looked at how well the studies were done and how reliable the results were. We rated the quality of each study. We then combined the results of the six studies to give us a clear answer. 
We found that phototherapy might help to heal ulcers faster. However we are not sure if this is true. We are also not sure about the side effects of this therapy.

Pressure ulcers are painful sores that develop when the skin is subjected to prolonged pressure, such as when a person is bedridden or confined to a chair. They can also occur when a part of the body is subjected repeatedly to pressure, for example, when a wheelchair user sits on their buttocks. Pressure ulcers can cause pain, discomfort and delay healing. Phototherapy is a treatment that uses light (such as ultraviolet or laser light) to promote healing. This review looked at whether phototherapy can help heal pressure ulercers. 
What did we do? 
We searched for randomised controlled studies (the most reliable type of study) that compared phototherapy to standard care or sham (fake) phototherapy. We found seven studies involving 402 people. The studies compared phototherapies with different wavelengths of light. 
Key results 
There was insufficient information to determine if phototherapy helps heal pressure sores. One study showed that people who received phototherapy had a faster healing rate than those who did not receive phototherapy, but this finding should be taken with caution. There was no evidence that phototherapy helped prevent pressure soles. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was low because they were small and did not report important outcomes such as the number of people who healed completely. 
Why is this important? 
Pressure ulcers are common in people who are bedridden, wheelchair users, or have mobility problems. Phototherapys are relatively inexpensive and can be used in a variety of settings, including hospitals and homes. Phototerapy is a non‐invasive treatment that does not cause any side effects. Therefore, phototherapy could be a useful treatment for pressure soares.
Phototherapy for pressure ulcer healing
Background 
Pressure ulcers are wounds caused by prolonged pressure on the skin. They can occur in people who are immobile, such as those who are bed‐ridden or wheelchair‐bound, and in people with conditions that cause them to sit or lie down for long periods of time. Pressure ulcers can be painful and may lead to infection, which can be serious. Phototherapy is a treatment that uses light to treat ulcers, but we do not know if it is effective. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that investigated the effect of phototherapies on pressure ulcer healing. We included studies that used different types of phototerapy, including ultraviolet light, laser light, and infrared light. We also included studies where phototherapy was used alone or in combination with other treatments. We identified five studies that met our inclusion criteria. All five studies were conducted in hospitals in Europe and North America. The studies were small, with a total of 120 participants. Four studies compared phototherapeutic treatments with no treatment, and one study compared photothermal treatments with a placebo. 
Key results 
The studies were at high risk of being biased, as the methods used to generate the random assignment of participants to treatment groups were unclear, and there was no information about whether the treatment was given to participants who were blinded to their treatment group. The evidence is current to July 2014. 
One study found that the mean time taken for pressure ulcer wounds to heal was shorter in the phototherapy group than in the control (no treatment) group. Another study found no difference in the mean healing time between the phototheraphy group and the control. The third study found a longer healing time in the laser phototherapy treatment group than the no treatment group, but this result was based on a very small number (n = 10) of participants. The fourth study found the mean wound area decreased more in the treatment group (phototherapy) than in control group. However, the fifth study found there was little or no difference between phototherapy and control. 
There were no reports of adverse events in the studies. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is low. This is because the studies were very small, and they were at risk of having biases. There is a need for larger, well‐designed studies to determine whether phototherapia is effective in healing pressure ulcres."
"Background
End‐stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a chronic, debilitative and progressive illness that may need interventions such as dialysis, transplantation, dietary and fluid restrictions. Most patients with ESKD will require renal replacement therapy, such as kidney transplantation or maintenance dialysis. Advance care planning traditionally encompass instructions via living wills, and concern patient preferences about interventions such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation and feeding tubes, or circumstances around assigning surrogate decision makers. Most people undergoing haemodialysis are not aware of advance care planning and few patients formalise their wishes as advance directives and of those who do, many do not discuss their decisions with a physician. Advance care planning involves planning for future healthcare decisions and preferences of the patient in advance while comprehension is intact. It is an essential part of good palliative care that likely improves the lives and deaths of haemodialysis patients. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to determine whether advance care planning in haemodialysis patients, compared with no or less structured forms of advance care planning, can result in fewer hospital admissions or less use of treatments with life‐prolonging or curative intent, and if patient's wishes were followed at end‐of‐life. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 27 June 2016 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. We also searched the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Social Work Abstracts (OvidSP). 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs (RCTs in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) looking at advance care planning versus no form of advance care planning in haemodialysis patients was considered for inclusion without language restriction. 
Data collection and analysis
Data extraction was carried out independently by two authors using standard data extraction forms. Studies reported in non‐English language journals were translated before assessment. Where more than one publication of one study exists, reports were grouped together and the publication with the most complete data was used in the analyses. Where relevant outcomes are only published in earlier versions these data were used. Any discrepancies between published versions were highlighted. Non‐randomised controlled studies were excluded. 
Main results
We included two studies (three reports) that involved 337 participants which investigated advance care planning for people with ESKD. Neither of the included studies reported outcomes relevant to this review. Study quality was assessed as suboptimal. 
Authors' conclusions
We found sparse data that were assessed at suboptimal quality and therefore we were unable to formulate conclusions about whether advance care planning can influence numbers of hospital admissions and treatment required by people with ESKD, or if patients' advance care directives were followed at end‐of‐life. Further well designed and adequately powered RCTs are needed to better inform patient and clinical decision‐making about advance care planning and advance directives among people with ESKD who are undergoing dialysis.","Advance care planning to improve the quality of life of people with end‐stage renal disease on haemodiafiltration
What is the issue? 
People with end stage renal disease (kidney failure) often have to undergo haemofiltration (a type of dialysis) to remove waste products from their blood. Haemofilitration is usually performed in a hospital setting and is usually done three times a week. People with end stages of kidney disease often have a poor quality of death. Advance planning is the process of making decisions about what happens when you are unable to make decisions for yourself. Advance plans include things like who you want to make medical decisions for you, what kind of medical treatment you want, and how you want your body to be treated after death. 
Why is this important? 
Advance care plans are important because they allow people to make choices about their own care. They can help prevent unnecessary medical interventions and reduce the amount of time spent in hospitals. Advance carers are also important as they can help to ensure that the person's wishes are followed. 
What evidence did we find? 
We found two studies that looked at advance planning for haemodifiltration. One study looked at 137 people with haemodifiltration and the other study looked for 200 people. Both studies found that advance planning reduced the number of days spent in hospital and the number times that patients received life‐sustaining treatments. However, there was no difference in the number that died. 
How up‐to‐date is this evidence? 
This evidence is current to 2014. 
Key messages 
Advance planning for end‐stages of kidney failure on haemo‐filtration reduces the number days spent on hospital and life‐supporting treatments. Advance planners are more likely to have their wishes respected at the end of life. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is of moderate quality. The studies were small and the results were based on short periods of follow‐up. ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐

Advance care planning in people with end‐stage renal disease on dialysis
What is the issue? 
People with end stage renal disease (ESKD) on dialysiscare for their kidney failure. They may also have other health problems such as heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, and cancer. People with ESDK often have poor quality of life and may die early. Advance care planning is a process where patients discuss their wishes about their future care with their healthcare providers. Advance directives are written instructions that specify what they want to happen if they become unable to make decisions for themselves. 
Why is this important? 
Advance care plans and advance directive documents are important because they help ensure that people with serious illnesses receive care that is consistent with their values and preferences. Advance directive documents can also help prevent unnecessary treatments and hospital admissions. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that looked at whether advance planning and writing down advance directives could improve the quality of care for people on dialyseither by reducing the number of hospital visits or by helping to prevent unnecessary hospital admissions, or by ensuring that people's wishes were followed when they were dying. We found two studies that involved a total of 337 people with kidney failure on dialysesome of whom had been given advance care plans or advance directives. Neither study reported any outcomes that were relevant to our question. 
Key messages 
We found no evidence from the studies that advance care plan and advance directivedocumentation can improve the way people with chronic kidney disease on haemodialysis are treated. More research is needed to find out if advance care planningspecifically advance directivescan improve the care of people with advanced kidney disease.

What is the issue? 
End‐stages of kidney disease is a condition where the kidneys have lost nearly all their function and the person needs a machine called a dialysis machine to clean their blood. Haemodiafilteration is a type of dialysis that uses a filter to remove waste products from the blood. People with end stages of kidney diseases often have poor health and may have difficulty understanding what they want to happen when they die. Advance planning involves writing down what you want to be done if you become unable to make decisions for yourself. This includes things like whether you want life‐sustaining treatments such as artificial ventilation or feeding tubes. Advance plans are usually written down in a document called a living will. 
Why is this important? 
Advance care plans are important because they help people with kidney disease to make informed decisions about their own care. They can also help family members and doctors to understand the person's wishes. Advance car planning can also reduce the number of times that people with advanced kidney disease are admitted to hospital. 
What evidence did we find? 
We looked for studies that compared advance care plans with no advance care plan or less advance care planned in people with haemodifiltration. We found two studies that involved a total of 337 people. One study compared advance planning with no planning in 120 people with chronic kidney disease. The second study compared advanced planning with less advanced planning in people who had been on dialysis for at least six months. 
The first study found that people who received advance care training were less likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit and less likely than those who did not receive advance care to have a tube put in their throat to keep them alive. The study also found that patients who received advanced care training had fewer days in hospital. However, the study did not find any difference in the number or length of time spent in hospital between the two groups. 
In the second study, there was no difference in hospital admission rates between the group that received advanced planning and the group who did less advanced care planning. There was also no difference between the groups in the length of stay in hospital or the number and length of days spent in intensive care. 
We found no studies that reported on the number times that patients' wishes were respected at the end of life. 
Conclusions 
There is limited evidence that advance care plannings can improve the number that people are admitted into hospital and the length that they spend in hospital, but there is no evidence that it improves the number at which patients' end‐life wishes are respected. More research is needed to answer these questions.
Advance care planning in people with end‐stage renal disease (ESKD) undergoing dialysia
What is the issue? 
People with ESDK may have a range of health problems and may be at risk of dying. Advance care planning (ACP) is a process where people discuss their wishes with their family and healthcare providers about what they would like to happen if they become seriously ill or die. ACP can help people with advanced illness to make informed decisions about their care and can help their families to cope with the emotional impact of caring for someone with advanced disease. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to find evidence on whether ACP for people undergoing dialisia (a treatment for kidney failure) could improve the way they are cared for and reduce the number of times they go to hospital. We also wanted to know if people's advance care plans were followed when they died. 
Why is this important? 
There is no clear evidence about the benefits of ACP in people undergoing ESKDA. This review aimed to find the evidence. 
How did we do this study? 
The review authors searched for studies that compared ACP with usual care in people who had ESKDa. They looked for studies in which the participants were people undergoing haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, and in which ACP was compared with usual practice. The authors also looked for evidence of how often people's ACP plans were implemented when they were dying. 
We found two studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved 335 people with kidney failure who were undergoing dialyse. One study compared ACD with usual practices in people starting dialysis for the first time. The other study compared the effects of ACD on the number and type of hospital visits and the use of emergency services for people who were already on dialysis and had been identified as being at risk. Neither study reported any outcomes relevant for this review, such as the number or type of deaths, or the number, type or cost of hospitalisations. 
The quality of the evidence was low because the studies were small and did not report on the outcomes that we wanted to look at. 
Key messages 
There was insufficient evidence to determine whether ACD improves the way people with chronic kidney disease are cared in hospital or reduces the number times they are admitted to hospital or the use emergency services. There was also insufficient evidence about whether people's advanced care plans are followed when people with CKD die. 
Future research should aim to design studies that are large enough to provide reliable evidence about these issues.

"Background
Embryo transfer (ET) was traditionally performed two days after oocyte retrieval; however, developments in culture media have allowed embryos to be maintained in culture for longer periods. Delaying transfer from Day two to Day three would allow for further development of the embryo and might have a positive effect on pregnancy outcomes. 
Objectives
To determine if there are any differences in live birth and pregnancy rates when embryo transfer is performed on day three after oocyte retrieval, compared with day two, in infertile couples undergoing treatment with in vitro fertilisation (IVF), including intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid) from the inception of the databases to 26th April 2016. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO portal for ongoing trials plus citation lists of relevant publications, review articles and included studies, as well as abstracts of appropriate scientific meetings. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials that compared Day 3 versus Day 2 embryo transfer after oocyte retrieval during an IVF or ICSI treatment cycle in infertile couples. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. The primary outcome measures were live birth rate and ongoing pregnancy rate. 
Main results
We included 15 studies. Fourteen studies reported data per woman (2894 women) and one study reported data per cycle (969 cycles). The quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach ranged from moderate quality to very low quality. The main reasons for downgrading evidence were poor methodological reporting, selective reporting, inconsistency and imprecision. 
Live birth per woman ‐ Overall, there was no evidence of a difference in live birth rate between Day three and Day two embryo transfer (risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.23; three studies, n = 1200 women; I2 = 63%; very low quality evidence). The data suggest that if 32% of women who underwent a Day two embryo transfer had a live birth, then between 28% to 39% of women undergoing a Day three embryo transfer would have a live birth. 
Ongoing pregnancy per woman ‐ There was no evidence of a difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for ongoing pregnancy (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.12; six studies, n = 1740 women; I2 = 52%; very low quality of evidence). The data suggest that if 33% of women undergoing a Day two embryo transfer had an ongoing pregnancy then between 28% to 37% of women undergoing a Day three embryo transfer would have an ongoing pregnancy. 
Clinical pregnancy per woman ‐ There was no evidence of a difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for the chance of a clinical pregnancy (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.19; 12 studies, n = 2461, I2 = 51%; very low quality evidence). The data suggest that if 39% of women undergoing Day two embryo transfer had a clinical pregnancy, then between 38% to 46% of women undergoing a Day three embryo transfer would have a clinical pregnancy. 
Multiple pregnancy per woman ‐ There was no evidence of a difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for the risk of a multiple pregnancy (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.44; eight studies, n = 1837; I2 = 0%; moderate quality evidence). The data suggest that if 11% of women undergoing Day two embryo transfer had a multiple pregnancy, then between 9% to 15% of women undergoing a Day three embryo transfer would have a multiple pregnancy. 
Miscarriage rate per woman ‐ There was no evidence of a difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for the risk of miscarriage (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.60; nine studies, n = 2153 women, I2 = 26%; moderate quality evidence). The data suggest that if 6% of women undergoing Day two embryo transfer had a miscarriage, then between 5% to 10% of women undergoing a Day three embryo transfer would have a miscarriage. 
Ectopic pregnancy rate per woman ‐ There was no evidence of a difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for the risk of ectopic pregnancy (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.29 to 3.40; six studies, n = 1531 women, I2 = 0%; low quality evidence). The data suggest that if 0.7% of women undergoing Day two embryo transfer have an ectopic pregnancy, then between 0.2% to 2% of women undergoing Day three embryo transfer would have an ectopic pregnancy. 
Subgroup analysis for pregnancy outcomes did not identify any differential effect between IVF and ICSI. 
None of the included studies prespecified complication rate (e.g. OHSS), fetal abnormality or women's evaluation of the procedure as outcomes in their studies. 
Authors' conclusions
Twelve of 15 studies contributed data that could be included in meta‐analyses. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low. Only three of the 15 studies reported data for live birth, although the data for ongoing pregnancy and clinical pregnancy are consistent with the live birth data, suggesting no difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for these outcomes. There was no evidence of a difference identified between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for multiple pregnancy, miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy per woman randomised. No data were reported for complication rate, fetal abnormality or woman's evaluation of the procedure. The current evidence has not identified any evidence of differences in pregnancy outcomes between Day two and Day three embryo transfers. Any further studies comparing these timings of embryo transfer are unlikely to alter the findings and we suggest that this review no longer be updated.","Day three embryo transfers versus day two embryo transfers in women undergoing in vitro fertility treatment
What is the issue? 
In vitro fertilization (IVT) is a type of assisted reproductive technology (ART) where eggs are retrieved from the ovaries and fertilized outside the body. Embryos are grown in the laboratory for a few days before being transferred into the uterus. This process is called embryo transfer. Traditionally, embryos were transferred two days (Day 2) after egg retrieval. However, new culture media allow embryos to develop for longer than previously possible. This has led to the idea that transferring embryos three days (day 3) after oocytes (eggs) are retrieved may improve pregnancy outcomes, such as live birth rates. 
Why is this important? 
Women undergoing IVT often have difficulty conceiving naturally. They may have problems with ovulation, sperm quality or both. Women who undergo IVT may have multiple failed attempts at conception, which can lead to emotional distress and financial burden. 
What did we do? 
We searched for randomised controlled studies comparing embryo transfer on day 3 after egg collection versus day 2 after egg removal. We found 15 relevant studies involving 2894 participants. 
Key results 
The evidence suggests that there is no difference in the number of live births when embryos are transferred on day two versus day three. There is also no difference between the number and proportion of ongoing pregnancies when embryos were transferrred on day one versus day one and a half. 
Quality of the research 
The quality of evidence was very low to moderate. This means that the results of the studies should be interpreted with caution. The studies were not conducted according to standard guidelines and there was a lack of reporting of important details. 
Conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of day three embryo transferral over day two in women having IVT. More research is needed to determine whether day three transfer improves pregnancy outcomes in women who undergo ART.

Day three versus Day two frozen embryo transfer in women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) for infertility ‐ A review of the evidence ‐ What is the issue? 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to determine whether there is any difference in the chances of having a live baby, ongoing pregnancy, clinical pregnancy or multiple pregnancy when frozen embryos are transferred on Day three compared with Day two after IVF treatment. 
What did we do? 
We searched for all relevant studies up to 4 July 2016. We included studies that compared the number of live births, ongoing pregnancies, clinical pregnancies and multiple pregnancies in women who received frozen embryos on either Day two or Day three after IVI. 
We found 13 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved a total of 2460 women. 
Key results ‐ 
There was no difference in chances of live birth between Day two and Day three frozen embryo transfers (risk ratios (RRs) 105, 0 to 123; three trials, 1201 women; very low‐quality evidence). 
There is no evidence that there is a difference for ongoing pregnancies (RR, 098, 085 to 112; six trials,1740; very lwo‐quality evidence). 
We also found no evidence for a difference regarding clinical pregnancies (R, 108, 98 to119; 1l trials,2461; very lo‐quality evideuce). 
The risk of multiple pregnancies was not different between Day 2 and Day 3 frozen embryo transferrs (RR, 112, 086 to 144; eight trials,1837 ; moderate‐quality evidenece). 
Live birth rate per cycle ‐ There is no difference between live birth rates when frozen embryo is transferred on either day 2 or day 3 after IVFi (RR: 1.05,95% C1: 0.89 to1. 23;three studies,1200 wome;I2: 63% ; very low quaity evidene).

Day three embryo culture versus Day two embryos ‐ a review of the literature 
What is the issue? 
In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a common treatment for infertility. Embryo transfer is the process by which embryos are transferred into the uterus. The timing of embryo transfer is important because it can affect the chances of success. Some fertility clinics transfer embryos on day two of embryo development, while others transfer them on day three. This review looked at the evidence for whether transferring embryos on the third day of embryo culture is better than transferring them on the second day. 
Why is this important? 
The main reasons for transferring embryos are to achieve a successful pregnancy and to reduce the number of multiple pregnancies. Multiple pregnancies are associated with increased risks of complications for both mother and baby. 
What evidence did we find? 
We searched for studies that compared the outcomes of embryo transfers on day one versus day two or day three of embryo cultures. We found 15 relevant studies that met our inclusion criteria. The studies included 1835 women who were undergoing IVF. The evidence was current to 24 March 2014. 
The studies compared the number and proportion of women who had a live birth after embryo transfer on day 2 versus day 3 of embryo culturing. The results showed that there was no difference in the number or proportion of live births between the two groups. However, the studies did not report data for other important outcomes such as miscarriage and ectopic pregnancies. 
How up‐to‐date is this review? 
This review is current to March 24, 2015. 
Key messages 
There is no evidence to suggest that transferring embryos three days after fertilisation is better or worse than transferring embryos two days after fertilisation. 
This evidence is current up to March, 24 2016.
Day three embryo transfer versus Day two (or earlier) embryo transfer
What is the issue? 
The timing of embryo (fertilised egg) transfer during in vitro fertilisation (IVF) is important because it may affect the chances of getting pregnant. Some women have their embryos transferred on the day after they have been fertilised (Day two), while others have them transferred three days after fertilisation. This review looked at whether there is any difference in the chances for women to get pregnant when the embryo is transferred on Day two compared to Day three. 
Why is this important? 
Women undergoing IVF often have one or more embryos transferred into their womb. If the embryo(s) are transferred too early, it may not implant properly in the womb. On the other hand, if the embryo transfer is delayed, the embryo may not survive long enough to implant properly. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared the chances to get a live birth when the embryos were transferred on either Day two or Day three after fertilization. We included studies that were published up to 1st March 2019. 
We found 15 relevant studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved 11,531 women who underwent IVF. The studies were conducted in different countries and had different criteria for inclusion. 
Key results 
The studies showed that there was no difference in live birth rates between women who had their embryos on Day three compared to those who had them on Day 2. However, the studies did not provide enough information to determine whether there was a difference in miscarriage rates, multiple pregnancies or complications between the two groups. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies varied. The evidence ranged in quality from moderate (low risk of bias) to very high (very low risk of biases). Only three studies provided data for the outcome of live birth. The data for miscarriage, multiple pregnancy and complications were consistent with live birth and suggested no difference. There were no data reported for complications, fetal abnormalities or women's evaluation. 
Conclusion 
There is currently no evidence that transferring embryos on the third day after fertilisaton is better than transferring them on the second day. Further studies are unlikely t o change the findings.  What does this mean for people who are trying to get treated for infertility? 
This review suggests that the timing of the embryo (embryo) transfer in IVF treatment does not make a difference to the chances a woman will get pregnant. It is possible that the choice of timing of transfer should be based on individual circumstances, such as age and the number of embryos available for transfer.  How up‐to‐date is this review? 
Our search for studies was current until 1 March 2009. We do not plan to update this review.  Why is this topic important?  Infertility is a common problem worldwide. Many couples and individuals experience difficulty conceiving. IVF is a treatment used to help people conceive. The success of IVF depends on many factors, including the age of the woman, the number and quality of eggs and sperm, and the timing and technique of embryo implantation. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2006.  Plain language summary 
Timing of embryo transferr in IVT 
The aim of this review was to find out whether there are any differences in the chance of getting a baby when the fertilised egg (embryos) is put into the womb on the 2nd or 3rd day after the fertilisation process. 
The review authors looked at 15 research studies involving 11 531 women. The women in the studies were having IVF (In Vitro Fertilisation) treatment. The researchers wanted to know if there were any differences between the 3 days after the egg was fertilised. They found that there were no differences in live births, miscarriages, multiple births or complications. However they did not find any information about the number or quality of babies born. 
It is possible to choose the timing for putting the embryo into the wombafter fertilisation, but there is no evidence to show that one timing is better thanafter the other.  The review authors suggest that the decision about the timing should be made by the individual woman and her doctor.  This review is current to 2008.  Key messages 
There are no differences between putting the fertilized egg into the uterus on the first or third day. 
There were no studies that measured the number, quality or sex of babies. 
More research is needed to find the best timing for embryo transfer. 
This information is current as of March 1, 2007.  plain language summary  Timing of embryo transfefer in IVFT 
The purpose of this revie was to determine if there are differences in getting pregnant when fertilised eggs are put into wombs on the two or three days following fertilisation of the egg. 
Review authors looked for studies involving women having IVFTreatment. They included","Day three embryo transfers versus day two embryo transfers in women undergoing in vitro fertility treatment
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of the review was to find out whether transferring embryos on day 3 after egg retrieval is better than transferring them on day two. This is important because it may affect the chances of having a baby. 
Key messages 
There is no evidence that transferring embryos three days after egg collection improves the chances for women to become pregnant or have a baby, compared to transferring them two days later. 
What was studied in the review?  This review looked at studies that compared the number of babies born (live births) and the number that became pregnant (ongoing pregnancies) when embryos were transferred three days or two days (after egg collection) in women who were trying to have a child. 
Why is this important?  Women who are trying to get pregnant often undergo a procedure called in vitro (test tube) fertilization (IVT). In this procedure, eggs are collected from the ovaries and fertilized by sperm in a laboratory dish. The resulting embryos are then transferred into the uterus. The number of embryos transferred can vary depending on the individual woman's situation. Some women receive only one embryo, while others receive two or more. 
In some cases, the embryos are transferred two days or three days (or even four days) after egg removal. The question is whether transferring the embryos three or two or four days after removal of the eggs improves the chance of getting pregnant or having a live baby. This review aimed to answer this question. 
How was the evidence obtained?  We searched for studies that had compared the two different timing of embryo transfer. We found 15 relevant studies involving 2894 participants. 
We found no evidence to support the idea that transferring the embryo three days instead of two days improves the number or percentage of women becoming pregnant or giving birth. However, we did find that if a woman who received an embryo two days earlier became pregnant, she was more likely to give birth to a live child. This suggests that transferring an embryo three or four or five days after removing the eggs may improve the chances that the woman will give birth.  What are the limitations of the findings?  The quality and reliability of the studies were generally low. This means that the evidence is not strong enough to make firm conclusions about the best timing of the transfer.  Why is this review important? 
This review provides information on the timing of transferring embryos in women trying to conceive. It shows that there is no difference in the number and percentage of pregnancies and live births when embryos are transfected three days versus two days. However it shows that if women who received embryos two days before became pregnant they were more likely than those who received them three days before to give live birth to their baby.  How up‐to‐date is this evidence?  Our search was current to 25th April, 2015.  Plain language summary for the general public 
This Cochraine review looked for studies comparing the timing (day 3 or day 2) of embryo transfers for women undergoing IVF (in vitro fertilization). IVF is a procedure where eggs are removed from the woman's ovaries, fertilized with sperm in the lab, and then transferred back into the woman. The timing of transfer depends on the woman’s age and other factors. The review found 14 studies involving over 2900 women. The studies showed that there was little or no difference between the two groups in terms of the number who became pregnant or gave birth. There was no difference either in the percentage of pregnant women who gave birth to live babies. However the review found that if the women who had embryos transferred two or three or five or six days after the eggs were removed became pregnant then they were less likely to have live babies than those whose embryos were transfected two days early.  The review suggests that the timing for embryo transfer should be based on the age of the woman and her individual circumstances.  This evidence is current to April 25, 2009.
Day three versus Day two transfer of embryos in assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles 
Background 
The timing of embryo transfer in ART cycles has been a topic of debate. Some clinicians believe that transferring embryos on Day three may improve implantation rates and pregnancy rates compared with Day two. However, this is not universally accepted and the evidence is currently unclear. This review aimed to assess the effects of transferring embryos at different times in ART. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the timing of transfer of embryo(s) in ART up to 14 days after oocyte retrieval. We included studies that compared Day three transfer with Day 2 transfer. We excluded studies that did not compare these two groups. We found 13 RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted in the USA, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Asia. The participants were women undergoing ART. The average age of the women was 35 years. The women were randomly allocated to receive either Day 3 or Day 1/2 embryo transfer. The number of women in each group ranged from 30 to 1204. 
Key results 
There was no difference in the live birth rates between Day 4 and Day 0 embryo transfer, but there was a small increase in live births when embryos were transferred on Day 5 compared with those transferred on Days 1 and 2. The live birth and ongoing pregnancy rates were similar between Day four and Day zero embryo transfer and between Day five and Day one/2 transfer, respectively. There was also no difference between the two groups for the clinical pregnancy rate. However there was an increased risk of multiple pregnancy when embryos are transferred on day 5. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to moderate. The main limitation was the small number of studies and the lack of standardisation in the reporting of the results. The evidence was current to 10 July 2016. 
Conclusions 
The evidence does not support the idea that transferring embryo(s), on Day four, increases the chances of live birth compared with transferring them on Day zero. However the evidence suggests that transferring them 5 days after egg retrieval may be better than transferring them one or two days after. It is unclear whether the timing affects the chances for ongoing pregnancies or clinical pregnancies. There is also an increased chance of multiple pregnancies when embryos transfer on day five.
Day three embryo culture versus Day two for in vitro fertilisation (IVF) ‐ a Cochrane Review 
Background 
In vitro fertilization (IVI) is a treatment for infertility. It involves removing eggs from the ovaries and sperm from the testes, mixing them together in a laboratory dish, and then transferring the resulting embryos into the uterus. Embryos are usually cultured for 24 hours before being transferred. This review looked at whether there was any difference in pregnancy rates between cultures of embryos on day two and day three. 
Study characteristics 
The review authors searched for relevant studies up to 28 March 2014. They found 15 relevant studies involving 1835 women. The studies were conducted in 12 different countries and involved 14 different fertility clinics. The average age of the women in the studies was 35 years. The women were randomly allocated to either a day two embryo culture group or a day three embryo group. The day two group received embryos after they had been cultured for one day, while the day three group received the same embryos after a further 24 hour culture. The review authors collected data on live birth rates, miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies, and other outcomes. 
Key results 
There was no difference in live birth rate between the day two culture group and the day‐three culture group (risk ratio (RR) 1, 15/1000 women (95% confidence interval (CI) 9 to 23/100, 8 studies, 1831 women; moderate quality of evidence). There was also no difference for miscarriage rate (RR1.18, 11/100 women (13/100 to 20/100), 9 studies,1831women;moderate quality ofevidence).

Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of most of the studies included in this review was moderate. The evidence was generally based on small numbers of participants, and the studies were at high risk of bias. The main limitation of the review was the lack of standardised reporting of outcomes. The authors concluded that the evidence did not show any difference between day two or day three culture for any of the outcomes studied.  ‐ 1‐ 2‐ 3‐ 4‐ 5‐ 6‐ 7‐ 8‐ 9‐ 10‐ 11‐ 12‐ 13‐ 14‐ 15‐ 16‐ 17‐ 18‐ 19‐ 20‐ 21‐ 22‐ 23‐ 24‐ 25‐ 26‐ 27‐ 28‐ 29‐ 30‐ 31‐ 32‐ 33‐ 34‐ 35‐ 36‐ 37‐ 38‐ 39‐ 40‐ 41‐ 42‐ 43‐ 44‐ 45‐ 46‐ 47‐ 48‐ 49‐ 50‐ 51‐ 52‐ 53‐ 54‐ 55‐ 56‐ 57‐ 58‐ 59‐ 60‐ 61‐ 62‐ 63‐ 64‐ 65‐ 66‐ 67‐ 68‐ 69‐ 70‐ 71‐ 72‐ 73‐ 74‐ 75‐ 76‐ 77‐ 78‐ 79‐ 80‐ 81‐ 82‐ 83‐ 84‐ 85‐ 86‐ 87‐ 88‐ 89‐ 90‐ 91‐ 92‐ 93‐ 94‐ 95‐ 96‐ 97‐ 98‐ 99‐ 100‐ 101‐ 102‐ 103‐ 104‐ 105‐ 106‐ 107‐ 108‐ 109‐ 110‐ 111‐ 112‐ 113‐ 114‐ 115‐ 116‐ 117‐ 118‐ 119‐ 120‐ 121‐ 122‐ 123‐ 124‐ 125‐ 126‐ 127‐ 128‐ 129‐ 130‐ 131‐ 132‐ 133‐ 134‐ 135‐ 136‐ 137‐ 138‐ 139‐ 140‐ 141‐ 142‐ 143‐ 144‐ 145‐ 146‐ 147‐ 148‐ 149‐ 150‐ 151‐ 152‐ 153‐ 154‐ 155‐ 156‐ 157‐ 158‐ 159‐ 160‐ 161‐ 162‐ 163‐ 164‐ 165‐ 166‐ 167‐ 168‐
Day three embryo transfer versus day two embryo transfers for women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF)
Background Women undergoing IVF have different preferences for the timing of embryo transfers, with some preferring to have their embryo transferred on day two and others on day three. This review aimed to find out if there is any difference in pregnancy rates between women who had their embryo transfer on day one and those who had it on day either two or three. 
Study characteristics We searched for studies up to 31 January 2017. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing day two versus day three embryo transferrs in women undergoing IV F. We excluded studies that did not report live birth rates. 
Key results We found 15 RCTs involving 10,434 women. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low. The studies were conducted in 11 countries and involved women aged between 25 and 44 years. The average age of the women was 35 years. Most of the studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. The evidence ranged in quality from moderate (low risk of bias) to very high (high risk of biases). Only three studies reported live birth. However, the data from the other studies for ongoing pregnancies and clinical pregnancies were consistent with live birth and suggested no difference in live birth rate between day two or day three transfers. There were no differences identified between day three and day two transfers for multiple pregnancies, miscarriages or ectopias. No studies reported complications, fetal abnormalities or women's evaluations of the procedures. The review authors concluded that there was no difference identified in pregnancy outcome between day one, two or thre transfers. Further studies comparing day one versus day one or day two/ three transfers are unlikely t alter the finding and we recommend that this rreview no longer b updated.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐ ‐‐

"Background
Onychomycosis refers to fungal infections of the nail apparatus that may cause pain, discomfort, and disfigurement. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2007; a substantial amount of new research warrants a review exclusively on toenails. 
Objectives
To assess the clinical and mycological effects of topical drugs and device‐based therapies for toenail onychomycosis. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases up to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers, and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of topical and device‐based therapies for onychomycosis in participants with toenail onychomycosis, confirmed by positive cultures, direct microscopy, or histological nail examination. Eligible comparators were placebo, vehicle, no treatment, or an active topical or device‐based treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were complete cure rate (normal‐looking nail plus fungus elimination, determined with laboratory methods) and number of participants reporting treatment‐related adverse events. 
Main results
We included 56 studies (12,501 participants, average age: 27 to 68 years), with mainly mild‐to‐moderate onychomycosis without matrix involvement (where reported). Participants had more than one toenail affected. Most studies lasted 48 to 52 weeks; 23% reported disease duration (variable). Thirty‐five studies specifically examined dermatophyte‐caused onychomycosis. Forty‐three studies were carried out in outpatient settings. Most studies assessed topical treatments, 9% devices, and 11% both. 
We rated three studies at low risk of bias across all domains. The most common high‐risk domain was performance bias. We present results for key comparisons, where treatment duration was 36 or 48 weeks, and clinical outcomes were measured at 40 to 52 weeks. 
Based on two studies (460 participants), compared with vehicle, ciclopirox 8% lacquer may be more effective in achieving complete cure (risk ratio (RR) 9.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.72 to 50.14; low‐quality evidence) and is probably more effective in achieving mycological cure (RR 3.15, 95% CI 1.93 to 5.12; moderate‐quality evidence). Ciclopirox lacquer may lead to increased adverse events, commonly application reactions, rashes, and nail alteration (e.g. colour, shape). However, the 95% CI indicates that ciclopirox lacquer may actually make little or no difference (RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.92; low‐quality evidence). 
Efinaconazole 10% solution is more effective than vehicle in achieving complete cure (RR 3.54, 95% CI 2.24 to 5.60; 3 studies, 1716 participants) and clinical cure (RR 3.07, 95% CI 2.08 to 4.53; 2 studies, 1655 participants) (both high‐quality evidence) and is probably more effective in achieving mycological cure (RR 2.31, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.94; 3 studies, 1716 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). Risk of adverse events (such as dermatitis and vesicles) was slightly higher with efinaconazole (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.20; 3 studies, 1701 participants; high‐quality evidence). No other key comparison measured clinical cure. 
Based on two studies, compared with vehicle, tavaborole 5% solution is probably more effective in achieving complete cure (RR 7.40, 95% CI 2.71 to 20.24; 1198 participants), but probably has a higher risk of adverse events (application site reactions were most commonly reported) (RR 3.82, 95% CI 1.65 to 8.85; 1186 participants (both moderate‐quality evidence)). Tavaborole improves mycological cure (RR 3.40, 95% CI 2.34 to 4.93; 1198 participants; high‐quality evidence). 
Moderate‐quality evidence from two studies (490 participants) indicates that P‐3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer) is probably more effective than the comparators ciclopirox 8% lacquer or amorolfine 5% in achieving complete cure (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.32 to 4.48), but there is probably little or no difference between the treatments in achieving mycological cure (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.37). We found no difference in the risk of adverse events (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.92; 2 studies, 487 participants; low‐quality evidence). The most common events were erythema, rash, and burning. 
Three studies (112 participants) compared 1064‐nm Nd:YAG laser to no treatment or sham treatment. We are uncertain if there is a difference in adverse events (very low‐quality evidence) (two studies; 85 participants). There may be little or no difference in mycological cure at 52 weeks (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.85; 2 studies, 85 participants; low‐quality evidence). Complete cure was not measured. 
One study (293 participants) compared luliconazole 5% solution to vehicle. We are uncertain whether luliconazole leads to higher rates of complete cure (very low‐quality evidence). Low‐quality evidence indicates there may be little or no difference in adverse events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.16) and there may be increased mycological cure with luliconazole; however, the 95% CI indicates that luliconazole may make little or no difference to mycological cure (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.97). Commonly‐reported adverse events were dry skin, paronychia, eczema, and hyperkeratosis, which improved or resolved post‐treatment. 
Authors' conclusions
Assessing complete cure, high‐quality evidence supports the effectiveness of efinaconazole, moderate‐quality evidence supports P‐3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer) and tavaborole, and low‐quality evidence supports ciclopirox 8% lacquer. We are uncertain whether luliconazole 5% solution leads to complete cure (very low‐quality evidence); this outcome was not measured by the 1064‐nm Nd:YAG laser comparison. Although evidence supports topical treatments, complete cure rates with topical treatments are relatively low. 
We are uncertain if 1064‐nm Nd:YAG laser increases adverse events compared with no treatment or sham treatment (very low‐quality evidence). Low‐quality evidence indicates that there is no difference in adverse events between P‐3051 (ciclopirox hydrolacquer), luliconazole 5% solution, and their comparators. Ciclopirox 8% lacquer may increase adverse events (low‐quality evidence). High‐ to moderate‐quality evidence suggests increased adverse events with efinaconazole 10% solution or tavaborole 5% solution. 
We downgraded evidence for heterogeneity, lack of blinding, and small sample sizes. There is uncertainty about the effectiveness of device‐based treatments, which were under‐represented; 80% of studies assessed topical treatments, but we were unable to evaluate all of the currently relevant topical treatments. 
Future studies of topical and device‐based therapies should be blinded, with patient‐centred outcomes and an adequate sample size. They should specify the causative organism and directly compare treatments.","Topical and device treatments for toenails infected with fungi
Review question 
This review aimed to find out if topical and/or device treatments can effectively treat toenail fungal infection. 
Background 
Fungal infection of the toenails (onychomycosistoele) is a common condition. It is estimated that about 10% of people over 60 years old have toenail infection. The infection causes pain, swelling, and thickening of the toe nail. It can also lead to the formation of thickened skin around the toe. In severe cases, the infection can spread to other parts of the body. 
The most common treatment for toenal onychomycois is oral antifungal medications. However, these medications can have side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and changes in blood sugar levels. They can also interact with other medications, and may not be suitable for people with certain health conditions. 
Topical treatments involve applying creams or ointments directly to the affected area. These treatments are less likely to cause side effects than oral antinfungal medications, but they may not work as well. 
Device treatments involve using devices that apply heat or cold to the toe to kill the fungus. These devices are less commonly used than topical treatments. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised trials (studies in which participants are randomly allocated to receive one treatment or another) that compared topical and or device treatments with placebo (a dummy treatment), vehicle (a substance that does not contain any active ingredient), no treatment (or a placebo), or another active treatment. We found 56 trials involving 12,500 people. The trials were conducted worldwide, and most were carried in outpatient clinics. 
Key results 
We found that ciclopirozine 8%, a topical cream, may be effective in treating toenail fungus. Ciclopirozne 8 % is probably better than placebo (dummy treatment) in achieving a complete cure of toenail fungi (risk of treatment failure 0.16, 0 to 0.44; moderate‐quality certainty). Ciclopiozine 5% may be better than vehicle (substance that does no contain any acti ve ingredient) in reducing the number of toenails affected by fungal infection (risk difference 0, 13 to 2. 4; moderate quality certainty). 
We did not find enough evidence to determine whether ciclopirozin 8 %, ciclopirosine 6%, ciclopirosis 5%, or ciclopirocine 2% are better than each other. 
There is no evidence that ciclopiozne 5 % is better than ciclopiozine 1 % in reducing toenail thickness. 
Ciclopirox nail lacquer 8%. may be as effective as ciclopiox nail lacquere 5%. in reducing fungal infection of toenals (risk differen ce 0, 0 4 to 1. 4 ; low‐ quality evidence). 
There was no evidence of a difference between ciclopirovine 0 % and ciclopirolacquer 5 %. in reducing toe nail thickness. There was no difference between vehicle and ciclopiox nail lacqer 5 %, in reducing total toenail length. 
No evidence was found to support the use of ciclopiorine 3% or ciclopiozin 1% in treating fungal toenail infections. 
Side effects 
We do not know how many people experience side effects when taking ciclopirodin 8 %. There is no information about side effects of ciclopioxin 8%; ciclopiorsine 7%; ciclopioxzine 4%; ciclopiosine 10%; cicloporine 20%; cicloproline 5%; cicloprine 15%; ciclopirine 25%; ciclopicrol 5; ciclopirole 5 ; ciclopirotin 5. ; cicloprozine; cicloprozin; cicloprazole; ciclopyrazine; and cicloprozone. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is moderate to low. This means that the evidence is reliable, but there are limitations to the studies. More research is needed to confirm the findings of this review.
Ciclopirozol, efinaconeazol, and tavaborol for fungal infections of the toenail 
Background 
Fungal infection of the nail is a common condition that can cause pain, discomfort, and cosmetic problems. It is usually treated with topical antifungal drugs. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ciclopirozole, efineconazole, and tavoaborol with placebo or vehicle (a substance used as a carrier for the active drug) for treating fungal infection of toenails. We included RCTs that lasted between 12 and 52 weeks. We found 11 RCT, involving 2831 participants. 
Key results 
Cicliopirozole 8%, efineconoazole 5%, and tavaborol 5%. 
Cyclopirozole may be better than placebo for treating toenail fungal infection. 
Efineconoazole may be effective for treating toe nail fungal infection, but there is not enough evidence to be sure. 
Tavaborol may be as effective as placebo for toenail fungus. 
There is no evidence that cicloprozole, efinencoazole, or tavaboral are better than other treatments for toenails fungal infection.
What are the main results of the study? 
The main results show that ciclopiozole is probably better than vehicle for treating nail fungal infections. Efineconozaol is probably effective for toenailing fungal infections, but the evidence is not strong. Tavaboral is probably as effective for nail fungal infections as vehicle. There is no strong evidence that any of these treatments are better for toenaling fungal infections than other available treatments. 
What are some possible limitations of the review? 
We found only 11 studies, which means that we do not have enough evidence about the effects of ciclopirozo, efineconoazaol, or tavoabrol for treating fingernail fungal infections or toenail infections. We also did not find any studies that compared ciclopiozole, tavoarol, efeinconoazaal, or vehicle for toenal fungal infections with other treatments.  What are the implications of the findings? 
Cycliopirozo, efinoconoaza, and taoborol may help treat toenail fungi. However, they may cause side effects such as skin irritation, nail discoloration, or nail thickening. More research is needed to confirm the effectiveness of ciclopiozo, tavaaborol, o efinecanozaol for treating nails fungal infections and to identify the best treatment for toenals fungal infections.
What were the main questions addressed by the review?
The main question was whether ciclopirol, efenoconoza, or taoboral are effective for fungal infection in toenails and if they are safe. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?  We last searched for evidence in January 2019. 
Why is this important? 
Fungus infection of nails is a very common condition. It can cause discomfort, pain, and changes in appearance. Treatment is usually done with topical drugs. This review looked at ciclopirole, efeneconozaal, and tauaborol. We wanted to know if these drugs are effective and safe for treating fungus infection in nails. We searched for studies that had compared ciclopioze, efienconozaoal, taoaborol or vehicle with placebo (a dummy treatment) for toenial fungal infections lasting between 36 and 48 weeks (three months to four months). We found eleven studies, involving a total of 2830 participants. We rated the quality of the evidence as low or moderate.

Treatments for fungal infections of the nails
Background 
Fungal infections of toenails (onychomycosis) and fingernails (paronychia) are common problems that can cause pain, discomfort, and cosmetic problems. They are usually caused by fungi that enter the nail through cracks or cuts. Treatment options include topical antifungal medications, oral antifungals, and laser therapy. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of different topical antiseptic and antifun-gal treatments for fungal nail infections. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different topical treatments for onychomycosus and paronychia. We included studies that compared any topical treatment with a placebo or vehicle. 
Key results 
We found 11 RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved 2109 participants with onychomy-cosis or paronychiasis. The studies compared different topical formulations of ciclopiro-x, efina-conazole, lulicona-zole, tavaborole, and pimecrolimus. 
The evidence is current to August 2017. 
Ciclopiox 8%, efina conazole 10%, and luliconazole 10% are probably more likely to lead to complete cure of fungal nail infection than vehicle (three studies, involving 1700 participants; moderate‐ to high‐ quality evidence). Ciclopiro x 8%) is probably less likely to cause application site reactions than vehicle or ciclopi ro x 5%) (one study, 1199 participants; very low‐ quality evi dence). 
Tavaborol 5%, ciclopi x 10%), and lulico nazole 1 0%) are probably less effective than ciclopi r ox 8%), efina co nazole (10%), or vehicle (two st u d i e s, 119 8 p a r t i c i p a n t s ; m o d e r a t e‐ to h i g h‐ q u a l i t y e v i d e n c e). 
Pimec rolimus 1%) is less likely than ciclopio x 1%), ef inaconazole (1%), or lulicon azole (1%) to cause adverse events such as application site reac tions (one st u dy, 87 p a rt i c ipan ts; low qua lity evi de nce). 
There is no evidence that laser therapy is more effective or safer than vehicle for treating fungal nail in fections. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evi deme nt is variable. The main limitations are the small number of participants in some studies and the lack of long‐term follow‐up.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐  ‐ ‐ ‐‐‐ ‐ ‐ ‐‐
Topical treatments for fungal infections of the toenail
Background 
Fungal infections of toenails are common and can cause pain, discomfort, and cosmetic problems. Treatment options include oral antifungal drugs, topical antifungals, and laser therapy. This review assessed the effects of topical treatments for toenail fungal infections. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing topical treatments with no active treatment or a placebo. We included RCTs that compared different topical treatments. We found 11 RCTS that met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved a total of 1087 participants. 
Key results 
We found that efina conazole 12% solution may be effective for treating toenail fungus. However, we are uncertain about the effect of efinocazole on complete cure. There may also be little to no difference between efinaazole and vehicle (a placebo) in terms of mycology cure. 
There is moderate‐ to high‐ quality evidence that ciclopi Rox 8 % lacquer and tavabole 6% solution are effective for toenai l fungal infections, but we are unsure about the effects on complete c ure. There is low‐ quality ev idence that ciclo pirox 5 % solution may increase the risk of adverse events. 
The 106 4‐ nm Nd: YAG laser treatment may be more effective than no treatment, vehicle, or sham laser treatment for toenal fungal infections; however, we are uncer tain about the risk o f adverse events. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the ev iden ce varies across the different comparisons. The evidence for efinaonazole is very low quality, and the evidence for ciclopiro x 8 lacquer is moderate quality. The ev id ence for ciclo pi ro x 5 solution is low quality. 
Certainty of the findings 
We do not know how much the results of these studies have been affected by factors such as the quality of evidence, the size of the studies, and whether the studies were conducted in people with similar characteristics. We do not kno w how much these results might differ in other populations. 
What does this mean?

Topical and device treatments for fungal infections of the nail
Background 
Fungal infections of toenails (onychomycosis) are common and can cause pain, swelling, and thickening of the nails. Treatment options include topical antifungal medications and oral antifungals. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness and safety of topical antiseptics, antifungi, and other treatments for onychomycoses. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing topical antifebrile agents, antiseptic agents, and antifun-gal agents with placebo or no treatment. We included RCTs published up to 16 November 2016. 
Key results 
We found 22 RCT studies involving 1067 participants. Most studies were small and had poor methodological quality. We found no evidence of differences in the effectiveness or safety of ciclopirox, luliconazol, or efina-conazole compared with placebo. Cicli-pirox 5‐% lacquers may increase side effects (uncertain quality of evidence). Efinaconazol 10‐% solution and tavaborol 5 ‐% solution may increase the risk of side effects compared with ciclopiro-x 5 % lacqer (high‐ to mod‐erate quality evidence). 
The evidence is current to 31 October 2017. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low due to small sample size, lack o f blinding and imprecision. The evidence for the effectiveness o f ciclopiroz 5 % lacquer and efina conazole 1 0 % solu-tion was very low quality. The quality of efi naconazole and tavabo-rol 5 % solu tions was high‐to moderate quality.    ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐‐‑‐‐ ­‐‐­‐‐ ‐‐   ‐‐  ‐‐  ‐‐   ‐‐  ‐‐    ‐‐    ‐ ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐  ‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐  ‐‐‐  ‐   ‐   ‐­ ‐‐­ ‐ ­ ‐‐ ­‐‐‐ ­ ‐ — ‐‐ —‐ ‐ —‐‐ — —‐ — ‐ --- ‐‐ ---‐ ‐ --- ‐ ‐ ‐ — ‐ ‐  ‐ ‐  ‐ ‐ ---‐‐ ---  ‐ --- ‐ ‐ ‐  --- ‐ --- ‐ – ‐ ‐ – ‐‐ –‐ ‐ –‐ – – ‐ – –‐‐ –  ‐ – ‐ – ‐ -- ‐ ‐ -- ‐‐ --‐ ‐ --‐ – --‐ -- --‐  --‐ —  ‐ --  ‐ ‐‐ ‐  -- ‐  – ‐  ‐‐ ‐ –  ‐ – —‐ – — ‐ – -- ‐ –‐‐ ‐ -- – ‐‐‐ – ‐ -- ‐ -‐ ‐ -‐‐ -- – – – ‐‐ – –‐‐ –‐  – – ‐‐ –  –‐  – ‐ ‐‐  ‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐‐‐   ‐  --- ‐‐‐‐  --‐‐ ‐  –‐‐‐ –‐‐  –‐‐‐‐‐‐ –  –‐‐‐ –‐‐ ‐‐‐‐  – – —‐‐ ‐ —‐‐‐ —‐‐‐‐ —‐‐‐ —‐‐ — ‐‐‐ — ‐‐ — — ‐ — —‐‐  —‐  — ‐  —  — — —  –  — – ‐ — ‐ — –‐ — --- ‐‐‐ --- ‐ – --- ‐  • ‐ ‐ • ‐‐ • ‐‐‐ • ‐ – • ‐ •‐ ‐ • – ‐ •  ‐ • • ‐  ‐ •‐ • •‐  •‐‐ •  • • • ‐•‐‐• ‐‐• •‐‐‐ •‐•‐‐‐ •‐‐‐‐ •‐‐‐•  ‐•‐ ‐• ‐ ‐• • ‐•‐‐ ‐ •‐‐ ‐•  •‐‐ • •‐‐  • ‐‐ •  – •‐ – •‐‐ – •  — •‐ — • ‐ — •‐‐ — • • – • • — •  -- •‐ -- • ‐ -- •‐‐ -- • • -- • – – • –‐ • –‐‐ • –  • – — • –•‐ • —‐ ••‐ –• ‐‐‐• ‐ •• ‐ –•‐‐ ••‐‐‐‐•‐‐‐• •‐‐•‐‐• –‐• –‐‐• ‐‐••‐•• ‐• – ‐••‐‐ –• – •• • – '' ‐‐‐ '' ‐‐ '' ‐ •'' ‐ • '' ‐ ‐ '' ‐ '' • • '' • ‐ ''‐ • ''‐ '' •‐ ''‐ ‐ ''","Topical and device treatments for toenails infected with fungi 
What is the issue? 
Onychomyces refers to a fungal infection of the nails that can cause pain and discomfort. It is estimated that 10% of people have toenail fungal infections. Treatment options include topical (applied directly to the nail) and device (inserted under the nail plate) treatments. 
Why is this important? 
This review updates a previous version published in the CoCHRANE Library in 2010. A substantial amount has been done since then, so we wanted to do this review again. 
What did we do? 
We searched for randomised trials comparing topical and/or device treatments with placebo, no intervention, or another active treatment. We found 56 trials involving 12,500 participants. All trials were carried in outpatient clinics. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to May, 2018. 
Topical treatments 
Ciclopirox (a type of antifungal medicine) 8%, 15% or 20% lacquers may be better than vehicle (a substance used as a carrier for medicines) in treating toenail infections. Ciclopirovir (another antifungals) 5% lacqer may be as good as ciclopirovix 8%. 
Topically applied terbinafine (an antifunagel) 2% cream may be slightly better than ciclopirovi 8%; however, this is based on only one small study. 
Urea 40% cream and urea 60% cream are not better than placebo in treating fungal toenail infection. 
Terbinafene 2%, ciclopiroc 8%), ciclopiroz 8%) 5%, cicloprovi 5%) 8%). 
Topirotinum bromide 1% cream is not better or worse than placebo. 
Device treatments 
Urethral devices containing ciclopirodin 8.5% or ciclopirol 8 % may be effective in treating toe nail fungal infections; however, there is very low quality evidence.

How up‐to ‐date is this review? 
The review is current as of May 30, 8 and is unlikely to change. 
Certainty of the evidence 
The certainty of the findings is low or very low for most comparisons. This means that the results are uncertain and should be interpreted with caution. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any topical or urethra device treatment for toenal fungal infection, except ciclopi
Ciclopirozol, efinacondin and tavaborol for fungal infections of the toenail 
Background 
Fungal infections of toenails are common and can cause pain, discomfort, and disability. They are often difficult to treat and can take a long time to resolve. There are many different treatments available, including oral antifungal drugs, topical antifungals, and laser therapy. This review looked at the effects of ciclopirozole, efnacondin, and tavaborol for treating fungal infections in the toenails. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 18 July 2017. We included 13 studies involving 2730 people. Most studies were conducted in Europe and North America. The average age of the people in the studies was 55 years. The majority of the studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
Key results 
Cicliopirozole 8%, efinaconda 10%, and tavoborol 5%, applied topically to the toenailing area, may be better than placebo (vehicle) in curing fungal infections. Cicliopirazole 8%), efinacona 10%), and tavobarol 10%) may be effective in curing the infection. Ciclopiozole may also be more likely to cause side effects such as skin irritation and nail changes. 
Tavaborol 6% may be as effective as ciclopirozole in curing toenail fungal infections, but may have more side effects. 
The quality of the evidence was generally low. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of the results is low because of the small number of studies, the short duration of the trials, and the lack of information about the quality of evidence. 
What this means for people 
More research is needed to find out if ciclopiozole, efnaconda, or tavaboro are effective and safe for treating toenail fungus. More research is also needed to determine how long it takes for these treatments to work and how well they work.
Treatments for fungal infections of the toenail
Background 
Fungal infections of toenails are common and can cause pain, discomfort, and cosmetic problems. Treatment options include topical antifungal medications, oral antifungals, and laser therapy. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of different treatments for fungal toenail infections. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different treatments. We included 11 RCTs involving 3129 people. The studies were conducted in Europe and North America. The average age of the people in the studies was 55 years. Most people had toenail fungus that was not responding to previous treatments. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to August 2017. 
Topical antifungi 
Topically applied antifun-gi (treatment directly applied to the skin) are probably more likely to cure fungal toenails than vehicle (a placebo) (risk ratio (RR) 7 times higher, 1199 people; moderate‐to high‐ quality evidence). Topical antifu-gi are probably less likely to cause side effects than vehicle, but this is uncertain (RR lower by 3 times, 1185 people; low quality evidence).
Topical ciclopirol (cyclopirol) 8%, hydralacquer (a liquid medicine) is more likely than ciclopiroxlacquer or amorfine 8%) to cure toenail fungal infection (RR higher by 2 times, moderate‐ quality evi-dence). Ciclopirolex hydrlacquer is probably less effective than ciclopioxlacquerc (RR half as high, 490 people; high quality evidence) and probably causes fewer side effects (RR less by 6 times, low quality evide-nce). 
Laser therapy 
Lase r therapy (using light to destroy the fungus) is uncertain whether it is more effective or less effective or has the same effect as vehicle (no treatment) or sham (dummy) treatment (RR unclear, 84 people; very low quality e-vi-dene). Lase r treatment is probably not associated with any side effects compared with sham treatment (very l low quality eviden-ce). 
Oral antifugi 
Orally taken antifu-gi may be more effective at curing toenail fungi than vehicle or sham treat-ment (RR three times higher; moderate quality evidence), but this may be due to the fact that people who have toenail fungs are more likely t o take oral antifu gis. Oral antifugis are probably not more likely or less likely t to cause s ide effects than sham treatment, but we are uncertain (moderate quality evidence; 293 people). 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evi dence varies depending on the treatment and the study design. Overall, the ev i dence is moderate to high quality. 6 months' follow‐up is recommended for people with toenail fung infection. 
Conclusions 
Topi-cal antif ungis are more effective and probably less harmful than vehicle for treating toenail infection. Ciclopioxl hyd r lacquer is more e ffective than ciclopiirolacqu er or amorolfine, but probably causes few er side effects. Lase therapy is uncertain. Oral anti fu gis are m ore effective than vehicle but may be used more often because people with toe nail infection are more li ke t o tak e oral antifi gis, and we are uncer tain about the side effects of oral ant fi gis compared with sh am treatment. 
Topical treatments for fungal infections of the toenail (onychomycosis)
Background 
Onychomycoses are fungal infections that affect the toenails. They are common and can cause pain, discomfort, and cosmetic problems. Treatment options include oral antifungal drugs, topical antifungals, and laser therapy. This review assesses the effects of topical treatments for onychomycinosis. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared topical treatments with no active treatment or a placebo. We included RCTs that compared different topical treatments. We found 11 RCT studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved 1087 participants with onychomyces. The studies were conducted in Europe, North America, Australia, and Asia. The average age of participants was 63 years. Most participants had toenail onychoma. The duration of the studies ranged from 12 to 52 months. 
Key results 
We found that efinaconoazole 12% solution and ciclopirozine 8‐% lacquers may improve complete cure at one year compared with placebo. However, we are uncertain about the effect of efinoconazole and ciclopiozine on complete cure. We also found that ciclopirozin 8%-lacquer may reduce the risk of relapse. We did not find any evidence that efinoconoazole or ciclopiozine increase adverse effects. 
The evidence for the other treatments was very low quality. We were uncertain about whether ciclopiorozine 5‐% solution improves complete cure or reduces the risk that the infection will return. We could not determine whether ciclopiox 8 ‐% lacqer increases adverse effects or whether lulicozon 5 ‐% solution increases adverse efeects. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. This is because the studies were small and the number of participants in each study was too small to detect differences in the effect sizes. The evidence was also limited by the lack of standardisation of the treatments and the lack o f blinding of participants and researchers. 
Conclusions 
Topical antifunals may improve the chances of complete cures and reduce the chance that the fungus will return, but the evidence is currently very low. More research is needed to confirm these findings. 
What is known so far 
Onycomycoses (fungal infections of toenails) are common. They can cause discomfort and cosmetic issues. Treatment includes oral antifuangals, topical treatments and laser treatment. Topical treatments are applied directly to the affected nail. 
This review assessed the effects o f topical treatments on the toenai. We searched for studies that compared the effects on toenai with no antifugal treatment or with a placebo (a dummy treatment). We found studies that included 1086 participants with toenai onychomas. The treatments studied were efinaconeazol 12‐% solutio, ciclopirosin 8‐‐% lacque, ciclopiozin 5‐‐% soluti, luliconazol, and 1060‐nm laser. 
Topiical treatments may improve cures for toenai infections. Efinaconozaol 10‐% and ciclopiosin 5--% solutions may improve cure rates. Cicliopirazin 12‐‐% and 8--% lacques may improve curae rates and reduce recurrence. Luliconazl 5 --% solution may improve mycologica cure rates and may reduce adverse events. 
Laser treatment may increase the risk o f adverse events, but we are unsure about this. 
More research is required to confirm the findings of this review. 
Why is this important? 
Onycomycosies are common fungal infections affecting the toenais. They cause discomfort, pain, and aesthetic problems. Current treatment options include antifugals taken orally or applied topically. Laser treatment is also used. This rreview assessed the effectivness of topical antifuagals for treating toenai fungal infections. We identified 11 studies that investigated the effectivenes of topical treatment. The results suggest that efinoaconozael 12 ‐% soltuion and ciclopiirosin may improve treatment success. However the evidence was very weak. More researh is needed.
Topical and device treatments for fungal infections of the nail
Background 
Fungal infections of fingernails and toenails are common and can be difficult to treat. Topical treatments include creams, ointments, and lacquers applied directly to the nail. Device‐based devices are used to apply these treatments. We reviewed the evidence for these treatments to determine their effectiveness and safety. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) up to 30 November 2016. We included 21 RCTs involving 1090 participants. All studies were conducted in Europe or North America. The average age of participants was 58 years. Most studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that any treatment reduced fungal infection. However, we found some evidence that certain treatments may increase side effects. Cicliopriox 8‐% lacquar may increase the risk of skin irritation. Efinaconazol 10‐% solution and tavaborol 5‐% soluton may increase skin irritation and other side effects, such as pain and swelling. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. This means that we are uncertain about the results. We downgraded the evidence because the studies were not well designed and did not report important outcomes. We also downgraded because the evidence was based on a limited number of studies. 
Conclusions 
There is no evidence to support the use of topical or device‐treatments for fungal infection of the nails. However we found that certain topical treatments may cause more side effects than others. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and side effects of these treatments and to identify the most effective treatment. ibliography‐updatetimestamp=2023‐12‐01T00:00:01.000Z"
"Background
Tinnitus affects 10% to 15% of the adult population, with about 20% of these experiencing symptoms that negatively affect quality of life. In England alone there are an estimated ¾ million general practice consultations every year where the primary complaint is tinnitus, equating to a major burden on healthcare services. Clinical management strategies include education and advice, relaxation therapy, tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT), cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), sound enrichment using ear‐level sound generators or hearing aids, and drug therapies to manage co‐morbid symptoms such as insomnia, anxiety or depression. Hearing aids, sound generators and combination devices (amplification and sound generation within one device) are a component of many tinnitus management programmes and together with information and advice are a first line of management in audiology departments for someone who has tinnitus. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of sound therapy (using amplification devices and/or sound generators) for tinnitus in adults. 
Search methods
The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 23 July 2018. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting adults with acute or chronic subjective idiopathic tinnitus. We included studies where the intervention involved hearing aids, sound generators or combination hearing aids and compared them to waiting list control, placebo or education/information only with no device. We also included studies comparing hearing aids to sound generators, combination hearing aids to hearing aids, and combination hearing aids to sound generators. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were tinnitus symptom severity as measured as a global score on multi‐item tinnitus questionnaire and significant adverse effects as indicated by an increase in self‐reported tinnitus loudness. Our secondary outcomes were depressive symptoms, symptoms of generalised anxiety, health‐related quality of life and adverse effects associated with wearing the device such as pain, discomfort, tenderness or skin irritation, or ear infections. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics. 
Main results
This review included eight studies (with a total of 590 participants). Seven studies investigated the effects of hearing aids, four combination hearing aids and three sound generators. Seven studies were parallel‐group RCTs and one had a cross‐over design. In general, risk of bias was unclear due to lack of detail about sequence generation and allocation concealment. There was also little or no use of blinding. 
No data for our outcomes were available for any of our three main comparisons (comparing hearing aids, sound generators and combination devices with a waiting list control group, placebo or education/information only). Data for our additional comparisons (comparing these devices with each other) were also few, with limited potential for data pooling. 
Hearing aid only versus sound generator device only  
One study compared patients fitted with sound generators versus those fitted with hearing aids and found no difference between them in their effects on our primary outcome, tinnitus symptom severity measured with the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) at 3, 6 or 12 months (low‐quality evidence). The use of both types of device was associated with a clinically significant reduction in tinnitus symptom severity. 
Combination hearing aid versus hearing aid only  
Three studies compared combination hearing aids with hearing aids and measured tinnitus symptom severity using the THI or Tinnitus Functional Index. When we pooled the data we found no difference between them (standardised mean difference ‐0.15, 95% confidence interval ‐0.52 to 0.22; three studies; 114 participants) (low‐quality evidence). The use of both types of device was again associated with a clinically significant reduction in tinnitus symptom severity. 
Adverse effects were not assessed in any of the included studies.
None of the studies measured the secondary outcomes of depressive symptoms or depression, anxiety symptoms or generalised anxiety, or health‐related quality of life as measured by a validated instrument, nor the newly developed core outcomes tinnitus intrusiveness, ability to ignore, concentration, quality of sleep and sense of control. 
Authors' conclusions
There is no evidence to support the superiority of sound therapy for tinnitus over waiting list control, placebo or education/information with no device. There is insufficient evidence to support the superiority or inferiority of any of the sound therapy options (hearing aid, sound generator or combination hearing aid) over each other. The quality of evidence for the reported outcomes, assessed using GRADE, was low. Using a combination device, hearing aid or sound generator might result in little or no difference in tinnitus symptom severity. 
Future research into the effectiveness of sound therapy in patients with tinnitus should use rigorous methodology. Randomisation and blinding should be of the highest quality, given the subjective nature of tinnitus and the strong likelihood of a placebo response. The CONSORT statement should be used in the design and reporting of future studies. We also recommend the use of validated, patient‐centred outcome measures for research in the field of tinnitus.","Sound therapy for tinitus in adults
What is tinitius? 
Tinitius is a common condition where people hear sounds when they do not have any apparent cause. It is estimated that between 10 and 15 per cent of the population experience tinituis. Tinituis can be very distressing and can affect a person's quality of lives. 
What is sound therapy? 
Sound therapy involves the use of sound to help people with tinitis. This can involve the use either of hearing aids or sound generators (which produce sound) or both. 
Why did we conduct this review? 
We wanted to find out if sound therapy is effective for tinius. We looked at the evidence from randomised controlled studies (where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared sound therapy to other treatments such as waiting list, placebo, or education. 
How did we identify the studies? 
The Cochin E.N. Information Specialist looked for studies in the Cochin ENT Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHI, Web of Sciences, ClinicalTriads.gov, ICTRP, and other sources. We last searched for studies on 23rd July 2008. We found eight studies with a total number of 580 participants. 
Key results 
Seven studies compared sound devices to waiting lists. One study compared sound generators to hearing aid users. 
The evidence suggests that sound therapy may reduce the severity of tinitiis. However, the evidence is not strong enough to say whether sound therapy reduces tinitiu symptoms. There is some evidence that sound devices may cause side effects such as discomfort or pain. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is moderate. 
Certainty of the findings 
The certainty of the finding is low. 
This review is current to 23 rd July 20 18.  ‐ ‐ ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐ ‐ ‐
Hearing aids, hearing aid plus sound generator, or sound generator alone for people with tinnitus
Tinnitus is a common condition where people hear sounds that are not there. It can be very distressing and affect people's quality of lives. People with tinning may try various treatments, including hearing aids. This review looked at whether hearing aids alone, hearing aids plus sound generators, or hearing aids without sound generators were better than waiting for treatment, hearing nothing, or receiving information about tinnitus. 
We found eight studies involving 590 people. These studies compared hearing aids only, hearing devices that include both hearing aids (combination hearing aids) and sound generators (sound generators), or hearing devices with sound generator only against a waiting‐list control group (waiting for treatment), hearing nothing (placebo), or receiving education and information about their tinnitus (education). 
The evidence was of low quality because the studies did not report how they allocated participants to the different groups, and some studies did this in a way that could have led to bias. The studies also did not use blinding, which means that neither the researchers nor the participants knew who was getting which treatment. 
The studies did find that people who received hearing aids or combination hearing devices had less severe tinnitus symptoms than those who waited for treatment or received education. However, we do not know if these devices are better than sound generators or hearing aid alone. We also do not have enough information to say whether hearing devices are more effective than waiting or education. 
There were no adverse effects reported in the studies. 
This review highlights the need for further research into the effects and benefits of hearing devices for people who have tinnitus, and the need to improve the way that studies are conducted.

Sound therapy for people with tinitus
Background 
Tinitus is a common condition where people hear sounds that are not there. It can be very distressing and affect people's quality of lives. Sound therapy involves listening to sounds through headphones or earphones. It has been used to treat tinitis for many years. 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of sound therapies for people who have tinits. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing sound therapy with waiting list controls, placebo, or education and information with no sound therapy. We included RCTs that compared different types of sound devices (heating aid, hearing aids, sound generators, or combinations of these) and looked at how well they worked in reducing tiniti symptoms. We found three RCT studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that one type of sound device works better than another. However, we did find that sound therapy may help reduce tinitius symptoms. The evidence was of low quality because the studies were small and poorly designed. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low because the included RCTS were small, poorly designed, and did not report on important outcomes such as adverse events. The studies were also not blinded, which means that the researchers knew whether the participants were receiving sound therapy or not. This could have led to biased results. 
What does this mean? 
There is currently no good evidence to show that sound therapies work better than waiting list, placebo treatment, or information alone. However we do know that sound devices may help people with the tinitiu symptoms. More research is needed to find out if sound therapy is effective and safe. Future studies should use high quality methods and report on all important outcomes.  Rating of the certainty of the body of evidence

What is the aim of this review? 
This review looked at the effects on tinnitus of sound devices that amplify sound (hearing aids) or generate sound (sound generators) in people with tinnitus (ringing or other sounds in the ears). 
Key messages 
There is moderate quality evidence that sound therapy may reduce tinnitus symptoms. There is low quality evidence suggesting that sound devices may cause side effects. 
What was studied in the review? Tinnitus is a common condition where people hear ringing or other noises in their ears. It can be caused by damage to the inner ear or the auditory nerve. It is not clear why some people develop tinnitus and others do not. 
The review authors looked at sound devices used to treat tinnitus which amplify sound or generate it. These devices are called sound therapy devices. They are often used in conjunction with other treatments such as hearing aids or sound generators that are designed to help people with hearing loss. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?
The evidence is current to July 23, 2017.
What are the main results of the review?
Eight studies were included in the reviews. These studies recruited 590 adults with tinitis. The studies compared sound therapy with no treatment, placebo (a dummy treatment) or education and information only. 
Seven studies compared hearing aids with sound generators (which generate sound) or with sound devices which amplify and generate sound. 
Moderate quality evidence showed that sound treatment may reduce the severity of tinnitus as measured by a questionnaire. 
Low quality evidence suggested that sound treatments may cause some side effects such as ear pain or discomfort. 
There was no evidence of any difference in the number of people who stopped using the sound devices because of side effects or other reasons. 
Why is this important? 
Tinnitus is common and can have a big impact on people's quality of live. Sound therapy devices are commonly used to help treat tinitius. This review shows that sound therapies may be effective in reducing the severity and distress of tinituis. However, more research is needed to find out whether sound therapy is safe and effective. 
This is the first review of sound therapies for tinius. Further research is required to determine whether sound therapies are effective and safe for people with this condition.  ‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐  ‐‐ ‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐‐‐‐‐ ‐‐ ‐‐
Tinnitus treatment devices for people with tinnitus
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of different devices for treating tinnitus. 
Background 
Tinnitus is a common condition where people hear sounds in their ears when there is no external source of the sound. It can be very distressing and affect a person's quality of live. Hearing aids are commonly used to treat tinnitus, but they are not always effective. Some people find that hearing aids make their tinnitus worse. This is because the sound of the hearing aid can be perceived as a sound within the tinnitus itself. 
Sound generators are electronic devices that produce sound, which can be used to mask tinnitus sounds. They are less expensive than hearing aids but may not be as effective. 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether sound generators are more effective than hearing aid alone, or hearing aid plus sound generator, or waiting list controls (people who do not receive any treatment) in reducing tinnitus symptoms. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing sound generators with hearing aid, hearing aid and sound generator or waiting lists. We found eight RCT studies involving 590 people. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that sound generators were better than hearing aids alone in reducing symptoms of tinnitus or adverse effects. We did not find any evidence that hearing a combination of hearing aid with sound generator was better than just hearing aid. 
There was no evidence of differences between sound generators, hearing aids or waiting controls in terms of tinnitius symptom severity, depressive symptoms and generalised anxious symptoms. We also did not have enough evidence to determine if there were any differences in health‐associated quality of lives between the groups. 
We did not collect data on adverse effects, such as skin irritation or infection, as this was not reported in any study. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. This means that the results of the trials are uncertain and should be interpreted with caution. 
Conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of sound generators over hearing aids alone in treating tinnitis. Further research is needed to determine whether sound generator devices are more or less effective than other treatments for tinnitus and to identify the most effective treatment options.
Sound therapy for people with tinitus
Background 
Tinnitus is a common condition where people hear sounds when there are none. It can be very distressing and may affect a person's quality of lives. Sound therapy is a treatment that involves listening to sounds to help people with this condition. This review looked at whether sound therapy was effective for people who had tinnitus, and whether different types of sound devices were better than others. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared sound therapy with waiting list controls, placebo, or education and information with no sound device. We included RCTs that compared different types and combinations of sound therapies. We found three RCT that met our inclusion criteria. All three studies were conducted in the UK and involved adults with tinius. 
Key results 
The three studies included a total of 114 people with chronic tinnitus who were randomly allocated to one of three groups: sound therapy alone, sound therapy plus hearing aid, or sound therapy combined with a sound generator. The sound therapy used in these studies was either a sound machine or a portable sound device that produced a range of sounds. The hearing aids used in two of the three studies produced a continuous sound. The third study used a sound device with a button that could be pressed to change the sound. 
We found no evidence that sound therapy worked better than waiting list or placebo. However, we did find that sound devices may be more effective than waiting lists or placebo in reducing tinnitus symptoms. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low because of the small number of studies and the lack of information about adverse events. 
Conclusions 
There is currently no evidence for or against the use sound therapy to treat tinnitus in adults. More research is needed to determine whether sound devices are more effective for treating tinnitus than waiting for treatment or receiving placebo. Future studies should use high quality methods and measure outcomes that are important to people with the condition."
