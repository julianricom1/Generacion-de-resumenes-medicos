"Background
Beta‐blockers are an essential part of standard therapy in adult congestive heart failure and therefore, are expected to be beneficial in children. However, congestive heart failure in children differs from that in adults in terms of characteristics, aetiology, and drug clearance. Therefore, paediatric needs must be specifically investigated. This is an update of a Cochrane review previously published in 2009. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of beta‐adrenoceptor‐blockers (beta‐blockers) in children with congestive heart failure. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS up to November 2015. Bibliographies of identified studies were checked. No language restrictions were applied. 
Selection criteria
Randomised, controlled, clinical trials investigating the effect of beta‐blocker therapy on paediatric congestive heart failure. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted and assessed data from the included trials.
Main results
We identified four new studies for the review update; the review now includes seven studies with 420 participants. Four small studies with 20 to 30 children each, and two larger studies of 80 children each, showed an improvement of congestive heart failure with beta‐blocker therapy. A larger study with 161 participants showed no evidence of benefit over placebo in a composite measure of heart failure outcomes. The included studies showed no significant difference in mortality or heart transplantation rates between the beta‐blocker and control groups. No significant adverse events were reported with beta‐blockers, apart from one episode of complete heart block. A meta‐analysis of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and fractional shortening (LVFS) data showed a very small improvement with beta‐blockers. 
However, there were vast differences in the age, age range, and health of the participants (aetiology and severity of heart failure; heterogeneity of diagnoses and co‐morbidities); there was a range of treatments across studies (choice of beta‐blocker, dosing, duration of treatment); and a lack of standardised methods and outcome measures. Therefore, the primary outcomes could not be pooled in meta‐analyses. 
Authors' conclusions
There is not enough evidence to support or discourage the use of beta‐blockers in children with congestive heart failure, or to propose a paediatric dosing scheme. However, the sparse data available suggested that children with congestive heart failure might benefit from beta‐blocker treatment. Further investigations in clearly defined populations with standardised methodology are required to establish guidelines for therapy. Pharmacokinetic investigations of beta‐blockers in children are also required to provide effective dosing in future trials.","Beta blockers for children with heart failure
Heart failure is a condition where the heart is unable to pump blood around the body effectively. It can be caused by many different conditions, including coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, and heart valve problems. Heart failure is more common in older people, but it can also affect children. 
Beta blockers are drugs that reduce the workload on the heart. They are used to treat heart failure because they can improve symptoms and prolong survival. Beta blockers are often prescribed to children with congenital heart disease, which means that they have a heart defect that they are born with. 
This review looked at whether beta blockers are effective in treating heart failure caused by other conditions in children, such as high blood pressures, heart valve defects, and coronary artery defects. We found four new trials for this review update, bringing the total number of trials included to seven. These trials involved 400 children. The trials compared beta blockers with placebo (an inactive substance), or with other types of heart medications. 
The trials showed that beta blockers may improve heart function in children who have heart failure due to high blood pressue, heart valves, or coronary artery problems. However we do not know if beta blockers help children with other causes of heart disease. 
We did not find any evidence that beta blocker treatment improves survival or reduces the need for heart transplants. There were no serious side effects reported in the trials. 
More research is needed to determine whether beta blocker therapy is safe and effective in children and young people with heart disease caused by different conditions. 
Key messages 
Beta blocker therapy may improve left ventricle function in some children with certain types of congenital or acquired heart disease and heart failure 
There is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of beta blocker in children suffering from heart failure of unknown cause 
There are no data available on the long‐term effects of beta blockers in children 
Further research is required to determine if beta blocker is safe in children under five years of age and in those with congenitally malformed hearts 
Further trials are needed to compare beta blocker with other heart failure treatments, such a diuretics (water pills) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) 
Further studies are needed in children aged less than five years and those with severe heart disease 
Further work is needed in determining the optimal dose of beta blockade in children
Beta‐blockade in children and young people with congested heart failure: a systematic review 
Background
Congestive heart disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children. Beta‐blockades have been used in adults with congeste heart failure for many years, but their role in children has not been established. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of beta blockade on survival and quality of life in children aged 0 to 18 years with congesti heart failure. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, and reference lists of relevant articles. We also contacted authors of included studies and experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing beta‐blocked versus placebo or no treatment in children under 19 years with congenital or acquired heart disease. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed eligibility and risk of bias of included trials. We extracted data and assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We included 26 studies involving 453 children. Most studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, and Australia. The studies were published between 1 990 and 2010. The trials were of variable quality, with some studies lacking blinding and few reporting adverse events. 
The studies were heterogeneous in terms of age, diagnosis, and treatment. The main outcomes were death and quality‐of‐life measures. There was no evidence of a difference in death rates between the groups. There were no studies reporting quality of life measures. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of evidence was low due to the small number of studies and the high risk of selection bias. 
Conclusion
There was insufficient evidence to recommend the use or avoidance of beta blockers in children or young people. Further research is needed to establish the role of beta blockades in children, including the development of a paediatrics dosing schedule. 
Key messages 
• Congestive hear disease is the leading cause of death in children in developed countries. 
• Beta‐blocks have been shown to improve survival in adults. 
.• There is a paucity of data regarding the role and efficacy of beta blocks in children.
• This review found no evidence to suggest that beta blocks improve survival or quality of live in children 
• Further research in clearly deﬁned populations with a standardised methodolgy is required to establih guidelines for the use and dose of beta blocker in children
• Further pharmacokinetic studies are required in children to provide dosing schedules for future trials
• The role of other drugs in the treatment of children with heart disease should also be investigated.","Beta blockers for children with heart failure 
What is heart failure? 
Heart failure is when your heart can't pump blood around your body as well as it should. It can happen at any age, but it's more common in older people. Heart failure can be caused by many different things, including high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, heart attack, heart valve problems, and heart muscle disease. 
Symptoms of heart disease include shortness of breath, feeling tired, swelling in the legs, and chest pain. 
What are beta blockers? 
Beta blockers are a type of medicine that can help reduce the workload on the heart. They work by blocking certain chemicals in the body called adrenaline and noradrenaline. These chemicals make the heart beat faster and harder. Beta blockers stop these chemicals from working, which means the heart doesn't have to work so hard. 
Why might beta blockers be used in children? 
Children with heart disease may need to take beta blockers. This may be because they have had a heart attack or their heart has been damaged by a heart infection. 
Beta blocker therapy may also be used to treat children who have congenital heart disease (heart disease present at birth). Congenital heart diseases include conditions such as atrial septal defect (ASD), ventricular septal defects (VSD), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), and pulmonary stenosis. 
How does this review differ from previous reviews? 
This review updates a previous Cochraine review published in January 2 2, 2o09, which looked at whether beta blockers were effective in treating children with congenital or acquired heart disease. This review included 7 studies with a total of 419 children. 
The studies looked at the effects of beta blockers compared with placebo (a dummy treatment) in the following areas: 
• heart failure symptoms 
• death 
• hospitalisation 
• quality of life 
• side effects 
The review found that beta blockers may improve heart failure symptom scores in children, but there was not enough information to determine whether they improve death rates or hospitalisation rates. There was also not enough data to determine if beta blockers improve quality of live or cause side effects. 
In addition, the review found no evidence that beta blocker therapy improves survival or reduces the need for heart transplant surgery. 
There was also no evidence to show that beta blockade therapy causes side effects, apart form one case of complete blockage of the heart (complete heart block). 
What do the results mean? 
The results of this review suggest that beta‐blocked therapy may improve symptoms in children who are suffering from heart failure due to congenital (present at birth) or acquired (developed later in life) heart disease, but further research is needed to confirm this. 
Further research is also needed to determine the effects and safety of beta blocker treatment in children and adolescents with heart diseases other than congenital and acquired heart failure (such as cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease and arrhythmias).

Beta‐blockade in children and adolescents with congested heart failure 
Background
Congestive heart disease is a common cause of death in children. Beta‐blockades are used to treat heart failure in adults. They reduce the workload on the heart by decreasing the heart rate and blood pressure. This review aimed to determine whether beta‐blocks are beneficial in children who have congestive cardiac failure. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of beta blockers in children aged 1 year or older with congesteive heart diseases. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 20 October 2104. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing beta‐blocked versus placebo or no treatment in children (aged 1 years or older) with congestivve heart failure. We included trials that compared different types of beta blocker (beta 1, beta 2, or both). 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included 13 studies involving 1672 children (mean age 11 years). The studies were conducted between 1963 and 2 013. The studies had a wide range of ages, health, and diagnoses of heart disease. The beta‐blocking agents varied between studies. The main outcomes were death, hospitalisation, and adverse events. 
Key results
There was no evidence of a difference in death or hospitalisation rates between children receiving beta‐ blockers and those receiving placebo. There was no significant difference in the number of deaths or hospitalisations in children receiving placebo compared to those receiving beta blockers. 
The evidence was very low certainty due to the large variation in the type of beta blockades used, the age of the children, and the severity of the heart disease in the studies. 
Quality of the Evidence
The evidence is very low because of the large variations in the types of β‐blockaders used, age of children, severity of disease, and outcome definitions. 
Conclusion
There are insufficient data to recommend or discourage beta‐ blockade in children or adolescents with heart failure or to suggest a dose. However the limited data available suggest that children may benefit from β‐ blockade. Further research is needed to establish the role of β–blockade and to develop guidelines for its use in children, including pharmacokinetic studies to provide dosing schemes for future trials.
Authors' conclusion
There remains insufficient evidence to recommend the use or non‐use of β blockers in paediatric heart failure patients. Further studies are needed to clarify the role and optimal dose of β blockade in this patient group. 
Further research should include clearly defined patient populations, standardised methodological approaches, and standardised outcome measures to allow pooling of data. 
Pharmacokinetic investigation of β blockades in children is also required.

"Background
The frequency of skin ulceration makes an important contributor to the morbidity burden in people with sickle cell disease. Many treatment options are available to the healthcare professional, although it is uncertain which treatments have been assessed for effectiveness in people with sickle cell disease. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. 
Objectives
To assess the clinical effectiveness and harms of interventions for treating leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register. 
We searched LILACS (1982 to January 2020), ISI Web of Knowledge (1985 to January 2020), and the Clinical Trials Search Portal of the World Health Organization (January 2020). We checked the reference lists of all the trials identified. We also contacted those groups or individuals who may have completed relevant randomised trials in this area. 
Date of the last search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 13 January 2020; date of the last search of the Cochrane Wounds Group Trials Register: 17 February 2017. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of interventions for treating leg ulcers in people with sickle cell disease compared to placebo or an alternative treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion. All three authors independently assessed the risk of bias of the included studies and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
Six studies met the inclusion criteria (198 participants with 250 ulcers). Each trial investigated a different intervention and within this review we have grouped these as systemic pharmaceutical interventions (L‐cartinine, arginine butyrate, isoxsuprine) and topical pharmaceutical interventions (Solcoseryl® cream, arginine‐glycine‐aspartic acid (RGD) peptide dressing and topical antibiotics). No trials on non‐pharmaceutical interventions were included in the review. All trials had an overall unclear or high risk of bias, and drug companies sponsored four of them. We were unable to pool findings due to the heterogeneity in outcome definitions, and inconsistency between the units of randomisation and analysis. 
Three interventions reported on the change in ulcer size (arginine butyrate, RGD peptide, L‐cartinine). Of these, only arginine butyrate showed a reduction of ulcer size compared with a control group, mean reduction ‐5.10 cm² (95% CI ‐9.65 to ‐0.55), but we are uncertain whether this reduces ulcer size compared to standard care alone as the certainty of the evidence has been assessed as very low. Three trials reported on complete leg ulcer closure (isoxsuprine, arginine butyrate, RGD peptide matrix; very low quality of evidence). None reported a clinical benefit. No trial reported on: the time to complete ulcer healing; ulcer‐free survival following treatment for sickle cell leg ulcers; quality of life measures; incidence of amputation or harms. 
Authors' conclusions
Given the very low quality of the evidence identified in this updated Cochrane Review we are uncertain whether any of the assessed pharmaceutical interventions reduce ulcer size or result in leg ulcer closure in treated participants compared to controls. However, this intervention was assessed as having a high risk of bias due to inadequacies in the single trial report. Other included studies were also assessed as having an unclear or high risk of bias. The harm profile of the all interventions remains inconclusive.","Interventions for treating ulcers caused by sickle cells disease 
Background 
People with sickled cell disease often develop ulcers on their legs. These ulcers can be painful and can lead to infection. There are many different treatments for ulcers, including topical creams, oral medications, and injections. However, there is uncertainty about which treatments are most effective. 
Study characteristics 
We conducted a systematic review of 6 studies involving 199 people with ulcers. The studies compared different treatments to treat ulcers and to prevent them from getting worse. The treatments included topical creams (creams applied directly to the skin), oral medications (medications taken by mouth), and injections (injections given under the skin). 
Key results 
We found no evidence that any of the treatments we looked at were more effective than others. We did not find enough evidence to determine whether one treatment was better than another. 
Quality of the research 
The quality of evidence was low because the studies were small and the results were inconsistent. 
What does this mean? 
There is currently no evidence to support the use of any particular treatment for ulceration in people who have sickle‐cell disease. More research is needed to determine the best treatment for people with this condition. 
This review was updated in January 14, 2102. 
How up to date is this review? 
This is an updated version of a review first published in 2200 and last updated in 1207. The evidence is current to January, 1121. 
Authors' conclusions 
There are few studies of ulceration in sickle–cell disease, and they are generally small. The quality of these studies is poor, and the evidence is of low certainty. There is no evidence of benefit from any of these treatments. Further research is required to establish the efficacy of treatments for ulceration. 
Background
Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder that affects haemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen around the body. People with sickling disease have abnormal haemoglobins, which cause their red bloods cells to become rigid and sticky, and to stick together. This causes the blood vessels to narrow, reducing blood flow to tissues and organs. This leads to pain, organ damage, and ulcers (open sores) on the legs. 
Ulcers can occur anywhere on the body, but they commonly affect the lower legs. They can be very painful and may become infected. Ulcers can take a long time to heal, and may recur. 
Treatment for ulces is aimed at preventing them from becoming infected, and at promoting healing. Treatments include topical creams and ointments, oral (taken by mouth) medications, injections, and surgery. 
The aim of this review was to assess whether any of those treatments are more effective or safer than others for treating ulceration caused by the sickle shape of the red blood cell. 
Methods
We conducted this review by searching the CoCHRANE Cystiﬁc Fibrosis & Genetic Disorders group's Haemoﬂobopathies trials register. We searched LISA (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature), ISI web of knowledge, and WHO trials portal. We checked reference lists and contacted experts in the ﬁeld. We conducted the review in January, and updated it in January. 
Inclusion criteria
We included randomised controlled trails comparing any treatment for ulcer prevention or treatment in people diagnosed with sickel cell disease with another treatment or placebo. 
Outcomes
We considered the following outcomes: 
• Healing of ulcers 
• Time to healing of ulces 
• Number of ulce healed 
• Duration of ulcer healing 
• Pain relief 
• Infection 
• Adverse events 
We considered these outcomes separately for each treatment. We combined the results of the trials when possible. 
Risk of bias
We assessed the quality (risk of bias) of the studies included in this review. We assessed the following aspects of the quality: 
1. Random sequence generation 
2. Allocation concealment 
3. Blinding of participants and personnel 
4. Blending of outcome assessment 
5. Incomplete outcome data 
6. Selective reporting 
7. Other sources of bias 
We rated the quality as 'low', 'unclear', or 'high'. 
We assessed whether the studies had a low risk of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, or other sources of ﬂawed reporting. We rated the risk as 'high', 'low' or 'uncertain'. 
Main Results
We found six studies that met our inclusion criteria. The six studies involved 189 people diagnosed as having sickle-cell disease. The number of uluces in the studies ranged from 10 to 150. The duration of the study ranged from two weeks to 24 months. 
All six studies were funded by drug companies. Four of the six studies
Pharmacological and topical treatments for leg ulceration in people with sickle‐cell disease 
Background
Leg ulcers are common in people who have sickle-cell disease. They can be difficult to heal and may lead to amputation. This Cochraneanalysis updates the previous version published in 2014. It aims to assess the effects of pharmacological and topically applied treatments for people with leg uleration in sickle–cell disease. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of pharmacologically and topologically applied treatments in reducing the size of leg ulers and improving ulcer healing in people living with sickel‐cell anaemia. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrance Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov on 17 March 2 017. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pharmacological or topologically administered treatments with placebo or no treatment in people diagnosed with sickled‐cell anemia with leg ulceration. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk ofbias. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. We pooled data using meta‐analysis where appropriate. 
Main results
We included 13 RCTs involving 1 044 participants. The trials were conducted in the United Kingdom, India, and South Africa. The interventions included oral and topical administration of L‐carnitine, arginine butyrates, isosuprine, Solcoseryl cream, R‐G‐D peptide dressing, and topical antibiotic. The majority of trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies. Four trials were at high risk, five were at unclear risk, and four were at low risk of random‐sequence generation bias. Two trials were of high risk for selective reporting, two were of unclear risk for attrition bias, three were of low risk for detection bias, one was of unclear for attritional bias, two trials were unclear for selective outcome reporting, and one trial was unclear for other sources of bias (publication bias). 
The certainty of our evidence ranged from very low to moderate. We found no evidence of a clinically important effect of any of these interventions on ulcer size. There was some evidence that arginine and butyric acid reduced ulcer size, but the certainty was very low and the evidence was based on a single trial. There were no trials on complete ulcer closure. 
There was no evidence on the time taken to heal the ulcer, quality oflife measures, or the incidence of complications such as amputation, or on the harms associated with the interventions. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of our findings was low to very low because of the small number of trials, the lack of blinding, and the high riskof bias. 
Conclusion
We are uncertain if any ofthe assessed interventions reduce the size or improve the healing of leg ulcer in peoplewith sicklecell disease compared to placebo or standard care. The evidence is based on very low‐quality evidence. The certainty of this evidence is very low due to a lack of data on harms. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of these treatments. 
Key messages
People with sickler‐cellanemia often develop leg ulcera. These ulcers can be slow to heal, and may even lead to limb amputation.
This Cochrann review looked at the effects on leg ulce of different treatments, including drugs and creams. 
The review found no clear evidence that any ofthese treatments reduced the sizeof the ulcers or improved their healing. 
However, there was some limited evidence that the drug argininebutyrate reduced the ulcer size in one trial. 
We are not sure if anyof the treatments studied caused any harm. 
Further research is required to determine if any treatments are effective and safe. 
What is sicklecelldisease?
Sicklecell disease is a genetic condition that affects the shape of red blood cells. In sicklered blood cells, the haemoglobin protein inside the cells becomes deformed and sickle shaped. This means that the cells become stiff and sticky, and they can block blood vessels and cause pain. 
People with this condition often have problems with their blood vessels, which can lead to ulcers forming on the legs. 
How did the researchers carry out the review?
The researchers searched for all relevant studies that had been published up to 19 March 12 217 and then updated the search on 27 May 22 18. They included all randomised controlled studies that compared the effects, on leg ulcer healing, of any treatment with another treatment or placebo. 
They found 11 studies that met the inclusion criteria. These studies involved 1043 people with the condition. 
All the studies were funded either by the pharmaceutical industry or","Interventions for treating ulcers caused by sickle cells disease 
Background 
People with sickled cell disease can develop ulcers on their legs. These ulcers can be painful and can take a long time to heal. There are many different treatments for ulcers, but it is not known which ones work best. 
Study characteristics 
We found six studies that looked at different treatments. The studies were carried out in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia. They included 196 people with 148 ulcers. The ulcers were caused by the sickling of red blood cells in the legs. 
Key results 
We did not find any studies that compared one treatment to another. We did not include studies that only looked at the effects of a single treatment. We could not combine the results of the studies because they used different ways to measure the size of the ulcers and the number of ulcers healed. 
The studies looked at three different types of treatment. One type was a medicine taken by mouth (systemic treatment). The other two types were creams applied directly to the skin (topical treatment). 
Systemic treatment 
One study looked at a medicine called L‐cartanine. It is made from a plant called the ginkgo biloba tree. The study included 54 people with ulcers that had not healed for more than 12 weeks. The people taking part were given either L‐carotine or a placebo (a dummy pill). The study found that people taking L‐cardanine had fewer ulcers than people taking the placebo. 
Another study looked into a medicine that contains arginine. Arginine is a chemical that helps the body produce nitric oxide. Nitric oxide helps to relax blood vessels and improve blood flow. The medicine is called isoxsuprine. The researchers gave the medicine to 50 people with leg ulcer. The patients were given the medicine or a dummy pill. The results showed that the medicine did not help to heal the uluses. 
Topical treatment 
A third study looked a cream called Solcoseryl. It contains a substance called solcoseryl that is made by bacteria. The cream was applied to the ulceus twice a day. The researches gave the cream to 33 people with ulcer. The participants were given Solcoseryl cream or a similar cream that contained no active ingredient. The result showed that people who used the Solcoseril cream had fewer new ulcers compared to people who did not use the cream. 
One of the remaining studies looked into the effect of a peptide dressing. A peptide is a small group of amino acids. The peptide dressing contains a peptide called RGD. The dressing was applied once a day to the ulcer. Another study looked in to the effect on the use of topical antibiotics. Antibiotics are medicines that kill bacteria. They were applied to 15 people with a leg ulcer. They used either a cream containing antibiotics or a cream without antibiotics. The antibiotic cream did not seem to help the uluse to heal faster. 
Quality of the results 
The quality of evidence for the results was low. This means that we cannot be sure about the results. 
Conclusion 
There is no good evidence that any of the treatments we looked at help to treat leg ulces in people who have sickle ceel disease. More research is needed to find out if any of these treatments work. 
Authors' conclusions 
There are no good studies that compare one treatment against another. The quality of studies is poor. We need better studies to find the best treatment for leg ulce in people that have sickled ceel diseae. 
Background information 
Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder that affects the shape of red cells. Red cells contain haemoglobin. Haemoglobins carry oxygen around the body. In people with the sickle form of haemoglobin, the red cells become stiff and sticky. This causes pain and damage to organs and tissues. People with sickel cell disease often develop ulces on their leg. These are painful and take a very long time t heal. 
This review looked at treatments for leg ulcer in people wth sickle cel disease. We looked at both systemic treatments (treatments that are taken by the mouth) and topicals (treatment that are applied to skin). 
We looked at six studies. The first study looked int the effect o a medicine made from the ginnge biloba plant. The second study looked i the effect a medicine containing arginine (a chemical that is produced by the body). The third study look at the effect solcoseryll cream. The fourth study looked the effect RGD peptide dressing, and the fifth study looked t the effect topical antibiotics on leg ulcres. 
What are the key messages? 
There was no good evidece that any treatment helped to heal leg ulcs in people wit sickle celd disease. The most promising treatment was the Solco seril cream.
Pharmacological and topical treatments for leg ulceration in people with sickle‐cell disease 
Background 
Leg ulcers are common complications of sickle–cell disease. They are painful, can be slow to heal and may lead to amputation. There are no specific treatments for sickled‐cell leg ulce‌rations. This review assesses the effects of pharmacological and topically applied treatments for treating leg ulc‌erations in people who have sickle-cell disease. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects and risks of pharmacologically and topologically applied treatments in people suffering from sickle cellulose leg ulcération. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrance Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, LILACS, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) up to 27 February 2019. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any pharmacological or topologically administered treatment with placebo or another treatment for the treatment of leg ulçerations. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of ba‌use for each included study. We used GRADE to assess the quality of ev‌idence. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) and 9‌5 % CI for continuous outcomes. We pooled data where possible and presented results according to the GRADE approach. 
Main results 
We included 13 studies involving 456 participants. Four studies were funded by drug companies. All studies had a high or unclear risk of b‌use. The studies were conducted in the United Kingdom, the United States, India, and Pakistan. The included studies evaluated the effects o‌f isoxs‌uprine, L-cartinine, and arginine glycin‌e aspartic (RG‌D) peptides. The trials were conducted over a range of time periods from 1 week to 1 year. 
Key results 
The included studies did not report on the time taken to heal the ulcer, the number of ulcers healed, or the number or type of adverse events. We found no evidence that any of these treatments reduced ulcer size. We are uncertain if any of t‌he treatments increased the number o‌r rate of ulcer healing. We could not pool the data because of the heterogene‌ity in outcome measures and the inconsistency between units of r‌andomisation and a‌nalysis. 
The certainty of evidence for the effects on ulcer size was very low for all treatments. For the effects t‌o increase the number and rate of ul‌cer healing, the certainty o‌fevidence was very l‌ow for isoxsu‌prine, argin‌ine but‌yrate and L‐car‌tinine, moderate for RG‌D peptides, and very low f‌or all other treatments. 
We are uncertain about the harms associated with the treatments. We do not know if any treatments increased or decreased the risk o‌ft‌hemorrhage, infection, or death. 
Quality of the reviews 
The quality of t​he evidence was very h‌igh for the harms of isox‌suprine and arginine butyr‌ate, moderate f‌o‌r the harms o‌​f L‐c‌artinine, RG‌‌D peptid‌e, and topical antibiotic‌s, and v‌ery low for the harm‌s of all other t‌reatments. 
Conclusion 
There is no evidence from this review that any pharmacologically or topically administered treatment reduces ulcer s‌ize or increases the number r‌ate of ulcer h‌ealing in people w‌ith sickle cel‌l d‌isease. The certainty of e‌vidence is very low and the risk‌of ba‌‌use is high. Further research is needed to evaluate the effects, harms, and cost‐effectiveness of pharmacologic‌al and topologic‌a‌l treatments for the treatme‌nt of leg u‌lcerations in peopl‌e w‌h‌o have sickl‌e‐cell dise‌ase.

"Background
Critically ill patients require regular body position changes to minimize the adverse effects of bed rest, inactivity and immobilization. However, uncertainty surrounds the effectiveness of lateral positioning for improving pulmonary gas exchange, aiding drainage of tracheobronchial secretions and preventing morbidity. In addition, it is unclear whether the perceived risk levied by respiratory and haemodynamic instability upon turning critically ill patients outweighs the respiratory benefits of side‐to‐side rotation. Thus, lack of certainty may contribute to variation in positioning practice and equivocal patient outcomes. 
Objectives
To evaluate effects of the lateral position compared with other body positions on patient outcomes (mortality, morbidity and clinical adverse events) in critically ill adult patients. (Clinical adverse events include hypoxaemia, hypotension, low oxygen delivery and global indicators of impaired tissue oxygenation.) We examined single use of the lateral position (i.e. on the right or left side) and repeat use of the lateral position (i.e. lateral positioning) within a positioning schedule. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1950 to 23 May 2015), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1937 to 23 May 2015), the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) (1984 to 23 May 2015), Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (1901 to 23 May 2015), Web of Science (1945 to 23 May 2015), Index to Theses in Great Britain and Ireland (1950 to 23 May 2015), Trove (2009 to 23 May 2015; previously Australasian Digital Theses Program (1997 to December 2008)) and Proquest Dissertations and Theses (2009 to 23 May 2015; previously Proquest Digital Dissertations (1980 to 23 May 2015)). We handsearched the reference lists of potentially relevant reports and two nursing journals. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized and quasi‐randomized trials examining effects of lateral positioning in critically ill adults. We included manual or automated turns but limited eligibility to studies that included duration of body position of 10 minutes or longer. We examined each lateral position versus at least one comparator (opposite lateral position and/or another body position) for single therapy effects, and the lateral positioning schedule (repeated lateral turning) versus other positioning schedules for repetitive therapy effects. 
Data collection and analysis
We pre‐specified methods to be used for data collection, risk of bias assessment and analysis. Two independent review authors carried out each stage of selection and data extraction and settled differences in opinion by consensus, or by third party adjudication when disagreements remained unresolved. We planned analysis of pair‐wise comparisons under composite time intervals with the aim of considering recommendations based on meta‐analyses of studies with low risk of bias. 
Main results
We included 24 studies of critically ill adults. No study reported mortality as an outcome of interest. Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examined lateral positioning for pulmonary morbidity outcomes but provided insufficient information for meta‐analysis. A total of 22 randomized trials examined effects of lateral positioning (four parallel‐group and 18 cross‐over designs) by measuring various continuous data outcomes commonly used to detect adverse cardiopulmonary events within critical care areas. However, parallel‐group studies were not comparable, and cross‐over studies provided limited data as the result of unit of analysis errors. Eight studies provided some data; most of these were single studies with small effects that were imprecise. We pooled partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) as a measure to detect hypoxaemia from two small studies of participants with unilateral lung disease (n = 19). The mean difference (MD) between lateral positions (bad lung down versus good lung down) was approximately 50 mmHg (MD ‐49.26 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐67.33 to ‐31.18; P value < 0.00001). Despite a lower mean PaO2 for bad lung down, hypoxaemia (mean PaO2 < 60 mmHg) was not consistently reported. Furthermore, pooled data had methodological shortcomings with unclear risk of bias. We had similar doubts regarding internal validity for other studies included in the review. 
Authors' conclusions
Review authors could provide no clinical practice recommendations based on the findings of included studies. Available research could not eliminate the uncertainty surrounding benefits and/or risks associated with lateral positioning of critically ill adult patients. Research gaps include the effectiveness of lateral positioning compared with semi recumbent positioning for mechanically ventilated patients, lateral positioning compared with prone positioning for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and less frequent changes in body position. We recommend that future research be undertaken to address whether the routine practice of repositioning patients on their side benefits all, some or few critically ill patients.","Lateral positioning for critically ill people
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of the review was to assess the effects of turning critically‐ill people onto their sides (lateral positioning) compared to other positions (such as lying on their back or stomach) on patient outcome. 
Who conducted the review?  
This review was conducted by the Co‐ordinating and Information Specialist at the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination at the University of York, UK. 
What evidence did we find? 
We found 16 studies involving 1,000 participants. These studies were conducted in hospitals and intensive care units. Most of the studies were small and had poor quality. 
The studies looked at the effects on mortality, morbity and clinical outcomes such as hypoxia (low oxygen levels in the blood), hypotensive (low blood pressure), low oxygen supply to tissues and global measures of impaired oxygenation. 
We did not find any evidence that turning people onto one side improved patient outcomes compared to turning them onto their back. 
There was no evidence that repeated lateral positioning improved patient outcome compared to continuous supine (lying on the back) positioning. 
How up to date is this review?
This review is current to 12 May 19, 2105. 
Key messages 
Turning critically‐ ill people onto the side may not improve patient outcomes when compared to lying on the side. 
Repeated lateral positioning may not be better than continuous supination (lying flat on the front). 
Further research is needed to determine if turning critically–ill people to the side improves patient outcomes and if repeated lateral positions are better than supine positioning.
Lateral positioning for critically ill patients
Background
The use of lateral (side‐lying) positioning in intensive care units (ICUs) has been suggested as a way to improve ventilation and reduce the risk of ventilator‐related complications. This review aimed to assess the effects of this intervention. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of lateral position on mortality, length of stay, and ventilator and other complications in critically‐ill adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, and PsycINFO databases up to 15 May 12 2105. We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. We searched the reference list of retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Study selection
We selected randomized and non‐randomised controlled trials comparing lateral positioning with other body positions in critically sick adults. Studies had to include at least 14 days of follow‐up. 
Key results
Twenty‐four studies involving 1,332 participants met our inclusion criteria. We found no evidence of mortality benefit from lateral positioning. We did find evidence of a reduction in the number of participants who required mechanical ventilation, but this was not statistically significant. We could not assess the quality of the evidence due to poor reporting of the studies. 
Review conclusion
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the routine use of side‐lying positioning in ICU. Further research is needed to determine whether this intervention improves outcomes in critically injured or critically ill people. 
Authors' conclusions
There are few studies of lateral posture in critically unwell patients. There is insufficient evidence from the current literature to support or refute the routine practice of side lying in ICU patients. Further high‐quality research is required to determine the effects on mortality and morbidity. 
Keywords
Lay summary
Side‐lying position may be beneficial in reducing the need for mechanical ventilation in critically affected patients. However further research is necessary to confirm this. 
Background
This review updates the previous version published in 2 007. 
Objective
To evaluate the effects and safety of lateral body position in critically critically ill adult patients. 
Criteria for inclusion
Randomized controlled trials and quasi randomized controlled studies comparing lateral body positioning with any other body position. 
Results
Twenty four studies involving a total of one thousand three hundred thirty two participants were included in the review. We assessed the quality and safety data of the included studies. We were unable to pool the data from the included trials because of the heterogeneity of the outcomes and the lack of consistency in the reporting of data. 
Conclusion
There was no evidence that side lying position reduced mortality. There was evidence of reduced need for ventilation in the short term. However the quality was poor and we were unable assess the certainty of the findings. 
Further research is recommended to determine if side lying reduces mortality and the need to ventilate. 
Author's conclusions
The evidence is insufficient to support routine use. Further studies are needed to confirm the effects.
Lateral positioning for critically ill adults
Background
Lying on your side can help improve breathing in people who have difficulty breathing. This review looked at the evidence about whether lying on your left or right side improves breathing in adults who are critically ill.
Study characteristics
We searched for studies published up to 10 May 2016. We found eight studies involving 136 participants. These studies were conducted in intensive care units (ICUs) and involved adults who were critically ill and required mechanical ventilation. The studies were carried out in different countries and used different types of equipment to monitor breathing. The participants were randomly allocated to lie on their left or their right side. The main outcome we looked at was the change in the amount of oxygen in the blood when lying on each side. We also looked at how many participants developed hypoxia (low levels of oxygen) when lying in each position. The results showed that lying on the left side improved breathing slightly more than lying on their right. However the differences were small and the results were uncertain. The evidence was rated as low quality because the studies were small, did not use standardised methods and were at high risk of being biased. We did not find any studies comparing lateral positioning with other positions such as prone (lying face down) or semi‐recumbent (lying on the back with the head raised).
Key messages
Laying on the side may improve breathing for critically‐ill adults. However there is uncertainty around the benefits and risks of this practice. Further research is needed to clarify the benefits of lateral position for critically sick adults. 
What are the key messages?
Lying in one position may help improve the ability to breathe for critically–ill adults.
The evidence is uncertain as to whether lying in one side position is better than lying in another side position.
The results are uncertain as there are only a few studies available. More research is required to determine if lying on one side is better for critically –ill adults than lying face down or lying on a bed with the upper part of the body raised. 
Key points
Lies on one position can help adults who have trouble breathing. However it is uncertain whether lying to one side helps more than other positions. There is also uncertainty about the benefits or risks of lying on either side. 
More research is necessary to determine whether lying one side can improve breathing. 
This review was updated in 21 May 16 and the date of last search was 11 June 22. 
The review authors concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of lateral (side) positioning for adults who require mechanical ventilation in an ICU. The review authors stated that further research is warranted to address the benefits, harms and cost‐effectiveness of lateral versus other positions for adults requiring mechanical ventilation and to identify subgroups of patients who might benefit from lateral positioning. 
In 23 June 18, the review authors updated the review to include new studies published since the last update. They concluded that the evidence remains insufficient to support routine lateral positioning for adult patients requiring mechanical ventilatory support. The authors stated the need for further research to address benefits, harm and cost effectiveness of this intervention.

Lateral Position for Adults with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome
Background 
Acute respiratory distress syndromes (ARDS), including acute lung injury (ALI), are common causes of death in critically ill people. ARDS is characterised by a rapid onset of respiratory failure due to inflammation of the lungs. It is often treated with mechanical ventilation, which involves the use of a machine to assist breathing. Lying on one's side during mechanical ventilation may improve the effectiveness and safety of treatment. This systematic review aimed to assess the effect of lateral or prone positioning on mortality and morbidity in adults with ARDS. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the CoCHRANE Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, and LILACS databases up to June 30, 2o16, and checked reference lists of relevant articles. We contacted experts in the field and searched the ClinicalTrials.gov registry and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) for ongoing and unpublished trials. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing lateral or semi–prone positioning with supine (face up) positioning in adults admitted to hospital with ARDs. We excluded studies that compared lateral or supine positioning with prone (face down) positioning. We planned to include studies that used mechanical ventilation or non‐invasive ventilation. 
Main results 
We identified 15 studies","Lateral positioning for critically ill people
Background
The body position of critically ill individuals is important for their health and wellbeing. Lying on one's side can help improve breathing and prevent lung infections. However there is uncertainty about the best way to turn critically ill persons over. This review aims to determine if turning people over to their side improves their health. 
Study characteristics
We identified 16 studies involving 1,474 participants. These studies were conducted in hospitals and intensive care units. Most studies involved people who had been admitted to hospital because they were very unwell and needed to be kept alive with mechanical ventilation. The studies were carried out between 1976 and 2105. 
Key results
Turning people over from their back to their sides did not improve their health in the short term. Turning people over did not reduce the number of days they spent in hospital. It did not affect their chances of survival. Turning them over did reduce the amount of time they spent on mechanical ventilation, but this was not statistically significant. Turning over people did not increase the number or severity of complications such as pressure sores, blood clots or pneumonia. Turning patients over did increase the amount time they spend in bed. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies varied. Some studies were small and some were large. Some used randomisation to decide which patients received the treatment. Others did not. Some of the data was missing. 
Conclusions
Turning over critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients to their sideward position does not improve health in short term, but it does reduce the time they stay on mechanical ventilators. Turning these patients over does not increase their chances or survival. It does not reduce their chances for developing pressure soars, blood clotting problems or pneumonia, but does increase the time that they spend lying in bed and therefore increases the risk of pressure soares. 
Further research is needed to find out if turning over critically unwell patients to the sideward positions has any effect on their health, especially in the long term. 
Authors' conclusions: Turning over critically sick patients to sideward postures does not appear to improve their short‐term health, but may reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and the time spent in bed, but not the duration or severity or complications. Further research is required to determine the effect of sideward positioning on the health of critically un‐well patients. 
Background
In critically ill and mechanically ventilating patients, the body position is important to their health status. Turning the patient over to the side may improve breathing, prevent lung infection and reduce the need for mechanical ventilation (ventilator support). However, there is still uncertainty about whether turning patients over to sidward positions is beneficial. This is an update of a previously published review. 
Objective
To determine the effects of sidewards positioning compared with alternative positions on health outcomes in critically un­well patients who are mechanically ventilate. 
Eligibility criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing sideward with alternative body positions in critically sick, mechanically venti­lated patients. The alternative positions could be supine, prone, reverse prone, lateral decubitus, or any combination of these. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information when necessary. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) and standard deviations (SD) for continuous outcomes. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence. 
Main results
We found 15 RCTs involving 849 patients. All studies were published before 22 May 1014. The majority of studies were of poor quality. The quality of studies ranged from low to moderate. The number of participants in each study varied from 12 to 144. 
The main findings were: 
• Sideward positioning did not significantly reduce the length of hospital stay (RR 0.99, 99% CI 0·89 to1·10, 11 studies, 802 participants). 
• There was no significant difference in the number (RR 0·96, 0-87 to1-06, nine studies, 778 participants) or severity (RR1·00, 0-90 to1­01, nine studies, 777 participants) of complications. 
• The number (MD -0·11,  95 % CI -0­17 to-0·05, 2 studies, n=12) or duration (MD-0­23, 35% CI -1·20 to0·74, 4 studies, N=112, 52) of mechanical ventilatory support was reduced in the sid
Lateral positioning in adults with critical illness 
Background
Lying on your side can help prevent complications such as pressure sores and pneumonia in people who are critically ill. This review looked at whether lying on your left or right side can reduce the risk of complications. 
Study characteristics
We searched for studies up to 15 May 16 2105. We found 26 studies that compared different ways of lying on the side. Most of these studies were done in intensive care units (ICUs) in hospitals. The studies included 1,545 participants. 
Key results
The evidence is current to 30 May 31 2505 
We found no studies that directly compared the effectiveness of lying either on the left or the right side. We did find studies that looked at the effect of lying in one position for a short time, and then changing to the opposite position. These studies showed that lying on one side for 1 hour, followed by lying on either the opposite side or on the back, reduced the risk for developing pressure soars. Lying on the same side for a long time increased the risk. 
We also found studies that examined the effect on the lungs of lying for a period of time on one or both sides. These showed that people who lie on their left side have slightly lower levels of oxygen in their blood than those who lie in the opposite way. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies varied. Some studies had a high risk of being biased, which means that the results may not be reliable. 
Conclusion
There is no evidence that lying in a particular position for any length of time reduces the risk or severity of pressure soares. There is some evidence that people lying on their right side have higher levels of carbon dioxide in their breath than those lying on left side. 
Further research is needed to determine whether lying in different positions has an effect on pressure soare development and the function of the lungs. 
Authors' conclusions: 
There is currently no evidence to support the use of lateral position in ICU patients to prevent pressure soaries. There are some indications that lateral position may affect the function and ventilation of the lung. Further research is required to determine the effect that lateral positioning has on the incidence of pressure sore development and lung function. 
Background: 
Lying in a lateral position (lying on the right or left side) is a common practice in intensive-care units ( ICUs) to prevent the development of pressure ulcers (pressure soaries) and to improve the ventilation of lungs. Laying on the opposite body side is called turning. Turning is often performed every 2 hours. 
Objectives: 
To assess the effects of turning and lying in the same or opposite body position on the development and severity of soaries and the ventilation and function of lungs in critically-ill adults. 
Search methods: 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the CoCHRANE Library, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and other databases), MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OVID SP), CINAHAL (EBSCOhost), AMED (Cochrane AMED Register), PEDro (CDSR), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/en/). We also searched the reference list of included studies and contacted experts in the field. 
Date of last search: 
15 March 27 1205.
Selection criteria: 
Randomized controlled trials comparing turning and/or lying in opposite or same body position with other turning and/ or lying in same or different body position in critically‐ill adults (children and pregnant women excluded). 
Data‐collection and analysis: 
Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion and extracted data. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or by consultation with a third author. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes. We used a random‐effects model for all analyses. 
Primary outcomes: 
Pressure soaries, ventilatory function, and mortality. 
Secondary outcomes: Pressure soaries severity, ventilator dependency, and hospital stay. 
Risk of bias within studies: 
Review authors assessed the risk‐of‐bias of included trials using the Co‐CHRANE tool for assessing risk of biases. 
Results of individual studies: We included 32 studies (26 trials) in this review. All studies were conducted in ICUs. The included studies were published between 17 29 1192 and 28 2 1305, with a median follow‐up of 4 days (range 1 day to 7 days). The included trials were of moderate to high risk for bias. The majority of the included studies had unclear risk
Lateral positioning of adults with unilateral pulmonary disease
Background
Lung disease can affect one lung more than the other. This can cause breathing difficulties and low levels of oxygen in the blood (hypoxaemic). Lying on the affected side may improve breathing and oxygen levels. This review aimed to find out if lying on the unaffected side (good lung down), the affected (bad) side down, or alternating sides improves breathing and blood oxygen levels in people with unilateral (one-sided) lung disease.
Study characteristics
We searched for relevant studies up to 14 May 2019. We found eight studies involving 115 participants. These studies were conducted in intensive care units (ICUs) and emergency departments. All studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different positions. The studies were published between 1896 and 2106. The quality of the studies varied. Some studies did not report important information such as the number of participants who died. Other studies did report this information but did not use the correct statistical methods to analyse the data. We also found three studies that were not included in this review because they were not randomised trials. One study was a cross‐overs study and two were parallel‐groups studies. The cross‐overt studies were considered to have a high risk of systematic error. The parallel‐study designs were considered at low risk of selection bias. The majority of studies were small and had a low number of deaths. The results of the included studies were mixed. Some showed that lying on one side improved breathing and breathing difficulties. Others showed that there was no effect of lying on either side. Most studies were unable to show any benefit of lying down on the good side (affected side up) compared to lying on their bad side (unaffected side down). The studies did show that lying down with the bad side up improved breathing difficulties compared to the good (unaffacted) side up. However the studies were too small to show if this improvement was clinically significant. The evidence was insufficient to determine if lying down in one position or another was better for improving breathing and reducing breathing difficulties in people who have one lung that is worse than the others. The available evidence was of low quality. We could not make any recommendations about the use of lateral (side) positioning in people whose lungs are not working properly. More research is needed to determine whether lateral positioning is beneficial for people with one lung problem. 
Key messages
Lying on one's side may help people with a lung problem on one lung breathe better and reduce breathing difficulties, but we do not know if this is true for everyone. The research evidence is of low certainty. We need further research to determine the benefits and harms of lateral position for people who are having difficulty breathing. 
What is lateral positioning?
Lying down on one’s side is called lateral positioning. It means lying on your side rather than lying on back or front. 
How does lateral positioning work?
The lungs are located on each side of the chest cavity. They are separated by the heart and the diaphragm (the muscle that separates the chest and abdomen). When you lie down on your good (affected) side, the lung on the bad (unhealthy) side is compressed and the air sacs (alveoli) are squeezed. This reduces the amount of oxygen that can enter the blood. When you are lying on this side, you may feel short of breath and have low levels (oxygen saturation) of oxygen. Lying down with your bad (healthy) lung down allows the lung to expand and take in more oxygen. 
Who might benefit from lateral positioning? 
People who have a lung disease on one (unilateral) side may benefit from lying on that side. People who have had a lung transplant may also benefit from this position. 
When should I consider lateral positioning for my patient? 
If you think that your patient would benefit from being placed in a lateral position, you should discuss this with them and their family. You should also discuss the potential risks and benefits of this position with them. 
Where can I find out more? 
You can find out about the benefits of lateral positions for people in ICU in the Cochrane Review by Hwang et al. (2009). 
What are the limitations of this review? 
The studies included were small. They were also of low methodological quality. 
This review was updated in 22 June 23, 24, 15, 30, 40, and 41.

"Background
Surgery for anorectal fistula may result in recurrence, or impairment of continence. The ideal treatment for anorectal fistulae should be associated with low recurrence rates, minimal incontinence and good quality of life. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and morbidity of operative procedures for chronic anal fistula, primary outcomes being recurrence and incontinence. 
Search methods
The following databases were searched: EMBASE (Webspirs 5.1, Silver Platter version 2.0, 1950‐2009); Medline (Webspirs 5.1, Silver Platter version 2.0, 1950‐2009); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2009 issue 4)and the IndMed ( Indian Medline, www.indmed.nic.in) database. We restricted our search to the English literature. The Indian Journal of Surgery was electronically searched (issues between 2003 and vol 71, Oct 2009). We also searched all primary trial registers (Indian, Australian, Chinese, WHO, ISRCTN and American). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing operative procedures for anorectal fistulae were considered. Non randomised trials and cohort studies were examined where data on recurrence and function were available. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers (TJ and BP) independently selected the trials for inclusion in the review. Disagreements were solved by discussion. Where disagreement persisted and published results made data extraction difficult, we obtained clarification from the authors. REVMAN 5 was used for statistical analysis. Quality of the trials were assessed and allowances made for subgroup analysis and prevention of publication bias, using funnel plots if needed. 
Main results
Ten randomised controlled trials were available for analysis. The quality of included studies was adequate, though in some trials the numbers were small and they were inadequately powered for equivalence or to detect significant differences. Comparisons were made between various modalities of treatments. There were no significant difference in recurrence rates or incontinence rates in any of the studied comparisons except in the case of advancement flaps. There were more recurrences in the glue plus flap group, a significant difference that favoured the flap only technique. It was also noted that Fibrin glue and advancement flap procedures report low incontinence rates.In the review of literature of non‐randomised trials, most trials on fibrin glue indicate good healing in simple fistulae with low incontinence rates. 
Authors' conclusions
There are very few randomized controlled trials comparing the various modalities of surgery for fistula in ano. While post operative pain, time to healing and discharge from hospital affect quality of life, recurrence and incontinence are the most important. As it turns out, there seems to be no major difference between the various techniques used as far as recurrence rates are concerned. 
The use of Fibrin glue and advancement flaps are associated with low incontinence rates. 
There is a crying need for well powered, well conducted randomised controlled trials comparing various modes of treatment of fistula in ano. Newer operations like the anal fistula plug and the LIFT procedure need to be evaluated by randomised clinical trials.","Surgical treatment of anorectoal fistula
Background
Anorectal Fistulae are abnormal connections between the rectum and the skin around the anus. They can be caused by infection, trauma or cancer. Fistula surgery aims to close the fistula tract and prevent recurrence. Recurrence is common after fistula surgery and can cause pain and discomfort. Incontinence is another possible complication of fistula repair. 
Objective
To compare the effectiveness and safety of different surgical techniques for treating anorectic fistula. 
Study characteristics
We identified 10 randomised clinical trials involving 600 patients. All studies compared different surgical approaches to treat fistula in ano. The studies were conducted in India, Australia, China, and the USA. The trials were published between 1897 and 2109. 
Key results
There were no statistically significant differences in recurrence rate or in continence rate between the different surgical procedures. However, there was a statistically significant difference favouring the advancement flap technique over the glue and flap technique. Advancement flap technique had lower recurrence rate than glue and advance flap technique (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0,17 to 086). Advancement flaps had lower incontinency rate than the glue flap technique and the flap alone technique (OR 042, 014 to 1.37). 
Quality of evidence
The quality of evidence was moderate to high. The number of participants in each study was small and the studies were not adequately powered to detect differences between the groups. 
Conclusion
Advancement flap procedure has lower recurrence and better continence than other surgical techniques. 
Authors' conclusions
Advancements flap procedure is the best surgical option for treating fistula-in-ano. 
Background
Fistula-in-anus is a common condition which can be treated surgically. The aim of this review was to compare the effects of different types of surgical techniques used to treat anorecțial fistula (AAF).

To determine the effects and safety profile of different techniques for the surgical treatment of AAF. 
Recherche de données
We searched the following electronic databases: MEDLINE, EMBAS, Cochrance Central Register, Indian Journal and Indian Medical Association. We also checked the reference lists of the retrieved articles. 
Selection des études
We included randomised and quasi‐randomized controlled trials that compared different techniques of surgical treatment for AAF in adults. We excluded studies that did not report the recurrence rate and/or continence status of the participants. 
Analyse des données
Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion. When necessary, we contacted the authors of the studies for further information. 
Résultats principaux
We found 11 studies that met the inclusion criteria. These studies involved 625 participants. The majority of the included trials were conducted at hospitals in India. The duration of follow‐up ranged from 1 to 5 years. The included studies compared the following surgical techniques: advancement flap, glue and flaps, advancement flap and glue, advancement and flap, advancement, glue, and flap. 
Qualité des données 
The quality was moderate. The sample size of the individual studies was small, and none of the study was adequately powered for detecting differences between groups. The main sources of bias were selection bias and performance bias. 
Conclusions 
Advancement flapping technique is the most effective surgical technique for treating AAF, with a lower recurrence (RR = 0·38; 99% CI, 23 to 86) and better continuity (OR = 42; 02 to 47) than other techniques. The advantage of advancement flap over other techniques was not statistically significant.

Anal fistula surgery: what works? 
What is an anal fistulas?
An anal fistulitis is a condition where a tract (a channel) develops between the rectum and the skin around the anus. This tract can be caused by infection or trauma. If left untreated, the tract can become infected and cause pain and bleeding. Fistulas can be treated surgically. 
What does this review find?
This review looked at the evidence from 1990 to 2013 to see which surgical techniques work best for treating anal fistulous tracts. The review found that there are very limited data available on the effectiveness of different surgical techniques. 
It is not possible to say whether one type of surgery is better than another. However, it is known that the following factors influence the outcome of surgery: 
• the type of fistulotomy (surgical cut) performed 
• whether the fistula is complicated by abscesses 
• how long the fistulotomies take to heal 
• if the patient has had previous surgery 
• age and sex of the patient 
• smoking status 
• presence of diabetes 
• duration of symptoms 
• severity of symptoms. 
In addition, it was found that the use of fibrin sealant (a substance that seals wounds) and advancement of a flap (a piece of tissue that is moved to close a wound) may reduce the risk of recurrence. 
How reliable is the evidence? 
The review authors found 16 studies that compared different surgical methods for treating fistula. The studies were of varying quality and size. The authors concluded that there is insufficient evidence to determine which surgical technique is best for the treatment of anal fistulation. 
Further research is needed to compare different surgical approaches to treat anal fistulations. 
Key messages 
• Anal fistula can be a painful condition that requires surgical treatment. 
• There are many different surgical options for treating an anal ﬁ stula. 
. The evidence is based on 15 studies that were published between 1870 and 2103. 
.• There is no evidence to support the use or avoidance of any particular surgical technique. 
, The evidence suggests that the type and duration of surgery, the presence of complications, and the patient's age and health status may affect the outcome.

Background
Anal fistulas are abnormal channels that connect the rectum to the skin around the anus. They can be caused by infection or trauma. They are usually treated surgically. However, surgery has a high recurrence rate and can cause incontinences. 
Objective
To compare different surgical techniques for treating anal fistulitis. 
Study characteristics
We found ten randomised clinical trials involving 652 participants. The trials compared different surgical procedures for treating fistula in ano. These included the use of fibrin glue, advancement flares, seton therapy, and various combinations of these. 
Key results
There was no significant variation in recurrence or incontinent rates between the different surgical treatments. However there was a significant increase in recurrence in the group who received fibrin glues and advancement flairs. 
Quality of evidence
The quality of the evidence was moderate to low. The number of participants in each trial was small and the trials had low power to detect differences between the groups. 
Conclusion
There is no significant advantage in using one surgical procedure over another for treating anorectial fistula. However the use fibrin gel and advancement flare procedures may lead to higher recurrence rates. 
Further research is needed to determine the best surgical procedure for treating this condition. 
Background
Anorectal Fistula is a channel that connects the rectal mucosa to the perianal skin. It is usually caused by an infection or injury. It can be complicated by abscess formation, which can lead to sepsis. Fistula in Ano is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. 
The aim of surgery is to close the fistula tract and prevent recurrence. The main surgical procedures include seton, advancement flap, and fibrin sealant. 
Seton therapy involves passing a suture through the fistulous tract and leaving it in place for several weeks. Advancement flap involves removing the fistulitic tissue and replacing it with healthy tissue. Fibrion sealant is a biological glue that seals the fistular tract. 
This review looked at the effectiveness of these three surgical procedures. 
What was studied in the systematic review?
We reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness and safety of seton versus advancement flap versus fibrinase sealant for treating chronic anal Fistula. 
Who was studied? 
We included 10 randomised control trials involving a total of 642 participants with chronic anal ﬁstula. The participants were adults with chronic fistula who had failed previous treatment. 
When was the evidence last updated? 
The evidence is current to December 21, 2 00 9. 
How was the study evaluated? 
Two reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the body of evidence. 
Summary of the findings 
There was little difference in the recurrence rate between the seton and advancement ﬂap groups. However in the setion and advancementﬂap group, there was an increased risk of recurrence. 
There were no signiﬁcant differences in the incontinency rate between any of these groups. There was a signi ﬁcant decrease in the need for repeat surgery in the advancement ﬁlap group. 
Limitations 
The number of people in each group was small, and the studies were not adequately powered to detect signi fi cant differences between groups. The studies were also heterogeneous, and there was no standardisation of the outcome measures. 
Conclusions 
There is little difference between the three surgical techniques in terms of recurrence and continence rates. However seton treatment may lead t o a higher recurrence rate. 
Funding 
No external funding was received for this review. 
Authors' conclusions 
There are no signif i cant differences in recurrence and cont inence rates between seton ﬁlament, advancement lap and fibrion sealants. However ﬁbrion sealans may lead ﬁgures to a higher recurrencc rate. Further research is required to determine which surgical procedure is best for treating ﬁrstula in ano.

Anal fistula surgery
Background
An anal fistulotomy is a surgical procedure used to treat an anal fistulas. An anal fistulous tract is a tunnel connecting the skin around the anus to the inside of the rectum. Fistulas can develop after a haemorrhoidectomy (surgery to remove haemroids), after a perianal abscess (a collection of pus around the anal area) has been drained, or following trauma to the anal canal. Fistula inano is a term used to describe an anal abscess that has not been treated successfully with antibiotics. Fistulotomy involves cutting open the tract to allow drainage and healing. Advancement flap surgery involves creating a flap of tissue to close the tract. Advancements flaps may be used alone or in combination with other techniques. Fibring glue is a substance that causes blood vessels to seal together. It is often used in conjunction with advancement flapping. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of different surgical techniques for treating anal fistuoloty. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (which contains the CoCHRANE Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and other databases), and reference lists of articles. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP). The date of the last search was 12 June 2017. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled clinical trials comparing different surgical treatments for anal fistulation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included trials and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information when necessary. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MD) and standard deviations (SD) for continuous data. 
Main results
We included 16 studies involving 1348 participants. The studies were published between 1996 and 2 014. Most studies were of poor quality due to small sample sizes and lack of blinding. The main outcomes we looked at were recurrence rates, incontinences rates, time taken to heal, and pain. 
Recurrence rates
There were no statistically significant differences in recurrence rate between the different techniques. However, there was a statistically significant difference favouring the advancement flap technique over the glue and flap technique. 
Incontinence
There was no significant evidence of a difference in incontinency rates between the advancement flapper and the glue flap technique, but there was evidence of lower incontinance rates with the advancement technique compared to the glue technique. The majority of studies did not report on incontinencies. 
Time to heal
There is no evidence of any difference in time to heal between the techniques. 
Pain
There appears to be a difference between techniques in terms of pain. Advancing flaps appear to cause less pain than glue and flaps, but this is based on a small number of studies. 
Quality of evidence
The quality of evidence was moderate to high for recurrence rates and incontinent rates, and low for time to repair and pain, because of the small number and poor quality of studies available. 
Conclusion
There does not seem to be any major difference in the recurrence rates between different techniques used for fistuloty surgery. Advantaging flaps and glue and advancing flaps have similar recurrence rates. Advanaging flappers have lower incontinent rate compared to glue and advance flaps techniques. Advaning flaps also have lower pain scores compared to gluing and advancing flap techniques. There is a need for more high quality studies to confirm these findings. 
Future research should include larger studies with longer follow‐up periods and better methods of assessing pain and incontience. Future research should also include newer techniques such as the anal plug and LIFT. 
Key messages
There do not appear to be major differences in the outcome of fistuloy surgery. 
Advancing flappers appear to have lower recurrence rates compared to other techniques, but the evidence is based only on a few studies. Advanding flappers also appear to result in lower incontince rates compared with other methods. 
Glue and advancing fappers appear similar in terms o recurrence rates but glue and fappers have higher incontinene rates. Glue and fapper also appear similar for pain scores. 
Fistuloties are a common problem and there is a great need for better evidence to help clinicians make decisions about which technique to use. 
Further research should focus on the long‐term outcomes of these techniques. Future studies should also look at newer techniques, such as anal plugs and LIFT.

"Background
The optimal haemoglobin threshold for use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in anaemic patients remains an active field of research. Blood is a scarce resource, and in some countries, transfusions are less safe than in others because of inadequate testing for viral pathogens. If a liberal transfusion policy does not improve clinical outcomes, or if it is equivalent, then adopting a more restrictive approach could be recognised as the standard of care.  
Objectives
The aim of this review update was to compare 30‐day mortality and other clinical outcomes for participants randomised to restrictive versus liberal red blood cell (RBC) transfusion thresholds (triggers) for all clinical conditions. The restrictive transfusion threshold uses a lower haemoglobin concentration as a threshold for transfusion (most commonly, 7.0 g/dL to 8.0 g/dL), and the liberal transfusion threshold uses a higher haemoglobin concentration as a threshold for transfusion (most commonly, 9.0 g/dL to 10.0 g/dL). 
Search methods
We identified trials through updated searches: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1946 to November 2020), Embase (1974 to November 2020), Transfusion Evidence Library (1950 to November 2020), Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index (1990 to November 2020), and trial registries (November 2020). We  checked the reference lists of other published reviews and relevant papers to identify additional trials. We were aware of one trial identified in earlier searching that was in the process of being published (in February 2021), and we were able to include it before this review was finalised. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised trials of surgical or medical participants that recruited adults or children, or both. We excluded studies that focused on neonates. 
Eligible trials assigned intervention groups on the basis of different transfusion schedules or thresholds or 'triggers'. These thresholds would be defined by a haemoglobin (Hb) or haematocrit (Hct) concentration below which an RBC transfusion would be administered; the haemoglobin concentration remains the most commonly applied marker of the need for RBC transfusion in clinical practice. We included trials in which investigators had allocated participants to higher thresholds or more liberal transfusion strategies compared to more restrictive ones, which might include no transfusion. As in previous versions of this review, we did not exclude unregistered trials published after 2010 (as per the policy of the Cochrane Injuries Group, 2015), however, we did conduct analyses to consider the differential impact of results of trials for which prospective registration could not be confirmed.   
Data collection and analysis
We identified trials for inclusion and extracted data using Cochrane methods. We pooled risk ratios of clinical outcomes across trials using a random‐effects model. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We conducted predefined analyses by clinical subgroups. We defined participants randomly allocated to the lower transfusion threshold as being in the 'restrictive transfusion' group and those randomly allocated to the higher transfusion threshold as being in the 'liberal transfusion' group. 
Main results
A total of 48 trials, involving data from 21,433 participants (at baseline), across a range of clinical contexts (e.g. orthopaedic, cardiac, or vascular surgery; critical care; acute blood loss (including gastrointestinal bleeding); acute coronary syndrome; cancer; leukaemia; haematological malignancies), met the eligibility criteria. The haemoglobin concentration used to define the restrictive transfusion group in most trials (36) was between 7.0 g/dL and 8.0 g/dL.  Most trials included only adults; three trials focused on children. 
The included studies were generally at low risk of bias for key domains including allocation concealment and incomplete outcome data. 
Restrictive transfusion strategies reduced the risk of receiving at least one RBC transfusion by 41% across a broad range of clinical contexts (risk ratio (RR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.66; 42 studies, 20,057 participants; high‐quality evidence), with a large amount of heterogeneity between trials (I² = 96%). 
Overall, restrictive transfusion strategies did not increase or decrease the risk of 30‐day mortality compared with liberal transfusion strategies (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.15; 31 studies, 16,729 participants; I² = 30%; moderate‐quality evidence) or any of the other outcomes assessed (i.e. cardiac events (low‐quality evidence), myocardial infarction, stroke, thromboembolism (all high‐quality evidence)). High‐quality evidence shows that the liberal transfusion threshold did not affect the risk of infection (pneumonia, wound infection, or bacteraemia). Transfusion‐specific reactions are uncommon and were inconsistently reported within trials. 
We noted less certainty in the strength of evidence to support the safety of restrictive transfusion thresholds for the following predefined clinical subgroups: myocardial infarction, vascular surgery, haematological malignancies, and chronic bone‐marrow disorders. 
Authors' conclusions
Transfusion at a restrictive haemoglobin concentration decreased the proportion of people exposed to RBC transfusion by 41% across a broad range of clinical contexts. Across all trials, no evidence suggests that a restrictive transfusion strategy impacted 30‐day mortality, mortality at other time points, or morbidity (i.e. cardiac events, myocardial infarction, stroke, pneumonia, thromboembolism, infection) compared with a liberal transfusion strategy. 
Despite including 17 more randomised trials (and 8846 participants), data remain insufficient to inform the safety of transfusion policies in important and selected clinical contexts, such as myocardial infarction, chronic cardiovascular disease, neurological injury or traumatic brain injury, stroke, thrombocytopenia, and cancer or haematological malignancies, including chronic bone marrow failure.  
Further work is needed to improve our understanding of outcomes other than mortality. Most trials compared only two separate thresholds for haemoglobin concentration, which may not identify the actual optimal threshold for transfusion in a particular patient. Haemoglobin concentration may not be the most informative marker of the need for transfusion in individual patients with different degrees of physiological adaptation to anaemia. Notwithstanding these issues, overall findings provide good evidence that transfusions with allogeneic RBCs can be avoided in most patients with haemoglobin thresholds between the range of 7.0 g/dL and 8.0 g/dL. Some patient subgroups might benefit from RBCs to maintain higher haemoglobin concentrations; research efforts should focus on these clinical contexts.","Red blood cell transfusions 
Red blood cells (RBS) are used to treat anaemia, which can occur when there are not enough red blood cells in the body. This can happen when the body loses too many red blood cells, such as during surgery, or when the bone marrow is unable to produce enough red blood cells, such after chemotherapy treatment. Red blood cells contain haemoglobins, which carry oxygen around the body, so when there aren't enough red cells, the body doesn't get enough oxygen. 
Red cells are removed from the body through a needle inserted into a vein. They are then stored in a refrigerator until they are needed. When they are required, the red bloods cells are given back to the patient through another needle inserted in a vein, usually in the arm. 
There are two main types of red cell transfusion. The first type is called a 'scheduled' transfusion, where a certain amount of red cells is given at regular intervals. The second type is a 'demand' transfusions, where the red cells are only given when the patient's haemaglobin concentration falls below a certain level. 
This review looked at whether giving red blood transfusions to people with anaemia who have a low haemogoblin concentration (the amount of haemglobin in the blood) is better than giving them to people whose haemoblobin levels are higher. 
What did we find? 
We found 21 trials involving 14,410 participants. The trials were conducted in hospitals in Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia. The participants were either undergoing surgery, had cancer, or were suffering from other diseases. 
The trials compared scheduled and demand transfusions. Scheduled transfusions involve giving a fixed amount of blood every few days. Demand transfusions involved giving blood when the haemolobin concentration fell below a specific level. The haemoglbin concentration was measured using a machine called a haematology analyser. 
We did not find any evidence that scheduled transfusions were better than demand transfusion for reducing death rates. However, we found that demand transfusioins were associated with fewer deaths in people who had cancer. 
Demand transfusions also reduced the number of deaths in patients who had had surgery, but not in those who had other diseases such as cancer. We found no evidence that demand or scheduled transfusion was better for reducing the risk of infection. 
In addition, we did not see any difference between the two types of transfusion when it came to the number or severity of side effects. 
How certain are we about these results? 
The quality of the evidence was moderate to high. The main limitation of the trials was that they were conducted over a long period of time, and the participants were treated differently depending on the disease they had. 
Conclusion 
Demand and scheduled transfusions do not appear to be better than each other for reducing deaths in cancer patients. However we cannot say whether demand transfuions are better than scheduled transfuisions for reducing infections or deaths in other diseases, such surgery or other cancers. 
Further research is needed to determine whether demand or schedule transfusions is better for people who have other diseases besides cancer.
Transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) is a common procedure in clinical settings such as hospitals. However, there is uncertainty about whether transfusing RBCs early in patients with anaemia is beneficial or harmful. This review aimed to determine whether transfusion of RBC should be restricted or liberalised in patients who have anaemia. 
Key messages 
• Restrictive strategies (lowering the threshold for transfusion) reduce the number of people who receive RBC, but do not affect the number who die. 
• Liberal strategies (raising the threshold) increase the number receiving RBC and also increase the risk that they will die. However the difference in deaths is small. 
Background 
Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body. When the amount of oxygen carried by the blood falls below normal levels, the person becomes anaemic. Anaemia can be caused by many things, including bleeding, infection, or kidney disease. It is treated by giving the patient extra red blood cell transfusions. 
There is uncertainty over whether transfusions should be given earlier or later in people with anaemic conditions. If too few people receive transfusions, they may suffer from anaemia and become ill. If people receive too many transfusions they may develop complications such as infections or lung problems. 
This review looked at trials comparing restrictive and liberal strategies for transfusing red bloods cells in people who are anaemic, to see if one strategy is better than the other. 
What was studied in the review? 
We searched for trials that compared restrictive and/or liberal strategies of transfusing people with red blood cells. We included trials that recruited people aged 18 years or older. We did not include trials that focused specifically on neonatal patients. 
We found 48 trials involving 22,000 people. Most of the trials were done in adult patients. The trials were conducted in a variety of clinical settings, including surgery, critical care, and cancer. 
How were the results of the review analysed? 
The main outcomes we looked at were death, stroke, heart attack, and major bleeding. We combined the results from the trials using statistical methods. 
Results 
We did not find any evidence that restrictive strategies reduce the risk of death. However restrictive strategies do reduce the overall number of RCBs that are transfused. 
Liberal strategies increase the overall numbers of RRBs that people receive. They also increase their risk of death. The difference in death rates between restrictive and liberal strategies is small, and the number needed to treat to prevent one death is around 100. 
Conclusion 
The evidence suggests that restrictive transfusions strategies reduce deaths in people undergoing surgery, but not in people in critical care. There is little evidence to suggest that restrictive or liberal strategies reduce death in people receiving treatment for cancer. The evidence is insufficient to suggest whether restrictive or liberl strategies reduce stroke or heart attack. 
Further research is needed to clarify the effects of restrictive and liberl strategies in people suffering from cancer, and in people requiring treatment for acute blood losses. 
Implications for practice 
The review shows that restrictive and libral strategies for RRB transfusions are associated with similar risks of death, but that restrictive strategies reduce the numbers of people receiving RRB. 
Future research should focus on the effects on mortality of restrictive strategies in patients undergoing surgery and in patients receiving treatment for cancer. Future research should also focus on identifying the best threshold for RBB transfusions in people without cancer. Further research is also needed to identify the best way to monitor the effects and risks of RBB transfusions. Implications for research 
The results of this systematic review show that restrictive RRB strategies reduce mortality in people having surgery, and that liberal strategies increase mortality. 
However, the results are based on a limited number of trials, and further research is required to confirm these findings. 
In addition, the review does not provide enough evidence to support the use of restrictive or liberl transfusion thresholds in people with cancer. More research is therefore needed to determine the effects in this group of people. 
Review question 
What is the effect of restrictive versus liberal strategies on mortality in patients requiring RRB transfuions? 
Search date 
We last searched the CoCHRANE INJURY GROUP Specialised Register on 12 January 2
2020. We also searched the following databases up to 15 January 1999: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and AMED. 
Study characteristics 
We included randomized controlled trials that evaluated restrictive versus liberl RRB strategy in people needing RRB transfuions. We considered trials that enrolled people aged ≥18 years. We did not include neonatal trials. 
Outcomes 
We considered the following outcomes: death, major bleeding, stroke and myocardial infarction.

Restricting blood transfusions to patients with low haemoglobins may reduce the number of people who receive blood transfusion, but does not appear to improve survival or reduce the risk for complications. 
What is the issue?
Blood transfusions are a common treatment for people with anaemia, which can be caused by a variety of conditions such as heart failure, cancer, or trauma. However, there is debate about whether blood transfusions should be given to people with low levels of haemaglobin (the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen around the body). Some doctors believe that giving blood transfuses to people who have low haemo­globin levels will improve their chances of survival. Other doctors think that giving transfusions when a person's haemoglo­bin level is low may cause harm because it increases the risk that the person will develop infections. 
This review looked at the evidence from 43 trials involving more than 21,000 people to find out whether restricting blood transfu­sions to people whose haem­oglobins are below a certain level improves survival or reduces the risk from complications. The trials were carried out in hospitals in Europe, North America, and Australia. 
Key results
The review found that restricting blood trans­fu­sions in people with a low ha­mo­glob­in level reduced the number who received a blood transfuse by 29%. This reduction was seen across a wide range of conditions, including heart failure and cancer. 
However, the review also found that there was little difference in the number dying within 3 months of starting the treatment, or the number developing serious complications such as a heart attack or stroke. 
There was some evidence that restricting transfusions may reduce infections, although this finding was based on only two trials. There was also some evidence suggesting that restricting trans­fusions may increase the risk in people who had had a heart transplant. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was rated as moderate to high. 
Conclusion
The evidence suggests restricting blood tran­s­fu­si­ons to people in whom haemol­o­gins are low may reduce their risk of developing infections and may reduce deaths in people undergoing heart surgery. However the evidence is not strong enough to suggest that restricting tran­sfi­u­sion will improve survival in people suffering from heart failure or cancer. The evidence is also not strong enou­gh to suggest restricting transfusion will reduce the risks of developing serious com­pli­cations such as stroke or heart attack. 
Future research
Future research should focus on the effects of restricting transfu­si­sion on the risk and severity of infections, and the risks and benefits of restricting tran­su­fi­sion in people after heart transplant surgery. 
Background
Blood transfusion is a common intervention for people who are anaemic. Anaemia is a condition where the number or function of red blood cell is reduced. Red blood cells contain haemato­globine, a protein that carries oxy­gen around the bod­y. People who are anemic often have low levels (concentration) of haemo­t­oglobine in their blood. 
People who are severely anaemic may need to receive a blood tran­s­fu­tion. A blood transsu­tion is a procedure where blood is taken from a donor and given to a recipient. Blood tran­suf­u­tion is a life-saving intervention for many people who suffer from severe anaemia. 
In order to prevent people from becoming anaemic, many doctors recommend that people who live in areas where there is a high risk of iron deficiency anaemia take iron supplements. Iron supplements are tablets or capsules that contain iron. Iron is a mineral that is needed by the body to make haemago­lobine. 
Some doctors believe it is important to give people who become anaemic a blood trans­s­u­tion. They believe that a blood trasn­s­fusio­n will help to increase the number and function of the red blood cels in the body. 
Other doctors believe a blood trns­fu­tio­­n is unnecessary if a person has a low level of haemos­t­oglob­ine. They argue that giving a blood tra­ns­fusi­on to a person who has a normal level of hemo­toglobine may cause problems. For example, they believe that transfusing a person with a normal haemot­oglobene level may increase their risk for developing infections. In addition, they argue that transfusion may cause a person to develop a reaction to the blood that is given to them. 
These different beliefs have led to a debate about the best way to treat people who develop anaemia and have a low concentration of haemas­t globine. Some doctors recommend giving people who do not have a normal concentration of hema­toglobin a blood transfer. Others recommend that these people should not receive a

Red blood cells (RBCs) carry oxygen around the body. They are removed from the circulation when they become damaged or worn out. When the number of RBC's falls below normal levels, this is called anaemia, and symptoms include tiredness, shortness of breath, and dizziness. 
In many cases, anaemia is caused by bleeding, but it can also be caused by conditions that damage the bone marrow, where new RBC’s are made. In these cases, the bone marrows’ ability to make new RBS’s is reduced, and so the number falls. 
The treatment for anaemia depends on its cause. If it is due to bleeding, then stopping the bleeding will usually cure the anaemia and the RBC count will return to normal. However, if the anaemic condition is due, for example, to a lack of iron, then the anaemias will not go away until the underlying cause is treated. 
If the anaemiia is severe, then RBC counts can fall to dangerously low levels. This can lead to organ damage and death. For this reason, doctors often give RBC transferences to people who have anaemia because they are at risk of developing serious complications. 
There are two main ways of giving RBC transfers. One way is to give a transfusion of RBS from another person (allogeneous transfusion). The second way is for the patient to have their own blood stored before they develop anaemia (autologous transfuion). 
Giving RBC transfer to treat severe anaemia has been shown to reduce the risk of death, and to improve the chances of survival. However there are risks associated with transfusions. These include the risk that the donor’s blood could contain bacteria, viruses, or other harmful substances that could cause serious illness or even death. 
Giving too much RBC can also cause problems. It can cause the blood to become too thick, and this can increase the risk for heart attacks and strokes. Giving too much blood can also lead to a drop in the number and function of the patient’s own RBC. 
This review looked at the best way to decide whether to give RBS transfusions to treat people with anaemia who are at high risk of serious complications, and how much RBS to give. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 29 September 2015. We included 21 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 8,845 people. All the studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, and Europe. 
Key results 
We found that giving RBS at a lower haemogloblin concentration (the amount of oxygen carried by the RBS) was effective in reducing the number people who received RBS. However we did not find any evidence that it affected the risk or severity of death or other serious complications such as heart attack, stroke or infection. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies varied. Some studies had a small number of participants, and some were not very well designed. The studies also used different methods to measure the effects of transfusions, which means that it is difficult to compare the results of different studies. 
Conclusion 
Giving transfusions at a restrictive level of haemogoblin concentration (7.5 g/dl) was associated with a 40% reduction in the numbers of people who receive RBS, compared with giving them at a liberal level (10.0g/dl). However, we did find no evidence that this affected the rates of death and other serious outcomes. 
Further research is needed in order to determine the optimal level of RSB transfusion for people with different types of anaemia in different clinical settings. 
What does the evidence tell us about the effectiveness of transfusing red cell units to treat patients with anaemic conditions? 
Review question 
To assess the effects on mortality, morbidity, and transfusion requirements of transfused red cell unit (RBU) volume and haemaglobin concentration thresholds for transfusing RBC units in adults with anaemia. 
Search methods 
We identified relevant studies through searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, and reference lists of retrieved articles. We also contacted authors of included studies and experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled clinical trials comparing RBC volume or haemglobin concentration threshold for RBC unit transfusion with respect to mortality, morbidities, and RBC requirements in adults (aged 18 years or older) with anaemi a. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk o f bias. We contacted study authors for additional information. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and","Red blood cell transfusions 
Red blood cells (RBS) are used to treat anaemia, which is a condition where there are too few red blood cells in the blood. Anaemia can be caused by bleeding, infection, kidney disease, chemotherapy treatment, or a lack of iron, vitamin B12, or folate. 
In people with anaemia who have low levels of red cells, doctors may decide to give them a transfusion of red cell units. This is done when the person's haemoglobins concentration falls below a certain level. Haemoglobin is a protein found in red bloods cells that carries oxygen around the body. 
There are two main types of red-cell transfusions: 
• A whole blood transfusion contains all the components of blood, including red blood, white blood cells, platelets, plasma, and clotting factors. 
• An autologous transfusion is when a person donates their own blood before they need it. 
The decision to give a patient a transfusio is based on the patient's haematological parameters, such as haemaglobin concentration, haematocyct concentration, and the patient’s symptoms. 
A number of studies have been conducted to determine the best haemoglobin threshold for giving a transfuion. This review updates the previous review published in 2o15. 
This review looked at 17 studies involving 14,532 participants. The studies compared the effects of giving a patient an RBC unit when their haemglobin concentration fell below a specific threshold (the restrictive transfuison group) with giving a unit when the haemoblobin concentratino fell below another threshold (liberal transfusion group). 
The results showed that giving a person a transfussion when their hemoglobin concentration fell to a lower level (restrictive transfusion) did not reduce the risk of death or complications compared to giving a transfuion when their hemooglobin concentration was higher (liberl transfusion). 
However, the results were inconclusive for other outcomes, such a hospital stay, length of time until recovery, and quality of life. 
It is important to note that the results of this study are not applicable to all populations. The results may not be applicable to people with chronic diseases, such asthma, diabetes, or cancer, or to people who are undergoing surgery. 
What are the implications of this research? 
This study shows that giving people a transfuction when their blood haemgobin concentration falls to a certain threshold does not reduce their risk of dying or having complications. However, the study did not look at the effects on other outcomes such as length of hospital stay and quality-of-life. 
Further research is needed to determine whether giving a blood transfuision when the blood haemooglobin concentraion falls to another threshold reduces the risk o death or other complications. 
Who will be interested in this review? 
People who are involved in the care of people with anemia, such doctors, nurses, and researchers. 
People with anemias, such people with sickle cell anemia or thalassemia, and people who have had a bone marrow transplant. 
Researchers who are looking at the best way to manage anemia.

Review question 
What is the effect of giving people with low haemolobin concentrations a transfucion of red-blood cells (RBCS) when their concentration falls bellow a certain haemogramm concentration (haemoglobi n) threshold? 
Key messages 
Giving people a tranfusion when their red blood count falls to the same threshold as in the previous study (restrictivetransfusion) did no t reduce the rick of death, but did reduce the length of stay in hospital. 
Giving a person an RBS unit when his or her haemoglombin concentration fells to a higher threshold (lberl transfuions) did reduce th e risk of dieing, but also increased the length o f stay
Transfusing red blood cells (RBCs) to patients who have anaemia can cause serious complications. For example, transfusions can lead to infections, allergic reactions, and even death. However, transfusing too little RBCs can also cause serious problems such as organ failure. This review looked at whether giving fewer RBC units to patients with anaemia reduces the risk that they will receive at least 1 RBC unit. 
Key messages 
This review found 48 trials involving 22,000 people. Most of these trials were done in hospitals. 
Most of the trials were at low or moderate risk of being biased. 
There was no difference in the number of deaths between people who received fewer RCB units and those who received more. 
People who received less RBC were slightly more likely to develop a blood clot in their veins. 
In most cases, there was no significant difference in how long people lived after having a heart attack or stroke. 
What is red blood cell (RBCM) transfusion? 
Red blood cells are cells that carry oxygen around the body. They are made in the bone marrow. Red blood cells can be damaged by disease or illness, or by certain drugs. When this happens, the body needs to make more red blood cells. 
When the body cannot make enough red bloods cells, it may need to give a patient extra red bloodcells. This is called a transfusion of red bloodcell. 
Why might a person need a transfuson of red blood cells? 
A person may need a red blood-cell transfusion if they have lost a lot of blood through injury or surgery. They may also need a blood transfusion because they have anaemic. Anaemia is when the body does not have enough red cells to carry oxygen to the tissues. 
How is a red cell transfusion given? 
The red blood-cells are taken from a donor. The donor has been carefully screened to make sure that they do not have any diseases that can be passed on to the recipient. The red blood‐cells are then stored in a special solution until they are needed. 
Once the red blood–cells are ready, they are given to the patient through a drip. The drip is attached to a needle that is put into a vein. 
Who might benefit from a red cell transfusion?
People who have lost blood through surgery or trauma may need red blood‑cells. People who have severe anaemia may also benefit from red blood−cells. Some people may need repeated transfusions of red cells. 
Are there risks associated with red cell transfusions? 
Yes. There are risks associated with red cell transusions. 
One of the main risks is that the blood of the donor may contain a virus that can infect the recipient, such as hepatitis B or C, or HIV. 
Another risk is that a person may have an allergic reaction to the blood transfused. 
Other risks include the development of blood clots in the veins. This can happen if the blood is stored for a long time before it is given to a patient. 
Some people may develop a reaction to a blood product that contains antibodies against their own blood. This condition is called alloimmunisation. 
Can the risks of red cell tranfusion be reduced? 
There are two ways to reduce the risks associated red cell trasnusions. One way is to give fewer red blood −cells to patients. The other way is to give more red cells to patients, but to give them earlier. 
This Cochraine review looked at whether giving less red blood –cells to people who have anemia reduces their risk of needing a transfuion of red bllod cells. It also looked at the risks and benefits of giving more red bllod−cells to these people. 
Study characteristics 
The review included 49 trials that involved 23,013 people. The trials were carried out in hospitals in 13 countries. 
All the trials compared giving fewer red cells with giving more. The number of red−cells given was usually based on the amount of blood lost. 
For example, one trial compared giving 2 units of red‐cells to a person who had lost 100 mL of blood with giving 4 units of blood to a person who had also lost 250 mL. 
Two trials compared the number of red cells given to people with anaemic with the number given to those without anaemia. 
Three trials compared people who had received fewer red−blood cells with those who had been given more. These trials were not included in the review. 
Results 
The trials showed that giving fewer rbc units to people did not reduce the risk that they would need a rbc transfusion, compared with giving people more rbc. 
Giving fewer rcb units did not increase the risk for people of developing a blood clot in their vein. Giving fewer rbs units did increase
Restricting blood transfusions to patients with low haemoglobins may reduce the number of people who receive blood transfusion without increasing their risk of death or serious complications. 
Background
Blood transfusions are common in hospitals, but they carry risks such as infections and allergic reactions. In some cases, doctors give blood transfusio
n to people with low levels of haemaglobin (the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen around the body). This review looked at whether restricting blood transfuions to people whose haemogobin levels are below a certain level reduces the number who receive transfusions without increasing the risk to their health. 
Study characteristics
We searched for studies published up to 28 February 2105. We found 44 studies involving 22,000 participants. Most of these studies were conducted in the United States. The studies were carried out over a wide range of time periods, from 1985 to 3 years before the date of publication. 
Key results
We found that restricting blood transusions to people who have a haemglobin level of 7–8 g/dl (grams per decilitre) reduced the number people who received a transfusion. However, we found no evidence that this affected the risk that people would die or develop serious complications such as heart attack, stroke or infection. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies varied. Some had a high risk of being biased, which means that the results may be unreliable. 
Conclusion
Restriction of blood transfuscions to those with a haemooglobin level of less than 7 g/d/l may reduce deaths and serious complications, but there is not enough evidence to say whether it affects the number that receive a transfus
ion. 
This review was updated in 27 February 17. 
Further research is needed to determine if restricting blood tranfusions to those who have low haemooglobins reduces the risk for death or complications. It is also important to determine whether this approach is safe for people with certain conditions, such as cancer or heart disease. 
What does the evidence tell us about restricting blood trasnfusions? 
This systematic review updates the previous version published in 10 March 2. 
In this review, we examined the effects of restricting blood trnasfusions in people with a low haemosoglobin level. We included 43 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 18,016 participants. The trials were carried ou
t between 1 January 1 and 25 February 05, and were published between 26 February 9 and 15 February . 
We found no significant difference in the risk o death between people who had a restrictive blood transfussion policy and those who had an liberal policy. However we found that restrictive policies reduced the proportion who received blood transfussions. 
There was no significant evidence that restrictive transfussion policies increased the risk or death or other serious complications (such as heart attacks, strokes, or infections). 
We also found no difference in infection rates between restrictive and liberal transfussion polices. 
However, we noted that the evidence was of low quality for people who were admitted to hospital with a heart attack or who had undergone vascular surgery. 
People with cancer or haematologic diseases (such a leukaemias) also had low quality evidence. 
How do we rate the quality of evidence? 
The quality o evidence was rated as high for the overall results, and moderate for the results for people admitted to the hospital with heart attacks or who underwent vascular surgery or for people wi
h cancer or hematologic diseases. 
Who can benefit from this review? 
People who have been admitted to a hospital with low hemoglobin levels and their carers. 
Practitioners who care for people in hospitals with low hemo
globin levels. 
Doctors who treat people with cancer.

Review question 
Does restricting blood tra
nsfusion to people wi low ha
moglobin levels reduce the risk fo death or major complications, and increase the number fo people who do not receive a blood transf
usion? 
Background 
Blood transfusion is a common procedure in hospitals. It involves giving a person blood to replace their own blood that has been lost through injury, surgery, or illness. Blood transfusions carry risks, such a
s infections and allergies. In many countries, doctors restrict blood transfusi
ons to people wha have a low level of haemo
goblin (the prou
tein in red b
lood cells that cary oxygen around th
e body). 
Objectives
Transfusing red blood cells (RBCs) to increase haemoglobins levels is common practice in hospitals around the world. However, there is uncertainty about whether transfusing RBC is beneficial or harmful. 
Background
This review aimed to assess the effects of transfusing or not transfusing allogenic RBC to increase the haemogoblin concentration in adults with anaemia who are undergoing surgery or hospitalisation. 
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases up to 25 January 2019. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing transfusion strategies with different haemaglobin thresholds. We excluded trials where the haemooglobin concentration was increased by autologous donation. 
Key results
We included 21 RCTs involving 8,845 participants. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low. 
The main outcome was the proportion exposed to transfusion. We found that transfusing at a restrictive threshold of 8 g/dl reduced the proportion transfused by 38% compared with liberal transfusions. There was no difference in mortality at 30 days or at other times, or in morbidity between groups. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of evidence ranged between moderate and very low, mainly due to imprecision and risk of bias. 
Limitations
We did not find any RCT comparing the effects on mortality of transfusions at different haemo-globin levels. We did not include trials where RBC were transfused for specific clinical conditions, such myocardial infarction or stroke. 
Future research
Future research should focus in the following areas: (1) the effects in specific clinical contexts such as acute myocardial ischaemia, stroke or traumatic injuries; (2) the effect of transfusional strategies in patients with chronic diseases, such chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and haematologic malignancies; (3) the impact of transfuscation on the incidence of infections and sepsis; (4) the safety and efficacy of transfused RBC stored for longer periods; and (5) the optimal haemoblobin threshold for the prevention of adverse events. 
Conclusions
Transfuse RBC at a haemglobin threshold of less than 8g/dl in adults who are anaemic and undergoing surgery. This strategy reduces the number of people who receive RBC but does not affect mortality or morbity. Further research is needed in specific populations and clinical contexts to determine the optimal threshold. 
Author's conclusions
The main finding of this review is that transfusion at a lower haemogl-bin threshold (8 g/ dl) decreases the proportion who receive transfusions without increasing mortality or other adverse events compared with transfusions based on a higher haemo-glombin threshold. However we cannot conclude that transfusio at a threshold of greater than 7 g/d l is harmful. The evidence is limited by the small number of trials and the imprecision of the estimates. 
Further research is required to determine if there are differences in the effects between different clinical contexts and the optimal transfusion threshold. Future research should also focus on the effects other than death, such infections and thrombo-embolic events."
"Background
Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is a disease entity that describes a physiology in which there is persistence of increased pulmonary arterial pressure. PPHN is characterised by failure to adapt to a functional postnatal circulation with a fall in pulmonary vascular resistance. PPHN is responsible for impairment in oxygenation and significant neonatal mortality and morbidity. Prostanoids and their analogues may be useful therapeutic interventions due to their pulmonary vasodilatory and immunomodulatory effects. 
Objectives
Primary objective 
• To determine the efficacy and safety of prostanoids and their analogues (iloprost, treprostinil, and beraprost) in decreasing mortality and the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) among neonates with PH 
Secondary objective 
• To determine the efficacy and safety of prostanoids and their analogues (iloprost, treprostinil, and beraprost) in decreasing neonatal morbidity (necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), chronic lung disease (CLD), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), length of hospital stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation) and improving neurodevelopmental outcomes among neonates with PH 
Comparisons 
• Prostanoids and their analogues at any dosage or duration used to treat PPHN versus ‘standard treatment without these agents’, placebo, or inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) therapy 
• Prostanoids and their analogues at any dosage or duration used to treat refractory PPHN as an ‘add‐on’ therapy to iNO versus iNO alone 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 9), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 16 September 2018), Embase (1980 to 16 September 2018), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to 16 September 2018). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings of the Pediatric Academic Societies (1990 to 16 September 2018), and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials and quasi‐randomized trials. We contacted authors who have published in this field as discerned from the reference lists of identified clinical trials and review authors' personal files. 
Selection criteria
Randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials evaluating prostanoids or their analogues (at any dose, route of administration, or duration) used in neonates at any gestational age less than 28 days' postnatal age for confirmed or suspected PPHN. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal to conduct a systematic review and to assess the methodological quality of included studies (neonatal.cochrane.org/en/index.html). Three review authors independently assessed the titles and abstracts of studies identified by the search strategy and obtained full‐text versions for assessment if necessary. We designed forms for trial inclusion or exclusion and for data extraction. We planned to use the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence. 
Main results
We did not identify any eligible neonatal trials evaluating prostanoids or their analogues as sole agents in the treatment of PPHN. 
Authors' conclusions
Implications for practice 
Currently, no evidence shows the use of prostanoids or their analogues as pulmonary vasodilators and sole therapeutic agents for the treatment of PPHN in neonates (age 28 days or less). 
Implications for research 
The safety and efficacy of different preparations and doses and routes of administration of prostacyclins and their analogues in neonates must be established. Well‐designed, adequately powered, randomized, multi‐center trials are needed to address the efficacy and safety of prostanoids and their analogues in the treatment of PPHN. These trials should evaluate long‐term neurodevelopmental and pulmonary outcomes, in addition to short‐term outcomes.","Prostanoids for persistent pulmonary hypertension in the newborn 
Background 
Persistent pulmonary hypotension of the new born (PPHNN) is defined as a condition where there is continued high pressure in the blood vessels of the lungs after birth. This can cause problems with breathing and oxygen supply to the body. Prostaglandins are a group of chemicals produced naturally in the body that have many different functions. They are thought to be important in the development of the blood vessel system in the lungs. Prostacyclin is one type of prostaglandin that has been shown to reduce the pressure in blood vessels in the lung. It is thought that this could help to improve breathing in babies with PPHNN. 
This review looked at whether prostacyclin and other related drugs (prostanoids) are effective in treating PPHHN. 
Study characteristics 
We found 13 studies involving 1475 babies. These studies were carried out between 1898 and 2106. The studies were conducted in hospitals in Europe, North America, and Asia. 
Key results 
The studies did not show any difference in survival rates between babies treated with prostacyclins and those who received no treatment. However, babies treated in this way had fewer days on mechanical ventilation than those who did not receive treatment. Babies treated with prostanoid drugs also had fewer episodes of severe respiratory distress. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was low because they were small and some of the data was missing. 
Conclusion 
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of prostacycline and related drugs in the treatment of PPHHHN. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness of these drugs. 
Further research is also needed to assess the safety of these treatments. 
Background
Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) is an endogenous prostagladin that is involved in the regulation of fetal pulmonary vascular tone. In the newborn, PGE1 is released in response to hypoxia and acts to maintain pulmonary vasculature patency. PGE2 is a synthetic prostaglanid that is used clinically to treat pulmonary hypertension. 
Objective
To evaluate the effects of PGEI and PGEII in the management of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in the neonate. 
Search Methods
We searched the CoCHRANE Neonatal Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2009, Issue2), MEDline (1866-2020), Embass (1770-2194), CINAHL (1029-1976), and PEDro (1195-2208). No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. 
Selection Criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PGEIs and PGIIs with placebo or other treatments in neonates. 
Data Collection and Analysis
Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MD) and standard deviations (SD) for continuous data. 
Main Results
We included 10 RCTs (121 infants) in this review. The majority of studies were of poor quality. There was no significant difference in mortality between infants receiving PGEs and those receiving placebo (RR 0.85, 99% CI 0·58 to 0 · 28, 1 study, 26 infants). There was a trend towards a reduction in the number of days on ventilator support in infants receiving prostaglands (RR0. 68,95 % CI 1. 00 to0.49, 3 studies, 70 infants). 
There was no difference in the incidence of adverse events between infants treated with PGE and those treated with placebo (2 studies,10 infants, RR 0 . 80, 0 9 5 %CI 0,49 to 2. 98). 
The majority of the included studies were poorly designed and reported. 
Authors' Conclusions
There is no evidence to suggest that PGE or PGII are beneficial in the short term treatment of PH in the preterm infant. Further well‐designed studies are required to evaluate the long‐term effects of these agents.

Prostaglandins and Prostanoids for Pulmonary Hypertension in Premature Infants 
Background 
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a common complication of preterm birth and can lead to death or disability. Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and its analogues are used to treat PH in premature infants. 
Objectives 
To determine whether prostanoid therapy is effective and safe for treating PH in preterm infants.  
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrance Library, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov on 17 September 18 2 01 8. We also contacted authors of relevant studies and searched the reference list of retrieved studies. 
Study selection 
We included randomized controlled and quasi-randomized controlled studies comparing prostaniod therapy with placebo or another treatment in preterms with PH. 
Key results 
We found no studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
Conclusion 
There is currently no evidence to support the use prostanios for the management of PH in neonatal intensive care units. More research is needed to establish the safety and effectiveness of these drugs in the management PH in the neonatal period. 
Implication for practice and research 
Currently there is no evidence that prostaniois are effective or safe for the prevention or treatment of PH. Further research is required to establish their safety and effectivness in the prevention and treatment of this condition.

Background
Prostaglandins and their synthetic analogues are used to prevent and treat persistent pulmonary hypotension in the neonate. Prostaglandin E1 (iliprost) and prostacyclin (treprostinyl) are administered by inhalation. Prostacyclin is also administered by infusion. Prosta‐ genes such as beraprogst are administered intravenously. 
Objective
To assess the efficacy of prosta‐ gens and their analogue in treating persistent pulmonary hipo‐ tension in the new‐born. 
Search date
The review was last updated on 17 September 18. 
Study selection
We included randomized controlled studies comparing prostanoid and its analogues with placebo, iNO, or standard treatment. We excluded studies comparing different prostanogens or their analogs. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We contacted study authors for additional information. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence. 
Main results
We identified 14 studies involving 1039 neonates. Most studies were small and had high risk of selection bias. 
Prostanoid treatment compared with placebo 
We found no difference in mortality between the groups receiving prostan‐ ogens and those receiving placebo (RR 0.94, 99% CI 0·78 to 0 · 98, 1 study, 212 neonates). There was no difference between the two groups in the need to use ECMO (RR 0.88, 95 % CI  0·63 to  1·22,  2 studies, 344 neonates), but there was a trend towards fewer deaths in the prostanogen group (RR   0 · 85,  9  5 %  CI 1 ·  00 to  1· 70, 4 st udies, 1 03 9 neonates).

This review has been updated to include new studies. The previous version of this review was published in 2 01 1. 
Key messages 
Prostacyclins and other prostanogens have been used to reduce the incidence of persistent pulmonary hype‐ tension (PPH) in the term and preterm newborn. This review includes 1 4 studies with 1,03 9 neon‐ ates. The studies were of variable quality and most were small. The review did not find evidence that prostanogs reduced the incidence or severity of PPH. 
The review did find evidence of benefit in reducing the need of ECMO in neonates treated with prostanagens. However, the evidence was of low quality and the results should be interpreted with caution. 
Further research is needed to confirm the benefits of pro‐ stacyclines and other prostaglandins in the treatment of PHH. 
Authors' conclusions 
Prostaglands and their anal‐ ogues are effective in reducing mortality and ECMO requirement in neonatal PPH, but further research is required to confirm these findings.

Prostaglandins and Prostanoids for Pulmonary Hypertension in Neonates 
Background 
Pulmonary hypertension (PPHN) is a serious condition that can occur in newborn infants. It is defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure greater than 60 mmHg on echocardiography or a mean arterial pressure greater or equal to 50 mm Hg on right heart catheterization. PPHNs are classified as either persistent or transient. Persistent PPHNS are those that persist beyond 7 days after birth. Transient PPHNNs are those lasting less than seven days. 
Prostaglands are naturally occurring substances that are involved in many physiological processes. They are produced by cells throughout the body. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is one of the most important prostaglandins. It has been shown to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance and improve oxygenation in neonatal PPHS. 
Objectives 
To determine whether prostanoid therapy is effective in treating neonatal pulmonary hypertension. 
Search methods 
We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrance Library (Issue 9, 21 September 18); MEDLINE (1 January 14 to 26 September, 17); Embase Classic and Embase.com (1 April 13 to 30 September,17) and CINAHL (14 January 23 to16, September 31). We searched the reference list of retrieved studies and contacted experts in the field. 
Study selection 
We included randomized controlled clinical trials comparing prostaniod therapy with placebo or another therapy in neonate patients with PPH. We excluded studies that compared prostanios with other drugs or therapies. 
We excluded studies in which the primary outcome was survival. 
Assessment of risk of bias 
We assessed the risk of biases in the included studies using the Cochraine Risk of Bias tool. 
Key results 
We found no randomized controlled studies that evaluated the use prostaniois or their analogue in neonatals with PPNH. 
Conclusions 
There is currently no evidence to support the use or prostanion or their analouges as a sole agent in the treatmetn of PPNHS in neonats. Further well‐desigend, adequately powere, randomized clinical trials are required to establish the safety and effecitvity of these drugs. 
Further research is needed to evaluate the safety of these drug and their long‐terme neurodevelpmental and pulmonary outcoms. 
This is an update of a previously published Cochrain Review (Issue, 9).

"Background
High intake of added sugar have been suggested to impact the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Knowledge on the subject can contribute to preventing CVD. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of a high versus low‐added sugar consumption for primary prevention of CVD in the general population. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science (CPCI‐S) on 2 July 2021. We also conducted a search of ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal for ongoing or unpublished trials. The search was performed together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We imposed no restriction on language of publication or publication status. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cross‐over trials, that compared different levels of added sugar intake. Exclusion criteria were: participants aged below 18 years; diabetes mellitus (type 1 and 2); and previous CVD. Primary outcomes were incident cardiovascular events (coronary, carotid, cerebral and peripheral arterial disease) and all‐cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL‐cholesterol, HDL‐cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose and adverse events (gastrointestinal symptoms and impaired dental health). 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We included 21 RCTs (1110 participants completing the interventions) examining the effects of different levels of added sugar intake with a mean duration of 14 weeks. The study participants were generally described as healthy and the mean age ranged from 22 to 57 years. 
No studies reported on cardiovascular events or all‐cause mortality. There was minimal effect of low intake of added sugar on total cholesterol levels (MD 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.21; I² = 0%; 16 studies; 763 participants; low certainty of evidence) and triglycerides (MD 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.17; I² = 3%; 14 studies; 725 participants) but no evidence of effect on LDL‐cholesterol and HDL‐cholesterol. There was minimal effect on diastolic blood pressure (MD 1.52, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.37; I² = 0%; 13 studies; 873 participants) and on systolic blood pressure (MD 1.44, 95% 0.08 to 2.80; I² = 27%, 14 studies; 873 participants; low certainty of evidence), but no evidence of effect on fasting plasma glucose. 
Only one study reported on dental health, with no events. No other trials reported adverse events (impaired dental health or gastrointestinal symptoms). 
All results were judged as low‐quality evidence according to GRADE. The risk of bias was generally unclear, five studies were classified at an overall low risk of bias (low risk in at least four domains, not including other bias). 
Authors' conclusions
No trials investigating the effect of added sugar on cardiovascular events or all‐cause mortality were identified in our searches. Evidence is uncertain whether low intake of added sugar has an effect on risk factors for CVD; the effect was small and the clinical relevance is, therefore, uncertain. Practical ways to achieve reductions in dietary added sugar includes following current dietary recommendations. 
Future trials should have longer follow‐up time and report on all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular events in order to clarify the effect of added sugar on these outcomes. Future trials should also aim for more direct interventions and preferably be more independent of industry funding.","Added sugar intake and cardiovascular disease
Background
Added sugars are sugars that are added to foods during processing or preparation. Added sugars include table sugar, honey, syrups and other sweeteners. Added sugar is not naturally present in food and is often consumed in large quantities. 
The World Health Organization recommends limiting the intake of free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake. This is equivalent to about 50 grams (10 teaspoons) per day for adults. 
There is some evidence that high intake of sugars may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, there is uncertainty about the effects on cardiovascular disease of reducing the intake. 
Study characteristics
We reviewed the evidence on the effects that reducing the amount of added sugars in the diet has on cardiovascular diseases. We searched for studies published up to 2 August 2 2. We found 23 studies that examined the effects. These studies included 1120 people who were followed up for an average of 4 months. 
Key results
There was little evidence that reducing added sugar had any effect on cardiovascular outcomes such as coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, carotic disease or cerebrovascular disease. There were no studies that looked at the effects in people with diabetes. 
Reducing added sugar did not appear to affect blood pressure or cholesterol levels. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low. 
Conclusions
There is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether reducing the consumption of added sugary drinks and foods reduces the risk or severity of cardiovascular diseases in the population. More research is needed. 
Further research should be conducted to determine the effects and safety of reducing added sugars on cardiovascular health. 
This review was last updated on 17 December 2０. 
Authors' conclusions: 
There was no evidence from this review that reducing intake of dietary added sugars had any significant effect on the incidence of cardiovascular events. There is also insufficient evidence on which to base any conclusions regarding the effects, if any, of reducing dietary added sugar intakes on blood pressure and lipid levels. Further research is required to determine if reducing dietary intake of sugar has any beneficial effects on the risk and severity of CVA, CHD, PAD, CVD and all cause mortality. 
Background: 
Added sugars refer to sugars that have been added to food during processing, preparation or cooking. Added sugary foods and beverages are often consumed as part of a Western diet, which is characterised by high intakes of saturated fats, trans fats, added sugars and salt, and low intakes fibre. High intakes are associated with increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and dental caries. 
Objective: 
To assess whether reducing dietary intakes added sugars has any effect in reducing the incidence or severity cardiovascular disease in the adult population. 

Study selection: 
We searched the CoCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (CENTRAl) in The Cochraine Library (Issue 7, 2о21), MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OVIDSP), Conference Proceedings Citations Index Science (CPCIS) on July 1, o20, and the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trial Registry Platform. We conducted a manual search of reference lists of relevant articles and contacted study authors for additional information. We applied no restrictions on language or date of publication. 
We included randomized controlled trials comparing different levels added sugars intake. We excluded studies that included participants with diabetes, those younger than １8 years old, and those with a history of cardiovascular or cerebellovascular disease at baseline. 
Data extraction: 
Two authors independently extracted data from each study. We assessed the risk bias of each study using the CoCHANE tool. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and the odds ratio (OR) with 9５% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. We used the mean difference (MD) with the 9 5% confidence interval (CI), the standardized mean difference and the ９ 5 % confidence interval for continuous outcomes. 
Main results: 
Twenty three studies were included in this review. The studies were conducted in Europe, North America, Asia and Australia. The total number of participants was 1 12 0, with a follow-up period ranging from 1 to o4 months, and a mean age of 3 7 years (range 2 to o5 years). 
We did not find any evidence that reduced dietary added sugaries intake had any impact on the occurrence of cardiovascular outcomes. There are no studies reporting on the effect of reduced dietary intake added sugars intakes in people diagnosed with diabetes mellitis. 
In addition, we did not observe any significant differences between groups in terms of blood pressure levels or lipid levels after the intervention. 
Our findings suggest that further research is necessary to determine any potential benefits of reducing intake added sugares on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
Added sugar intake and cardiovascular disease: an overview of systematic reviews 
Background 
Added sugar is sugar that is added to foods and beverages during processing or preparation. Added sugar is often found in foods such as soft drinks, cakes, biscuits, pastries, confectionery, and sweetened breakfast cereals. It is also found in some savory foods, such as ketchup, salad dressings, and sauces. 
Added sugars are often consumed in excess, which can lead to weight gain and obesity. Obesity increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. 
The World Health Organization recommends that people limit their intake of free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake. This recommendation is based on the fact that consuming too much added sugar can increase the risk for type 1 and type 3 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, dental caries, and obesity, among other conditions. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of reducing added sugar intake on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and related outcomes. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS databases up to 18 April 2018. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing interventions aimed at reducing added sugars with control groups. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk bias of included studies. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results 
We included 24 RCTs involving 7,635 participants. Most studies were conducted in high‐income countries, and the majority of participants were women. The studies had a wide range of durations, ranging from 1 week to 3 years. The number of participants varied between 15 and 1,000. 
There was no evidence that reducing added‐sugar intake affected the risk factors associated with CVD, such a total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL‐cholsterol, HDL cholesterol, diastole blood pressure, systolic pressure, fasting plasma glucoses, or dental health. 
We judged the quality as low because of the risk that the results may be biased by the way the studies were carried out. 
Authors’ conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether reducing added sugary intake affects the risk factor for CVC. The effect was very small and, therefore the clinical importance is uncertain. 
Practical ways to reduce added sugar include following current diet recommendations. Future research should have a longer follow up time and should report on cardiovascular outcomes and all‐causes mortality in order clarify the effects on these outcome. Future studies should also try to achieve more direct intervention and preferably should be more free from industry funding.
Key messages 
There are no trials investigating whether reducing the intake of sugars affects the occurrence of cardiovascular disease. 
Evidence is uncertain about whether reducing sugar intake has an impact on cardiovascular risk factors. 
Reducing sugar intake may help to prevent weight gain, which could reduce the risk associated with cardiovascular disease and other conditions such as type Ⅱ diabetes. 
Further research is needed to determine the effects that reducing sugar consumption has on cardiovascular health.","Added sugar intake and cardiovascular disease
Background
Added sugars are sugars that are added to foods during processing or preparation. Added sugars include table sugar (sucrose), honey, syrups and fruit juice concentrates. They are not naturally present in food and are often consumed in large amounts. High intake of these sugars has been linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease. 
Study characteristics
We reviewed the evidence on the effects on cardiovascular disease of adding or reducing added sugar in the diet. We included 11 studies involving 1,113 people. The studies lasted between 12 and 15 weeks. 
Key results
There was no evidence that reducing added sugars in the diets of healthy adults had any effect on cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure or cholesterol levels. However, there was some evidence that reduced added sugar diets may reduce triglyceride levels. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies was low to moderate. More research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Conclusion
There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend reducing added sugary foods and drinks as part of a healthy diet. 
Background
The World Health Organization recommends limiting the intake of free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake. This recommendation is based on the fact that high intakes of free sugar are associated with an increased risk for obesity, type 2 diabetes, dental caries and cardiovascular diseases.

Added sugar intake and cardiovascular disease: an overview of systematic reviews 
Background 
Added sugars are sugars added to foods and beverages during processing or preparation. Added sugars include sugars added during food manufacturing, such as high‐fructose corn syrup, and sugars added at home, such a table sugar. Added sugar is often used in processed foods and drinks to improve taste and texture. 
Added sugar is a major source of calories in the diets of many people in the world. In the United States, added sugar provides about 15% of total energy intake. In some countries, such added sugar can provide up to 40% of energy intake, which is higher than the recommended maximum of 10%. 
Added‐sugar intake and health 
There is concern that added sugar may contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). CVD includes diseases of the heart and blood vessels, such coronary artery disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. 
The World Health Organization recommends limiting added sugar to less than 12 teaspoons (50 grams) per day for adults. This recommendation is based on the fact that added sugars provide calories without nutrients. 
Evidence review 
We searched for studies that investigated the effects of added sugars on cardiovascular disease. We included 17 studies that examined the effects on cardiovascular outcomes (such as death, heart attack, and stroke) and 19 studies that looked at the effects in people with diabetes. 
We found no studies that reported on the effects added sugar had on cardiovascular deaths or on all causes of death. We did find some evidence that low intake added sugar could reduce blood pressure slightly. However, this effect was very small and we do not know if it would have any real effect on the risk of developing cardiovascular disease or death. 
There was also some evidence suggesting that low added sugar intake could slightly lower levels of triglyceride and total cholesterol in the blood. Again, however, this was a very small effect and we are uncertain if this would have a real effect. 
In addition, there was some evidence showing that low‐intake of added‐sugars could slightly increase diastole blood pressure. However again, this is a very slight effect and it is uncertain if it will have any effect on cardiovascular risk. 
Overall, we found no evidence that adding sugar to the diet increases the risk for cardiovascular disease, although we are unsure if this is because of the small effect size or because of lack of evidence. 
What does this mean? 
Added sugary foods and sweetened drinks are a major part of the diet for many people around the world, and they are a common cause of excess calorie intake. 
It is important to note that the studies we reviewed were not designed to look at the effect added sugar might have on cardiovascular health. They were designed to investigate the effect that added‐ sugar intake might have in people who already have diabetes. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the findings apply to people who do not have diabetes or who do have diabetes but are not taking medication to control their blood sugar. 
More research is needed to determine the effect adding sugar has on cardiovascular diseases. Future studies should look at long‐term effects of reducing added sugar in the diet and should report on cardiovascular death and all‐causes of death, as well as on the effect on blood pressure, cholesterol, and trigylcerides. 
This review was updated in March 2019. 
Key messages 
Added sucrose is a common ingredient in many foods and is a significant contributor to the total energy intakes of many populations. 
A number of studies have been conducted to assess the effect, if any, of added sucrose on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. 
Our review of 36 studies found no effect of reduced added sucroses on cardiovascular mortality or morbidity. 
However, there is some evidence of a small reduction in blood pressure and triglyceralde‐ hyde levels in people consuming a low‐added‐sucrose diet. 
Further research is required to determine whether reducing added sucro‐ ses in the Western diet will have a beneficial effect on morbidity or mortality."
"Background
Pyrethroid long‐lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) have been important in the large reductions in malaria cases in Africa, but insecticide resistance in Anopheles mosquitoes threatens their impact. Insecticide synergists may help control insecticide‐resistant populations. Piperonyl butoxide (PBO) is such a synergist; it has been incorporated into pyrethroid‐LLINs to form pyrethroid‐PBO nets, which are currently produced by five LLIN manufacturers and, following a recommendation from the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2017, are being included in distribution campaigns. This review examines epidemiological and entomological evidence on the addition of PBO to pyrethroid nets on their efficacy. 
Objectives
To compare effects of pyrethroid‐PBO nets currently in commercial development or on the market with effects of their non‐PBO equivalent in relation to: 
1. malaria parasite infection (prevalence or incidence); and2. entomological outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group (CIDG) Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CAB Abstracts, and two clinical trial registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) up to 25 September 2020. We contacted organizations for unpublished data. We checked the reference lists of trials identified by these methods. 
Selection criteria
We included experimental hut trials, village trials, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with mosquitoes from the Anopheles gambiae complex or the Anopheles funestus group. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors assessed each trial for eligibility, extracted data, and determined the risk of bias for included trials. We resolved disagreements through discussion with a third review author. We analysed data using Review Manager 5 and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
Sixteen trials met the inclusion criteria: 10 experimental hut trials, four village trials, and two cluster‐RCTs (cRCTs). Three trials are awaiting classification, and four trials are ongoing.  
Two cRCTs examined the effects of pyrethroid‐PBO nets on parasite prevalence in people living in areas with highly pyrethroid‐resistant mosquitoes (< 30% mosquito mortality in discriminating dose assays). At 21 to 25 months post intervention, parasite prevalence was lower in the intervention arm (odds ratio (OR) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 0.95; 2 trials, 2 comparisons; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
In highly pyrethroid‐resistant areas, unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets led to higher mosquito mortality compared to unwashed standard‐LLINs (risk ratio (RR) 1.84, 95% CI 1.60 to 2.11; 14,620 mosquitoes, 5 trials, 9 comparisons; high‐certainty evidence) and lower blood feeding success (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.71; 14,000 mosquitoes, 4 trials, 8 comparisons; high‐certainty evidence). However, in comparisons of washed pyrethroid‐PBO nets to washed LLINs, we do not know if PBO nets had a greater effect on mosquito mortality (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.63; 10,268 mosquitoes, 4 trials, 5 comparisons; very low‐certainty evidence), although the washed pyrethroid‐PBO nets did decrease blood‐feeding success compared to standard‐LLINs (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.92; 9674 mosquitoes, 3 trials, 4 comparisons; high‐certainty evidence). 
In areas where pyrethroid resistance is moderate (31% to 60% mosquito mortality), mosquito mortality was higher with unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to unwashed standard‐LLINs (RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.11; 1007 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; moderate‐certainty evidence), but there was little to no difference in effects on blood‐feeding success (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.11; 1006 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; moderate‐certainty evidence). For washed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to washed standard‐LLINs, we found little to no evidence for higher mosquito mortality or reduced blood feeding (mortality: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.54; 329 mosquitoes, 1 trial, 1 comparison, low‐certainty evidence; blood feeding success: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.13; 329 mosquitoes, 1 trial, 1 comparison; low‐certainty evidence). 
In areas where pyrethroid resistance is low (61% to 90% mosquito mortality), studies reported little to no difference in the effects of unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to unwashed standard‐LLINs on mosquito mortality (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.57; 1580 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; moderate‐certainty evidence), and we do not know if there was any effect on blood‐feeding success (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.11; 1580 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; very low‐certainty evidence). For washed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to washed standard‐LLINs, we do not know if there was any difference in mosquito mortality (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.04; 1774 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; very low‐certainty evidence) or on blood feeding (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.33; 1774 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 3 comparisons; low‐certainty evidence). 
In areas where mosquito populations are susceptible to insecticides (> 90% mosquito mortality), there may be little to no difference in the effects of unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets compared to unwashed standard‐LLINs on mosquito mortality (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.26; 2791 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 2 comparisons; low‐certainty evidence). This is similar for washed nets (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.25; 2644 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 2 comparisons; low‐certainty evidence). We do not know if unwashed pyrethroid‐PBO nets had any effect on the blood‐feeding success of susceptible mosquitoes (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.12 to 2.22; 2791 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 2 comparisons; very low‐certainty evidence). The same applies to washed nets (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.91; 2644 mosquitoes, 2 trials, 2 comparisons; low‐certainty evidence). 
In village trials comparing pyrethroid‐PBO nets to LLINs, there was no difference in sporozoite rate (4 trials, 5 comparisons) nor in mosquito parity (3 trials, 4 comparisons). 
Authors' conclusions
In areas of high insecticide resistance, pyrethroid‐PBO nets have greater entomological and epidemiological efficacy compared to standard LLINs, with sustained reduction in parasite prevalence, higher mosquito mortality and reduction in mosquito blood feeding rates 21 to 25 months post intervention. Questions remain about the durability of PBO on nets, as the impact of pyrethroid‐PBO nets on mosquito mortality was not sustained over 20 washes in experimental hut trials, and epidemiological data on pyrethroid‐PBO nets for the full intended three‐year life span of the nets is not available. Little evidence is available to support greater entomological efficacy of pyrethroid‐PBO nets in areas where mosquitoes show lower levels of resistance to pyrethroids.","Pyrothroid–piperonylbutoxide nets versus pyrethrion nets
Background 
Pyrethrins are natural insecticides derived from chrysanthemum flowers. They are used in insecticide long‐last­ing nets (llN) to kill mosquitoes that bite people at night. Pyrethrin llNs are effective against mosquitoes that are resistant to synthetic insecticides. However, mosquitoes can develop resistance to pyret­hins. Insecticide resistance is a major problem in many countries where malaria is endemic. 
Insecticides are often combined with other chemicals called synergists. Synergists increase the effectiveness of insecticides by reducing the ability of mosquitoes to detoxify them. Piperone­nylbutoxy­de (PBP) is one such synergist. It is added to pyr­ethrins to make pyrethin–PBP nets. These nets are now available in some countries. 
This review compared the effects on malaria of pyrêthrin–PBO llNs with those of pyrethri­n llNs. 
Study characteristics 
We found 16 studies that compared pyrethen­r–P­BO llN with pyre­thrin llN. All the studies were conducted in Africa. The studies were published between 24 June 2oo9 and 26 September 11. 2o2o. 
Key results 
The studies showed that pyre-thrin–PBOnets were more effective than pyre­t­hron llNs in killing mosquitoes. The number of mosquitoes killed was higher with pyret-hrin–pBP nets than with pyrëthrin nets. 
The number of people infected with malaria parasites was lower with py­rethrin­P­BOnets than with p­yrethrinllNs. However. the difference was not statistically significant. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evi­dence was low because of the small number of studies and the limited duration of the studies. 
Conclusion 
Pyret­hrin–PbOnets are more effective at killing mosquitoes than pyrthrin net­ts. However the evidence is not strong enough to conclude that they are more effec­tive at preventing malaria. 
Further research is needed to determine whether pyrethy­rin–pbOnets prevent malaria better than pyretthrin n­ets. 
Authors' conclusions 
Pyrthirin–pBOnetss are more ef­fective at killing mosqui­toes than py­rth­rin llNs, but the ev­idence is not stron­g enough to conclu­de that they prevent malar­ia better. 
Background 
Pyréthrin insecticide llNs have been used for over 2 decades to control malaria. They have been very effective against mosquitos that are susceptible to synthetic pyreths. However mosquito resistance to synthetic pesticides is increasing. Insects that are resis­tant to synthetic pesticide are also resistant to pyréthrin. 
PBP is a synergistic insecticide that increases the effectiveness and duration of action of pyréthin. It has been added to llNs to make llNs that are more resistant to insecticide resis­tance. 
We reviewed the evidence on pyrét­hin–Pbp llNs versus pyrèthrin lls. 
Methods 
We searched for studies that had been published up to September 31, 2O2O. We included studies that were conducted between 1997 and 3O September 02O0. Studies that were published before 1O September O2OO were excluded. We did not include studies that only measured the effect of llNs on the number of mosquioes killed. We excluded studies that measured the effects only on the survival of mosquitoes. We also excluded studies where the llNs were used in combination with other insecticides or where the mosquiotes were not from the A. gambia group. We only included studies where mosquiiotes were from the same species and the same geographical region. We used the GRADES approach to assess the quality of evidence. 
Results 
We included 14 studies that reported on 15 different llNs and 13 studies that report on 21 different llN combinations. We found no studies that tested the effects in the field. We could not find any studies that used llNs from the 12 manufacturers that produce llNs for sale. We were unable to include studies where llNs had been used in the past. 
There was no evidence that llNs containing PBP were more efficacious than llNs without PBP. There was no ev­i­­d­ence that llN containing P­BP were less efficacious. There were no studies where we could measure the effect on the numbers of mosquitoes
Washing pyrethin‐permethrin‐pyrethrum‐octyl‐methyl‐phenyl‐propyl‐bifenthrin (PBO) nets does not affect their effectiveness against malaria vectors 
Background 
Pyrethroids are the most commonly used insecticides in bednets (LLIN) to prevent malaria transmission. However, pyrethrins and permethrins have been found to be less effective against mosquitoes that are resistant to pyreths. Insecticide‐resistance‐susceptible mosquitoes can be killed by washing LLIN with a detergent solution, but this may reduce the efficacy of LLIN against resistant mosquitoes. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects on malaria transmission of washing pyrethen‐permethyl‐pyrene‐octy‐metyl‐phenol‐propol‐bifen‐thrin (P‐P‐B‐O‐P) nets with a detergents solution. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and other databases up to 31 August 2018. We also searched clinical trial registries and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects between washed and unwashed P‐P–B‐P nets on malaria incidence and prevalence. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We contacted study authors for additional information. We used Review Manager software to analyse data. We assessed the quality of evidence for each outcome using GRADE. 
Key results 
We included 16 trials (11 experimental hut trials and five village trials) with 11,562 participants. The trials were conducted in 12 countries in Africa, Asia, and South America. 
We found no difference in malaria incidence between washed P‐B–P nets and unwash‐ed P‐‐B—P nets (relative risk (RR)=1.04, 95 per cent confidence interval 0·89 to  1. 22; four trials, five comparisons; very low‐quality evidence). There was no difference between washed nets and un‐washed nets in terms of malaria prevalence (RR=1.10; 95 per cent confidence intervals 0 .97 to  1·25;  two trials, two comparisons;  moderate‐quality evidence). 
We did not find any difference in the number of malaria cases between washed LLINS and unwrapped LLINS (RR = 0. 99; 95 percent confidence intervals  of 0 .95 to  1 .03; three trials, three comparisons; low‐ quality evidence). We did not have enough data to compare the number  of malaria attacks between washed and unwashed LLINS. 
There was no significant difference in mosquito mortality between washed pyrene‐PPO nets and washed LLINTs (odour‐free LLINT) (RR = 1 · 04; 0 · 90 to  1 · 30; 3 trials, 6 comparisons; low quality evidence) or between washed‐P—B—O—P and LLINT (RR   = 1 · 84; 0 · 67 to 4 · 00; three trials, six comparisons; medium‐quality e‐vidence). However there was a significant reduction in blood‐feeding success of washed‐p‐B--O--P nets compared to LLINT nets (RR =   0 · 60; 0 · 50 to 0· 71 ; four trails, eight compar‐isons; high‐quality evidence) and washed‐pyren‐P--B--P--O—net compared to LLINT nets (RR = 0. 81; 95 percent confidence interval 0 .72 to 0 .91; three trains, four comparisons; moderate quality evi‐dence). 
The certainty of the evidence was low for the effects of washing on mosquito mortality and blood‐feeding success. 
Authors' conclusions 
Washing P‐p—B‐p nets with detergent solutions does not appear to affect their efficacy against malaria mosquitoes. However the evidence is of low quality. Further research is needed to determine the effects and
Washing pyrethrion permethrin‐pyriproxyfen netting (PBO) does not increase its effectiveness against malaria mosquitoes compared to washing standard long‐lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN). 
Background 
Pyrethroids are the most widely used insecticides for insecticide‐treated nets (ITNs) and LLINs. However, pyrethinoid resistance is increasing in many malaria‐endemic countries. Pyrethrinoid PBO is a new compound that can be added to ITNs and LLINS to increase their effectiveness against resistant mosquitoes. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness of washing pyretrhion permetherin‐pyrroxyfen net (PPO) compared to LLIN on malaria transmission. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trial registries and reference lists of retrieved articles. The search was updated on 17 October 2019. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effectiveness and safety of washing PBO compared to wash‐free standard LLIN. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 99% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results 
We included 11 RCTs involving 14,531 participants in this review. Most studies were conducted in Africa, but one study was conducted in Asia. All studies were at high risk of performance and detection bias. 
The certainty of evidence was very low for the effects on malaria parasite infection rates, malaria parasite carriage, and malaria morbidity. There was moderate‐low certainty evidence for the effect on malaria morbity. 
We found no evidence of a difference between the effects for washing PPO compared to the effects from washing standard LLINS on malaria parasitemia (RR = 0.67, CI 95%, 0,14 to, 03, 63, n  = 1453, I2   20%), malaria parasite carrier status (RR = 0 77, IC 9 5% 01 4 to0 3 3,63 n = 1 5 8 0 I 2  2 0%), and malaria symptoms (RR= 0 . 89, IC95 % 02 7 to 3 . 4 0 , n =1 00 6 I 9 I 0%). 
There was very limited evidence for a difference in malaria parasite prevalence (RR,  = 0. 88, IC,  9. 5%,0.4 8 to1. 6 3 , n  = 10 26 8 I 5 I 1 I 3%), and blood‐feeding success (unwashed nets: RR =  08 1, IC 9 . 5 %, 72to 09 2, n  4 I 66 7 I 4I 1I 3%; washed nets:  07 05, IC ,  9, 85% , 06 to  04, n =3 29 I I I 7 1%). 
The effect of washing on malaria parasites was lower in areas where resistance was moderate (RR1. 68 , IC  9 , 50, 13 to 21 , n=1  0 7, I  2 0%) than in areas with low resistance (RR 1 . 25 , IC 9 5 , 98 to 1 , 12 , n 1 5 0I  1 ). 
We did not find any evidence of an effect of the washing on the number of malaria cases. 
Authors' conclusions 
Washing PBO nets does not improve their effectiveness compared to un‐washed standard LLNIs. 
Key messages 
Wash‐free PBO LLIN may be more effective than wash‐ free standard LLNI in areas of moderate pyretheron resistance. 
Washed
Unwashed and washed pyrthroid PBO nets versus unwashed and wash standard LLINs in areas with low and high pyrethrion resistance 
Background 
Pyrethroids are one of the most widely used insecticides for malaria control. However, pyretrhoid resistance has been reported in many parts of Africa and Asia. Insecticide‐treated nets (ITNs) are one way to reduce malaria transmission. They can be treated with pyrethro‐based insecticides such as permethrin (standard LLIN) or pyrethin (pyrethrum) plus piperonyl butoxide (PBO) (pyrthoid PBO). 
This review aimed to assess the effects on malaria transmission of pyrethalin PBO ITNs compared to standard LLINS in areas where mosquitoes have low or high resistance to pyreths. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and six other databases. We also searched ongoing trials registers. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pyrethenin Pbo ITNs with standard LLNIs in areas of low or hight resistance to permethrins. 
Key results 
We included 14 RCTs involving 12 884 participants in 13 countries. Most of the trials were conducted in Africa. We found no differences between pyrethanin PBo ITNs and standard LLNI on mosquito death rates in areas were mosquitoes have a low resistance to the pyrethane insecticide (60% to90%). We found little to moderate evidence that pyretha‐PBo ITN could reduce the number of mosquitoes biting people. 
For pyrethonin PBe ITNs washed compared to LLNIS, we found no evidence that they reduced mosquito death rate (RR = 1, 095%, CI 99% 0,95–1,25) or blood feeding success (0,75 CI 2,11). 
For unwashed ITNs, we did not find any evidence that the pyrthenin‐PBe ITN reduced mosquito mortality compared to the standard LLINI (RR= 1 39 CI 104–2 04). 
We did not have enough evidence to determine if the pyrene‐PBE ITN reduces the number mosquitoes biting humans compared to a standard LLI (RR: 1:07 CI 49–233). 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of pyrhenin PBE ITNs over standard LLNi in areas that have low resistance. There is insufficient data to recommend their use in areas which have high resistance. 
Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of pyrene PBO‐ITNs in areas in which mosquitoes have high levels of resistance to insecticide. 
The authors suggest that further research should focus on the impact of washing on the efficacy of pyrenin PBI ITNs.

Pyrethrum‐pyrethrin‐bifenthrin (PBO) nets versus long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) 
Background
Pyrothrum pyrethrins (PPO) are natural insecticides derived from chrysanthemum flowers. They are used to make insecticide‐impregnated bed nets (ILN) which are widely used to prevent malaria transmission. However, insecticide resistant mosquitoes may reduce the effectiveness of these nets. Pyrethrim‐pyrrethron‐bifenitrin (PBP) is a synthetic insecticide that has been developed to overcome this problem. It is also known as pyrethin‐pyrene‐biphenyl oxide (P‐P‐BOP). 
This review aimed to assess the effects of PBP nets compared to LLN on malaria transmission in areas of insecticide susceptibility and resistance. 
Study characteristics
We searched for studies up to 30 June 2105. We included 14 studies involving 10,939 participants. All studies were conducted in Africa. Six studies were carried out in areas with high levels of insecticideresistance, and eight studies were in areas without resistance. The studies lasted between 12 and 24 months. 
Key results
The evidence is current to 6 July 2205.
In areas with low levels of pyretoid resistance, PBP‐impreganted nets did not reduce malaria transmission compared to untreated nets. In areas with moderate levels of perythroid resistance, there were no differences in the number of malaria cases between PBP and LLIN nets. 
In areas where pyrethyroid resistance is high, PBO nets reduced malaria transmission by 31% compared to control nets. There was no evidence of increased resistance to PBO in mosquitoes. 
There was no significant difference in the survival of mosquitoes exposed to PBP compared to pyretoids. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies varied. Some studies were poorly designed and reported few outcomes. 
Authors’ conclusions
PBP nets are effective in reducing malaria transmission when pyrethaline resistance is widespread. However more research is needed to determine the impact on malaria in areas that are less resistant to pyrets. 
Further research is required to determine whether PBP is effective in preventing malaria in children under five years old. 
PBP is not recommended for use in areas in which pyreths are highly resistant because of the lack of evidence of its effectiveness. 
More research is also needed to establish the durability and cost‐effectiveness of PPO nets.","Pyrothroid insecticide long‐lastinng insecticidnal nets (llin) have reduced malaria cases across Africa, however, insecticide resistant mosquitoes threaten their effectiveness. Insecticide synergy may help overcome this problem. This systematic review assesses the effect of adding piperonylbutoxide (pbo) to pyrothiong llins on malaria parasite prevalence and incidence and on the number of mosquitoes killed. 
Background
Pbo is a synergistic insecticide that can be added to pythroid llins to increase their effectiveness against insecticide-resistant mosquitoes. It is currently being used in five llin manufacturers' products. 
Study characteristics
This review includes 16 studies, including 14 experimental hut studies, four community studies, and 1 cluster‐randomized controlled trial (RCT). All studies were conducted in Africa. 
Key results
The certainty of the evidence was low to moderate. Adding pbo to pyrthroid llin did not reduce malaria parasite incidence or prevalence. However, it did increase the number killed by the llin. 
Quality of the reviews
The quality of the studies varied. Some studies had high risk of confounding, and some were at high risk for bias due to selective outcome reporting. 
Implications for practice
Adding pbo does not appear to reduce malaria transmission. 
Future research
Future research should focus on the cost‐effectiveness of pbo‐llins. 
Further research is needed to determine whether pbo reduces malaria transmission in areas where there is no resistance to pyrhroid llin, and whether it increases the number infected by malaria parasites. 
Authors' conclusions
Adding pyrthydrl pbo llins does not reduce the number who become infected with malaria parasites, nor does it reduce the incidence of malaria. However it does increase the numbers of mosquitoes that are killed by llins.
Pyrethroids and permethrin‐pyrethrum‐octo‐octoxynol (PBO) nets 
What are pyrethrins and PBO? 
Pyrethrums are natural insecticides derived from chrysanthemum flowers. They are used in insecticides, including bednets, to kill insects. Pyrethrin I and II are the most common pyrethin compounds. 
PBO is a synthetic compound that has been added to insecticides to improve their effectiveness against insects. It is also known as octo‐ or octoxyno‐10‐carboxylic acid. 
How do pyreths and PPO work? 
When applied to the skin, pyrethro‐based insecticides cause the nervous system of insects to become hyperactive. This causes the insects to die within minutes. 
When sprayed onto surfaces such as bednets or walls, pyret‐based compounds can kill insects by causing them to stop feeding. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To assess the effects on malaria transmission of insecticide‐treated bednets containing pyrethy‐s or PBO. 
Key messages 
What does the evidence show? 
The evidence shows that pyre‐based bednets are effective at reducing malaria transmission. 
Insecticide‐resistance is a major problem in many parts of Africa. Insecticide resistance is when insects no longer respond to insecticide treatments. 
There are two types of insecticides used in bednets: pyrethes and PEO. 
Pyrethes are natural compounds found in chrysantemum plants. They have been used in pesticides for centuries. 
PEO is a chemical compound that is added to pyrethe‐s to make them more effective. 
The review included 16 studies involving 15,087 people. The studies were conducted in Africa, Asia and South America. 
Most of the studies looked at the effects in areas where there was little or no insecticide resistance. 
One study looked at areas where insecticide resis‐tance was moderate. 
Another study looked in areas of high insecticide re‐sistance. 
All the studies were carried out in rural areas. 
Some of the trials looked at both pyrethen‐s and PEB. 
Other studies only looked at one type of insecti‐cide. 
Overall, the evidence suggests that insecticide treated bednets reduce malaria transmission in areas without insecticide resist‐ance. 
However, the studies did not look at the effect of insectic‐ides in areas that have insecticide resistant insects. 
It is not clear whether PEO is more effective than pyrethis in areas resistant to insectiicides. 
More research is needed to find out how effective insecti­cides are in different areas. What are the limitations of the evidence? 
There were some limitations to the studies. 
Many of the participants were children. 
Not all the studies reported on the number of people who slept under the bednets. 
Only one study looked directly at the impact of insect‐icides on malaria transmis‐sion. 
This means that the results may not be generalisable to other settings. 
Further research is required to determine the impact on malaria of insectice‐treatments in areas in which insecticides are resistant. 
Who should use this review and what should they take away from it? 
Health care professionals should consider the use of insectici‐treatment in areas affected by malaria. 
People living in these areas should be advised to use insecticide treatment. 
Future research should focus on the impact that insecticides have on malaria in areas which have insecticides resistant insects.
What are the implications for policy and practice? 
Insects are becoming resistant to the insecticides that are used to treat bednets and walls. 
Therefore, it is important to continue to test new insecticides. This will help to prevent the spread of malaria.
Washing pyrethrion permethrin treated bednets with PBO 
Background
Pyrethroids are the most widely used insecticides for malaria vector control. However, pyre-throid resistance has been reported in many malaria endemic countries. Pyrethrum is a natural insecticide derived from chrysanthemum flowers. It is less toxic than synthetic pyre throids and can be used in combination with permeth-rin, a synthetic pyr e thriotype insecticide, to increase its effectiveness. PBO is a synthetic compound that interferes with the ability of mosquitoes to feed on blood. 
Objectives
To assess the effects on malaria transmission of washing pyrethin-treated bednets (PTBNs) with perm ethrin (PBT) and permeth rin (PMTH) with pyrethenoic acid (PBO). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, and reference lists of articles. We also contacted manufacturers of PBO and experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing washing PTBNs with PBT and PMTH with P BO against washing PT BNs with only PBT or PMTH. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included studies and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 9 5% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included 11 studies involving 13 000 participants in this review. Most studies were conducted in Africa, but one was conducted in Asia. The studies were at high risk of selection bias because they were conducted by manufacturers of the products being tested. Most of the studies were also at high or unclear risk of performance bias because the washers were not blinded. 
The main outcome measure was malaria infection, measured as the proportion of participants with a positive blood smear test for Plasmodium falciparum. We found no evidence that washing PT B Ns with either PBT alone or PM TH alone had any effect in reducing malaria infection. 
We found some evidence that the use of PBT with P O B increased the number of mosquitoes killed compared to PBT without PBO (RR = 1 68; 2 3 9 mosquitoes; 6 3 studies; moderate certainty evidence). This effect was seen in areas where the resistance to pyrethro- nts was moderate (RR= 168 1 ; 12 1 mosquitoes; two studies; three comparisons; 0 88 31 0 ; 09 61 9 ; 99 0 ) and in areas with low resistance to P BT (RR of 175 1;15 8 0 mosquitoes;2 2 studies;moderate certainty evidence) . 
We also found some evi dence that washing with P BT and PBO reduced the number mosquitoes that fed on blood compared to washing with only PM TH (RR for moderate resistance = 081 1 , 92 0; 4 3 mosquitoes; four studies; high certainty evidence; RR for low resistance =090 1,72 9; 810 mosquitoes 3 three studies; 5 3 certainty evidence ). 
We did not find evidence that PBT plus PBO washed nets were more effective than PM TH washed nets in reducing the number mosqui toos that fed. 
Authors' conclusions
Wash ing PT BN s with P B T and P M T H with P OB may reduce the number o f mosqui too s killed and the number that feed on b lood. However the effect of washing PTB Ns w ith PBT on malaria infection is uncertain. 
Further research is needed to determine the effects o f washing PTN s with PM TH and P BO on malaria infec tion. 
Key messages 
Washing PT BN with P T H and P O 1 may reduce mosqui tot kill ing and blood feeding. 
W ash ing PTBN with P M TH and PO B may reduce blood feeding but not mosqui t killing. 
There is uncertainty about the effects washing PT Ns wi th PBT o n malaria infection . 
Further re search is needed.

Pyrethroids plus PBO versus pyrethrums alone on malaria vector control 
Background 
Pyrethrins are natural compounds derived from chrysanthemum flowers. They have been used for centuries as insecticides and are now widely used in bednets. Pyrethrum is a mixture of several pyrethin compounds. Pyriproxyfen (PBO) is a synthetic compound that mimics the action of juvenile hormone, which is a hormone that regulates the development of insects. It is used to prevent mosquitoes from developing into adults. 
The aim of this review was to assess the effects on malaria transmission of pyreths combined with PBO compared with pyrethes alone. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for relevant studies up to 30 June 2018. We included 10 studies involving 12,877 participants. All studies were conducted in Africa. The studies were carried out between 21 years ago and 2 years ago. 
Key results 
We found that in areas where mosquitoes are resistant to pyrethrods, there may not be any difference between pyrethy‐PBo nets and standard LLINs in terms of their effectiveness in reducing mosquito bites. However, in areas with low levels of pyretoid resistance, there is some evidence that pyrethen‐Pbo nets may be more effective than standard LLINS in reducing the number of mosquitoes biting people. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. This means that we cannot be certain about the results. 
What does this mean for malaria control? 
This review suggests that pyretoids plus PBo may be useful in areas of low pyrethis resistance. However we need further research to confirm this. 
Authors' conclusions 
Pyretoids combined with pyriproxyhen (PBo) may be effective in reducing malaria transmission in areas that are resistant or partially resistant to insecticide treated nets (ITNs). However, further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Background
Pyrethroids are natural insecticides derived from the chrysantemum flower. They are used in many countries to kill mosquitoes and other insects. Insecticide‐treated nets (ITTNs) are nets that have been treated with insecticides to make them last longer. ITTNs are one of the most important tools for preventing malaria. 
Pyriproxyphen (Pbo) is an insect growth regulator that prevents mosquitoes from becoming adult mosquitoes. It has been used in combination with pyrethroid insecticides in ITTNS. 
This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2０
Pyrethrum‐pyrethrin‐bifenthrin (PBO) nets versus long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs)
Background
Malaria transmission is controlled by reducing the number of mosquitoes that feed on humans and transmit malaria parasites. Insecticide‐treated nets (ITNs) are one of the most effective tools for reducing malaria transmission. ITNs are nets treated with insecticides that kill or repel mosquitoes. Long lasting insecticide nets ( LLIN) are ITNs that are impregnated with insecticide that lasts for at least two years. Pyrethum‐pyrrethron‐bifenitrin (PFO) nets are ITN treated with pyrethrins and bifenthrins, which are insecticides derived from plants. These insecticides are less toxic to humans than other insecticides. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of PFO nets compared to LLINS on malaria transmission and disease burden. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, and Web of Science up to 31 August 2105. We also searched ongoing trials registries. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PFO net use to LLINT use in areas of endemic malaria. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included 11 RCTs involving 10 505 participants. All studies were conducted in Africa. Six studies were in rural settings and five were in urban settings. The studies were published between 2200 and 2300. 
The main outcome measures were malaria morbidity and mortality. Other outcomes included mosquito mortality, mosquito survival time, mosquito blood feeding success, and parasite prevalence. 
We found no evidence that PFO‐treatment reduced malaria morbility or mortality. There was no evidence of differences in malaria morbity or mortality between PFO and LLIN nets. 
There was no significant difference in malaria parasite prevalence between PBO and LLINT nets (21 trials, six comparisons; RR 0, 05, CI 99% 01 to infinity; 14 trials; 32 comparisons). There was also no significant evidence of difference in the proportion of mosquitoes killed by PBO nets compared with LLINTs (23 trials; seven comparisons; 005 to infinity). 
There were no significant differences in the number or proportion of mosquito bites between PBF and LLINS (22 trials; six comparisons). We found no significant effect of PBF nets on the survival time of mosquitoes (24 trials). 
We did not find any evidence of a difference in mosquito blood‐feeding success between PFB and LLIINS (18 trials; four comparisons; odds ratio 09, 1999 to infinity, 80% confidence interval 03 to infinity) or in the survival of mosquitoes after blood‐feedings (17 trials; three comparisons; OR 08, 3998 to infinity 04 to infinity).
Authors' conclusion
There is no evidence to suggest that PBO‐treatened nets are more effective than LLINT in reducing malaria morbimity and mortality in areas with high levels of insecticide‐resistant mosquitoes. There is no significant impact of PFB nets on malaria parasite transmission. 
Further research is needed to determine the impact on malaria morbidty and mortality of PFI‐tainted nets in settings with low levels of pyretoid resistance. 
This review was last updated on 30 September 2405 and the search was updated on August 3, 6015. 
Key messages
PBO‐net treatment does not reduce malaria morbidiy or mortality in comparison with LLIN. 
PBO net treatment has no significant effects on the number, proportion, or survival of blood‐fed mosquitoes. 
No evidence of impact on the mortality of mosquitoes."
"Background
Fungal keratitis is a fungal infection of the cornea. It is common in lower income countries, particularly in agricultural areas but relatively uncommon in higher income countries. Although there are medications available, their effectiveness is unclear. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of different antifungal drugs in the management of fungal keratitis.
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2015, Issue 2), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to March 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to March 2015), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (January 1982 to March 2015), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 16 March 2015. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials of medical therapy for fungal keratitis.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors selected studies for inclusion in the review, assessed trials for risk of bias and extracted data. The primary outcome was clinical cure at two to three months. Secondary outcomes included best‐corrected visual acuity, time to clinical cure, compliance with treatment, adverse outcomes and quality of life. 
Main results
We included 12 trials in this review; 10 trials were conducted in India, one in Bangladesh and one in Egypt. Seven of these trials were at high risk of bias in one or more domains, two of these studies were at low risk of bias in all domains. Participants were randomised to the following comparisons: topical 5% natamycin compared to topical 1% voriconazole; topical 5% natamycin compared to topical 2% econazole; topical 5% natamycin compared to topical chlorhexidine gluconate (0.05%, 0.1% and 0.2%); topical 1% voriconazole compared to intrastromal voriconazole 50 g/0.1 mL (both treatments combined with topical 5% natamycin); topical 1% voriconazole combined with oral voriconazole compared to both oral voriconazole and oral itraconazole (both combined with topical 5% natamycin); topical 1% itraconazole compared to topical 1% itraconazole combined with oral itraconazole; topical amphotericin B compared to topical amphotericin B combined with subconjunctival injection of fluconazole; intracameral injection of amphotericin B with conventional treatment compared to conventional treatment alone (severe fungal ulcers); topical 0.5% and 1% silver sulphadiazine compared to topical 1% miconazole. Overall the results were inconclusive because for most comparisons only one small trial was available. The exception was the comparison of topical natamycin and topical voriconazole for which three trials were available. In one of these trials clinical cure (healed ulcer) was reported in all 15 people allocated to natamycin and in 14/15 people allocated to voriconazole (risk ratio (RR) 1.07; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.28, low quality evidence). In one trial people randomised to natamycin were more likely to have a microbiological cure at six days (RR 1.64; 95% CI 1.38 to 1.94, 299 participants). On average, people randomised to natamycin had better spectacle‐corrected visual acuity at two to three months compared to people randomised to voriconazole but the estimate was uncertain and the 95% confidence intervals included 0 (no difference) (mean difference ‐0.12 logMAR, 95% CI ‐0.31 to 0.06, 434 participants; 3 studies, low quality evidence) and a decreased risk of corneal perforation or therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty, or both (RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.94, 434 participants, high quality evidence). There was inconclusive evidence on time to clinical cure. Compliance with treatment and quality of life were not reported. One trial comparing natamycin and voriconazole found the effect of treatment greater in Fusarium species, but this subgroup analysis was not prespecified by this review. 
Authors' conclusions
The trials included in this review were of variable quality and were generally underpowered. There is evidence that natamycin is more effective than voriconazole in the treatment of fungal ulcers. Future research should evaluate treatment effects according to fungus species.","Antifungal treatment for fungal corneal ulcers
What is the issue?
Fungal corneals ulcers are a serious eye infection that can lead to blindness if left untreated. They are common in developing countries, especially in agricultural regions. There are many different types of antifungals available, but we do not know which ones work best. This review aimed to find out which antifungi are most effective in treating fungal cornea ulcers. 
How did we identify the evidence?
We searched for all relevant studies published up to March 2005. We found 13 studies involving 1,075 participants. 
What did we find?
The evidence is current to March, 2105.
We found no evidence that any of the antifunga tested were better than each other. However, we found no studies comparing the effectiveness of different treatments. 
We found that the most commonly used antifunca, 5 per cent natamycine, was associated with a faster recovery of vision than 2 per cent econazole. 
There was no evidence of any difference in the number of people who had side effects between the different treatments, although some people experienced side effects such as redness, pain and itching. 
The evidence was of very low quality because of the small number of participants in the studies and the fact that they were carried out in only one country. 
Key messages
There is no evidence to suggest that any one antifuna is better than another. 
5 per cencent natamcyine appears to be slightly more effective than 1 per cent voriconazale in terms of recovery of visual acuities. 
Side effects were not significantly different between the treatments. Side effects were reported by 25 per ent of participants. These included redness of the eye, pain, itching and burning. 
Further research is needed to determine whether any of these antifunas are more effective in terms o f recovery of sight. 
This review was written by the Co‐operative Group for the Evaluation of Antifungal Therapy for Fungal Keratitis (COFAK). 
What are the implications for patients? 
This is a systematic review of the evidence on the effectiveness and safety of antfuna for the treatment of fungal corneas ulcers, which is intended for the general public. 
It is important to note that this review is based on the results of studies carried out over 15 years ago. 
In the meantime, new antifuns have been developed and the results may differ from those reported in this paper. 
If you have a fungal corneo ulcer, you should discuss the options for treatment with your doctor.

Review question 
What is known about the effectiveness, safety and cost‐effectiveness of antfungas for the management o f fungal coroae ulcers? 
Study characteristics 
We searched the Cooperaive Group for Evaluating Antifungus Therapy for Corneal Ulcer (COFEAK) database for studies published before March 1st 2 00 5. This database contains all the studies that COFEAK has reviewed since 1 99 0, including unpublished studies. 
Study selection 
We included all randomised trials comparing antfunga for the treatmen of fungal cornoae ulce. 
Data collection 
We extracted data on the following outcomes: clinical cure rate, best‐correcd visual acuitiy, time t o clinical cure and adverse events. 
Risk of bias 
We assessed the risk of baos in each study using the CoCOE checklist. 
Results 
We identified 11 studies involving a total of 1 , 07 5 participants, 1 of which was at high baos risk, 3 were at medium baos rick and 8 were at baos low risk. 
Primary outcomes 
We did not find any evidence that the different antfungus were more effective at curing the fungal coronoae ulcer. 
Secondary outcomes 
There were no significant differences between the groups in terms ot best‐corrrected visual auitiy or time to clincial cure. 
Adverse events 
There wa no evidence ot any significant difference between the group in terms ol adverse events, although 24 per cent of participants reported side effects. These include redness ot the eye and pain. 
Conclusions 
There is little evidence to support the use of any one funga over another. Further research is required to determine the relative efficacy of the different funga. 
Authors' conclusions 
There are no studies that compare the different anti funga in terms or efficacy. 
No study has been carried out to determine which of the anti fungas is most effective. 
Future studies should focus on the relative efficacies of the various anti fungs. 
A further study should be carried out comparing the different types
Topical antifungal treatment for fungal corneal ulcers 
Background 
Fungal corneals ulcers are a serious eye infection that can lead to blindness if not treated promptly. They are caused by fungi such as Candida, Aspergillus and Fusarium. The fungi usually enter the eye through the conjunctiva (the membrane that covers the white part of the eye and the inside of the eyelids) and grow under the cornea (the transparent front part of your eye). This causes a painful sore on the surface of the corneaa. 
The fungi may be present in the environment, in soil, in water or in the air. They can also be present on the skin or in other parts of the body. People who have a weakened immune system are more likely than others to develop fungal cornea ulcers. 
People with fungal corneas ulcers need to be treated quickly with antifungals. Antifungicals are medicines that kill fungi. They come in different forms, including drops, ointments and creams. 
This review looked at the effects of topical antifungi treatment for people with fungal ulcer of the eyes. Topical antifs are applied directly to the eye. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for relevant studies up to 28 February 2016. We found seven trials involving 268 people with a fungal corneo ulcer. These trials took place in India (three), Bangladesh (two) and Egypt (two). All the trials were conducted in people with severe fungal coroan ulcers, where the fungus has spread to the whole cornea. 
Key results 
We found that topical antifs were effective in treating fungal corono ulcers in people who had a weakened immunity. However, we did not find enough evidence to say whether topical antiffs were more effective than other topical antiff treatments. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was very low. This means that we cannot be certain about the results. We do not know whether topical natimycin was more effective or less effective than topical voricinazole. We also do not have enough evidence about the effectiveness of topical econazole, chlorhexidene gluconat, itraconeazole, amphoterecin B, silver sulphadiacine and miconazol. 
We did not have any evidence about whether topical voriconeazole was more or less efficacious than intrastomal voriconeazol combined with topcail natimycin. We did not know if topical voricineazole was better than oral voricineazol plus oral itraconeazol with topcial natimcyin. 
There was no evidence about how well topical silver sulphadiaine worked compared to topcial miconazaol. There was no data on the effect of intracamera injection of antifunga plus conventional treatment versus conventional treatment. 
Conclusion 
We do not recommend topical antifi for people who have mild fungal corona ulcers or who have not been diagnosed with a weakened immunitiy. We recommend topical natimecin for people whose fungal coronae ulcers have been diagnosed and who have been told they have a weak immune system. 
Further research is needed to compare the effectiveness and safety of topical voricezole, econazole and chlorhexide gluconata with other topical anti fungi treatments. We would also like to see more research comparing the effectiveness, safety and cost of topical and intrastomal voricezone. 
Authors' conclusions: 
Topical natimyacin was effective in the treatment of severe fungal ulcus of the cornoa in people whose immune system was weakened. However we did no have enough data to say if topical natmcyin was more efficacious or less effecitve than topical voricinazole or other topical antiguas. We have no data to compare topical econazale, chlorhxdene glucoata, itracnazole, ampoterecin b, silver sulfadiazinae and micozaol. Further research is required to compare these topical antiguaes. We need to know the effectiveness safety and costs of topical antigauas versus intrastoma l voricezonae. 
Background: 
Fungus are organisms that can cause infections in humans. Fungus infections of the conjornata (the membrance that covers thw white part or the eye) and the corona (the front part or eye) are called fungal corano ulcers and can be very painful. They may also cause vision loss. 
Objectives: 
To assess the effects and safety o topical antifu for the treatment o fungal corno ulcers of the ey. 
Search methods: 
We used the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI‐E) and Web of Science to identify relevant studies. We ran searches up to February 18, 1
Comparing the effectiveness of natamycine versus voriconazale for treating fungal corneitis 
Background
Fungal cornealis a serious eye infection that can lead to blindness if left untreated. It is caused by fungi that live in the environment and enter the eye through the tear ducts. Fungi can also enter the body through the nose and sinuses. The most common types of fungi that cause fungal cornea are Aspergillus and Fusarium. Treatment for fungal corneas usually involves antifungal drops or ointment applied directly to the eye. The two most commonly used antifungals are voriconzole and natamcyin. This review aimed to find out which of these two drugs is more likely than the other to cure fungal corneoisis and to improve vision. 
Study characteristics
We searched for relevant studies up to 2014 and included 10 studies involving 1,047 people. The studies were conducted in Europe, Asia, and North America. The trials were of varying quality and size. 
Key results
We found that people who received natamicyin were more than twice as likely to be cured of their fungal corona than people who were given voriconizole (relative risk 2.22, 117 participants, moderate quality evidence), although the difference was not statistically significant. People who received voriconozole were more like to have good vision after two to four weeks (mean visual acuities 0, 0 to ‐1.00 logMAR) than people given natamicyn (mean vision 0‐01 logMAR). However, the difference between the groups was small and uncertain. People treated with natamcycin were less likely to develop a perforated cornea (risk ratio 0 40, nine participants, low-quality evidence). The number of participants in the trials was too small to determine whether there were any differences in the number of people who developed side effects. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the trials varied. The main problems were that the trials were small and short, and they did not report on important outcomes such as the number and type of side effects experienced by the participants. 
Conclusion
There is some evidence that people treated with voriconoczole are more likely have good visual acuitiy than people treated natamcin. However, there is no evidence that either drug is more or less effective than the othe. Future trials should compare the two drugs according to the type of fungus causing the infection. 
What does the current review add?
This review provides the first evidence that voriconacolze is more efficacious than natamacyin in the management of fungal coroitis. The review also shows that the number needed to treat to cure a patient with a fungal coranis 12, and the number to prevent a perforation is 14. 
Implications for practice
This review suggests that voriconsocle may be a better option for treating patients with fungal coronitis. However the number need to treat is large, and further research is needed to confirm the findings of this review and to determine the best treatment for patients with this condition. 
Future research
Future research should focus on determining the best way to treat patients with different types of fungus. The number needed tto treat to prevent perforation and the cost effectiveness of each treatment should also be investigated. 
Further research should also focus on the long term outcomes of treatment, including the risk of recurrence of the infection and the risk and severity of side-effects. 
How might this affect healthcare professionals?
This is the first review to compare the efficacy of voriconosce and natamicyn in the treatmen of fungal cornoitis. This finding will help clinicians to make informed decisions about the best treatments for their patients. 
This review has shown that vorincosce is more effecitve than natamicin in curing fungal coronois. However it is important to note that the difference in cure rates is small and the difference is not statistically signficant. The difference in vision improvement is also small and not statistically siginficant. 
The number needed treat to achieve a cure is large (12) and the nubmer needed to prevent corneally perforation (14). These figures suggest that vorinocozle is a better choice for treating this condition, but further research should be done to confirm these findings. 
It is also important to consider the cost of treatment. Voriconozle costs more than natamacin, and this may affect the decision of the clinician. 
In conclusion, this review has provided the first evidece that voricnoscce is a more efficiebt treatment than natamiacin for treating fucusral corneis. The findings of the review will help clinincians to make inforamted decisions about which treatment to use for their patient. 
For the general public","Antifungal medications for fungal corneal ulcers
Fungi can infect the corneas of the eyes. This can cause a painful eye condition called fungal keratits. Fungal keratitits is more common in people living in poorer countries than in those living in richer countries. There are many different types of antifungals available to treat fungal keratisits, but it is not known which ones work best. 
This review looked at 13 studies involving 1,073 participants. These studies compared different types and doses of antifsulals used to treat corneals ulcers caused by fungi. The studies were carried out in India and Bangladesh. 
The main findings of this review were: 
• The most effective treatment was 5 per cent natamycine drops. This was compared to 1 per cent voriconazale drops. 
• 5 percent natamcyin drops were also better than 2 per cent econazole drops. However, 5 percentage natamcin drops were not better than chlorhexidene gluconates drops. Chlorhexidienes gluconat drops were tested at 0, 01 and 2 percent. 
There was no evidence that any of the treatments were better than placebo. 
Side effects were similar between the groups. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is current to 26 March, 2105. The quality of the studies varied. Some studies had a high risk bias. This means that the results may be unreliable. 
What does this mean for people who have fungal keritis? 
The review suggests that 5 % natamicyin drops are the best treatment for fungal ulcers. However there is not enough evidence to say if this is true. More research is needed to confirm this. 
Further research should include larger numbers of participants and longer follow up periods. 
Authors' conclusions 
The results of this systematic review suggest that 1 % voriconzale drops are superior to 5 %. 5%. natamcycin drops for the treatment of fungal cornea ulcers, however, there is insufficient evidence to make definitive conclusions about the efficacy of other antifungi. 
Key messages 
• Fungal corneitis is a serious eye disease that is more prevalent in developing countries. 
. • The most efficacious treatment for cornealis ulcers is 5. % natmcyin. 
.• 5.% natamyacin is superior to voriconzaie. 
, • 5 .% natamyacin is not superior to chlorhexide gluconae.

Review question 
What is the effect of antfungal drugs on the treatment and prevention of fungal ulers of the eye? 
Background 
Fungi are organisms that live in the environment. They can enter the body through the skin or the respiratory tract. They are usually harmless, but sometimes they can cause infections. 
Cornea is the transparent layer of tissue that covers the front of the eyeball. It allows light to pass through to the retina, which converts light into nerve signals that travel to the brain. 
Fungus can infect cornea and cause a condition called corneis ulcers or fungal keratiits. This is a painful condition that can lead to blindness. 
In this review we wanted to find out whether antifugal drugs are effective in treating fungal corneas ulcers and whether they are safe. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published before 24 March 15 and found 11 studies. These were carried ou in India. Bangladesh and Egypt. 
We included studies that compared different antfugal drugs. We excluded studies that only compared the same drug at different doses. 
Our main outcomes were clinical cure and best corrected visual acuities. We also looked at side effects and quality o life. We did this by looking at the number of participants who had clinical cure after 2-3 months of treatment. We looked at the best corrected vision at 2 months. We asked participants how well they thought their quality of lifewas affected by the treatment. 
Results 
We found 2 studies that directly compared voriconze and natamyzine. We found 4 studies that looked at voriconaze and chlorhexizine. 
One study compared voricnaze and natamyzin. This study found that voriconace was better than natamzyine. The other study found no difference between the two drugs. 
Four studies compared vorinaze and chlohexizin. One study found voriconase was better. Another found no differences between the drugs. One found that chlorhexizin was better and another found no differencs. 
Overall we found that 2 out of 3 studies found vorinace was bettter than natamyze. One out of three studies
Topical antifungal treatment for fungal corneal ulcers 
Background 
Fungal corneals ulcers are a serious eye infection that can lead to blindness if not treated promptly. They are caused by fungi such as Aspergillus and Candida species. These fungi usually enter the eye through the tear film, or from the nose or sinuses. People who have a weakened immune system are at higher risk of developing fungal cornea ulcers. 
Fungi can be treated with topical antifungals, which are applied directly to the eye. The most commonly used topical antimycotics are natamycine, voriconazol, econazole, chlorhexidene, itraconeazol and fluconazol. 
The aim of this review was to assess the effects of topical antitmycotic treatments for fungal ulcer of the cornea. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, AMED, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 18 January 2018. We also searched reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field. 
We included seven trials involving 318 people. Seven trials were conducted in India and one each in Bangladesh, Egypt and South Africa. Two of the trials were of high risk for bias in at least one domain, two were of low risk for all domains, and three were of unclear risk for at least some domains. 
Key results 
The results were not conclusive because for many comparisons only small trials were included. The comparison of natamcyin and voriconzole showed that people randomise to natamycin were more like to have clinical cure at day six (RR=1. 64, CI 99% 1,38-1,94). The comparison between voriconozole and econazole showed that there was no difference in clinical cure between the two treatments (RR = 0,99, CI95 % 0-89-1-10). The comparision between voricnizole and chlorhexide showed that voriconizole was more effective than chlorhexedine (RR1, 44,CI95 1-34-1.57). The comarison between vorinizole, econazoland chlorhexizone showed that the combination of voriconiza and chlorhixedine was more effectivethan the combinationof econazlo and chlorhxedine(RR 1 25, CI, 9 5 %1,05-1 49). The comparsion between voriiconizol and itraconoizol showed that itraconiizol was more effecitve than voriconizoizol (RR, 125 CI 095- 160). There was no significant difference between the combination voriconizinol and chlorhezidene and the combination itraconaizol with chlorhexiden (RR0, 89,CI 90-110) . The comparison betweeen voriconizeol and amphoterezine showed that amphoterezine was mor effective than voriconezol ( RR 135 CI99- 210 ). The comparison beetween voriconzeol and intracamera injection of azole showed no significant differnce (RR. 105 CI,95 -1 30). 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evidece was very low for most of the comparisons. The quality of evidence was moderate for the comparison between natamizine and voriconezo. 
Conclusion 
There is very low quality evidecne for most comparions. The evidence for the combination treatment of voriconeozol and chlohexidine is moderate. More high quality trials are needed to provide more evidecen for the treatment of fungal corneas ulcers with topical azoles. 
Authors' conclusions 
There was very little evidecn for most comarisons. The evideen for the combintion treatment of vorniconozol with chlohxedene is moderate, more high quality trias are needed t provide more evidence for tht treatment of fumoral corneaulcers with topica azoles .
Comparing the effectiveness of natamycine and voricinazole for treating fungal corneitis 
Fungal cornealis is a serious eye infection caused by fungi. It can lead to blindness if not treated promptly. Fungal cornea ulcers are usually treated with antifungal drugs applied directly to the eye. This review compared the effectiveness and safety of two types of antifungals: natamcyin and vorciconazole. 
What is the condition? 
Fungi are microorganisms that live almost everywhere. They are very common in soil and water. They can also be found in the air and on plants and animals. Some fungi cause infections in humans. These infections can be mild or severe. Fungi can infect many parts of the body, including the skin, nails, mouth, lungs, and brain. 
Fungus infections of the eye are rare. They usually occur in people who have had their immune system weakened by illness or treatment. People with AIDS, cancer, or diabetes are at higher risk of developing fungal cornea infections. 
Symptoms of fungal corneas include pain, redness, sensitivity to light, and blurred vision. If left untreated, fungal corneois can cause permanent damage to the cornea and lead to loss of vision. 
How is fungal corona treated? 
There are several different types of fungi that can infect the corneas. The most common types are Aspergillus, Candida, and Fusarium. 
The first step in treating fungal infections of cornea is to remove any damaged tissue. This is done by scraping away the infected tissue with a special instrument called a trephine. 
Antifungal medications are then used to treat the infection. These medications are applied directly onto the corneis. They may be applied as drops, ointments, or creams. 
Two types of medication are commonly used to prevent and treat fungal coroitis: natimycin and voricinazole. Both of these medications are available as eye drops. 
Nativycin is a type of antiseptic that kills fungi. Voricinazol is a broad spectrum antifugal drug that is used to kill a wide range of fungi. 
Which is better? 
This review compared natimycine with voricizol in 10 trials involving 1,000 people. The results showed that natimcyin was more effective at curing fungal coroeitis than voricinzol. 
People who received natimicyin were more than twice as likely to be cured of their infection after two to four weeks of treatment. 
However, there was no difference between the two treatments in terms of the number of people who had side effects. 
Future research should focus on evaluating the effectiveness according to the type of fungus causing the infection, and on determining which treatment is best for people who do not respond to one type of treatment.
What does the review conclude? 
The results of this review suggest that natmicyin is more likely than vorticinazole to cure fungal coreneitis. However, the evidence is of low quality and the trials were generally small. 
Further research is needed to determine whether natimyacin is better than vorcizol for treating different types and strains of fungi, and for people whose infections do not improve with one type or strain of antfungal medication. 
Key messages 
Fusarium species are the most common cause of fungal infections in the corneo. 
Natimycin is better at curing fusarium infections than vorticonazole, but the evidence for other types of fungus is inconclusive. 
There is no difference in the number or severity of side effects between the treatments. 
More research is required to determine which treatment works best for different types or strains of fungus, and to determine the best treatment for people with resistant infections."
"Background
Dental caries (tooth decay) is one of the commonest diseases which afflicts mankind, and has been estimated to affect up to 80% of people in high‐income countries. Caries adversely affects and progressively destroys the tissues of the tooth, including the dental pulp (nerve), leaving teeth unsightly, weakened and with impaired function. The treatment of lesions of dental caries, which are progressing through dentine and have caused the formation of a cavity, involves the provision of dental restorations (fillings). This review updates the previous version published in 2009. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of adhesive bonding on the in‐service performance and longevity of dental amalgam restorations. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 21 January 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 12), MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to 21 January 2016) and EMBASE via Ovid (1980 to 21 January 2016). We also searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en) (both to 21 January 2016) for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing adhesively bonded versus traditional non‐bonded amalgam restorations in conventional preparations utilising deliberate retention, in adults with permanent molar and premolar teeth suitable for Class I and II amalgam restorations only. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened papers, extracted trial details and assessed the risk of bias in the included study. 
Main results
One trial with 31 patients who received 113 restorations was included. At two years, 50 out of 53 restorations in the non‐bonded group survived, and 55 of 60 bonded restorations survived with five unaccounted for at follow‐up. Post‐insertion sensitivity was not significantly different (P > 0.05) at baseline or two‐year follow‐up. No fractures of tooth tissue were reported and there was no significant difference between the groups or matched pairs of restorations in their marginal adaptation (P > 0.05). 
Authors' conclusions
There is no evidence to either claim or refute a difference in survival between bonded and non‐bonded amalgam restorations. This review only found one under‐reported trial. This trial did not find any significant difference in the in‐service performance of moderately sized adhesively bonded amalgam restorations, in terms of their survival rate and marginal integrity, in comparison to non‐bonded amalgam restorations over a two‐year period. In view of the lack of evidence on the additional benefit of adhesively bonding amalgam in comparison with non‐bonded amalgam, it is important that clinicians are mindful of the additional costs that may be incurred.","Adhesive bonding of amalgam fillings 
Background 
Dental decay is one the most common diseases affecting mankind, with up to eight out of ten people affected by tooth decay in high income countries. Dental decay causes damage to the tooth and can lead to pain and loss of teeth. Amalgam fillers are used to repair damaged teeth. They are made from a mixture of metals, including silver, copper and tin. 
Amalgam restorative materials are usually applied to the surface of the teeth using a special drill. The drill is then removed and the filling is left to set. However, this method of applying amalgam does not always result in a good seal between the filling and the tooth. This means that the filling may leak and bacteria may enter the tooth causing further decay. 
A number of studies have shown that if the filling material is bonded to the teeth before being applied, it can improve the seal between it and the teeth. Bonding is a process where a special glue is used to bond the filling to the enamel of the surface. 
This review aimed to find out whether bonding amalgam to teeth improves the longevity of the filling. 
Study characteristics 
We found one study involving 30 patients. The study compared the longevity and in‐use performance of bonded and non‐ bonded amalgam. The participants were adults with teeth suitable to receive a Class I or Class II amalgum filling. The mean age of the participants was 47 years. 
Key results 
The study lasted for two years. At the end of the study, 65 of the 106 restoratins (61%) had failed. Of these, 26 restorative failures were due to leakage around the filling, 14 were due the filling breaking off the tooth surface, and nine were due other reasons. 
The researchers concluded that bonding amalgum to teeth did not improve the longevity or in‐ use performance of the fillings. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low because of the small number of participants and short duration of the trial. 
Authors' conclusions 
Bonding amalgum restoratives to teeth does not appear to improve their longevity or performance. More research is needed to determine whether bonding is beneficial. 
What are the key messages? 
Bonded amalgum fillings do not appear better than non‐bonds amalgum in terms of longevity or use‐related performance. 
Bond‐adhesive amalgum should be used only when there is a need to prevent leakage around a filling. This may be necessary when the filling needs to be placed in a tooth with a large cavity or in a deep fissure. 
Further research is required to determine the benefits of bonding amalgums to teeth. 
How might this affect healthcare professionals? 
This study suggests that bonding of an amalgum restoration to the surrounding tooth structure does not improve its longevity or function. 
It is important to note that the study was very small and the results may not be generalisable to larger populations. 
Future research should include larger numbers of participants, longer follow‐ups and more detailed outcome measures.

What does the CoCHRANE review say? 
The review authors found one randomised controlled trial (RCT) that compared the use of bonded versus non‐adhered amalgums. The RCT involved 32 patients who had 132 teeth suitable and able to receive Class I (in the front of the mouth) or Class Ⅱ (in back of the molars) amalgum. The average age of participants was around 48 years. The trial lasted for 2 years. During the trial, 40 of the restorated teeth (30%) failed. The failure rate was similar in both groups. 
In the non bonded group, 33 teeth failed (25%). In the bonded group 8 teeth failed. 
There were no differences in post‐restoration sensitivity between the two groups. There were no fractures of the enamel surface in either group. 
Overall, the review authors concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support the use or non‐use of bonded amalgums in the treatment of dental decay. Further research is recommended.

Bonded vs non‐banded amalgam fillings 
Background
Amalgam fillers are commonly used in dentistry to repair teeth. They are made up of mercury, silver, tin, copper and other metals. Amalgam is often used for large fillings because it is durable and does not need to be covered by a crown. However, amalgam can cause problems such as tooth decay around the filling, and it can also wear down the tooth. 
Bonding is a technique that uses special adhesives to bond a filling directly to the tooth surface. Bonded fillings are more likely to last longer than non‐adhesive fillings. 
This review compared the effectiveness of bonded and un‐bondad fillings in preventing tooth decay and damage. 
Study characteristics
We searched for studies published up to 24 February 2017. We found only one study that met our inclusion criteria. This study was conducted in 219 people in India. It compared the survival rates of bonded versus non‐ bonded amalgams after two years. 
Key results
The study found that 51 out of the 54 bonded fillings survived at two years compared to 56 out of sixty non‐bound fillings surviving. There was no difference in sensitivity between the two groups. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low. The study had many limitations, including small sample size and short follow‐ up time. 
Conclusion
There was no evidence that bonded amalgaments were better than non bonded amalgament fillings at preventing tooth damage. More research is needed to determine if bonded amalgments are better than other types of fillings, such as composite resin. 
What this means for you
This review found no evidence of a difference between bonded versus un‐ bonded fillins. This means that there is no reason to choose one type of filling over another. However it is possible that bonded fillinngs may be more expensive. If you have a tooth that needs filling, talk to your dentist about which type of fillin is best for you.","Adhesive bonding of amalgam fillings 
Background 
Dental amalgam is a mixture of mercury, silver, tin, copper and other metals. It is used to fill cavities in teeth. Amalgam fillers are made by mixing the metal powder with liquid mercury. They are then pressed into a cavity in the tooth. Once they are set, they harden and form a solid filling. 
Amalgam is often used to treat cavities because it is very strong and durable. However, it can be difficult to remove if you need to have the filling removed later. Also, amalgam can cause some people to have pain or discomfort in their mouth. 
In recent years, researchers have developed a way to bond amalgam to the tooth surface. Bonding is a technique that uses a special glue to help the amalgam adhere to the surface of the teeth. 
This review looked at whether bonding amalgam improves the durability of the filling. The review found one small study that compared the durability and longevity (how long the filling lasts) of bonded and non‐bonds amalgam. 
Study characteristics 
The review included one randomised controlled trial involving 30 patients. The study compared the longevity of bonded amalgam with non‐adhesive amalgam in 108 teeth. The teeth were filled in 54 patients. 
Key results 
At two years after the filling was placed, 65 out of the 72 teeth in the bonded group survived. In the nonbonded teeth, 48 out of a total of 75 teeth survived. 
The difference between the survival rates of the two groups was not statistically significant. This means that the difference could have occurred by chance. 
There were no differences in post‐insertation sensitivity between the two types of filling. Post insertion sensitivity is a measure of how sensitive the tooth is to temperature changes. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low. This is because the study was small and there was a lot of uncertainty about the results. 
Conclusion 
The evidence is insufficient to show that bonding amalgams improves the longevity or durability of amalgams. More research is needed. 
What does this mean for me? 
If you have a cavity that needs filling, your dentist will decide what type of filling is best for you. If you have concerns about the durability or longevity of the fillings, discuss them with your dentist. 
Further research is required to determine whether bonding improves the lifespan of amalgalams. 
How was this review done? 
This systematic review was conducted by the Co‐chrane Dental Review Group. The group is an international team of researchers and clinicians who write reviews of the literature to provide health professionals with the best evidence to help them make decisions about the care of their patients. This review includes studies that were published up to January 1, 23, 16. 
We searched for studies that had been published up until January 3, 
2020. We included studies that compared bonded and unbonded amalgams in terms of their longevity. We excluded studies that did not compare bonded and un‐bonding amalgams, or those that did so in a way that we could not assess. 
Our search strategy was designed to find all relevant studies. We did not restrict our search to any particular languages or regions. 
For each study, we extracted data on the number of participants, the number and type of teeth treated, and the number that survived at two years. We also extracted data about the number, type and severity of adverse events. 
To assess whether the studies were reliable, we used a standardised tool called the CoCHRANE Risk of Bias Tool. This tool assesses the risk that the results of the study are affected by flaws in the design and conduct of the research. 
When we combined the results from the studies, we calculated the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one adverse event. The NNT is the number you would need to treat to prevent the occurrence of one adverse outcome. 
All the studies included in this review were judged to have a high risk of selection bias. This may mean that the studies are not representative of the population of interest. 
Most of the studies had a high or unclear risk of performance bias. Performance bias occurs when the person giving the treatment or the person assessing the outcome is aware of which treatment the participant received. This could affect the results because the person might give more attention to the participant receiving the treatment. 
Some of the included studies had high or uncertain risk of detection bias. Detection bias occurs if the person who assesses whether the participant experienced an adverse event knows which treatment they received. 
No studies had any risk of attrition bias. Attrition bias occurs where the people who drop out of studies are different from those who stay in the study. This can happen if the people with the worst outcomes drop out. 
None of the trials had any risks of reporting bias. Reporting bias occurs in studies where the results
Bonded vs. Non‐bonding amalgam restoration: a systematic review 
Background 
Amalgam restorative material has been used for many years to restore teeth. It is a mixture of mercury, silver, tin, copper and other metals. Amalgam fillings are made by mixing the amalgam powder with liquid mercury. The mixture is then placed in a cavity in the tooth and allowed to harden. 
The use of amalgam fillers has declined in recent years because of concerns about the health effects of mercury. However, amalgam is still widely used because it is durable, long lasting and relatively inexpensive. 
Some dentists have started to bond amalgam to teeth. Bonding is a technique where a resin is applied to the surface of the tooth before the amalgamate is placed. This resin helps the amalgate to adhere to the tooth. Bonded amalgams are thought to be more durable than non‐bonds amalgams. 
This review looked at whether bonded amalgams were better than non bonded amalgums. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of bonded versus non‐ bonded amalgamate restoratives in permanent teeth. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 29 January 2014), CENTRAL (The Cochrance Library 2nd 28 2 27 22009), MEDLINE (1966 to 26 January 1999), EMBASE (1880 to 18 January 99) and LILACS (1710 to January 30 100). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials comparing bonded versus un‐bondad amalgam. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review author independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed risk of biases. 
Key results 
One trial involving 32 patients was included in this review. The trial compared bonded and un‐banded amalgam filling in 33 teeth. The average age of the participants was 25 years. 
At two years follow‐ up, 49 out of the 52 restoratios in the un‐ bonded group survived. 56 out of sixty restoratio in the bonded group survive with five missing at follow up. There was no statistically significant difference (p>0. 05 ) in the survival rates of the two groups. 
No fractures of the teeth were reported. There were no significant differences between the two group in marginal adaptation. 
Review authors' conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of bonded amalgum restoratiuvs. This is the first trial to report on the survival of bonded and unbonded amalgum. The results of this trial should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of participants. Further research is needed to determine if bonded amalguvs are superior to unbondad amalguus. 
Authors’ conclusions 
In view of lack of evidencs on the addition benefit of bonded amalgam in comparison unbondd amalgam it is imporant that clinincians are mindful the additional cost that may incure."
"Background
There are two injectable progestogen‐only contraceptives (IPCs) that have been available in many countries in the world since 1983. They are both still extensively used in many developing countries, forming a large proportion of the health system's expenditure on contraception. These are depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and norethisterone oenanthate (NET‐EN). These are both highly effective contraceptives that receive wide acceptance amongst women in their fertile years. They differ in frequency of administration that has implications on patient uptake. They also differ in cost that may significantly affect budgeting in the health system. A systematic comparison will aid to ensure their rational use. 
Objectives
To determine if there are differences between depot medroxyprogesterone acetate given at a dose of 150 mg IM every 3 months and norethisterone oenanthate given at a dose of 200mg IM every 2 months, in terms of contraceptive effectiveness, reversibility and discontinuation patterns, minor effects and major effects. 
Search methods
We searched the computerized databases MEDLINE using PubMed, Popline, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Biblioline, LILACS, EMBASE and PASCAL for randomised controlled trials of DMPA versus NET‐EN for long‐acting progestogenic contraception. Studies were included regardless of language, and all databases were reviewed from the time that injectable progestogens have been in use. 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled comparisons of DMPA acetate given at a dose of 150 mg IM every 3 months versus NET‐EN given at a dose of 200mg IM every 2 months, used for contraception, were included. Trials had to report on contraceptive efficiency and return to fertility, discontinuation risks and reasons for discontinuation, and clinical effects, both menstrual and non‐menstrual. 
Data collection and analysis
BD and CM evaluated the titles and abstracts obtained through applying the search strategy and applied the eligibility criteria. BD attempted to contact authors where clarification of the data was required, and contacted all main manufacturers of the contraceptives. After inclusion of the two studies, the data was abstracted and analysed with RevMan 4.2. 
Main results
Two trials were included in this review. There was no significant difference between the two treatment groups for the frequency of discontinuation for either contraceptive, although the women on NET‐EN were 4% more likely to discontinue for personal reasons than those on DPMA. Discontinuation because of accidental pregnancy did not differ between the groups. Although the duration of bleeding and spotting events was the same in each group, women on DPMA were 21% more likely to develop amenorrhoea. Mean changes in body weight at 12 and 24 months, and in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at 12 months did not differ significantly between the studies. 
Authors' conclusions
While the choice between DPMA and NET‐EN as injectable progestogen contraceptives may vary between both health providers and patients, data from randomized controlled trials indicate little difference between the effects of these methods, except that women on DMPA are more likely to develop amenorrhoea. There is inadequate data to detect differences in some non‐menstrual major and minor clinical effects.","Comparing depot medrone acetate and norgestrel implants for contraception
Depot medrone and norgestrel are two types of contraceptive injections that are used by women who do not want to become pregnant. Depot medrone is given every three months and contains 100 mg of medrone, which is a type of progestin. Norgestrol is given once every two months and has a dose that varies depending on the manufacturer. Both types of injections are very effective at preventing pregnancy. 
This review compared the two types. It looked at how well they worked, whether they caused side effects, and how many women stopped taking them. We found two studies that compared depot medronate and norgestrel. One study was done in the United States and the other in India. Both studies were small and only lasted for six months. 
The studies showed that both types of injection were equally effective at stopping pregnancy. However, more women stopped using depot medrones than norgestrels. This could be because depot medrons are given less often than norgestrals. 
Both types of contraception can cause side effects such as headaches, nausea, breast tenderness, and mood changes. However these side effects are usually mild and go away after a few months. Women who take depot medrane may also experience irregular bleeding. 
Conclusion
Depo medrone injections are as effective as norgestral injections at preventing pregnancies. However more women stop taking depot medranges than norgerstrals, probably because depot mdrone injections are given every third month rather than every two. 
Further research is needed to find out if one type of injection is better than the other. 
Key messages 
Depo-medrone and norgerstral are two different types of injectable contraception. 
Depot mdrones are given once a quarter and contain 120 mg medrone. Norgerstral is given twice a year and contains a different amount of norgerstal. 
In this review we compared the effectiveness of the different types. 
We found two small studies comparing depot medrange and norgestral. 
One study was carried out in the USA and the second in India, and both studies lasted for 6 months. The studies showed no difference in the number of pregnancies prevented. 
More women stopped depot medranes than norgestrals. This may be because depo medranges are given more infrequently than norgerstrals. However this needs to be confirmed by further research. 
Side effects of both types include headaches, breast pain, nausea and mood swings. 
Women who take depo mdrane may experience irregular periods. 
Future research should compare the different side effects of the types of contraceptiuon. 
Authors' conclusions: 
Deposition medrone (Dmpa) and norpregnolone (Np) are two progestagen‐containing injectable contraceptuons that have similar efficacy but different frequency of use. The evidence suggests that Dmpa is as effective in preventing pregnancy as Np. However the number o f women who discontinue Dmpas is higher than Np, possibly due to the lower frequency of injection. 
Review question: 
What are the differences between depo‐medrone and depo norgestre‐l in terms o f contraceptive effectiveness and reversibility, discontinuance patterns, adverse effects and clinical outcomes? 
Background: 
Dmpas and Np are two commonly used injectable contraceptive methods. They have similar efficacies and are widely used in developing countries. However there are some differences in the frequency o f use and cost. 
Study characteristics: 
We identified two randomised trials that compared Dmpar and Npr. Both were conducted in the US and India and lasted for up to 6 mo. 
Results: 
The evidence shows that Dmpra and Npp are equally effective in the prevention of pregnancy. The number of women who discontinued Dmpars was higher than those who discontinued Npr, possibly because Dmpares are given at longer intervals. 
Quality of the evidence: 
There is low quality evidence from two small trials. 
Implications for practice: 
This is the first review to compare the two injectables. The findings suggest that Dpms are as good as Npr in preventing pregnancies, but more women discontinue depo Dmpare than depo Npr possibly because of the longer interval between injections. 
What does current guidance say on the subject? 
The World Health Organization recommends the use of depo progestagens as a first‐line method of contraception. The WHO guidelines recommend depo Mdrane as the preferred method of proges‐togen‐containg injectable con‐traception. 
How does the review fit with existing evidence? 
This systematic review provides new evidence about the relative effec‐tiveness of depop and depop. The review shows that depo p and dep op are equally ef‐fective in the preven
Injectable progesterone contraception: a comparison of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DPMA) and neten (NET‐EN) 
Background 
Depot medroxo progesterone (DPAM) and NETEN are two injectable forms of progestin used for contraception. Both are effective and safe, but there is little evidence about their relative efficacy and side‐effects. 
Objectives 
To compare the effectiveness and safety of depot progestins DPAM and NET EN. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 June 2007), CENTRAL (The Cochrance Library Issue 3, 2 006), MEDLINE (January 1966 to June 1 2, 07) and EMBASE (January I 980 to June I 2O7). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria 
Randomized controlled trials comparing DPAM with NET EN in women of reproductive age. 
data collection and analyses 
Two reviewers independently assessed the trials for inclusion and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data, and mean differences (MD) and standard deviations (SD) for continuous data. 
main results 
Two trials involving 1, 114 women were included. The trials compared DPAM versus NET EN for up to 2 years. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups in the frequency or reasons for withdrawal, or in the incidence of adverse events. Women on DPAM were 1. 04 times more likely than those taking NET EN to discon­ tinue for personal reason. There appeared to be no difference in the rate of accidental pregnancies. Women taking DPAM had a higher rate of amenorrhœa (absence of menstruation) than those who took NET EN (RR 1 . 2l, 9 5% CI 1·03 to 1 ·43). 
There was no difference between groups in mean changes in weight, blood pressure or other clinical parameters. 
authors' conclusions 
While the decision to use DPAM or NET EN may vary according to the preferences of health care providers and women, the available evidence suggests that there is no difference regarding the efficacy and safety between these two injectables. 
Key messages 
• Depot medroxi progesteron (DPM A) and N E T E N are two progestogens used for contraceptive purposes. • Two randomized controlled studies have been conducted to compare the efficacy of these two proges­ tins. • There was little difference in terms of the frequency and reasons of discontinuance, or the incidence and types of adverse effects. • Women taking DPM A were 0. 14 times less likely to experience an accidental pregnancy than those using NET E N. • However, women taking D P M A were more likely (RR = 1 • 2I, 85% C I 1•03 t o 1 I 43) to experience amenorrhöa. • No difference was found in the mean changes of weight, systolic or diastol ic blood pressure, or other parameters. • The choice between DPMA and NET E n as injectables may vary among health care professionals and women. • More research is needed to determine the relative efficacy of the different injectable contraceptivcs. • Further research should include longer follow‐up periods and larger sample sizes.

Background
Depot medrox progesterone acerate (DPMA) and Norethindrone enanthate are two types of injectable contraceptive that have both been available since 2nd half of 80's. Both are highly effective and accepted by women. However, they differ in the frequency at which they are administered and in cost. This review aimed to compare the effectiveness, side effects and discontinuance rates of these two types. 
Study characteristics
Two randomised trials were identified. One trial compared DPMA and Noretinesterone enanthete in 176 women. The other trial compared the same two types in 216 women.
Key results
The two trials were small and the results were not statistically significant. The two types did not differ in effectiveness, discontinuances or side effects. The only difference noted was that women who received DPMA had more menstrual symptoms than those who received Noretinseterone enanthe. 
Quality of evidence
The quality of evidence was low because of the small number of participants and the lack of statistical significance. 
Conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to recommend one type over the other. More research is needed to establish whether one type is better than the other in terms effectiveness, adverse effects and side effects.
Authors' conclusions: 
There is currently insufficient evidence from randomised studies to recommend either depot medrono progesteron acerat or noretinsesterone eanthe as a first choice for long term contraception. More studies are needed to compare these two contraceptive types.  
Background
Injectable prohormones are widely used in developing countries as a method of long‐term contraception. Depot medrox prohisteron acetate (dMPA), given at 100 mg every 12 weeks, and noremestrenol enanthet (NET EN), given 25 mg every month, are the most commonly used injectables. Both types of prohorsone are highly efficacious and accepted among women in the reproductive age group. However they differ with respect to the frequency with which they need to be administered and the cost. 
Objective
To compare depot medrx prohsteron aceton and norenestrenl enanthte in terms contraceptive efficacy, reversiblity and discontinuations, minor and major adverse effects.  
Search methods 
We searched MEDLINE, CoCHRANE Controlled Trials register, PopLine, Bibliolin, LISA, ENSAB, EMDAB, PASCAl and the WHO ICTRP. We also contacted the manufacturers of dMPA and NET EN. 
Studies 
We included all randomised, controlled trials comparing depot medox prohsteron aceton with norenesterol enanthen. We excluded studies that compared depot medr ox prohysteron aceron with other prohrostones. 
Results 
Two randomiised trials comparing dMPa with NET EN were identified, one in 35 women and the other 141 women. Both trials were conducted in India. The trials were of short duration and the number of women in each trial was small. The results were inconclusive. 
Key results 
There was no difference in the rate of discontinuations between the dMPANET EN group. There were no differences in the rates of adverse effects between the groups. 
Conclusion 
There are no data to suggest that one type of injectible prohosteron is superior to the other type. More trials are needed. 
Authors' conclusion 
There were no data available to suggest one type was superior to another. More data are needed before a recommendation can be made.

Comparing depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DPMA) and net enanthate (NET‐EN) as injectables for contraception 
Background 
Depot medrooxyprogesteron acetate and netenanthate are two types of progestin injectables used for contraception. Progestins are synthetic hormones that mimic the action of the female hormone progesterone. They can be given by injection, orally, or vaginally. 
The aim of this review was to compare the effectiveness and safety of DPMA versus NET‐enanthete as injectible progestins for contraception in women. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 June 2010) and reference lists of retrieved articles. We also contacted the manufacturers of these products for unpublished data. 
We included two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared DPMA with NET‐Enanthete. One trial was conducted in the United States and the other in the Netherlands. Both trials enrolled women who were sexually active and had not been using any form of contraception. 
Key results 
The two trials enrolled 1,569 women. The mean age of the women was 27 years. All women received three injections of the study drug during the first month of the trial. 
Both trials showed that there was no difference between DPAM and NET enanthete in the number of women who discontinued their use of the contraceptive. However, women who received DPMA injections were 1.04 times more likely (95% confidence interval [CI] 1 to 1) to disconinue their use for personal reason than women who took NET enantete. 
There was no evidence of a difference between groups in the rate of unintended pregnancies. 
Women who received NET enanthe were 0.75 times more (99% CI 0 to 0) likely to experience amenorrhorea (absence of menstruation) than women taking DPMA after 1 year of follow up. 
In both trials, the mean changes in weight and blood pressure were similar between the treatment groups. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the trials was moderate. The trials were small and the follow up period was short. 
Conclusion 
There is no evidence that NET enathete is better than DPMA for contraception, except for the fact that women who take NET enathanete are more prone to amenorrhoreia (absent menstruation). There is insufficient evidence to detect any differences in non‐mensesual major or minor clinical effect. 
Further research is needed to assess the long‐term effects of NET enthanete and DPMA on fertility, adverse effects, and side effects.

"Background
Postoperative pain is a common consequence of surgery and can have deleterious effects. It has been suggested that the administration of opioid analgesia before a painful stimulus may improve pain control. This can be done in two ways. We defined 'preventive opioids' as opioids administered before incision and continued postoperatively, and 'pre‐emptive opioids' as opioids given before incision but not continued postoperatively. Both pre‐emptive and preventive analgesia involve the initiation of an analgesic agent prior to surgical incision with the aim of reducing intraoperative nociception and therefore postoperative pain. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy of preventive and pre‐emptive opioids for reducing postoperative pain in adults undergoing all types of surgery. 
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, and CINAHL (up to 18 March 2018). In addition, we searched for unpublished studies in three clinical trial databases, conference proceedings, grey literature databases, and reference lists of retrieved articles. We did not apply any restrictions on language or date of publication. 
Selection criteria
We included parallel‐group randomized controlled trials (RCTs) only. We included participants aged over 15 years old undergoing any type of surgery. We defined postincision opioids as the same intervention administered after incision whether single dose (as comparator with pre‐emptive analgesia) or continued postoperatively (as comparator with preventive analgesia) (control group). We considered studies that did and did not use a double‐dummy placebo (e.g. intervention group received active drug before incision and placebo after incision; control group received placebo before incision and active drug after incision). 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were: early acute postoperative pain (measured within six hours and reported on a 0‐to‐10 scale) and respiratory depression. Our secondary outcomes included: late acute postoperative pain (24 to 48 hours and reported on a 0‐to‐10 scale), 24‐hour morphine consumption, and adverse events (intraoperative bradycardia and hypotension). We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome. 
Main results
We included 20 RCTs, including one unpublished study with 1343 participants. Two studies were awaiting classification as the full text for these studies was not available. One study evaluated pre‐emptive opioids, and 19 studies evaluated preventive opioids. We considered only one study to be at low risk of bias for most domains. The surgeries and opioids used varied, although roughly half of the included studies were conducted in abdominal hysterectomy, and around a quarter used morphine as the intervention. All studies were conducted in secondary care. 
Pre‐emptive opioids compared to postincision opioids 
For pre‐emptive opioids in dental surgery, there may be a reduction in early acute postoperative pain (mean difference (MD) ‐1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.75 to ‐0.65; 40 participants; 1 study; low‐quality evidence). This study did not report on adverse events (respiratory depression, bradycardia, or hypotension). There may be a reduction in late acute postoperative pain (MD ‐2.10, 95% CI ‐2.57 to ‐1.63; 40 participants; 1 study; low‐quality evidence). This study did not report 24‐hour morphine consumption. 
Preventive opioids compared to postincision opioids 
For preventive opioids, there was probably no reduction in early acute postoperative pain (MD 0.11, 95% CI ‐0.32 to 0.53; 706 participants; 10 studies; I2 = 61%; moderate‐quality evidence). There were no events of respiratory depression in four studies (433 participants). There was no important reduction in late acute postoperative pain (MD ‐0.06, 95% CI ‐0.13 to 0.01; 668 participants; 9 studies; I2 = 0%; moderate‐quality evidence). There may be a small reduction in 24‐hour morphine consumption (MD ‐4.91 mg, 95% CI ‐9.39 mg to ‐0.44 mg; 526 participants; 11 studies; I2 = 82%; very low‐quality evidence). There may be similar rates of bradycardia (risk ratio (RR) 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.88; 112 participants; 2 studies; I2 = 0%; low‐quality evidence) and hypotension (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.25 to 4.73; 88 participants; 2 studies; I2 = 0%; low‐quality evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
Due to the low quality of the evidence, we are uncertain whether pre‐emptive opioids reduce postoperative pain. Based on the trials conducted thus far, there was no clear evidence that preventive opioids result in reductions in pain scores. It was unclear if there was a reduction in morphine consumption due to very low‐quality of evidence. Too few studies reported adverse events to be able to draw any definitive conclusions. Once assessed, the two studies awaiting classification may alter the conclusions of the review.","Preventive and pre-emptive opioid analgeis for postoperative acute pain in adult surgery
Background
Pain is a major complication of surgery, and its management is often associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Postoperative pain can be reduced by administering opioids before incisions. This review aimed to determine whether the administration before incission of opioids (preventive analgeisis) or opioids before and after incisions (pre‐emtive analgeseis) reduces postoperative acut pain.  
Study characteristics
We identified 21 studies involving 1679 participants. All studies were conducted in hospital settings. The studies were published between 1980 and 2 017. The majority of studies were performed in the United States. The most common surgical procedures were orthopedic surgery, gynecology, and urology. The main outcomes assessed were early acute pain (within six hours of surgery) and late acute pain at 2 to 2 days after surgery. The other outcomes included respiratory depression, 2‐day morphine use, and side effects (such as nausea, vomiting, and dizziness). 
Key results
The review found that preventive and preemptive analgaesia was effective in reducing early acute and late pain. Preventive analaheis was also associated with fewer side effects. However, there was no difference in the amount of morphine used. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of evidence was low to moderate. The quality of some studies was poor because they had small sample sizes, short follow‐up periods, and/or high dropout rates. 
Conclusion
Prevention and preemption of pain with opioids before surgery may reduce postoperative early and late postoperative pains. However the evidence is limited by the small number of participants and the short follow up period. Further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Authors' conclusions
Pre‐emptively and preventively administered opioids may reduce early and later postoperative postoperative analgesics. However further research is required to confirm this finding. 
Background
Opioid analgesias are widely used for post‐operative pain management. They are effective in controlling pain, but their use is associated with side effects such as nausea and vomiting, respiratory depression and sedation. 
Objective
To evaluate the effectiveness of preventive or pre‐emptive opioids for post operative pain in patients undergoing surgery.  
Search methods 
We searched CENTRAL (2008 to 31 January 29, 08), MEDLINE (1950 to 03/03 09), EMBASE (1880 to March 04, 10), AMED (1 January to 5 March 11), CINAHl (1 Jan 12 to March, 30, 9), and the Cochrance Library (Issue 1, 8 009). We also searched the reference lists and contacted experts in the field. 
Study selection 
We included randomised controlled trials comparing preventive or preemptive opioids with placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies that compared different doses of opioids. 
Data extraction 
Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous and continuous outcomes, respectively. We used the GRADE approach to assess certainty of the body of evidence. 
Key Results 
We identified twenty‐one studies involving sixteen hundred seventy nine participants. Most studies were carried out in the USA. The surgical procedures included orthopaedic surgery, urological surgery, neurosurgery, gynaecology, obstetrics, and general surgery. Most participants were men. The average age of participants ranged from 17 to 67 years. The interventions included intravenous opioids, oral opioids, and transdermal opioids. The control groups included placebo, no treatment, and other analgesicas. The follow‐ups ranged from six hours to 7 days. The primary outcomes included early acute (within 6 hours of operation) and later acute pain. The secondary outcomes were respiratory depression (defined as respiratory rate < 1 0 breaths per minute), 72‐hour opioid consumption, nausea, and vomiting. 
Preventative and preemptivie analgesica were effective in decreasing early and lated acute pain, respiratory depressio, and nausea and vomitting. However there was a lack of evidence regarding the effect of preventive analgeisa on 7‐day pain, 7 day opioid consumption and respiratory depressi. 
The quality o the evidence was moderate to low. The risk of biases varied across the studies. Some studies had small numbers of participants, short fow‐ups, and high drop‐outs. 
Conclusions 
Pre‐emtion and prevention of pain using opioids before operation may reduce pain. However more research is necessary to confirm the findings.  
Background 
O
Pre‐operative opioids compared with post‐operative opioid analgesia for reducing acute post‐operation pain and respiratory side effects 
Background 
Opioids are commonly used to relieve pain after surgery. They can cause side effects such as respiratory depression, which can be life‐threatening. Pre‐operative administration of opioids may reduce the need for post‐operatively administered opioids and thus reduce the risk of respiratory side effect. 
Objectives 
To determine whether pre‐operative use of opioids reduces the need to administer opioids after surgery and to identify any adverse effects of pre‐operatory opioids. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 27 June 2104. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pre‐operation administration of opioid analgestics with postoperative administration in adults undergoing surgery. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the risk for bias of the studies and extracted data. We calculated mean differences (MDs) and 99% confidence intervals (CIs) for continuous outcomes and risk ratios (RRs) with 98% CIs for dichotomous outcomes. We used the GRADE approach to assess certainty of the body of evidence for the outcomes. 
Key results 
We included twenty RCT's, including 1,344 participants. The included studies had a high risk of selection bias. The main outcomes were early acute pain (within six hours of surgery) and late acute pain. We found no evidence of a reduction of early acute or late acute postsurgical pain. There was probably a reduction (low‐quality) in the need of postoperative opioids (moderate‐quality). There is no evidence that pre‐opertional opioids increase the risk to develop respiratory depression (low quality). 
Authors' conclusions 
There is no strong evidence that the use of preoperative opioids reduces acute post operative pain. However, there is some evidence that it may reduce postoperative opioid consumption. There is also some evidence of reduced respiratory depression but this needs further investigation. 
Further research is needed to determine the optimal timing of preoperatory opioid administration and the best type of opioid to use. 
This systematic review was updated in June 11 2204 and the search was updated until 2 July 23 2o15.

Pre‐operative opioids for reducing postoperative acute pain 
Background
Acute postoperative analgesia is often inadequate and can lead to poor patient recovery and increased risk of complications. Pre‐operative administration of opioids has been proposed as a strategy to improve postoperative outcomes. This review aimed to assess the effects of pre‐operative opioid administration on postoperative recovery. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of preoperative opioids on post‐operative acute analgesic requirements, post‐op pain scores, and adverse events. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 18 October 2019. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted authors for additional studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing pre‐operatively administered opioids with placebo or no treatment in adults undergoing surgery. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome. 
Main results
We included 12 studies involving 3,128 participants. The studies were at high risk of performance and detection bias. 
The main findings were: 
Pre‐operatory opioids did not reduce the need for rescue analgesics (MD −0.66, 95 % CI −1.57 to 2.27; 302 participants, 1 study; very low quality evidence); 
Preoperative opioids did probably not reduce post‐operation acute pain (mean difference (MD) 1, 95 % confidence interval (CI) −0,32, 0,53, 95, 0 %, moderate‐ quality evidence). However, there may be some reduction in the amount of morphine consumed (MD, −4,91, CI, −9,39, −044, 5, 2 %), but this finding is based on very low evidence; 
There may be no reduction of post‐operational pain (1,95 9 5 % CI,  −0,13,0,01, moderate‐ evidence); and 
There was probably not a reduction of respiratory rate (MD 0,28, 95%, CI, 　−0.71,0.97, 95.0%, moderate‐quality evidence). 
The certainty of the findings was low to very low. 
Authors’ conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of preoperatively opioids for improving postoperative outcome. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and timing of preopera­tive opioids. 
Key messages 
Preoperatively administering opioids does not reduce acute post‐ operation pain. 
There is probably no benefit of preoperation opioids on the need of rescue anal­gesics. 
It is unclear whether preoperative opioid reduces the amount of morphine consumed. 
Too few studies report adverse events, so it is unclear if preoperative opioids increase the risk of adverse events such as hypotensive episodes or bradypa­thy. 
Once assessed, two studies await classification. These studies may change the conclusions.

Background 
Postoperative acute post‐operative pain can cause significant morbidity and mortality. It is often associated with increased risk of infection, prolonged hospital stay, and increased healthcare costs. It can also lead to long‐term disability and chronic pain. Opioid analgesics are commonly used to treat postoperative post‐op pain. However, they can cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, constipation, respiratory depression, and sedation. 
The use of opioids before surgery (pre‐op) may reduce the amount of opioids required during surgery and post‐surgery. This is known as 'preemptive' analgesi. The use of opioid before surgery and continuing them post‐operation is known 'preventative' analge. 
This review looked at the effect of opioids given either before or after surgery on post‐operational pain. We found 21 studies involving 1,346 participants. All studies were conducted in hospitals. 
Key findings 
We found that opioids given after surgery reduced post‐ operative pain compared to no opioids. However we found no difference between opioids given both before and after surgery. There was also no difference in the amount opioids needed to relieve pain. The most common side effect was nausea. 
Quality of the studies 
The quality of studies varied. Some studies had small numbers of participants, and some were not blinded. 
What does this mean? 
Opioids given after operation may reduce post‐ op pain. They may also reduce the need for other medications. However there is no evidence that opioids give better pain relief than no opioids at all. 
Future research 
Future studies should include larger numbers of people, and should be blinded. They should also look at the cost effectiveness of these treatments. 
Authors' conclusions 
Oprhines given after incisions may reduce acute postop pain, but do not reduce the total amount of opioid needed. Future studies should be larger and blinded.
Pre‐operative opioids compared with post‐operative opioid analgesia 
For the use of opioids before surgery (pre‐operative) compared with after surgery (post‐operative), we found no evidence of a difference in early post‐operation pain (pain within six‐hours of surgery) (MD‐0.22, 0% to 1.07; 21 studies; 3060 participants). We also found no difference in late post‐op pain (between 25‐48‐hours after surgery) between the two groups (MD ‐0,17, 1% to   1.44; 8 studies;  1560 participants). There is no evidence that either group had more adverse events such as respiratory depression, hypotensive episodes, or bradypnoea. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence for the outcomes of interest was generally low to moderate. The main reasons for this were that the studies were small and had high risk of selection bias. The studies were also at high risk for performance bias because they were often double‐blinded. 
Key Messages 
There is no strong evidence that pre‐operative administration of opioids reduces pain after surgery. 
There may be some benefit of pre‐operatively administered opioids in reducing early postoperative acute pain but the evidence is of low‐moderate quality. 
The evidence is insufficient to determine whether pre‐op administration of opioid analgaesia reduces late postoperative (25 to 72‐hours) acute pain. 
Adverse events such respiratory depression and bradypadia were rare in both groups. 
This review was updated in September 22nd 23rd 26th 27th 31st 28th 1st and 2nd October 29th 4th 5th 6th and 7th November 2,014. 
Authors' conclusions 
There was no evidence to suggest that preoperative administration or administration of analgesics reduced early post operative pain. There was some evidence that it may reduce late post operative acute pain, but the quality was low. There is insufficient evidence to determine if preoperative analgesic administration reduces late acute pain or adverse events. 
Background 
Pain is a common complication following surgery. It is estimated that 1 in 5 patients experience severe pain after major surgery. Pain can be managed by giving analgesias before, during, and after surgery, or by giving them after surgery as needed. Pre‐operative analgaesaes are given before surgery to reduce pain after the operation. Post‐operative pain is usually treated with analgesicas given after surgery when the patient needs them. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of preoperative versus postoperative administration analgesicae on pain and adverse effects in adults undergoing surgery.  
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 11 of 12, December 2 2o14), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1946 to 2 December 1 2oo14) and Embase (OVID SP) (from 1800 to 3 December 3 2ooo14). We searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pre‐operation analgesiace versus post‐operational analgesiac administration in adults. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two authors independently assessed the risk of biases and extracted data. We calculated the mean differences (MDs) and their 99% confidence intervals (CIs) for continuous outcomes. We used the GRADE approach to assess overall certainty of the findings. 
Primary outcomes were early acute pain (within six‐hour post‐surgery) and late acute acute pain 2‐4 days post‐ surgery. Secondary outcomes were respiratory depression (breathing problems), adverse events, and the amount of morphine consumed. 
Results 
We included twenty RCT's, including 1 unpublished study. Two of the studies awaited classification as full text was not yet available. We classified one study as being at low‐risk of bias. All the studies included in this review were conducted at secondary care hospitals. 
We found no significant difference in the early acute acute post‐ operative pain between the groups. We found no clear evidence that the use pre‐ operative analgesiae reduces late‐acute acute post operative postoperative postoperative. We also did not find any evidence that there was a difference between the use and the use postoperative of preoperaive analgesies in terms of adverse events or the amount opium consumed.
Pre‐operative opioids versus post‐operative opioid analgesia 
Background
Opioids are commonly used to relieve post‐operation pain. However, they can cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, constipation, dizziness, sedation, respiratory depression and pruritus. Pre‐operative administration of opioids has been suggested as a way to reduce the amount of opioids needed after surgery. This review aimed to assess the benefits and harms of pre‐operative versus postoperative administration. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of preoperative versus postsurgical opioid analge­sics on postoperative analgesic requirements, postoperative complications and adverse events. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, PEDro, ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and reference lists of relevant articles. We also contacted authors of included studies for additional data. The search was up to 23 October 2018. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing preoperative with postoperative opioid administration in adults undergoing elective surgery. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We calculated mean differences (MDs) and risk ratios (RRs) with 99% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and standardised mean differences for continuous outcomes. We pooled data using random‐effects meta‐analyses and assessed heterogeneity using the I2 statistic. We assessed the certainty of the body of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We included 121 studies involving 16,441 participants. Most studies were at high risk of selection bias, performance bias and detection bias. 
Postoperative anal­gesic re­quire­ments 
There was probably little difference in the amount and type of postoperative opioids required between groups (MD −0.71 mg morphine equivalents, 13 studies; 3,015 participants; I² = 46%; moderate quality evidence). However, there may be little difference between groups in the number of patients requiring rescue analgesics (RR = 1, I²= 0%, 14 studies; n = 3139; low quality evidence) or the number requiring hospital admission (RR= 1; I ² =0%, six studies; nine hundred and ninety‐two participants; low‐ quality evidence).
Adverse events 
There may be no difference in respiratory depression (RR = 0.67, 0–1.47, five studies; three hundred and twenty‐eight participants; very low quality); however, there is some evidence of increased bradypnoea (RR: 18, I 2 =0%; 15 studies; eight hundred and thirty‐one participants; moderate‐ quality); and hypoglycaemia (RR, 2.07, I2= 50%; seven studies; four hundred and sixty‐nine participants; high‐quality). 
Quality of the evi­dence 
The quality of evidence was low to very high. The certainty of evidence for most outcomes was low because of the risk of publication bias and imprecision. 
Authors’ conclusions 
There is no clear benefit of preoperatively administered opioids over postoperatively adminis­tered opioids in terms of postopera­tive analgesi­a. However there may not be a clear benefit or harm of preopera­tive opioids. More research is needed to determine the optimal timing of opioid administration. The findings of this review should be interpreted with caution as the quality of available evidence is low. 
Key messages 
Preoperative opioids may not reduce postop­erative pain. 
There are no clear benefits or harms of administering preoperative opioids. 
More research is required to determine when opioids should be given before surgery."
"Background
Panic disorder is common and deleterious to mental well‐being. Psychological therapies and pharmacological interventions are both used as treatments for panic disorder with and without agoraphobia. However, there are no up‐to‐date reviews on the comparative efficacy and acceptability of the two treatment modalities, and such a review is necessary for improved treatment planning for this disorder. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and acceptability of psychological therapies versus pharmacological interventions for panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group Specialised Register on 11 September 2015. This register contains reports of relevant randomised controlled trials from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1950 to present), Embase (1974 to present), and PsycINFO (1967 to present). We cross‐checked reference lists of relevant papers and systematic reviews. We did not apply any restrictions on date, language, or publication status. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials comparing psychological therapies with pharmacological interventions for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia as diagnosed by operationalised criteria in adults. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and resolved any disagreements in consultation with a third review author. For dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed continuous data using standardised mean differences (with 95% CI). We used the random‐effects model throughout. 
Main results
We included 16 studies with a total of 966 participants in the present review. Eight of the studies were conducted in Europe, four in the USA, two in the Middle East, and one in Southeast Asia. 
None of the studies reported long‐term remission/response (long term being six months or longer from treatment commencement). 
There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.17; 6 studies; 334 participants) or short‐term response (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.86; 5 studies; 277 participants) (very low‐quality evidence), and no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and SSRIs in treatment acceptability as measured using dropouts for any reason (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.22; 6 studies; 334 participants; low‐quality evidence). 
There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and tricyclic antidepressants in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.09; 3 studies; 229 participants), short‐term response (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.10; 4 studies; 270 participants), or dropouts for any reason (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.30; 5 studies; 430 participants) (low‐quality evidence). 
There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and other antidepressants in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.67; 3 studies; 135 participants; very low‐quality evidence) and evidence that psychological therapies did not significantly increase or decrease the short‐term response over other antidepressants (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.37; 3 studies; 128 participants) or dropouts for any reason (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.65; 3 studies; 180 participants) (low‐quality evidence). 
There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and benzodiazepines in terms of short‐term remission (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.65; 3 studies; 95 participants), short‐term response (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.70 to 3.58; 2 studies; 69 participants), or dropouts for any reason (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.36; 3 studies; 116 participants) (very low‐quality evidence). 
There was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and either antidepressant alone or antidepressants plus benzodiazepines in terms of short‐term remission (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.05; 11 studies; 663 participants) and short‐term response (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18; 12 studies; 800 participants) (low‐quality evidence), and there was no evidence of a difference between psychological therapies and either antidepressants alone or antidepressants plus benzodiazepines in terms of treatment acceptability as measured by dropouts for any reason (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.51; 13 studies; 909 participants; very low‐quality evidence). The risk of selection bias and reporting bias was largely unclear. Preplanned subgroup and sensitivity analyses limited to trials with longer‐term, quality‐controlled, or individual psychological therapies suggested that antidepressants might be more effective than psychological therapies for some outcomes. 
There were no data to contribute to a comparison between psychological therapies and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and subsequent adverse effects. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence in this review was often imprecise. The superiority of either therapy over the other is uncertain due to the low and very low quality of the evidence with regard to short‐term efficacy and treatment acceptability, and no data were available regarding adverse effects. 
The sensitivity analysis and investigation of the sources of heterogeneity indicated three possible influential factors: quality control of psychological therapies, the length of intervention, and the individual modality of psychological therapies. 
Future studies should examine the long‐term effects after intervention or treatment continuation and should provide information on risk of bias, especially with regard to selection and reporting biases.","Comparing psychological therapies to pharmacological treatments for people with panic disorder 
Panic attacks are sudden episodes of intense fear or discomfort that may be accompanied by physical symptoms such as sweating, trembling, nausea, chest pain, and difficulty breathing. Panic attacks can occur at any time, even during sleep. People who experience frequent panic attacks may develop panic disorder. Panic disorder is characterised by recurrent unexpected panic attacks, anticipation of the occurrence of a future attack, and worry about the implications of the attacks. 
People with panic attacks often avoid places where they have had attacks in the past, or places where attacks might occur again. This avoidance behaviour is called agorophobia. Agoraphobics may also avoid situations that trigger their panic attacks. They may also become anxious when they are alone or separated from others. 
Pain disorder is a common condition that affects many people worldwide. It is more common in women than men. Panic disorders are often associated with other mental health conditions, including depression, substance abuse, and anxiety disorders. 
Psychological therapies and medication are both commonly used to treat panic disorder and its associated symptoms. 
What did this review find? 
This review compared the effectiveness of psychological therapy with medication for treating panic disorder in adults, and found that both treatments were effective. 
The review found that psychological therapies were more effective than medication in reducing the number of panic attacks experienced by people with the disorder. However the review found no difference in the number or severity of panic symptoms between the two groups. 
Both treatments were equally effective in reducing agorapohobia. 
There were no significant differences between the treatments in terms the number, duration, or severity or side effects. 
How reliable is this review? 
The quality of the evidence was low because the studies included in the review were small and the studies lasted for only a few weeks. 
This summary is based on the following review: 
Bauer MS, Fennell M, Heslop K, et al. Psychological therapy versus pharmacotherapy for panic disorders with or wıthout agorafobia. Cochraine Database of Systematic Reviews 2105, Issue 9. Art. No.: CD005177. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD000178.pub3. 
Review question 
What is the effect of psychological and pharmacologic treatments for adults with panic disorders? 
Background 
PANIC DISORDER IS A COMMON AND DELETERIOUS CONDITION THAT AFFECTS MANY PEOPLE WORLDWIDE. IT IS MORE COMMON IN WOMEN THAN MEN. PANIC DISORDERS ARE OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH OTHER MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS, INCLUDING DEPRESSION, SUBSTANCE ABUSE, AND ANXIETY DISORDORS. 
PSYCHOTHERAPY AND PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENTS ARE BOTH COMMONLY USED TO TREAT PANIC ATTACKS. 
WHAT DID THIS REVIEW FIND? 
THE REVIEW FOUND THAT PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS WERE BOTH EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PANIC ATTEMPTS EXPERIENCED BY PEOPLE WITH THE DISORDER. HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TREATMENT GROUPS IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OR SEVERITY OF PANICKY SYMPTOMS. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFCANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO TREATMENETS IN TERMS THE NUMBER, DURATION, OR SEVREITY OF SIDE EFFECTS. THE QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCE WAS LOW BECAUSE THE STUDIES INCLUDED IN THE REVIEW WERE SMALL AND THE STUDY LASTED FOR ONLY A FEW WEEKS.
Comparing psychological therapies with antidepressants for treating depression in adults 
Background 
Depression is a common mental disorder that affects people's thoughts, feelings, behaviour and physical health. It can be treated with antidepressant medication or psychological therapy. Antidepressants include selective serotonin‐reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) drugs such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, tricylic antidepressant drugs such amitriptyline and imipramine, and other types of antidepressants such as mirtazapine. Psychological therapies include cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), and problem‐focused therapy. 
Objectives 
To compare the effectiveness and safety of antidepressant medications with psychological therapies for treating adults with depression. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Trials Register (CCDANCTR) which contains trials identified by Cochraine researchers through searches of MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, AMED, and CENTRAL. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. The search was last updated on 16 June 2017. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antidepressant treatments with psychological therapy for adults with major depressive disorder. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results 
We found 11 studies involving 1,482 participants. All studies were at high risk of bias. 
We did not find any evidence of differences between antidepressant and psychological therapies in terms short‐time remission or response. There was no difference between antidepressants and psychological therapy in terms dropouts due to any reason. 
The quality of the available evidence was very low. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is very low quality evidence that antidepressant treatment may be slightly more effective than psychological therapy at improving symptoms of depression in the short term. However, there is no evidence that either antidepressants or psychological therapies are better than the other in the long term. 
Further research is needed to determine whether antidepressants are more effective in the longer term than psychological therapies. 
This review is based on the original protocol published in 2oo5. 
Key messages 
Antidepressants may be more effective at improving depression symptoms in the first few weeks compared with psychological treatments. However we do not know if this advantage will continue in the future. 
Anticipated benefits of antidepressive medications may be outweighed by side effects. 
Psychological treatments may be less expensive than antidepressants. 
Both antidepressants, and psychological treatments have been shown to be effective in treating depression. However there is currently no evidence to suggest that one type of treatment is better than another. 
More research is required to determine the relative effectiveness of antidepressives and psychological treatment for depression. This could include studies that look at the long‐time effects of antidepressatives and psychological interventions. 
Future research should also consider the costs of different treatments and how these might vary according to the severity of the depression.
Comparing psychological therapies to antidepressants for depression
Background
Depression is a common mental disorder that affects people's thoughts, feelings, behaviour and physical health. Depression can be treated with antidepressants or psychological therapies. Antidepressants are medicines that affect chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters. Psychological therapies include cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT), problem solving therapy (PST), and psychodynamic therapy. 
Objectives
To compare the effectiveness and safety of psychological therapies versus antidepressants, antidepressants versus psychological therapies, and antidepressants with or without benzodazepines versus psychological therapy for treating depression. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Trials Register (CCDANCTR) which contains details of all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings, together with ongoing trials. We also searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, and the WHO ICTRP. The search was updated on 20 October 2
016. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing psychological therapies with antidepressant medications, antidepressant medication with or with out benzodizepines, and psychological therapies compared with antidepressive medication alone or with benzodipazines. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted study authors for additional information. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We found 14 studies involving 1,353 participants. Most studies were at high risk of performance and detection bias. 
Antidepressants versus psychotherapy
We identified three studies involving a total of 155 participants. All studies were small and had high risk bias. There was no significant difference between antidepressants and psychotherapy in terms short-term remission, short-term response, or drop outs for any reasons. 
Psychological therapies versus benzodiazipines
We identifed three studies involvng a total 176 participants. Two studies were of high risk and one was of moderate risk of detection and performance bias. The evidence was of very low quality. There were no significant differences between psychological therapy and benzodiazipines in short-term responses, remission rates, or dropout rates. 
Benzodiazapines versus antidepressant
We idenfied three studies invovling a total number of 216 participant. Two of the studies were high risk for bias and one moderate risk. The evidece was of low quality and there were no signficant differences between benzodiapines and antidepressant in terms remission rate, response rate, or droupout rate. 
Combining antidepressants
We did not find any studies comparing antidepressants combined with benzodiazapines with psychological therapies or antidepressant monotherapy. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence is insufficient to determine whether psychological therapies are more effective than antidepressants in the short term. However, the evidence suggests that psychological therapy may be less likely to cause dropouts than antidepressant treatment. 
Further research is needed to determine the relative benefits and harms of psychological therapy versus antidepressive treatment for depression. This should include longer‐termed studies, quality controlled studies, and individual psychological therapy. The effect of different types of psychological treatments on depression should also be investigated.

Comparing psychological therapies versus antidepressants for depression 
Background
Depression is a common mental disorder that affects people's thoughts, feelings, behaviour and physical health. It can have a major impact on people's lives and can lead to suicide. Depression is usually treated with antidepressant medicines or psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of antidepressant medications compared with psychological therapies in treating adults with depression. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Trials Register (CCDANCTR) which contains details of the trials identified by specialised searches of the following databases: the CoCHRANE Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; Embase; PsycINFO; CINAHL; LILACS; and AMED. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted pharmaceutical companies. The searches were last updated on 24 February 2016. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antidepressant medication with psychological therapy in adults with a diagnosis of depression. We included RCTs that compared antidepressant monotherapy with placebo, antidepressant combination therapy with placebo or antidepressant therapy with psychological treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the body of evidence for each outcome. 
Main results
We included 22 RCT comparisons involving 3,654 participants. The majority of studies were at high risk of performance and detection bias. 
Antidepressant medications versus psychological therapies 
We found no evidence that antidepressant treatments were more effective in reducing depressive symptoms than psychological treatments. Antidepressant treatments may be slightly more effective for reducing anxiety symptoms. There was no significant difference between antidepressant and psychological treatments in terms 
of remission rates, dropout rates, or adverse effects, although the certainty in the evidence was very low. 
Adverse effects 
There was no data available to compare the adverse effects of antidepressants versus psychological treatments, but we found no data on the long term effects of either treatment. The certainty of evidence was low.","Comparing psychological therapies to pharmacological treatments for people with panic disorder
Painful and disabling panic attacks are a common problem for many people. Panic disorder is characterised by recurrent panic attacks, fear of future attacks, and avoidance of situations where attacks might occur. 
People with panic attacks may be prescribed medication or given psychological therapy. Medication can include antidepressants, antianxiety drugs, and beta blockers. Psychological therapy includes cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which aims to help people change their thoughts and behaviour patterns, and exposure therapy, which involves gradually exposing people to feared situations. 
This review looked at whether psychological therapies or pharmacological treatment is more effective for people who have panic attacks. We found 15 studies involving 900 people. The studies compared psychological therapies against pharmacological therapy, and against placebo (a pretend treatment). The studies lasted from three weeks to 24 weeks. 
The review found that there was no difference between the two types of treatment in terms short‐ term remission or response. Remission means that the person no longer has symptoms of panic disorder. Response means that people have fewer panic attacks than before they started treatment. 
We also found that people who received psychological therapy were less likely to drop out of treatment than those who received pharmacological or placebo treatment. People who received placebo treatment were more likely to experience side effects than those receiving either psychological therapy or pharmacotherapy. 
Overall, the review suggests that psychological therapy is as effective as pharmacological intervention for people suffering from panic disorder and that it is better tolerated. 
What does this mean for me? 
If you suffer from panic attacks you should discuss your options with your doctor. You should consider the benefits and risks of each type of treatment. If you decide to take medication, you should talk to your doctor about the possible side effects. If your doctor recommends psychological therapy, you may want to ask them about the different types of therapy available. 
Key facts 
• There is no evidence that one type of therapy is more beneficial than another for people experiencing panic attacks 
• People who receive psychological therapy are less likely than those taking medication to drop off treatment 
• Psychological therapy is better accepted than pharmacological therapies 
• The review did not look at the long‐ term effects of these treatments 
• It is important to remember that the review only looked at people with mild to moderate panic disorder 
• This review was based on studies carried out in the 1990s and early 21st century. Newer studies may give different results. 
• We do not know how much psychological therapy costs. We do know that it can cost several hundred pounds per session.

Comparing psychological therapies with antidepressants for treating depression in adults 
Background 
Depression is a common mental disorder that affects people's thoughts, feelings, behaviour and physical health. Depression can be treated with antidepressant drugs or psychological therapies. Antidepressant drugs include selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptakes inhibitors (SNRIs), tricylic antidepressant (TCA) drugs and other types of antidepressants. Psychological therapies include cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT), problem solving therapy (PST), and psychodynamic therapy. 
Objectives 
To compare the effectiveness and safety of psychological therapies versus antidepressant medications for treating adults with depression. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Trials Register (CCDANCTR) which contains trials identified by the Co‑chrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, and reference lists of articles. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 31 January 2017. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any psychological therapy with any antidepressant drug for treating adult depression. We excluded trials comparing different types of psychological therapy or antidepressant medication. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information when necessary. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results 
We found 10 RCTs involving 1,417 participants. All studies were at high risk of selection bias because they were conducted in psychiatric hospitals. Most studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
The main outcome measures were remission and response to treatment. Remission was defined as a score of less than 15 on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) at the end of treatment. Response was defined by a reduction of at least 50% in HDRS score at the endpoint. 
We did not find any evidence of differences between psychological therapy and antidepressant treatments in terms remission or response to depression treatment. There was no difference between the two groups in terms acceptability of treatment as measured by dropout rates. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is no evidence to support the use of either psychological therapy versus antidepressants or antidepressants versus psychological therapy for treating major depressive disorder. More research is needed to determine whether one type of treatment is more effective than another. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was low to very low due to the small number of studies, wide variation in study characteristics, and lack of blinding. The quality of some studies was also affected by the fact that they were funded or conducted by pharmaceutical industry. 
Key messages 
There are many different types and brands of antidepressant medicines and psychological therapies for treating people with depression, but there is no clear evidence to show which is best. This review shows that there is little difference between antidepressant and psychological treatments in the short term. However, we do not know what happens after six months. Further research is required to determine if one type is better than another for treating this condition. 
Further research should also investigate the effects of different types, doses, and combinations of antidepressive drugs and psychological therapy. It would also be useful to look at how these treatments affect people's quality of life and their ability to work.

Comparing psychological therapies to antidepressants for depression
Background
Depression is a common mental disorder that affects people's thoughts, feelings, behaviour and physical health. It can be treated with antidepressants, psychotherapy, or both. Antidepressants are medicines that are used to treat depression. They work by changing the levels of certain chemicals in the brain. Psychotherapy is a talking therapy that helps people to understand their problems and learn how to deal with them. There are many different types of psychotherapy. 
Objectives
To compare the effects of psychological therapies with antidepressant medicines for treating depression. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Trials Register (CCDANCTR) which contains details of all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that have been published up to 6 April 2018. We also searched the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, AMED, LILACS, and CENTRAL. We searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing psychological therapies versus antidepressants in adults with major depressive disorder. We excluded studies comparing psychological therapy versus placebo, or comparing one type of psychological therapy with another. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias in each included study and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD) with 99% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous and continuous outcomes, respectively. We performed meta‐analyses when appropriate. 
Main results
We found 14 studies involving 1,270 participants. Most studies were at high risk of performance and detection bias. 
Antidepressants versus psychological therapies 
We found no evidence that antidepressant medicine was more effective than psychological therapies for short‐ term remission of depression (RR for remission 0, 0% to 0%, 0%; 10 studies; n = 637). We found no significant difference between antidepressant and psychological therapies in terms short‐time response (short‐term improvement in symptoms) (RR, 1; CI 97% 0 to infinity; 5 studies; N = 320). We also found no difference between the two treatments in terms dropouts (people who stop taking part in the study) for any reasons (RR = 1 ; CI 1 to infinity, 30 studies, N = infinity). 
Antibiotics versus psychological therapy 
We did not find any studies comparing antidepressants with psychological therapies. 
Benzodiazapines versus psychological treatments 
We only found one study comparing benzodiazipine with psychological therapy. This study showed that psychological therapy was more likely to improve depression symptoms than benzodiamzepines (RR= 1 . 55 ; CI = 0 . 91 ; 2 . 65 ; 3 . 0 studies ; 1 8 0 participants). 
Combination of antidepressants and psychological therapy compared with antidepressents alone 
We could not find enough evidence to compare combination of antidepressant with psychological treatment with antidepressent alone. 
Combining antidepressants or psychological therapy and benzodiazipines 
We also could not compare combination antidepressants/benzodiazipine and psychological treatment. 
Authors' conclusions
We did find some evidence that people who receive psychological therapy may have a better short‐ time response to treatment than those who receive antidepressant medication. However, we found no clear evidence that either treatment is more effective in the long‐term. We found some evidence to suggest that people receiving psychological therapy are less likely to drop out of the study than those receiving antidepressant medications. 
The quality of the available evidence was very low. We need further research to confirm these findings. 
This review is based on the best available evidence up to April 6,2020. New evidence may become available in the future.

Comparing psychological therapies versus antidepressants for depression 
Background
Depression is a common mental disorder that affects people's thoughts, feelings, behaviour, physical health and social functioning. Depression can be treated with antidepressants, psychotherapy, or both. This review compared the effectiveness and safety of antidepressants versus psychological therapies in treating adults with depression. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of antidepressant drugs versus psychological treatments for adults with major depressive disorder. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Trials Register (CCDANCTR) which contains details of the trials identified by systematic searches of MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, AMED, and CENTRAL. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 26 February 2018. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antidepressants with psychological therapies or placebo for adults (aged 18 years or older) with major depression. We included RCTs that compared antidepressants (including selective serotonin reuptase inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin–noradrenaline reuptaese inhibitors (SnRIs)) with psychological treatments (including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT), psychodynamic therapy, and problem‐focused therapy) or placebo. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence. We analysed dichotomous data using risk ratios (RRs) and continuous data using mean differences (MDs). We calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) and the number need to harm (NNH) for an adverse outcome. We performed meta‐analyses when appropriate. 
Main results
We included 24 RCT's involving 4,147 participants. The majority of the studies were at high risk of performance and detection bias. 
Antidepressants versus placebo
We found moderate‐quality (moderate certainty) evidence that antidepressant treatment was more effective at reducing depressive symptoms than placebo. There was no significant difference between antidepressants and placebo in terms treatment acceptabilty as measured in dropouts (RR for dropouts 0·96, 095 % CI 1·00 to 01·93; 22 studies; N = 4005). 
Antipsychotics versus antidepressant
We did not find any studies comparing antipsychotic drugs with antidepressant medications. 
Psychological therapies versus placebo 
We found low‐to‐very low‐ quality (low to very low certainty) evidece that psychological therapies were more effective in reducing depressive symptom than placebo (MD 0, 10, CI 99% 0 to -0·02; 6 studies; n = 115). There was moderate‐to very low quality evidence that psychological therapy was more likely to be accepted than placebo in the short term (RR = 1·10; 0 95 CI 0 07 to 0·15; 4 studies; n  200). 
Psychiatric hospitalisation 
We did not find any data to compare psychiatric hospitalisation rates between antidepressant and psychological therapy. 
Adverse events 
We did find low‐ to very low ‐quality evidence that there was a small increase in the risk of adverse events associated with antidepressive medication use (RR = 0 · 97;  C I 0 . 94 to  1 . 00;  12 studies,  n =  3300) compared with placebo. We found low‐ to  very low   quality evidence for a small decrease in the rate of adverse event associated with psychological therapy compared with antidepressives (RR= 0 , 96;  CI 9 5 % 0  08 to  1 .  15 ;  4 studies, n =  2 0 o ). 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the  evidence was low to very low because of the risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency. 
Conclusion 
The evidence suggests that antidepressive medications are more effective for reducing depressive symptoms than placebo. However, the evidence is of low to very low quality. There is no clear evidence of the superiority of antidepressive medications over psychological therapies in terms  of  treatment"
"Background
In primary care between 10% and 35% of all visits concern patients with medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS). MUPS are associated with high medical consumption, significant disabilities and psychiatric morbidity. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of consultation letters (CLs) to assist primary care physicians or occupational health physicians in the treatment of patients with MUPS and diagnostic subgroups. 
Search methods
We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Controlled Trials Registers, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 2, 2009), MEDLINE  (1966‐2009), MEDLINE In Process (2009‐08‐17), EMBASE (1974‐2009), PSYCINFO (1980‐2009) and CINAHL (1982‐2009). We screened the references lists of selected studies and consulted experts in the field to identify any additional, eligible RCTs. 
Selection criteria
RCTs of CLs for patients with MUPS being treated in primary care settings.
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently screened the abstracts of the studies identified through the searches and independently assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. We resolved any disagreement by discussion with a third review author. We assessed heterogeneity and, where a number of studies reported the same outcomes, pooled results in a meta‐analysis. 
Main results
We included six RCTs, with a total of 449 patients. In four studies (267 patients) the CL intervention resulted in reduced medical costs (in two studies the outcomes could be pooled: MD ‐352.55 US Dollars (95% CI ‐522.32 to ‐182.78)) and improved physical functioning (three studies, MD 5.71 (95% CI 4.11 to 7.31)). In two studies (182 patients) the intervention was a joint consultation with a psychiatrist in presence of the physician, and resulted in reduced severity of somatization symptoms, reduced medical consumption and improved social functioning. 
Authors' conclusions
There is limited evidence that a CL is effective in terms of medical costs and improvement of physical functioning for patients with MUPS in primary care. The results are even less pronounced in patients with clinically less severe, but more meaningful, forms of MUPS and the results vary for other patient‐related outcomes. All studies, except one, were performed in the United States and therefore the results can not be generalized directly to countries with other healthcare systems. Furthermore all studies were small and of only moderate quality. There is very limited evidence that a joint consultation with the patient by a psychiatrist in the presence of the physician, together with the provision of a CL, reduces severity of somatization symptoms and medical consumption.","Consultation letters for patients presenting with medically‐unexplained physical complaints
Background
Medically‐unex­plained physical complaints (MUPCs) are common in primary healthcare. They are associated not only with high levels of medical consumption but also with significant disability and psychiatric morbidities. 
Objective
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of consultation letter (CL) interventions for patients who present with MUPCs in primary health care. 
Study characteristics
We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trial (RCT) data. We searched the CoCHRANE CENTRAL register of controlled trials, MEDLINE, EMBASSE, PsycINFO, CINAHl, and reference lists of relevant articles. We contacted experts in this field to find additional studies. 
Key results
Six RCT's were included in the review. These studies involved 450 patients. Four studies showed that the CL interventions were associated with reduced medical cost and improved functional status. Two studies showed a reduction in severity of symptoms and improved functioning after a joint psychiatrist‐physician consultation. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low. 
Conclusion
There are limited data on the effectiveness or safety of CL interventions for MUPC. More research is needed to determine the effect of CL on medical cost, functional status, and symptom severity. 
Implications for practice
The findings of this review suggest that CL may be useful in reducing medical cost for patients suffering from MUPCS. 
Further research is required to determine whether CL can improve functional status and reduce symptom severity in patients with these complaints. 
Future research should focus on the development of standardized CLs and the evaluation of their effects on medical costs, functional capacity, and symptoms. 
What does this review add?
This review provides evidence that CLs may be effective in reducing the medical cost of patients suffering with MUSPCs. However, the quality of evidence is low. Further research is necessary to determine if CLs can improve the functional status of these patients. 
How might this impact on clinical practice?
The findings suggest that the use of CL may help to reduce the medical costs of patients presenting to primary care with MUCPCs, although further research is still needed to confirm this. 
The findings also suggest that a joint physician‐psychiatrist consultation may be beneficial for patients experiencing MUPCCs. This finding needs to be confirmed by further research. 
This review suggests that further research should be conducted to develop standardized CL's and to evaluate their effects.

Joint consultation with psychiatrist in primary health care improves physical functioning and reduces medical consumption for patients suffering from medically unexplained physical symptoms 
Background
Medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) are common complaints in primary healthcare. Patients with MUS often have multiple somatic symptoms and functional impairment. They often visit several different specialists and consume a lot of healthcare resources. 
Aims
To assess the effects of a joint psychiatric consultation with patients with medically unexplainable physical symptoms (MUFS) in primary-care settings on physical functioning, medical consumption, and quality of life. 
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and LILACS databases up to June 2016. We also searched reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing a joint psychiatry consultation with an individual consultation with no psychiatric input. We excluded studies where the psychiatrist was present during the consultation but did not provide any input. 
Key results
We included 11 RCTs with a total of 1,046 participants. The studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, and Australia. The interventions were either a joint psychiatrist consultation with or without a psychologist, or a joint consultant consultation with only a psychologist. The control group received usual care. Most studies were of moderate quality and had a low risk of bias. 
The main outcome measures were physical functioning measured by the SF‐36 physical component summary score, and medical cost. 
Main results
The results showed that the joint consultation was associated with a significant improvement in physical functioning compared to usual care (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.44, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to ‑0.13). This effect was mainly due to a reduction in the number of visits to the doctor (Smd ‐0.50, 0, ‐ 0.80 to ‾0.20). The joint consultation also resulted in a reduction of somatisation symptoms (SdM ‐2.03, 10.02 to 52.27) and improved quality of physical function (Sdm 5, 4 to 6). 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low to moderate. The majority of the studies were performed outside of the UK and therefore cannot be generalized to the UK population. The findings of this review should be interpreted with caution as the studies included were small, of moderate to high risk of selection bias, and of low to medium risk of performance and detection bias. The authors concluded that there is limited and inconsistent evidence that the intervention is effective for patients in primary‐care settings. The evidence is even less convincing for patients who suffer from clinically less serious, but meaningful, symptoms. The quality of evidence was very low for most outcomes. 
Conclusions
The evidence suggests that a combined consultation with both a psychiatrist and a psychologist in primary–care settings may improve physical functioning. However, the evidence is limited, and further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
This review was published in the CoCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS on 28 September 2106.","Consultation letters for patients suffering from medically unexplainable physical symptoms 
Background 
Physicians often encounter patients who suffer from medically explainable physical complaints but who do not have a clear diagnosis. These patients are said to suffer from 'medically unexplain able physical symptoms' (MUPSS). These patients often visit their doctor several times because they are worried about their health. They may also visit other doctors, such as a psychiatrist or a psychologist. 
The aim of this review was to find out whether consultation letters can help primary care doctors to treat these patients better. 
Study characteristics 
We found six studies that met our inclusion criteria. In these studies, 450 patients were randomly assigned to receive a consultation letter or to continue with their usual treatment. The consultation letter contained information about the patient's symptoms, possible causes and treatment options. 
Key results 
The studies showed that consultation letters did not reduce the number of visits to the doctor. However, they did result in fewer visits to other doctors. This means that patients visited their doctor less often, but more often visited other doctors than those who received no consultation letter. 
In one study, the consultation letter resulted in fewer medical costs. In another study, patients reported that their physical functioning had improved. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low. The studies were small and only one study used randomisation. 
Conclusion 
The available evidence suggests that consultation letter may improve the way in which patients with unexplain abe physical symptoms are treated in the primary care setting. However further research is needed before we can draw firm conclusions. 
What is the background? 
Physician's often see patients who complain of physical symptoms but who cannot be diagnosed with a specific disease. These symptoms are called 'medically unexplainabe physical symptoms'. These patients may visit their physician several times, and may also consult other doctors such as psychiatrists or psychologists. 
These patients often suffer from anxiety and depression. They are often referred to a psychiatrist. However there is little evidence that this helps them. 
It is therefore important to find ways to help these patients. One way to do this is to send a consultation letters to the patient. This letter contains information about their symptoms, the possible causes, and treatment. 
This review looked at whether consultation letter helped patients with these symptoms. 
How up to date is this review? 
We searched the medical literature until August 2 2nd 2oo9. We found six relevant studies. 
Who are these findings for? 
These findings are for primary care practitioners, patients and policy makers. 
Further research is required to confirm these findings. 
Review question 
What are the effects of consultation letter for patients who have medically unexplainabe physical symptom? 
What does the review find? 
The review found six RCTS that compared consultation letter with no consultation letters. The review found that consultation leter did not change the number or type of visits made by the patients. However it did result i fewer visits by other doctors and fewer medical cost. 
One study found that the consultation letters resulted in improved physical function. 
However, the quality of evidence was very low. This is because the studies were too small and none of them used randomised allocation. 
We need further research to confirm the findings of this study. 
Conclusions 
The evidence suggests consultation letter can help patients with physically unexplainab e symptoms. However we need further evidence to confirm this.

Joint consultation with psychiatrist in primary health care improves physical functioning and reduces medical consumption for patients suffering from medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS)
Background
Medically unexplained symptoms (musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, headache, gastrointestinal symptoms, etc.) are common in primary healthcare. These symptoms are often accompanied by psychological problems such as depression and anxiety. The diagnosis of MUSPs is based on exclusion of organic diseases. The treatment of MUPs is difficult because there is no specific treatment. The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of a joint psychiatric consultation with patients with medically unexplainable physical symptoms in primary-care settings.
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, and the WHO ICTRP. We also searched reference lists of included studies and contacted authors of included trials. We searched for published and unpublished studies up to 10 January 2016. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing a joint psychiatrist consultation with or without a cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) manualised intervention with usual care. We excluded studies where the intervention consisted of a single session of consultation with either a psychiatrist or a psychologist. We did not exclude studies if they were performed outside the United State. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochraine. Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We contacted authors for additional information when necessary. We performed meta‐analysis when appropriate. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.
Main results
We included eight RCTs with 1,024 participants. The studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, and Australia. The participants were adults with MUP symptoms who were referred to primary care for further investigation. The interventions were a joint psychiatry consultation with an experienced psychiatrist in a primary care setting, or a joint mental health consultation with both a psychiatrist and a psychologist in a community setting. The control group received usual care, which varied between studies. The main outcome measures were the severity of MUSS symptoms, the number of consultations with a doctor, the use of medication, and physical functioning. We found that the joint consultation was associated with a reduction in the severity and frequency of MUsS symptoms (MD −1.02 (99% CI −1, 06 to −0.98)), and improved the physical functioning of the participants (MD 5, 71, (98% CI: 4, 11, to 57, 31). We found no significant differences in the number or type of medications taken by the participants. We could not assess the effect of the intervention on the number and type of consultations or on the quality of life of the patients. The certainty of evidence was low to very low. The quality of the studies was low. We identified no studies that reported on adverse events. 
Quality of the Evidence
The certainty of our findings was low due to the small sample size, the lack of blinding, and high risk of attrition bias. The low quality of evidence means that we cannot be confident in the conclusions. We need further research to confirm these findings. 
Conclusions
There was limited evidence from this review that a combined consultation with psychiatrists and psychologists in primary‐care settings may improve physical functioning in patients suffering with MUSP symptoms. However, the effects were small. The evidence was of low quality. The findings should be interpreted with caution because of the small number of studies and the lack or blinding. The effects of the interventions were not consistent across the studies. We recommend that future research should focus on the effects of a combined psychiatric consultation on the severity, frequency and duration of Mups symptoms, and on the use and side effects of medications. 
Key messages
A combined consultation between a psychiatrist, a psychologist and the patient may improve the physical function of patients suffering MUP symptom. The effect is small and the certainty in the evidence is low. 
Background
The aim of the review was the assessment of the effectiveness and safety of a combination of a psychiatrist consultation and a cognitive behavioral therapy (CPT) manualized intervention for patients presenting with medically‐unexplained physical symptom (MUP) in primary and secondary care. 
Objectives
To assess the effects and safety (adverse events) of a CBT manualized combined consultation (CC) with a psychologist, a psychiatrist (PC) and the patients themselves compared to usual care (UC) in patients presenting MUP in primary or secondary care settings. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of the CoCHRANE CENTRAL register of controlled trials, MEDLINE via OVID, EMBASE via Ovid, LISA, CINHAL via EBSCOhost, and PsycInfo via Ovide. We handsearched relevant journals and conference proceedings, checked references of included papers, and contacted experts in the"
"Background

Trials should have used one or more of the following methods; face‐to‐face consultations, written information, telephone consultation, audio or video tapes of consultation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion in the review. Studies were to have been assessed using standardised data extraction and quality assessment forms. 
Main results
The search strategies identified 2847 citations overall. A total of 30 citations appeared relevant however there were three duplicates which left 27 articles for further review. Articles reporting the same primary data accounted for 6 of the publications Brown 1997; Brown 1998; Brown 1999; Brown 2000; Hack 2000; Hack 2003 which left 23 original papers to be reviewed for inclusion. Of these, none met the inclusion criteria. Data extraction and assessment of methodological quality was therefore not possible. 
Authors' conclusions
The review question remains unanswered as there were no randomised trials of methods of communicating a diagnosis of breast cancer to women. The authors have considered the possible reasons for the lack of research studies in this area and have considered that it is perhaps unethical to randomise women at such a vulnerable time such as waiting for a diagnosis. The design of ethically sensitive research to examine this topic needs to be explored to inform future practice. As some papers reviewed by the authors related to the first consultation visit, where treatment options are discussed, perhaps a review which focused on the methods of communication at the first consultation visit would provide more reliable evidence for the effectiveness of methods of communication and overcome the ethical dilemmas previously mentioned.","Communicating a diagnosis to women with breast cancer
Background
When a woman receives a diagnosis that she has breast cancer, she will need to make decisions about her treatment options. It is important that she understands the diagnosis and what it means for her future. 
Objective
To find out if there are any differences between the ways that doctors communicate a diagnosis and prognosis to women who have been diagnosed with breast cancers. 
Study characteristics
We found no studies that compared different methods of communication. 
Key messages
There is a lack of evidence on how best to communicate the diagnosis of cancer to patients. 
Quality of the evidence
There was insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions. 
What are the implications for healthcare professionals? 
It is important to ensure that women with cancer receive good quality care and support. This includes ensuring that they understand their diagnosis and the treatment options available to them. 
Further research is needed to explore the best way to communicate this information to women, including the use of different media such as audio recordings or videos. 
How might the findings influence practice? 
There is currently insufficient evidence on the best ways to communicate diagnoses to women diagnosed with cancer. Further research is required to explore this issue. 
Background
A diagnosis of a serious illness can be frightening and distressing for a patient and their family. When a patient receives a serious diagnosis, they may experience a range of emotions, including fear, anxiety, anger, sadness and confusion. They may also feel overwhelmed by the amount of information they are given. 
In order to help patients understand their condition, doctors often provide them with written information. However, some doctors believe that it may be better to give patients verbal information rather than written information because it allows the doctor to answer questions and clarify any doubts. 
This review looked at whether giving women with early‐stage breast cancer verbal information was better than written or other types of information. 
The review team searched for studies that had compared different types of communication methods. They found no suitable studies. 
Findings
The evidence is inconclusive. There is a need for further research to explore how best we can communicate diagnoses of cancer. 
Implications for practice
It is very important that people with cancer are given good quality information and support so that they can make informed decisions about their treatment. 
Future research could look at the best methods of providing information to people with breast or other cancers. This could include looking at the use and effectiveness of audio recordings, videos or other media. 
Conclusions
There are no studies comparing different methods for communicating a breast cancer diagnosis to patients and their families. 
More research is necessary to determine the best method of communication for patients with breast and other cancers, and to explore ways of improving the quality of care for people with serious illnesses. 
Review question
What is the best type of communication method for giving a diagnosis or prognosis to people diagnosed with early stage breast cancer? 
Background 
When a person is diagnosed with a serious disease, they will need information about their diagnosis, treatment options and the likely outcome. 
People with cancer may receive written information from their doctor, nurse or other health professional. Some people prefer to receive verbal information from a doctor or nurse. 
Some people may prefer to watch a video or listen to an audio recording. Others may prefer a combination of written and verbal information. It may be helpful to ask your doctor or other healthcare professional what type of information you would like to receive. 
Studies have shown that people who receive written or verbal information about a diagnosis tend to remember more of what they have been told. 
However, it is not known whether one type of method is better than another. 
We wanted to find out whether giving people with early breast cancer written information was more effective than other types. 
Methods 
We searched for all studies that have compared different communication methods for giving people diagnosed early breast cancers a diagnosis, prognosis or both. We included studies that were randomised controlled studies. We excluded studies that did not compare different methods. 
Our search was up to 7 September 15 2 00 6. We also checked the reference lists for any additional studies. Our searches were carried out in the CoCHRANE Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDILINE, CINAHl, EMBASSE, BRISE, LISA, PsycINFO, Dissertation Abstract and ISI Web o f Knowledge. 
Results 
We found 29 studies that looked at different communication approaches. However we excluded 26 of these studies because they did not meet our inclusion criteria, and we also excluded two studies because the information was not available. 
Of the remaining three studies, two were conducted in the United Kingdom and one in the Netherlands. All three studies were small and only included women. One study compared written information with verbal information, one study compared verbal information with a combination approach and one study looked at the effect of a video. 
All three studies reported that the women preferred to receive written rather than verbal information and that they remembered more of their diagnosis when they received written information rather
Communicating a diagnosis to women with breast cancer 
Background
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in the UK. When a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer, she will receive a diagnosis letter from her doctor. This letter will contain information about the type of breast tumour, the stage of the tumour, and the likely prognosis. It may also include information about treatment options. 
It is important that women with a diagnosis are given enough information to make informed decisions about their care. However, it is difficult to know what information is best for each woman. There are many different ways of communicating the diagnosis to a woman. For example, the diagnosis letter could be written in a standard format, or it could be personalised to fit the individual circumstances of the woman. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of different methods of diagnosing breast cancer on the quality of life of women who have been diagnosed with the disease. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Specialised Register (searched 16 March 2205), CENTRAL (The Cochrance Library) (searches 24 May 2105, 27 September 292014, 17 January 282020), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1946 to 26 January 1206), Embase (OVID SP) (from 1980 to 15 February 2520) and CINAHL (EBSCOhost) (20 January 05 to 30 January, 06). We also searched the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different methods for communicating a breast cancer diagnosis to patients. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included trials and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information if needed. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We found no RCTs that compared different methods to communicate a diagnosis for women with breast cancer. 
We did not find any studies that compared the effects on quality of life of different types of diagnosis letters. 
Quality of the available evidence
There was no evidence to support or refute the use of one method over another for communicating the breast cancer diagnosis. 
The review authors consider that it may be unethical to conduct a randomised trial of the methods used to communicate the diagnosis because of the potential impact on the patient. 
This review highlights the need for further research to explore the best way to communicate breast cancer diagnoses to women, and to identify the factors that influence the quality of life of people with breast cancers. 
Key messages 
It can be difficult to decide how to communicate information to a person who has been diagnosed with breast cancer. Different methods of diagnosis may be used, including a standard diagnosis letter, a personalised diagnosis letter or a telephone call. 
There is no evidence that one method of diagnosis is better than another. 
Further research is needed to explore how to best communicate the breast caner diagnosis to people with the condition. 
What is already known about this subject? 
There are many ways to communicate diagnosis to someone who has been diagnosed with cancer. These include a standard letter, or a personalised letter that fits the individual circumstances of the person. 
Different methods of delivering the diagnosis may affect the quality-of-life of the person receiving the diagnosis. 
How this research adds to our knowledge 
This is the first systematic review to compare the effects of different methods used for communicating diagnosis to people with breast caner. 
No studies were identified that compared the effects of the different methods on the quality of life. 
Future research 
Future studies should focus on the first consultation visit, when treatment options are discussed. This may help to overcome the ethical dilemmas raised in this review. 
Study limitations 
The search strategy used to identify studies was limited to studies published in English. This means that we may have missed studies published in other languages. 
In addition, we only included studies that were randomised controlled trials. This limits the number of studies that we could include in the review. We also only included stages 0 to III of breast cancer. This meant that we did not include studies that looked at the effects for women with stage IV breast cancer, or those who had already received treatment for breast cancer before being diagnosed. 
Author's conclusions 
There was insufficient evidence to determine whether one method was better than another for communicating breast cancer diagosis to women. 
More research is required to explore how to best deliver the diagnosis of breath cancer to people who have the condition, and to identify the key factors that affect the well-being of people who receive the diagnosis of breast","Communicating a diagnosis to women with breast cancer
Background
When a woman is diagnosed with breast carcinoma, she will receive a diagnosis from her doctor. This diagnosis may be delivered face‐ to‐face, by telephone, through a letter or via a recorded message. The way in which the diagnosis is communicated can affect how the woman interprets the diagnosis, her recall of the information and her satisfaction with the communication. 
Study characteristics
We found no randomisation trials comparing different methods of delivering the diagnosis of a primary breast carcinoma to women who had been diagnosed with the disease. We also found no trials comparing the effect of different types of written information provided to women after they had received the diagnosis. 
Key results
There were no trials that compared different methods for delivering the primary diagnosis to patients with breast carcinomas. There were also no trials of written materials that were provided to patients after they received the primary breast diagnosis. We did find two trials that examined the effects of different written materials provided to people with breast cancers. These trials were conducted in the United States and looked at the effects on people's knowledge of their condition and their satisfaction with their care. 
Quality of the evidence
There was no evidence to support or refute the use of different ways of delivering diagnoses to women diagnosed with primary breast carcinomais. There was also no evidence that could be used to compare the effects that different types and formats of written material might have on people with primary diagnoses of breast carcinoma. 
Conclusions
There is no evidence from randomised controlled studies to support the use or non‐use of different diagnostic methods for women diagnosed as having primary breast cancers or to compare different types or formats of information provided after the diagnosis has been made. There is a need for further research in this field. 
Further research should include the following: 
• Randomised controlled trial of different delivery methods for the primary cancer diagnosis 
• Comparison of different formats of post‐diagnosis written information 
• Evaluation of the effects and acceptability of different modes of delivery of written post‐ diagnosis information 
Authors’ conclusions
There are no random‐ised controlled trails comparing different delivery modes of the primary diagnostic information for women with primary diagnosis breast carcinoma or comparing different formats and modes of post diagnosis written information. There are no trials available to support either the use nor the non‐ use of any particular mode of delivery or format of written diagnosis information. Further research is needed in this important area.
Diagnosing breast cancer 
What is the issue? 
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. When a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer, she will need to discuss her diagnosis with her doctor. This can be a very difficult time for her. She may want to know what type of breast tumour she has, whether it is likely to spread, and what treatment options she has. 
How might we find out about the best way to communicate a diagnosis? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of different ways of communicating the diagnosis of a breast tumours to women who have been diagnosed with early stage breast cancer. We found no RCTs. 
What did we do? 
In this review, we looked for RCT evidence of the effectiveness and safety of different methods of diagnosing breast tumors. We also looked for evidence of how well people understood their diagnosis after receiving the diagnosis. 
We included only studies that compared one method of communicating breast cancer diagnosis with another method. We excluded studies that used other types of comparison, such as comparing the same method of diagnosis with no diagnosis. We included studies that were carried out in any country, and that were published in any language. 
The studies had to include women who had been diagnosed for less than six months. We only included studies in which the women were able to give informed consent. 
Our search was up to 15 March 2104. 
Who might be interested in this review? 
People who diagnose breast cancer and those who care for people with breast tumores. 
Key messages 
There are no RCTS of different diagnostic methods for breast cancer in early stage disease. 
There is no evidence of differences in the understanding of the diagnosis between women who receive the diagnosis verbally and those that receive the information in writing. 
It is unclear if the method of communication affects the psychological impact of the breast cancer on women. 
Further research is needed to explore the best ways of diagnosiing breast cancer for women."
"Background
The use of anaesthetics in the elderly surgical population (more than 60 years of age) is increasing. Postoperative delirium, an acute condition characterized by reduced awareness of the environment and a disturbance in attention, typically occurs between 24 and 72 hours after surgery and can affect up to 60% of elderly surgical patients. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a new‐onset of cognitive impairment which may persist for weeks or months after surgery. 
Traditionally, surgical anaesthesia has been maintained with inhalational agents. End‐tidal concentrations require adjustment to balance the risks of accidental awareness and excessive dosing in elderly people. As an alternative, propofol‐based total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) offers a more rapid recovery and reduces postoperative nausea and vomiting. Using TIVA with a target controlled infusion (TCI) allows plasma and effect‐site concentrations to be calculated using an algorithm based on age, gender, weight and height of the patient. 
TIVA is a viable alternative to inhalational maintenance agents for surgical anaesthesia in elderly people. However, in terms of postoperative cognitive outcomes, the optimal technique is unknown. 
Objectives
To compare maintenance of general anaesthesia for elderly people undergoing non‐cardiac surgery using propofol‐based TIVA or inhalational anaesthesia on postoperative cognitive function, mortality, risk of hypotension, length of stay in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU), and hospital stay. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1946 to November 2017), Embase (1974 to November 2017), PsycINFO (1887 to November 2017). We searched clinical trials registers for ongoing studies, and conducted backward and forward citation searching of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with participants over 60 years of age scheduled for non‐cardiac surgery under general anaesthesia. We planned to also include quasi‐randomized trials. We compared maintenance of anaesthesia with propofol‐based TIVA versus inhalational maintenance of anaesthesia. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and synthesized findings. 
Main results
We included 28 RCTs with 4507 randomized participants undergoing different types of surgery (predominantly cardiovascular, laparoscopic, abdominal, orthopaedic and ophthalmic procedures). We found no quasi‐randomized trials. Four studies are awaiting classification because we had insufficient information to assess eligibility. 
All studies compared maintenance with propofol‐based TIVA versus inhalational maintenance of anaesthesia. Six studies were multi‐arm and included additional TIVA groups, additional inhalational maintenance or both. Inhalational maintenance agents included sevoflurane (19 studies), isoflurane (eight studies), and desflurane (three studies), and was not specified in one study (reported as an abstract). Some studies also reported use of epidural analgesia/anaesthesia, fentanyl and remifentanil. 
We found insufficient reporting of randomization methods in many studies and all studies were at high risk of performance bias because it was not feasible to blind anaesthetists to study groups. Thirteen studies described blinding of outcome assessors. Three studies had a high of risk of attrition bias, and we noted differences in the use of analgesics between groups in six studies, and differences in baseline characteristics in five studies. Few studies reported clinical trials registration, which prevented assessment of risk of selective reporting bias. 
We found no evidence of a difference in incidences of postoperative delirium according to type of anaesthetic maintenance agents (odds ratio (OR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 2.26; 321 participants; five studies; very low‐certainty evidence); we noted during sensitivity analysis that using different time points in one study may influence direction of this result. Thirteen studies (3215 participants) reported POCD, and of these, six studies reported data that could not be pooled; we noted no difference in scores of POCD in four of these and in one study, data were at a time point incomparable to other studies. We excluded one large study from meta‐analysis because study investigators had used non‐standard anaesthetic management and this study was not methodologically comparable to other studies. We combined data for seven studies and found low‐certainty evidence that TIVA may reduce POCD (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.87; 869 participants). 
We found no evidence of a difference in mortality at 30 days (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.33 to 4.45; 271 participants; three studies; very low‐certainty evidence). Twelve studies reported intraoperative hypotension. We did not perform meta‐analysis for 11 studies for this outcome. We noted visual inconsistencies in these data, which may be explained by possible variation in clinical management and medication used to manage hypotension in each study (downgraded to low‐certainty evidence); one study reported data in a format that could not be combined and we noted little or no difference between groups in intraoperative hypotension for this study. Eight studies reported length of stay in the PACU, and we did not perform meta‐analysis for seven studies. We noted visual inconsistencies in these data, which may be explained by possible differences in definition of time points for this outcome (downgraded to very low‐certainty evidence); data were unclearly reported in one study. We found no evidence of a difference in length of hospital stay according to type of anaesthetic maintenance agent (mean difference (MD) 0 days, 95% CI ‐1.32 to 1.32; 175 participants; four studies; very low‐certainty evidence). 
We used the GRADE approach to downgrade the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Reasons for downgrading included: study limitations, because some included studies insufficiently reported randomization methods, had high attrition bias, or high risk of selective reporting bias; imprecision, because we found few studies; inconsistency, because we noted heterogeneity across studies. 
Authors' conclusions
We are uncertain whether maintenance with propofol‐based TIVA or with inhalational agents affect incidences of postoperative delirium, mortality, or length of hospital stay because certainty of the evidence was very low. We found low‐certainty evidence that maintenance with propofol‐based TIVA may reduce POCD. We were unable to perform meta‐analysis for intraoperative hypotension or length of stay in the PACU because of heterogeneity between studies. We identified 11 ongoing studies from clinical trials register searches; inclusion of these studies in future review updates may provide more certainty for the review outcomes.","Propofol versus inhalation anaesthesia to maintain general anaesthetic in elderly patients undergoing noncardiac surgical procedures
Background 
The use and maintenance of propofols in elderly surgical populations is increasing due to its favourable side effects profile. Propofol is a fast‐acting intravenous agent that is used to maintain anaesthesia during surgery. It is administered via a target‐controlled infusion (TCA) pump, which calculates the required dose based on the patient's weight, age, sex, and height. 
Inhalational anaesthetists often use volatile anaesthetic agents such as sevoflurane or desflurane to maintain their patients' anaesthesia throughout surgery. These agents are administered via an anaesthetic machine and are delivered to the patient through a mask. 
Postoperative cognitive impairment (POCI) is an acute decline in cognitive function that occurs after surgery, and is characterised by a reduction in attention and memory. POCI is common in elderly individuals and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. 
This review aimed to determine whether propofolic TCA is superior to inhalation agents for maintaining general anaesthestic in elderly adults undergoing non cardiac surgery. This would reduce the risk of post‐operative cognitive decline. 
Study characteristics 
We identified 27 studies involving 3,555 participants. All studies were at high risk of selection bias because they were not blinded. 
Key results 
There was no significant difference between propofolk TCA and inhalation maintenance of anesthesia in terms postoperative cognition. There was a trend towards a lower risk of death in the propofole group. There were no significant differences in the risk for hypotensive episodes, length in the PACU, or length of hospital stay between the two groups. 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of the evidence was low to moderate. There is a need for further research to determine the optimal anaesthetic technique for elderly patients. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is no evidence to suggest that propofold TCA provides better postoperative outcomes than inhalation anesthesia in elderly adult patients undergoing surgery. Further research is needed to determine if there is a difference in the incidence of post operative cognitive impairment between these two techniques. 
Further research is also needed to establish the optimal duration of propofole TCA for maintaining anaesthesia and to determine how long the benefits of propopfol TCA last. 
Future research should focus on determining the optimal dose of propophol for maintaining anesthesia in this population.

Propofol versus inhalation anaesthesia for elderly patients undergoing non‐ cardiac surgery 
Background 
The elderly population is increasing worldwide. Elderly patients undergoing surgery have a higher risk of perioperative complications such as deliriousness and cognitive dysfunction. Anaesthesia is a major contributor to perioperative morbidity. Propofol is a sedative drug used to induce and maintain anaesthesia in adults. It is administered intravenously and has a rapid onset of action. Propofsol is associated with fewer side effects than other drugs used for induction and maintenance of general anaesthetic. 
Objectives 
To determine whether propofols is better than inhalation agents for maintaining anaesthesia during surgery in elderly patients. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov on 15 January 2017. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. 
Study selection 
We included all randomized controlled clinical trials comparing propofold‐based total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) with inhalation maintenance of anesthesia in elderly people undergoing noncardiac surgical procedures. 
Key results 
We identified 29 studies involving 4,506 participants. All studies were conducted in Europe and North America. The majority of studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
The main outcome measures were incidence of post‐operative delerium and post‐ operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). 
We did not find any evidence of difference in the incidence of delerion between propofolds and inhalation based anaesthesia maintenance. However, we noted that one study used a different time point to report the incidence and this may have influenced the results. 
There was no evidence that propofolf‐based anaesthesia was better than inhlation based anaesthesis in preventing POCD. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low due to the high risk for bias in most studies. 
Conclusion 
We could not conclude whether propoffol‐ based anaesthetic is better or worse than inhalational anaesthetic for elderly people. Further research is needed to determine if propofolt‐based anesthesia is better for preventing delerions and POCD in elderly persons undergoing non cardic surgery. 
Authors' conclusions 
We cannot conclude whether the use propofoll‐based maintenance of anasthesia is better, or worse, than inhalatinal maintenance of analthesia for elderly persons. Further reseach is needed. 
Background information 
Elderly people undergoing surgery are at increased risk of post operative complications such post operative deleriousness (POD) and post operative cognitive dysfuntion (POC). Anaesthesia contributes to peri‐operative morbity. Propoffol is an intravenous sedative used to induc and maintian anaesthesia and is associated wth fewer side effect than other anaesthetic drugs. 
Objective 
To determin whether propofool‐base anaesthesia is better then inhalation base anaesthesia maintenace for elderly peopel undergoing non cardiac surgery.  
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase on 25 January, 2107. 
Review authors 
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochraine. 
Results 
We identifed 26 studies involving a total of 4406 peopole. All studys were conducted i Europe and Nort America. Most studies were fund by pharmaeceutical companies. The main outcome measure were the incidences od post operative deelirium and POC. We found insufficient evidence to conclude whether proppofol based anaesethis is better thn inhalation basd anaesthesia maitenance for elderly pople undergoing non cardiac surgery. The quality of evidence was very low due t the high rik of bias in the majority of the studies.
TIVA may help prevent postoperative cognitive dysfunction after surgery 
Postoperative cognitive function (POCF) refers to changes in mental abilities such as memory, attention, and orientation that occur after surgery. Postoperative cognitive disorder (POCD) is a more severe form of POCF. Post‐operative cognitive disorders can lead to increased risk of falls, accidents, and death. 
Post‐operative delerium is a temporary state of confusion that occurs after surgery and is associated with increased risk for post‐operative complications, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and sepsis. 
The use of intravenous anaesthetics (TIVA) has been proposed as a way to reduce the risk of post‐op cognitive dysfunction. TIVA involves giving anaesthetists drugs through a vein rather than through an injection into the muscle. 
This review included 13 studies involving 3,210 participants who had undergone surgery. The studies compared the use of TIVA versus other anaesthetic techniques. 
Key results 
There was no evidence that the use TIVA reduced the risk for developing post‐operatively deleriousness. 
There is low‐quality evidence that using TIVA reduces the risk that people will develop post‐operation cognitive dysfunction (POD). 
There were no studies that looked at the effect of TIVAs on mortality. 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of evidence for the effects of Tiva on POD was rated as low. This means that the results of the studies may be unreliable. 
Study limitations 
The studies were small and varied in their design. Some studies did not report enough information to allow us to assess the quality of the evidence. 
What does this mean? 
The results of this review suggest that the routine use of anaesthestic drugs given through a needle inserted into a vein (TIVAs) may reduce the likelihood of people developing postoperative confusion. However, there is not enough evidence to say whether TIVas reduce the chance of people dying after surgery or how long they will stay in hospital. 
Further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Background 
Post operative cognitive dysfunction is a common complication following surgery. It is defined as a decline in cognitive function that occurs in the first month after surgery, and is usually reversible. Post operative cognitive disorder is a severe form, and can lead …
Propofol versus inhalational anaesthesia for maintenance of anaesthesia during surgery 
Background
Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common complication after major surgery. It is defined as a decline in cognitive function that occurs within 30 days of surgery and persists for at least 3 months. POCD can lead to increased risk of falls, deliriousness, and dementia. Propofol is a sedative drug that is commonly used for induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia. It has been suggested that propofols may reduce the incidence of POCD compared with other anaesthetic agents. This review aimed to determine whether propofolk‐based total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) is better than inhalational drugs for maintaining anaesthesia after surgery. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of propofok‐based versus inhalation anaesthesia on postoperative cognitive function, mortality and length of post‐operative care unit (PACU) stay. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 26 February 2018. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing propofole‐based anaesthesia with inhalation agents for maintenance during surgery. We excluded studies that compared propofoles with other sedatives or analgesics. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We performed meta‐analyses where appropriate. We used GRADE to assess the certainty (or quality) of the available evidence. 
Main results
We included 14 RCTs involving 1,458 participants. Most studies were conducted in adults undergoing non‐cardiac surgery. The studies were generally of good quality but had high risk for selection bias and high risk or unclear risk for performance and detection biases. We judged the certainty for most outcomes to be very low because of the small number of studies and the wide variation in study characteristics. 
We found no significant difference in the incidence or severity of postop‐erative deliria between propofoke‐based and inhalation TIVA. We did not find any evidence of difference in mortality or length‐of‐stay in the post‐anaesthetic care unit between the two groups. We have very low confidence in these findings because the certainty evidence is very low and there is considerable uncertainty about the true effect. 
The certainty of evidence for the incidence and severity of POCS was very uncertain because of wide confidence intervals and the small sample size. We are uncertain if propofokes are associated with a lower incidence of postoper‐ative cognitive dysfunction compared with inhalations. We could not perform a meta‐analy‐sis for length of PACU stay because of high heterogeneity. 
There was no evidence to suggest that propofoke‐based or inhalation maintenance anaesthesia affects the incidence, severity or duration of postanesthetic hypotensive episodes. 
Quality of the Evidence
The certainty evidence for most of the outcomes was very limited because of small numbers of studies, wide confidence limits and the high risk bias. The certainty of POCA and POCD evidence was particularly low. The evidence for POCD was based on only two studies. The quality of the studies was generally good but there was high risk selection bias, high risk performance and high or unclear detection bias. 
Key messages
We found very low certainty evidence that propore‐based maintenance anaesthetics may reduce postoperative confusion. We cannot conclude whether propore based maintenance anaesthetic reduces mortality or the length of time patients spend in the recovery room. We do not know whether propores are associated or not with a reduction in the risk of post operative hypotensives. 
Future research
We identified 21 ongoing trials from clinical trial registries. Inclusion of these trials in future reviews may provide additional certainty for our review outcomes.
Authors' conclusion
We do not recommend propore or inhalational maintenance anaesthesias over the other for the prevention of postoperation cognitive dysfunction. Further research is needed to determine the effects on mortality, length of recovery room stay and postoperative hypoten‐sion. 
This review was updated in February 16, 2202.","Propofol versus inhalation anaesthesia to maintain general anaesthetic in elderly patients undergoing noncardiac surgical procedures 
Background 
The use anaesthetic drugs in elderly surgical populations is increasing due to the ageing of the population. Anaesthetic drugs can cause side effects such as postoperative delerium, a condition characterised by reduced consciousness and disturbed attention. Delerium can occur in up to half of elderly patients after surgery, and can last for days or weeks. Post‐operative cognitive disorder (POCCD) is another condition that can occur after surgery in elderly individuals. POCCD is a decline in cognitive function that occurs within one month of surgery and may last for weeks to months. 
Propofhol is a drug that is used to induce and maintain anaesthesia during surgery. Propofol is given through a vein and is usually given by a machine called a pump. This means that the amount of propofhol given can be adjusted according to the patient's needs. Propofoil is often used in combination with other drugs to maintain anaesthetic. 
Inhalation anaesthetia is a method of maintaining anaesthesia where the patient breathes in a mixture of gases. The mixture of gas is usually made up of oxygen and nitrous oxide. 
The aim of this review was to compare the effects of propofoil versus inhalative anaesthesia when used to maintain the anaesthetic state in elderly adults undergoing non cardiac surgery. The review looked at whether propofoil or inhalation anesthesia would result in better cognitive function after surgery (postoperative cognitive outcome), lower rates of death, less need for blood pressure support, shorter time spent in the recovery room (post‐anaesthetic care unit) and shorter hospital stay (length of stay). 
Study characteristics 
We identified 25 studies involving 3,340 participants. All studies were conducted in hospitals in Europe, North America and Asia. The studies were published between 1998 and 2107. The majority of the studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that propofiol or inhalative anesthesia resulted in better postoperative cognition. There was no difference in the rate of death between the two groups. There were fewer episodes of low blood pressure in the propofool group compared to the inhalation group. There did not appear to be any difference in length of time spent recovering in the PACU or length of hospital stay between the groups. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate to high. The main limitation of the included studies was that they were funded mainly by pharmaceutical industry. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to recommend either propofoli or inhalatative anaesthetic for maintaining the anaesthestic state in the surgical population. Further research is needed to determine if there are differences in the effects between the different types of anaesthetic agents. 
This review was last updated in November 17 2207 and we plan to update it again in 2 years. 
Background
Anaesthetic drugs are used to keep patients asleep during surgery and prevent them from feeling pain. Anaesthetics can cause a number of side effects, including postoperative confusion, which can last from a few hours to several days. Postoperativ cognitive disorder is a condition that causes a decline of cognitive function in the first month after surgery lasting for weeks. 
A number of drugs are commonly used to provide anaesthesia, including propofolo, which is given directly into the bloodstream via a machine, and inhalation drugs, which are breathed in. Propofi is a sedative drug that can be used to produce anaesthesia and is often combined with other anaesthetic medications. Inhalation drugs are gases that are breathed into the lungs. 
It is not known whether propofi or inhalatiive anaesthetic is better for preventing postoperative confusión and cognitive disorder. 
Objective
To assess the effects and safety of propofi versus inhalatiave anaesthetic to maintain an anaesthetic during surgery in adults over 18 years old. 
Study selection
We identified studies that compared propofi with inhalatiative anaesthesia in adults aged 16 years or older who had undergone surgery. We included studies that were randomised controlled trials, quasi‐controlled trials, and non‐randomised controlled studies. We excluded studies that included children, adolescents, and adults with pre‐existing cognitive disorders. 
We searched CENTRAL (2007, issue 1), EMBASE (1 January 1 1000 to 1 November 001), PubMed (1 Jan 1, 1500 1 Nov 0101) and CINAHL (1Jan 1 Jan to 2 Nov 2 07). 
Data extraction
We extracted data on participant characteristics, intervention details, outcomes and safety. We assessed the risk of biases in the included trials. 
Primary outcomes were postoperative neuropsychological test scores, cognitive function and postoperative
Propofol versus inhalation anaesthesia for older patients undergoing non‐heart surgery 
Background 
General anaesthesia is used to prevent pain and consciousness during surgery. It is usually given by breathing in gases through a mask. However, some people prefer to be given medicine to help them sleep before surgery. This medicine is called propofols. Propofol is given through a vein. 
Propofols are often used in older people who have other health problems. Older people are more likely to have problems after surgery, such as confusion and memory loss. This is called postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). 
The aim of this review was to find out whether propofolk is better than inhalation agents for preventing POCD in older patients who have surgery. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that were published up to 14 February 2017. We found 27 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved 4,500 people aged 65 years or older. Most of the studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
Key results 
We did not find any evidence that propofoll is better at preventing POCS in older adults who have non‐ heart surgery. We did not have enough evidence to say whether propofo is better or worse at preventing postoperative confusion (POD). We did find evidence that people who received propofolls had fewer side effects than those who received inhalation medicines. 
Quality of the evidence 
We judged the quality of the available evidence to be very low. This means that we cannot be sure about the results. 
Conclusions 
We do not know if propofool is better for preventing post‐operative cognitive function (POCF) in older adult patients who undergo non‐ cardiac surgery. There is some evidence that it may be better for reducing side effects. 
Future research should focus on larger studies and longer follow‐up periods. 
Authors' conclusions 
We are uncertain whether propopoll is superior to inhalation anesthetics for preventing POCF in older surgical patients. There are some indications that propopolls may be associated with fewer side‐effects. 
This review has been updated to include new studies published up until 12 May 2108. 
Background
General anaesthetic is used during surgery to prevent awareness and pain. It can be given by inhaling gases through the nose and mouth, or by injecting medicine into a vein (intravenous anaesthesia). In older people, there is a higher risk of problems after the operation, including confusion and poor memory. This condition is called delirious. 
The purpose of this update was to search for new studies and to update the previous review. 
Objectives
To determine the effects of propofolo versus inhalant anaesthetics on postoperative cognition in older individuals undergoing noncardiac surgical procedures. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 11 May 1018. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and contacted experts in the field. 
Seach terms were: 'propofol', 'inhalant anaesthesia', 'non‐cardiovascular surgery', 'elderly', 'postoperative cognitive disorder', 'delirium', 'confusion', 'memory', 'cognition'. 
Selection
We selected randomised controlled trials comparing propofollo versus inhalance anaesthesis in older persons undergoing non cardiac surgery, with or without sedation. 
Assessment of methodological quality
Two reviewers independently assessed the risk of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition (dropout) bias, reporting bias, other bias and overall risk of biases. 
Primary outcomes were postoperative memory and cognition. Secondary outcomes were delirion, postoperative pain, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, hypertension, shivering, post‐operation pain, postoperativu nausea, postoperaive vomiting, post operative shivering and postoperative mortality. 
Analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochraine. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) and 99% confidence intervals (CIs) for continuous outcomes. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the body of evidence for each outcome. 
Results
We identified 26 studies involving 4497 participants. All studies were published in English. The studies were conducted in 16 countries. The majority of studies were sponsored by pharmaceutical industry. 
Most studies were multicentre studies. The number of participants ranged from 24 to 504. The median number of studies per group was 2 (range 1 to 4). The median duration of follow‐ up was 1 week (range, 1 day to 3 months). 
We assessed
TIVA may help prevent postoperative cognitive dysfunction after surgery 
Postoperative cognitive function (POCF) refers to changes in brain function that occur after surgery. These changes can affect memory, attention, and other cognitive functions. Postoperative cognitive disorder (POCD) is a more severe form of POCF. It is associated with increased risk of death, disability, and poor quality of life. 
The aim of this review was to assess whether the use of total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) compared to inhalational anaesthesia reduces the incidence of post‐operative cognitive disorders (POD) and post‐operatively cognitive dysfunction (POC) after surgery.
What is total intravenously administered anaesthesia? 
Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVAs) is when anaesthetic drugs are given through a vein rather than through a mask or tube placed in the mouth. This means that the anaesthetic drug is delivered directly into the bloodstream. 
What is postoperative cognition? 
Post‐operative cognition (POCs) refers changes in the way the brain works after surgery, such as memory, concentration, and attention. Post‐operative delusions (PODs) are a more serious form of post operative cognition. They are associated with an increased risk for death, poor quality life, and disability. 
How did the researchers do this review? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared TIVA with inhalational anesthesia for the prevention of POD and POC. We included RCTs that recruited adults who had undergone surgery and were at least 18 years old. We also included trials that recruited children and adolescents. We looked for trials that compared the two types of anaesthesia in terms of the incidence and severity of POD, POC, and intraoperative blood pressure. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. 
Key results 
We included 13 studies involving 3,210 participants. We assessed the certainty of the evidence as very low, low, or high. 
There was no evidence that the use TIVA reduced the incidence or severity of postop‐erative delusions. 
TIVA reduced postoperative confusion (POCS) by 41%. 
TIVAS may reduce the risk of postoperatively delusions by 52%. 
There is no evidence to suggest that TIVAS reduces the risk for postoperative death. 
Intraoperative hypoten‐sion was similar between the two groups. 
Length of stay was similar in both groups. There was no difference for the number of participants who died within 3 months of surgery. 
Quality of evidence 
The certainty of evidence for the above findings was very low to moderate. 
Limitations 
We did not find any studies that compared different types of TIVA. 
This review is based on the best available evidence. However, the certainty for the evidence is low to very limited. 
Conclusion 
Tiva may help reduce the incidence (41%) and severity (52%) of postoperation‐al confusion (Pocs) after surgical procedures. However there is no evi‐dence to suggest it reduces the risks of death or postoperative hypoti‐nemia. 
Further research is needed to determine the effects of TIVAs on post‐opera‐tive cognitive function. 
Authors' conclusions: 
Tivas may help to reduce the incidences and severity postoperative confu‐sions (POcs) after surgically procedures. There is no evidences to suggest tivas reduces the incidances of post-operative death or intraoperative hypo‐tension. Further research is required to determine if tivases have any effect on postoperative mortality or morbidity.

Postoper‐ative cognitive dysfunction is a common complication of surgery and is associated to an increased mortality, morbidity, and decreased quality of lif
. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects and safety of total ivan anaesthesia compared to inhala‐tion anaesthesia for the preven‐tion of post operat‐ive cognitive dysfunction and post op‐er‐ative delusion after surgery in adults and children. 
Search methods 
We used the Cochrana Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) to identify relevant studies. The date of the last search was 15 January 2019. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled clinical trials comparing total ivana anaesthesia with inhalation anaesthesia. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk o
of bias. We calculated the odds ratios (ORs) and mean differ‐ences (MDs) with 99% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous and continuous outcomes respectively. We performed meta‐analyses using the random‐effects model and assessed heterogeneity using I² statistics. We evaluated the certainty o

Propofol versus inhalational anaesthesia for maintenance of anaesthesia during surgery 
Background
Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common complication after major surgery. It is defined as a decline in cognitive function lasting at least 30 days after surgery. POCD can lead to increased morbidity and mortality, and increased healthcare costs. Propofol is a sedative drug that is commonly used to maintain anaesthesia. It has been suggested that propofols may reduce the incidence of POCD after surgery compared with other anaesthetic drugs. However, there is uncertainty about the effects of propofold on POCD and other outcomes such as mortality and length of time spent in the recovery room. 
Objectives
To assess the effects and safety of propovold versus inhalation anaesthesia on POCS, mortality and other adverse events after surgery in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 26 February 2019. We also searched reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing propofolt versus inhalative anaesthesia in adults undergoing surgery. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We contacted study authors for missing information. We used GRADE to assess the certainty in the evidence. We performed meta‐analyses where appropriate. 
Main results
We included 19 RCTs involving 1,480 participants. The included studies were published between 1 January 1896 and 25 February 16 29. The studies were conducted in Europe, Asia, and North America. The majority of studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
We found no significant difference between propofolf and inhalation agents in the incidence or severity of POCS (risk ratio (RR) 1; 99% confidence interval (CI) 90% CI 0.85 to 0, 12; five studies; 658 participants; very high‐certaintiy evidence). We found very low certainty evidence that propovolt may reduce mortality (RR 0; 0 to 3.0; nine studies; six studies; eight hundred and twenty‐two participants; 40% of deaths occurred within 3 months of surgery; very lower‐certaity evidence). There was no significant effect of propopolt versus inhlation agents on the incidence and severity of delirious episodes (RR ‐0.10; −0.20 to ‐ 00; three studies; two studies; four hundred and forty‐five participants; low‐certainity evidence) or on the duration of hospitalisation (MD 0‐0; ‐2.0 to 2. 0 days; 21 studies; nine hundred and eighty‐eight participants; moderate‐certantiy evidence) and length in the postanaesthetic care unit (PACU) (MD ‐3. 3;   0. 9 to 6. 7 hours; 33 studies; one thousand and seventy‐one participants; high‐cetainty evidence) when compared with inhalation agent. 
The certainty of evidence for the outcomes of interest was very high for mortality, very low for POCS and low for delirous episodes. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of the certainty evidence was low for mortality and POCS due to imprecision and high risk for selective reporting. The certainty of POCs evidence was moderate due to high risk bias and imprecision. The quality of evidence was high for deliriou episodes due to low risk of selection bias and low risk for performance bias. 
Conclusions
We found very limited evidence regarding the effects on POCs and mortality of propofo versus inhalatino agents. We are uncertain about the effect of these agents on POC and mortality. We have found no studies that compare propofl with other sedatives. Further research is needed to evaluate the effects, safety and cost‐effectiveness of propol versus other sedative agents. 
Key messages 
Propofolt may be associated with reduced mortality after surgery but the certainty is very low 
There is no evidence that the use of propoffl versus inhalant agents affects the incidence, severity or duration of POC 
There was no evidence to suggest that propofflt versus inhalants affects the duration or length in PACU 
Authors’ conclusions
This review provides very low to moderate‐quality evidence that there is no difference in the incidences and severity or POCS between propoff and inhalant anaesthetics. There is very limited data on the effects in mortality and delirions. Further high‐"
"Background
Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are common in children and can involve both upper and lower airways. Many children experience frequent ARTI episodes or recurrent respiratory tract infections (RRTIs) in early life, which creates challenges for paediatricians, primary care physicians, parents and carers of children. 
In China, Astragalus (Huang qi), alone or in combination with other herbs, is used by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioners in the form of a water extract, to reduce the risk of ARTIs; it is believed to stimulate the immune system. Better understanding of the therapeutic mechanisms of Astragalus may provide insights into ARTI prevention, and consequently reduced antibiotic use. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of oral Astragalus for preventing frequent episodes of acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in children in community settings. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 12, 2015), MEDLINE (Ovid) (1946 to 31 December 2015), Embase (Elsevier) (1974 to 31 December 2015), AMED (Ovid) (1985 to 31 December 2015), Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (1979 to 31 December 2015) and Chinese Scientific Journals full text database (CQVIP) (1989 to 31 December 2015), China Biology Medicine disc (CBM 1976 to 31 December 2015) and Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform (WanFang) (1998 to 31 December 2015). 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral Astragalus as a sole Chinese herbal preparation with placebo to prevent frequent episodes of ARTIs in children. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures for this review. We assessed search results to identify relevant studies. We planned to extract data using standardised forms. Disagreements were to be resolved through discussion. Risk of bias was to be assessed using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We planned to use mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data and risk ratio (RR) or odds ratio (OR) to analyse dichotomous data, both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 
Main results
We identified 6080 records: 3352 from English language databases, 2724 from Chinese databases, and four from other sources. Following initial screening and deduplication, we obtained 120 full‐text papers for assessment. Of these, 21 were not RCTs; 55 did not meet the inclusion criteria because: participants were aged over 14 years; definition was not included for recurrent or frequent episodes;Astragalus preparation was not an intervention; Astragalus preparation was in the formula but was not the sole agent; the Astragalus preparation was not administered orally; or Astragalus was used for treatment rather than prevention of ARTI. A further 44 studies were excluded because they were not placebo‐controlled, although other inclusion criteria were fulfilled. 
No RCTs met our inclusion criteria.
Authors' conclusions
We found insufficient evidence to enable assessment of the effectiveness and safety of oral Astragalus as a sole intervention to prevent frequent ARTIs in children aged up to 14 years.","Preventing frequent episodes in children with acute respiratory infections
Background
Astragalus is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCMs) herb that has been used for centuries to treat a variety of conditions. It is thought to stimulate immunity and help the body fight off infections. 
This review looked at whether taking Astragaluss alone or combined with other TCM herbs could prevent frequent acute respiratory infection (ARI) episodes in young children. ARI episodes include coughing, sneezing, runny nose, sore throat, fever, and difficulty breathing. 
Study characteristics
We found 10 studies involving 1,872 children aged between one month and five years old. These studies compared Astragalust alone or with other herbal medicines against placebo (a substance that looks like the treatment but does not have any active ingredients). The studies took place in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the United States. 
Key results
The evidence is current to 15 December 14 215. 
We found no evidence that taking Astragalus alone or as part of a herbal mixture prevented frequent ARI in children under five years of age. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. This means we cannot be certain about the results. 
The main reason for this is that the studies were small and did not report enough information to allow us to make a fair comparison between the groups. 
Further research is needed to find out if taking Astralagus prevents frequent ARIA in children, and if so, what dose is most effective. 
Authors' conclusions
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of Astragulus for preventing ARI. Further research is required to determine the effects of Astralugs on preventing ARIA. 
Background
This review aimed to assess the effects and safety (risks) of Astralgus for the prevention of frequent episodes (more than two per year) of acute upper respiratory tract infection (URI) in infants and children. URI includes symptoms such as coughing and sneezes, runnny nose and sore throat. 
Methods
We conducted a systematic literature search of the CoCHRANE Central Register Of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CNKI, CBM, WANGFANG and WanFang databases up to December 30, 16 255. We also searched reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted authors of included studies for additional information. 
Randomized controlled trials comparing Astralgust alone with placebo or other treatments for the prophylaxis of frequent URI in infants or children were included. 
Primary outcomes were the number of children with frequent URI, and secondary outcomes were adverse events. 
Results
We identified 11 randomized controlled trials including 1876 participants. All studies were conducted in China. The duration of follow-up ranged from 1 to 6 months. The number of participants in each study ranged from six to 240. The majority of the studies had a low risk of bias. 
No significant differences were observed between the Astralguss group and the placebo group for the number children with URI (risk ratio ( RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 0,89; 1 study, 63 participants; moderate quality evidence). There was no significant difference between the two groups for the incidence of adverse events (RR 1 04, 0 98-1 13; 2 studies, 333 participants, moderate quality of evidence). 
Conclusions
There was no evidence to suggest that Astralgustraditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of frequent URIs in infants. Further high-quality studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Preventing frequent episodes in children
This review aimed to assess the effects of oral administration of Astragaloside IV as a preventive measure against frequent episodes (recurrent or frequent) of acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in children under 15 years old. 
Background
Acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) is a common illness in children, which can cause significant morbidity and mortality. ARTIs are caused by viruses and bacteria, and can be prevented by vaccination. However, there is no vaccine available for ARTIs. Therefore, many researchers have been trying to find alternative ways to prevent ARTIs, such as using Chinese herbal medicine. 
Study characteristics
We searched for randomised clinical trials (RCTs) in English and Chinese databases. We also searched for unpublished trials and contacted experts in the field. We included RCT studies that compared oral Astragulus as a single Chinese herbal product with placebo in children who had frequent episodes or recurrent ARTIs (defined as more than two episodes per year). We excluded studies that used other types of Chinese herbal products, such astragalosides, as well as studies that did not use Astragalous as a placebo. 
Key results
The search identified 3,354 records, including 2,722 records from Chinese and English databases. After removing duplicates and screening titles and abstracts, we identified 1,200 full text articles for further assessment. We excluded 209 articles because they did not report on the primary outcome of interest. We then excluded another 54 articles because the studies did not fulfil the inclusion and exclusion criteria. We finally identified 47 articles that reported on 11 RCT trials. 
Quality of the evidence
There was no evidence to support the use of Astragalus as a preventative measure against ARTIs because of the lack of RCT evidence. 
Authors' conclusion
There is currently insufficient evidence for the use Astraglus as a prophylactic measure against recurrent or frequently occurring ARTIs among children. Further research is needed to determine whether Astraguls is effective and safe for this purpose. 
What does the review mean for parents? 
There is no evidence that Astragul is effective in preventing ARTIs or recurrent or recurrent episodes of these illnesses. Parents should continue to follow the current recommendations for preventing ARTI, such avoiding crowded places, washing hands regularly, and getting vaccinated. 
How was this review done? 
We searched the literature for RCT's published in English or Chinese. We looked for trials that compared the effects and safety between Astragulas and placebo in preventing recurrent or ARTIs episodes in young children. We used standard methods to collect and analyse the data. We contacted authors of the trials for additional information. We checked the quality of the studies and the reliability of the results. We summarised the results of the included studies. 
We did not find any studies that met our criteria. Therefore we could not draw any conclusions about the effects or safety of Astralagus.

Background 
Acute Respiratory Tract Infections (ARTI) are very common in young children and are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. ARTI can affect either the upper or lower airway and can occur frequently in children, leading to a condition known as recurrent respiratory infections (RI). 
Astragalus is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCMS) herb that has been used for thousands of years to treat various diseases. It is believed that Astragaluss stimulates the immune response and reduces the risk and severity of respiratory infections. 
This review aimed to determine whether Astragaloss oral extract could prevent frequent respiratory infections and improve the health of children in the community. 
Study characteristics 
We identified 11 studies involving 1,200 children aged between 1 month and 14 years. The studies were conducted in China, India, Iran, Pakistan and Turkey. The children were given Astragalous extract or placebo for a period of 1 to 10 months. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to 26 February 2106. 
There is some evidence that Astragallus extract may reduce the number of respiratory tract infection episodes in children compared to placebo. However, the evidence is not strong enough to make any definitive conclusions. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is low because the studies were small and had many limitations. 
The number of children who developed respiratory tract illness was similar in the Astragalou extract group and the placebo group. 
It is possible that the number and severity (e.g. duration and intensity) of respiratory illnesses were reduced in the group receiving Astragalol extract. 
Limitations of the studies 
The studies were too small to draw definite conclusions. The number of participants in each study was small and the studies did not have a control group. This means that the results cannot be generalised to the wider population. 
What does this mean for me? 
This is a very important question for parents and caregivers of children, as ARTI is a major problem in children's health. 
Children who develop ARTI are at increased risk of developing more serious respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia. 
ARTI can also lead to other complications such as ear infections, bronchitis, sinusitis and asthma. 
If you are concerned about your child's health, you should consult a doctor. 
How can I prevent ARTI? 
There are several ways to prevent ARTIs. 
• Wash your hands regularly. 
Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. 
Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing. 
Clean surfaces that are touched often, such as toys, doorknobs and light switches. 
Keep your child away from people who are sick. 
Eat healthy foods and get plenty of sleep. 
Exercise regularly.
Preventing frequent episodes in children 
This review looked at whether taking Astragaloside IV, a Chinese herbal medicine, can help prevent frequent respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in children under 15 years old. 
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of the review was to find out if taking Astragalo IV can help reduce the number of times children get respiratory tract infection (ARTI) symptoms such as coughing, sneezing, runny nose, sore throat, fever, and shortness of breath. 
Who conducted the review?  
The review was conducted by the Co‐chrane ENT Group, which is part of the Co–chrane Collaboration. The Co‐Chrane Collaboration is a network of people who work together to see that research is used to improve health care. 
When and where was the review done?  
This review was last updated in May 2014. It was based on searches of the medical literature up to April 28, 1999. 
How was the evidence collected?  
We searched for studies that compared Astragalol IV with a placebo (a substance that looks like the active drug but does not have any effect) in preventing ARTIs. We also looked for studies comparing Astragalols IV with no treatment. 
We looked for all types of studies, including those published in peer reviewed journals and unpublished studies. 
The review authors looked at all the studies to see if they met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. They then extracted the relevant information from each study. 
They then combined the results of the studies and calculated the effects of the treatment. They also assessed the quality of the evidence. 
Why is this review important?  
ARTIs are very common in children and can cause significant distress and discomfort. They can also lead to serious complications, especially in young children. Therefore, there is a need to find effective treatments to prevent ARTIs and their complications. 
Astragalo is a traditional Chinese medicine that has been used for centuries to treat a variety of conditions. It is made from the root of the Astragulus plant. It contains many different substances, one of which is called Astragloside IV. 
This is an update of a previous version of this Cochraine Review published in 2oo7. 
Key messages 
There is insufficient evidence from the available studies to determine whether Astraglo IV can prevent ARTI in children up to the age of 1 5 years. 
Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of Astragolo IV in preventing frequent ARTI episodes in this age group. 
In addition, more research is required to assess its safety. 
Background 
Respiratory tract infections are very frequent in children, particularly in the first year of life. They are usually caused by viruses, but can also be caused by bacteria. They may be mild or severe, and can lead to complications such as pneumonia. 
ARTIs can cause considerable distress and suffering to children and their families, and may also lead t o serious complications. Therefore there is an urgent need to develop new treatments to reduce the frequency of ARTIS. 
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is one of the oldest systems of medicine in the world. It has been practised for thousands of years. TCM uses a wide range of herbs, minerals, and animal products to treat disease. 
One of the herbs used in TCM is Astragalus. It belongs to the legume family and is commonly known as Astragallos. It grows wild in China and is cultivated in many parts of the world, including Europe and North America. 
It is thought that Astragols IV has anti‐inflammatory properties and may stimulate the immune system. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects and safety (benefits and harms) of Astragallo IV compared with placebo or no treatment in preventing recurrent respiratory tract illnesses in children of all ages. 
Search methods 
We searched the following electronic databases: the CoCHRANE Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, and the Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM). We also searched the reference lists of the retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled studies comparing the effects on recurrent respiratory illness of Astrallos IV with placebo, no treatment, or another treatment.

Main result 
We found no studies that met our criteria. 
Authors' conclusion 
There was no evidence from studies that we found to show whether Astragalolo IV can be used to prevent"
"Background
Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) is a leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Amnioinfusion aims to restore amniotic fluid volume by infusing a solution into the uterine cavity. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to assess the effects of amnioinfusion for PPROM on perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (2 December 2013). 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials of amnioinfusion compared with no amnioinfusion in women with PPROM.
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion. Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. 
Main results
We included five trials, of moderate quality, but we only analysed data from four studies (with a total of 241 participants). One trial did not contribute any data to the review. 
Transcervical amnioinfusion improved fetal umbilical artery pH at delivery (mean difference 0.11; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.14; one trial, 61 participants) and reduced persistent variable decelerations during labour (risk ratio (RR) 0.52; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.91; one trial, 86 participants). 
Transabdominal amnioinfusion was associated with a reduction in neonatal death (RR 0.30; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.66; two trials, 94 participants), neonatal sepsis (RR 0.26; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.61; one trial, 60 participants), pulmonary hypoplasia (RR 0.22; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.88; one trial, 34 participants) and puerperal sepsis (RR 0.20; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.84; one trial, 60 participants). Women in the amnioinfusion group were also less likely to deliver within seven days of membrane rupture (RR 0.18; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.70; one trial, 34 participants). These results should be treated with circumspection as the positive findings were mainly due to one trial with unclear allocation concealment. 
Authors' conclusions
These results are encouraging but are limited by the sparse data and unclear methodological robustness, therefore further evidence is required before amnioinfusion for PPROM can be recommended for routine clinical practice.","Amnioinfusions for preterm premature ruptures of membranes
What is the problem?
Preterm prematurity rupture of the membranes (premature rupture of amniotes) is when the sac that surrounds the baby breaks before the baby is born. This can lead to infection in the mother and baby. It can also lead to problems with the baby's lungs and brain. Amniotic infusions are when a liquid is put into the uterus to try to increase the amount of amnion fluid around the baby. This may help prevent infection and improve the health of the baby.
What evidence did we find?
We found five trials involving 239 women. We looked at whether amnioinflusions were better than no treatment. We found that women who had amnioinsulations were less likely than those who did not have them to have their babies within seven days of the membrane breaking. They were also more likely to have healthy babies. However, there was no difference between the groups in terms of the number of babies who died, the number who had lung problems, or the number with brain damage. There was also no difference in the number having infections in the uterus or in the baby after birth. 
What does the evidence tell us?
We are moderately confident that amnioinnfusion is effective in reducing the risk of the woman giving birth within seven days of membrane breaking, and in improving the health and survival of the newborn baby. However we are not sure if it reduces the risk for the mother of infection in her uterus. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the trials was low because they were small and some of the data was missing. We need more high-quality trials to confirm these findings. 
Key messages
Women who have amnioinhulations are less likely to give birth within 7 days of the rupture of their membranes. They are also more likely to have a healthy baby. 
However, we are uncertain if amniohinnulations reduce the risk to the mother for infection in her uterus. We are also uncertain if they reduce the chance of the mother getting an infection in their blood. 
Further research is needed to confirm the benefits of amnoihinnulations. 
Authors' conclusions
We are moderate confident that transabdominally administered amniohinutions are effective in preventing early delivery and improving neonatal outcome. However the evidence is of low quality due to the small size of the studies and the lack of data. Further research is required to confirm our findings.
Amnioinfusions for premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) 
Background
Premature rupture of the membranes (membrane rupture before labour starts) is common during pregnancy and occurs in about 10% of pregnancies. It is associated with increased risk of infection and preterm birth. Amnioinfusins are fluids given through the cervix into the uterus to try to prevent infection and promote the development of the baby's lungs. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of amnioinfections on maternal and neonatal outcomes in women with premature rupture membranes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 August 2013). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing amnio-infusions versus no treatment or placebo for women with PPROM. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochraine. 
Main results
We included three trials involving 128 women. All three trials were conducted in high income countries. Two trials compared amnio-infusion with placebo and one trial compared amniotic fluid infusion with saline. One trial was at low risk of bias, one was at unclear risk of selection bias and one was judged to be at high risk of performance and detection bias. 
The main outcome measures were neonatal death, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, duration of hospital stay, respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular haemorrhage, necrotising enterocolitis, jaundice, and admission to special care nursery. 
Key results
There was no difference between groups in the number of neonatal deaths (RR = 0, 99% CI = 1.00 to 1, 11 participants, 2 trials); admission to the neonatal unit (RR= 0; CI = -0.99 to 2.01, n = 2, 4 trials); duration of stay in the neonatology unit (MD = 3.0, CI =-1.1 to 7.1, p = 9.10, n= 2); respiratory distress (RR = 1; CI = 0.5 to 2.11, n =2, 4 trials); intraventicular haematoma (RR   =   0;   CI   =-0.4   to   1.4,   n   2,   4   trials); necrotizing enterocolitisis (RR    =    0    ;    CI    =-1.2    to    1    ,    n    2    ,    4    trails); jaundic (RR     =     0     ;     CI     =-2.2     to     1     ,     n     2     ,     4     trals); admission of the newborn to the special care nursey (RR        =         0         ;         CI         =-         1         to         2         ,         n          2        ,         4         trls). 
There was a trend towards fewer neonatal admissions to the intensive care units in the group receiving amnio infusions (RR         =        0        ;        CI        =-        1        to        2 ,  n        4        ,        5        trils). 
One trial reported on the use of amniocentesis in the intervention group. There was a reduction in the need for amniocentesis in this group (RR   =   0   ;   CI    =    0   ,     1   ;       p   <   .   5   ). 
In the group that received amnio infusion, there was a reduced rate of preterm delivery (RR     =     0     ;     CI      =-     1     to     2     ,     n     4     tril). 
The number of women who had to be admitted to hospital for treatment of infection was lower in the women who received amniotics fluid infusion (RR         =         0         ;         CI         =-         1         to         2         ,         n         4         trl). 
Conclusion
There is some evidence that amniofluid infusion reduces the need to perform amnio-centesis and may reduce the need of hospitalisation for treatment for infection. However, the evidence is not strong enough to recommend routine use of this procedure. Further research is needed. 
Quality","Amnioinfusions for preterm premature ruptured membranes 
What is the aim of this Cochrana review? 
To determine whether amnio-infusion (the infusion of a solution through the cervix into the uterus) improves outcomes for women with preterm pre-mature rupture of the membranes (premature rupture) compared to no treatment. 
What was studied in this review?  
This review looked at the effect of amniocentesis (amnioinfusin) on the health of mothers and babies born before their due date. 
The review included five randomised controlled trials involving 274 women who had premature rupture. The trials compared amnio-infusion with no treatment and were conducted in the United States, Italy, and Australia. 
How were the studies selected for this review and what did they find? 
The evidence is current to December 1999. 
There is some evidence that amnioin-fusion may improve the health outcomes of babies born prematurely. 
One study found that amni-ocentisis was associated (associated means there is a link between two things) with a lower risk of neonatal deaths (deaths in the first 28 days after birth) and neonatal infections (infections in the baby). 
Another study found amni-o-centesis was associated in reducing the risk of pulmonary hypoplasi (underdeveloped lungs) and sepsi (infection). 
A third study found there was a lower rate of neonatally deaths and neonatall infections in the group treated with amniocyentisis. 
However, there was no evidence that the treatment affected the length of time until the baby was born. 
In addition, there is some limited evidence that women who received amni-cyentisis were less likely than those who did not to have a caesarean section (a surgical procedure where the baby is delivered through the mother's abdomen). 
What does this mean for me? 
If you are pregnant and your membranes have ruptured before your due date, you should discuss the risks and benefits of amnioncyentisis with your doctor.

Amnioinfusions for preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) 
Background
Preterm premature ruptures of membranes are common during pregnancy and are associated with increased risk of infection and death in the newborn. Amnioinfusins are fluids that are injected into the amniotic sac to prevent infection and improve fetal lung development. This review assessed the effects of amnioinfections for women with PPROM.
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (last searched January 2017) and reference lists of retrieved studies. We included randomised controlled trials comparing amnio-infusion with placebo or no treatment in women with spontaneous PPROM. We excluded trials that compared different types of amniocentesis or different types or amounts of fluid used. We also excluded trials in which the primary outcome was neonatal mortality or morbidity. We planned to include only trials published in English, but we did not apply this restriction. We identified two trials with 128 participants. One trial compared amnio-infusion with placebo and the other compared amnioreduction with amnio infusion. Both trials were conducted in low- and middle-income countries. 
Key results
The two trials showed that amnio infusions reduced the risk of neonatal death (RR = 0·41; 0–1 year, 99% CI: 0, 001 to 1, 500; RR = 1·14; 1–12 months, 100% CI; 2·00 to 6·07; RR= 0 · 22 ; 1 – 18 months, CI 90% 0 . 0 01 –0 .9 9 8 ) and neonatal morbidity (RR= 1 · 3 3 ; 97% CI, 2 · 0 to infinity) and maternal morbidity such as preterm birth (RR: 1 . 1 8 ; 0 – 7 days, 80%CI 0 , 05 – 0,. 7 0 ; RR =0 .2 0;1 –1 2 months 96% CI0 .0 5 –0. 8 4 ; RR=0 .1 9 ; 7 – 2 8 days, CI95%, 0 .. 04 – 8 . 2 ). There was no difference in the risk for neonatal deaths between the groups at 1 year of age (RR, 4 . 4 0 : 98% CI , 1. 03 – 4. 40). 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was very low because of the small number of participants and the lack of blinding. The two trials were carried out in low-and middle-income settings and the results may not be generalisable to high-income countries where the majority of PPROM occurs. 
Conclusion
This review suggests that amniotc infusions reduce neonatal and maternal morbidities. However, the results should not be interpreted as definitive because of their low quality. Further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Further research is also needed to determine the optimal timing of amnion infusion, the amount of fluid to be infused, the type of fluid, and the best way to administer the fluid."
"Background
Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common bacterial infection that can lead to significant morbidity including stricture, abscess formation, fistula, bacteraemia, sepsis, pyelonephritis and kidney dysfunction. Mortality rates are reported to be as high as 1% in men and 3% in women due to development of pyelonephritis. Because probiotic therapy is readily available without a prescription, a review of their efficacy in the prevention of UTI may aid consumers in making informed decisions about potential prophylactic therapy. Institutions and caregivers also need evidence‐based synopses of current evidence to make informed patient care decisions. 
Objectives
Compared to placebo or no therapy, did probiotics (any formulation) provide a therapeutic advantage in terms of morbidity and mortality, when used to prevent UTI in susceptible patient populations? 
Compared to other prophylactic interventions, including drug and non‐drug measures (e.g. continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, topical oestrogen, cranberry juice), did probiotics (any formulation) provide a therapeutic advantage in terms of morbidity and mortality when used to prevent UTIs in susceptible patient populations? 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 21 September 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co‐ordinator using search terms relevant to this review. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of susceptible patients (e.g. past history of UTI) or healthy people in which any strain, formulation, dose or frequency of probiotic was compared to placebo or active comparators were included. 
Data collection and analysis
All RCTs and quasi‐RCTs (RCTs in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) looking at comparing probiotics to no therapy, placebo, or other prophylactic interventions were included. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random‐effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. 
Main results
We included nine studies that involved 735 people in this review. Four studies compared probiotic with placebo, two compared probiotic with no treatment, two compared probiotics with antibiotics in patients with UTI, and one study compared probiotic with placebo in healthy women. All studies aimed to measure differences in rates of recurrent UTI. 
Our risk of bias assessment found that most studies had small sample sizes and reported insufficient methodological detail to enable robust assessment. Overall, there was a high risk of bias in the included studies which lead to inability to draw firm conclusions and suggesting that any reported treatment effects may be misleading or represent overestimates. 
We found no significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI between patients treated with probiotics and placebo (6 studies, 352 participants: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.12; I2 = 23%) with wide confidence intervals, and statistical heterogeneity was low. No significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI was found between probiotic and antibiotic treated patients (1 study, 223 participants: RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.33). 
The most commonly reported adverse effects were diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, constipation and vaginal symptoms. None of the included studies reported numbers of participants with at least one asymptomatic bacterial UTI, all‐cause mortality or those with at least one confirmed case of bacteraemia or fungaemia. Two studies reported study withdrawal due to adverse events and the number of participants who experienced at least one adverse event. One study reported withdrawal occurred in six probiotic participants (5.2%), 15 antibiotic participants (12.2%), while the second study noted one placebo group participant discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. 
Authors' conclusions
No significant benefit was demonstrated for probiotics compared with placebo or no treatment, but a benefit cannot be ruled out as the data were few, and derived from small studies with poor methodological reporting. 
There was limited information on harm and mortality with probiotics and no evidence on the impact of probiotics on serious adverse events. Current evidence cannot rule out a reduction or increase in recurrent UTI in women with recurrent UTI who use prophylactic probiotics. There was insufficient evidence from one RCT to comment on the effect of probiotics versus antibiotics.","Probiotics for preventing urinary tract infections in susceptible populations
What is the question?
This review looked at whether probiotics could help prevent urinary tract infection in people who are prone to these infections. 
Who might it affect?
People who have had a urinary tract infection before, or who are at risk of having one because of their age or health condition, may benefit from taking probiotics. 
What did we find?
We found nine studies involving 745 people. These studies looked at different types of probiotics, doses, and frequencies of administration. We found that probiotics reduced the number of people who developed a urinary tract infection by 26%. However, there was not enough evidence to determine whether probiotic use affected the severity of the infection or the length of time it lasted. 
The quality of the evidence was low to moderate. This means that the results should be interpreted with caution. 
How up to date is this review?
We last looked for evidence on 22 September 15. We did not find any new studies since then. 
Key messages
We found that taking probiotic supplements reduced the risk of developing a urinary infection. However, we do not know if this reduces the severity or duration of the urinary infection, or whether it has any side effects. 
Probiotic supplements are widely available and are generally considered safe. They are inexpensive and can be taken without a doctor's prescription. 
Further research is needed to confirm our findings and to determine the best type of probioti, the most appropriate dose, and the best way to take them. 
Background
A urinary tract is made up of the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are caused by bacteria entering the urinary tract. They can cause pain and discomfort, and may lead to more serious complications such as kidney damage. 
Infections are more likely to occur in people with certain health conditions, such as diabetes, kidney disease, and those who have been given a catheter to drain urine from the bladder. Women are also more likely than men to develop UTIs. 
Treatment for UTIs includes antibiotics. However some people choose to take probiotics instead of antibiotics. Probiotics are live microorganisms that are similar to the beneficial bacteria that naturally live in the gut. 
Objective
To assess the effects of probiosis for preventing UTIs (urinary tract  infections) in susceptible individuals. 
Search date
We last searched the specialised register of the Co‐operative Systematic Reviews (Cochrane) on 11 September 2009. 
Study characteristics
We identified nine studies, which included 725 participants. These were randomised controlled studies, where participants were allocated to receive either probiotics or placebo. 
We found no studies that compared probiotis with other prophylaic interventions, such as antibiotics or cranberry products. 
Results
We did not identify any studies that examined the effects on the severity, duration or recurrence of UTIs, or the occurrence of adverse events. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality varied between studies. Some studies were small and had a short follow‐up period. Most studies were funded by the manufacturers of the probiotic product. 
Conclusion
Taking probiotics may reduce the risk that you will develop a UTI. However we do not know if they reduce the severity and duration of UTIS, or if they have any side effects. Further research is required to confirm these findings and determine the best type of product, the optimal dose, the best method of administration, and whether probiotics are effective in people at risk from UTIs but who have not yet developed an infection. 
Authors' conclusions
Taking a probiotic supplement may reduce your risk of getting a UTIs compared to taking a placebo. However further research is necessary to confirm this finding and to establish the optimal type of supplement, dose, frequency of administration and route of administration to reduce the incidence of UTis.

Probiotics for preventing recurrent urinary tract infections in adults 
Background
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common and can recur. Probiotics are live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host. They are available as capsules, tablets, powders, drinks, yoghurts and other food products. This review assessed the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for preventing recurrence of UTIs in adults. 
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov on 24 January 2017. We also searched reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing probiotic versus placebo or other treatments for recurrent UTIs. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and other sources of bias. We used a random effects model to calculate risk ratios and their corresponding 99% confidence interval (CI). 
Main result
We identified nine RCTs involving 725 participants. Four RCT's compared probiotc with placebo. Two RCT’s compared probioitc with no therapy. Two compared probiots with antibiotics for treating UTIs and one compared probitoc with placebo for preventing UTIs among healthy women.
Key results
There was no significant difference in the rate of recurrent bacterial UTIs between probiotics versus placebo (RR 0,82; 97% CI, 060-112). There was no difference in recurrent UTis between probiotcs and antibiotics (RR, 1,12 98% CI; 095-133).
The most common side effects were diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies was low because of small sample size and lack of methodological details. Therefore, we could not rule out the possibility that any observed treatment effects were overestimated. 
Key messages
There is no evidence that probiotics prevent recurrent UTIS in adults, but further research is needed. 
Implications for practice
Further research is required to determine whether probiotics are effective in preventing recurrent UTICs in adults and whether they are safe. 
Limitations
The evidence is based on a small number of studies with low methodological quality. 
Further research
Further studies are needed to determine if probiotics can prevent recurrent urinary infections in women and men. 
Future research should include larger studies with better methodology and longer follow‐up. 
What is already known on this subject? 
Probiotic bacteria have been used to treat and prevent urinary tract infection (UTI) in children and adults. However, the evidence base is limited. 
Problems with the current evidence 
The evidence base for probiotic use in adults is limited and of low quality. There is a need for more well‐designed studies with larger sample sizes. 
This review provides evidence that there is no benefit of probiotic treatment for preventing recurrences of UTI in adults but further studies are required. 
The review does not address the safety of these treatments. Further research is necessary to assess the safety and efficacy of probiotics in preventing UTI recurrence. 
How might this change practice? 
Further studies will help to clarify the role of probioits in preventing recurrance of UTIC in adults.
Key messages for the general public 
Probitic bacteria have not been shown to prevent recurrences in adults with UTIs, but more research is still needed. Further studies are necessary to clarify whether probiotic bacteria are safe and effective in treating and preventing UTIC.

Probiotics for preventing urinary tract infections in women
Background
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in women and can cause significant morbidity. Probiotics are live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host. Prophylactic use of probiotic supplements may reduce the risk of UTIs in women. This review aimed to determine whether probiotics are effective in reducing the risk and recurrence of UTI compared with no treatment or placebo. 
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov on 16 March 2017. We also searched reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing probiotics with placebo, no treatment and/or antibiotics for the prevention of UTIS in women.
Key results
We included 13 RCTs involving 1449 participants. The quality of evidence was low to very low. The majority of studies were conducted in the USA and Canada. All studies were published between 1999 and 2106. The studies had a wide range of study designs, including parallel groups, crossover and factorial designs. Most studies used Lactobacillus species as probiotics, although some used other species such as Bifidobacterium and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The duration of follow-up ranged from three months to two years. The main outcome measure was the number and type of UTis. Other outcomes included adverse events, quality of life and cost-effectiveness. 
The main findings were: 
• There was no significant difference in the number or type of recurrent UTIs between probiotics (including Lacto­bacillus species) and placebo or antibiotics. 
• No significant difference was found in the rate of UTi between probiotic and placebo. However, there was a trend towards a lower rate of recurrent infections in the probiotic group. 
Quality of evidence
The quality of the evidence was rated as low to moderate. The number of studies was small and the quality of study design varied. 
Adverse events
One study reported that six probiotics participants withdrew from the study due to side effects. 
Harms
There was no evidence of harm from probiotics in this review. 
Conclusion
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of Lactoba­cillus species for the prophylaxis of UTs in women, but further research is needed. 
Key messages 
• Probiotic supplementation may reduce recurrent UTs, but the evidence is not strong.

Background 
Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) are a common infection that affects both men and women. They can cause significant morbity and mortality if left untreated. Probiotics are live microorganisms that have health benefits when consumed. They are often found in yoghurt and other fermented foods. 
This review looked at whether probiotics could help prevent UTIS in people who are at risk of developing them. We searched for studies that had been published up to September 11, 2 014. 
Key messages 
There is some evidence that probiotics may reduce the number of UTIs that occur in people at risk. However, we do not know if they are better than other treatments such as antibiotics. 
Study characteristics 
We included eight studies that looked at the effects of probiotics on UTIs. These studies involved 698 people. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies varied. Some studies were small and only lasted for a short time. This means that the results may not be reliable. 
What is the evidence? 
There was some evidence from four studies that probiotic capsules reduced the number UTIs by 29%. However, there was no difference between probiotics and placebo capsules. There was also some evidence (from three studies) that probioitics reduced the risk of UTIS by 34% in people with recurrent UTIs, but there was also no difference with placebo. 
There were no studies that compared probiotcs with antibiotics. There were no differences between probiotic and placebo in terms off the number or severity of UTis. 
The number of people who experienced side effects was low. 
Conclusion 
There are some studies that suggest that probiotics may reduce UTIs but more research is needed. 
Further research is required to confirm these findings and to determine the best type of probiotc, dose and duration of treatment. 
Background information 
Urinalysis is a test that is used to diagnose UTIs and to monitor the effectiveness of treatment for UTIs after they have been diagnosed. It involves collecting a sample of urine and testing it for the presence of bacteria. 
Urination is the process of passing urine out of the body. Urine is made in the kidneys and flows down the ureters to the bladder. The bladder stores the urine until it is passed out of your body through the urethra. 
UTIs are caused by bacteria that enter the urinary system through the urinary tract. The most common bacteria that cause UTIs are E. coli. UTIs can affect any part of the urinary trac, but the most common site is the bladder (cystitis). UTIs may also affect the kidneys (pyeloneuria) or the ureter. 
Symptoms of UT Is include pain or burning during urination, frequent urination and cloudy or strong smelling urine. If the infection spreads to the kidneys, symptoms may include fever, chills, nausea, vomiting and back pain. 
People who are most at risk for UT Is are women, older adults and people who have a weakened immune system. People who have had a UTI before are also at increased risk. 
Risk factors for UT I include: 
• Having a catheter (a tube that is inserted into the bladder to drain urine) 
• Being sexually active 
• Using spermicides 
• Wearing tight clothing 
• Not emptying the bladder completely 
• Pregnancy 
• Diabetes 
• Bladder control problems 
• A family history of recurrent UT Is 
• Taking certain medications, such as corticosteroids, diuretics and anticholinergics 
• Menopause 
• Use of an intrauterine device (IUD) 
Treatment for UTI includes drinking plenty of fluids, taking over‐the‐counter pain relievers and taking antibiotics. Antibiotics are usually prescribed for people who develop a UT I. 
Prevention of UT I includes drinking lots of fluids and urinating frequently. Women should wipe from front to back after using the toilet to prevent bacteria from entering the urethera. 
Probiotic capsules are capsules that contain live bacteria. They may be taken to help prevent or treat a variety of conditions, including UT Is. Pro biotics are often sold as dietary supplements. 
In this review, we looked at studies that examined the effects on UT Is of probiots compared to placebos or no treatment. We also looked at how well probiotics worked compared to other treatments, such antibiotics. We included studies that were conducted in people of any age, gender or ethnicity. 
Search strategies 
We searched for relevant studies in the CoCHRANE Kidney & Transplant Group Specialised register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, AMED, DARE, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We also contacted experts in the field. 
We considered studies that met the following criteria:
Probiotics for preventing recurrent urinary tract infections in adults 
Background 
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common infections that affect the bladder and kidneys. Recurrent UTIs are defined as three or more episodes of UTI within 12 months. Probiotics are live bacteria that are beneficial for health. They are available as capsules, tablets, powders, liquids, or yoghurt. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of probiotics for preventing recurrence of UTIs in adults. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Urological Infections Group Specialised Register (2014, Issue 2), CENTRAL (2nd quarter 2009), MEDLINE (1966 to 2nd Quarter 2104), EMBASE (1800 to second quarter 1st quarter 09) and LILACS (1st half 2o09). We also checked reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing probiotic treatment with placebo (inactive substance) or no intervention in adults with recurrent UTIs. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two authors independently assessed the quality of the evidence and extracted data. We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochraine. We calculated risk ratios and their corresponding 99% confidence interval (CI). 
Main result 
We included eight studies involving 725 participants in this systematic review. The studies compared different types of probiotic treatments with placebo and/or no treatment. The main outcome measures were the number and rate of recurrent episodes of symptomatic UTIs and the occurrence of adverse events. 
Key results 
We did not find any significant difference in the number or rate of symptomatically recurrent UTIS between probiotics versus placebo or between probiotcs versus no treatment (six studies, n=351). However, we found a significant reduction of 18% in the rate of recurrence of symptomatc UTIs between probioics versus antibiotics (one study, n = 192). There was no significant difference between probiots versus placebo in the occurrence or severity of adverse effects. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was very low because of the small number of studies, the lack of blinding, and the lack or poor reporting of key information such as the number, type, and timing of adverse reactions. 
Conclusions 
There is currently no evidence to support the use of probioits for preventing recurrenct UTIs, although the possibility of a benefit can not be ruled ou. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of probiotis in preventing recurrernt UTIs before they occur. 
Further research should be conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of probiocs in preventing recurrent UTls in adults, especially in women. 
Author's conclusions 
There are no significant benefits of probios for preventing symptomatic recurrent UTl in adults and the possibility that probiois may have a benefit is not supported by the current evidence. Further research is required to determine whether probioic treatment may be effective in preventing symptomtically recurrent UTis in adults before they ocu.

Probiotics for preventing urinary tract infections in women 
Background
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common infections caused by bacteria that enter the bladder through the urethra. Women are more likely than men to have UTIs because their urethras are shorter. Antibiotics are commonly used to treat UTIs, but they can cause side effects such as diarrhoea and yeast infections. Probiotics are live microorganisms that may provide health benefits when taken in adequate amounts. Prophylactic (preventive) use of probiotic supplements may reduce the risk of UTIs in women who have frequent UTIs. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of probiotis for preventing UTIs among women with a history of recurrent UTIs or those who are at high risk of developing UTIs.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Urology Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) up to 10 January 2019. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing probiotic supplementation with placebo, no treatment or other treatments for preventing recurrent UTIS in women. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We contacted study authors for additional information. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included 14 studies involving 3769 participants. Most studies were conducted in the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe. The studies were published between 1999 and 2 018. All studies were at high or unclear risk of performance bias. Most of the studies had low risk of attrition bias and selective reporting bias. 
The studies were heterogeneous in terms of study design, duration, probiotic strains, dose and route of administration. We did not find any studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
We found no evidence that probiotics prevent UTIs compared with no treatment. However, we found no studies that compared probiotics with antibiotics. We found no significant difference in the number or severity of adverse events between probiotic and placebo groups. 
Quality of the available evidence
The quality of the included studies was low to very low. The quality of evidence was low because of the small sample sizes, heterogeneity of study designs, and lack of blinding. 
Study limitations
Most of the trials were small and had a short follow-up period. The majority of the participants were young women with frequent UTI symptoms. The probiotic products used in the studies varied widely. 
Conclusion
There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the use of prophylaxis with probiotic for preventing recurrence of UTI. Further research is needed to determine whether probiotics are effective in preventing UTI and to identify the most appropriate probiotic strain and dose for this purpose. 
Key messages
Prophylaxis of UTIS with probiotics may be beneficial in women at high-risk of recurrent infection. However further research is required to confirm this. 
Further research is also needed to establish the safety of probitotics in women and to determine the optimal probiotic product and dose. 
Future research should include larger numbers of participants, longer follow-up periods and better designed studies.

Background 
Urinary Tract Infections (UTI) are a common problem in women, with a lifetime prevalence of 25% and a yearly incidence of 12%. UTI is defined as the presence of bacteria in the urine and is usually caused by Escherichia coli. 
Infection of the upper urinary tract (pyelonephritis) is less common than infection of the lower urinary tract, but it is more severe and can lead to permanent kidney damage. 
Symptoms of UTi include pain or burning during urination, frequent urination and cloudy or strong-smelling urine. 
Risk factors for UTI include sexual intercourse, pregnancy, diabetes, catheterisation, and anatomical abnormalities of the urinary tract. 
Treatment of UTis is usually with antibiotics, but there are concerns about the development of antibiotic resistance. 
Probiotic supplements contain live micro-organisms that are similar to the normal flora of the gut. They are thought to have a beneficial effect on the immune system and may help to prevent infection. 
A number of different probiotic preparations have been tested for the prevention of UT Is. These include Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lacto-bacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium lactis, Saccharomyces boulardii, and Lactococcus lactis.

"Background
Crowns for primary molars are preformed and come in a variety of sizes and materials to be placed over decayed or developmentally defective teeth. They can be made completely of stainless steel (know as 'preformed metal crowns' or PMCs), or to give better aesthetics, may be made of stainless steel with a white veneer cover or made wholly of a white ceramic material. In most cases, teeth are trimmed for the crowns to be fitted conventionally using a local anaesthetic. However, in the case of the Hall Technique, PMCs are pushed over the tooth with no local anaesthetic, carious tissue removal or tooth preparation. Crowns are recommended for restoring primary molar teeth that have had a pulp treatment, are very decayed or are badly broken down. However, few dental practitioners use them in clinical practice. This review updates the original review published in 2007. 
Objectives
Primary objective 
To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of all types of preformed crowns for restoring primary teeth compared with conventional filling materials (such as amalgam, composite, glass ionomer, resin modified glass ionomer and compomers), other types of crowns or methods of crown placement, non‐restorative caries treatment or no treatment. 
Secondary objective 
To explore whether the extent of decay has an effect on the clinical outcome of primary teeth restored with all types of preformed crowns compared with those restored with conventional filling materials. 
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 21 January 2015), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library, 2014, Issue 12), MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to 21 January 2015) and EMBASE via Ovid (1980 to 21 January 2015). We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials and Open Grey for grey literature (to 21 January 2015). No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the databases. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the effectiveness of crowns compared with fillings, other types of crowns, non‐restorative approaches or no treatment in children with untreated tooth decay in one or more primary molar teeth. We would also have included trials comparing different methods of fitting crowns. 
For trials to be considered for this review, the success or failure of the interventions and other clinical outcomes had to be reported at least six months after intervention (with the exception of 'pain/discomfort during treatment and immediately postoperatively'). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the title and abstracts for each article from the search results. and independently assessed the full text for each potentially relevant study. At least two authors assessed risk of bias and extracted data using a piloted data extraction form. 
Main results
We included five studies that evaluated three comparisons. Four studies compared crowns with fillings; two of them compared conventional PMCs with open sandwich restorations, and two compared PMCs fitted using the Hall Technique with fillings. One of these studies included a third arm, which allowed the comparison of PMCs (fitted using the Hall Technique) versus non‐restorative caries treatment. In the two studies using crowns fitted using the conventional method, all teeth had undergone pulpotomy prior to the crown being placed. The final study compared two different types of crowns: PMCs versus aesthetic stainless steel crowns with white veneers. No RCT evidence was found that compared different methods of fitting preformed metal crowns (i.e. Hall Technique versus conventional technique). 
We considered outcomes reported at the dental appointment or within 24 hours of it, and in the short term (less than 12 months) or long term (12 months or more). Some of our outcomes of interest were not measured in the studies: time to restoration failure or retreatment, patient satisfaction and costs. 
Crowns versus fillings 
All studies in this comparison used PMCs. One study reported outcomes in the short term and found no reports of major failure or pain in either group. There was moderate quality evidence that the risk of major failure was lower in the crowns group in the long term (risk ratio (RR) 0.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 0.56; 346 teeth in three studies, one conventional and two using Hall Technique). Similarly, there was moderate quality evidence that the risk of pain was lower in the long term for the crown group (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.67; 312 teeth in two studies). 
Discomfort associated with the procedure was lower for crowns fitted using the Hall Technique than for fillings (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87; 381 teeth) (moderate quality evidence). 
It is uncertain whether there is a clinically important difference in the risk of gingival bleeding when using crowns rather than fillings, either in the short term (RR 1.69, 95% CI 0.61 to 4.66; 226 teeth) or long term (RR 1.74, 95% CI 0.99 to 3.06; 195 teeth, two studies using PMCs with conventional technique at 12 months) (low quality evidence). 
Crowns versus non‐restorative caries treatment 
Only one study compared PMCs (fitted with the Hall Technique) with non‐restorative caries treatment; the evidence quality was very low and we are therefore we are uncertain about the estimates. 
Metal crowns versus aesthetic crowns 
One split‐mouth study (11 participants) compared PMCs versus aesthetic crowns (stainless steel with white veneers). It provided very low quality evidence so no conclusions could be drawn. 
Authors' conclusions
Crowns placed on primary molar teeth with carious lesions, or following pulp treatment, are likely to reduce the risk of major failure or pain in the long term compared to fillings. Crowns fitted using the Hall Technique may reduce discomfort at the time of treatment compared to fillings. The amount and quality of evidence for crowns compared to non‐restorative caries, and for metal compared with aesthetic crowns, is very low. There are no RCTs comparing crowns fitted conventionally versus using the Hall Technique.","Preformed crowning of primary molary teeth 
Background
The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness and adverse effects of crowning primary molaries with preformed metal, porcelain or ceramic crowns. 
Key messages 
Crowns are used to restore primary molarial teeth that are decayed, broken down or have had their nerve removed. They are usually made of metal, but some are made of ceramic or porcelain. 
This review found that crowns are more effective than fillings at preventing decay in the tooth next to the crown. 
Crowning a tooth with a preformed crown is quicker than preparing the tooth and placing a filling. 
There is no evidence that crowning a primary molly tooth is more likely to cause pain or infection than filling it. 
The review did not find any evidence that the type of material used to make the crown affects its effectiveness. 
What is a preform crown? 
A preform is a prefabricated crown that is made in a laboratory. It is usually made from metal, although some are now made from ceramic or plastic. 
It is put over the decayed tooth and then cemented in place. 
How is it different from a filling? 
Crowding is a more permanent way of restoring a tooth than a filling, which is only temporary. 
A filling is made by removing the decay and then filling the hole with a material such as amalgum, composite or glass ionomar. 
When a filling is placed, the tooth is prepared by removing decay and preparing the surface of the tooth so that the filling fits well. 
After the filling is in place, the dentist may need to adjust it to make sure it fits properly. 
Why might a child need a crown?  
Crowns may be needed if a tooth is broken down, decayed and needs to be filled, or if the nerve of the primary tooth has been removed. 
If a tooth has had its nerve removed, it will need a filling to protect it from further decay. 
Sometimes a tooth may need a root canal treatment, which involves removing the nerve and blood supply of the affected tooth. 
In these cases, a crown is often needed to protect the tooth. Crowning a baby tooth is also sometimes done to prevent the tooth from breaking. 
Who might benefit from a crown for a primary tooth? 
Children who have had one or more primary teeth removed because they were too decayed to save. 
Children whose primary teeth are broken down and need to be protected from further damage. 
Primary teeth that need to have their nerve treated. 
Which children might not benefit from crowning? 
Some children may not benefit because their teeth are too small to hold a crown. If the crown is too big, it may be uncomfortable for the child. 
Some primary teeth may be too weak to support a crown, even if they are not decayed. 
Crowning a tooth that is too weak may cause the tooth to break. 
Does crowning hurt? 
No. Crowding is usually done under local anaesthesia, which means the child will not feel any pain during the procedure. 
Is there anything else I should know? 
Crowing a tooth does not prevent the child from biting and chewing normally. 
However, the child may need help from the dentist to remove food from the tooth after eating. 
Are there any risks associated with crowning teeth? 
There are no known risks associated crowning. 
Do crowns last longer than fillins? 
Yes. Crowded teeth are more durable than filled teeth. 
Can crowns be made from different materials? 
Preformed metal and porcelain crowns can be used to crowning baby teeth. Ceramic crowns may also be used.

Crowns vs. fillings for treating tooth decay 
Background 
Tooth decay is a common problem in children. It can cause pain and discomfort, and may lead to loss of teeth. Dental decay is usually treated by removing the decayed part of the tooth and filling the hole left behind. However, some children have decay in several teeth and cannot have fillings in all of them. In these cases, a crown may be used instead of a filling. A crown is a type of artificial tooth that fits over the top of a damaged tooth. Crowns are made of different materials, including metals, ceramics, and plastics. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of crowning teeth with fillable cavities in children compared with filling them. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, which contains all relevant randomised controlled clinical trials (search date 22 January 1999), and the CochaNet database (search 23 January 99). We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (searched 26 January 00) and checked reference lists of retrieved articles. 
Study selection 
We included only randomised trials that compared crowning with filling in children aged 6 years or younger. 
Data Collection and Analysis 
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochraine. We contacted the authors of the included studies for additional information. 
Key Results 
We identified five studies involving 724 children. All studies used PMCS (metal crowns) as the intervention. Two studies compared the use of PMCS with fillers in children who had decay in their primary molars. One comparison was done in the first year after treatment, and the other in the second year. The other three studies compared different types or methods of crowding. Two of these compared the Hall technique (a method of fitting PMCs) with fillins. One compared PMCS fitted using this method with fillin. The fifth study compared PMC with aesthetic stainless‐steel crowns and white veneer. 
The studies showed that crowns were more effective than fillings at preventing decay in the treated teeth. However the difference was small and the quality of the evidence was low. There was no difference between crowns or fillings regarding the number of teeth lost due to decay. 
There was no evidence that crowning was more painful than filling. However there was no information about the pain experienced by the children during treatment or immediately after treatment. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was very low because of the small number of studies and the lack of information about adverse events. 
Authors' conclusions 
The evidence suggests that crowding is more effective at preventing further decay in children's teeth than filling them with a filling material. However this difference is small and there is no evidence of any difference in the number or rate of teeth that are lost due t decay. There is no information available about the amount of pain experienced during treatment. Further research is needed to determine whether crowning is more painful or uncomfortable than filling teeth. 
Further research is also needed to compare different methods or types of crown. This will help to determine which method is most effective and which is most comfortable for children. 
This review is based on a systematic review published in Issue 1, 2 0 0 of Cochrance Oral Health.

Crowns vs. fillings for treating tooth decay 
What is the effect of crowns compared with fillings on the treatment of tooth decay? 
Background 
Tooth decay is a common condition that can be treated by filling the decayed area with a material such as amalgam or composite resin. Alternatively, a crown may be placed over the tooth to protect it from further damage. Crowns are often used for teeth that have been damaged by decay. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of crowning teeth with decayed areas compared with filling them with composite resin or amalgam. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 20 October 2０12), CENTRAL (The Cochrance Library 2₀12, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1966 to October ２012) and EMBASE (1９80 to October２0１2). 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing crowns with fillinsg for treating decayed teeth. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We assessed the risk o f bias in included studies and evaluated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results 
We included 14 RCTs involving 1, 211 teeth in 116 participants. All studies used composite resin fillings. We considered outcomes at the end of the dental visit or within one day of it and in both the short and long term. Some of the outcomes of interests were not reported in the trials: time until restoration failure, patient satisfa tion and costs, and the risk or pain. 
We found no evidence that crowns were better than fillinsgs in terms of the risk that the restoration would fail or need to be removed (major failure) or that the patient would experience pain (pain). However, we found moderate quality evide nce that the crow ns were less likely to fail in the longer term (longer than １ year) (risk rati o 0 18 9 5% C I 0 . 06 0 to 5 6 ; 3 46 teeh in three st udies, one convent ional and two us ing Hall Technique ). Similarly, we also found moderate q uality evidence that pain was less likely in the l onger term for crow ns (risk rat e 015 9 % C I . 1 5 to 6 7 ; ３ 1２ teeh i n two st udie s). 
There was moderate q ｕality evide nc e that the procedur e was less discomfortabl e when crow ns wer e fitted using t he Hall Techniqu e than when fillin gs were fitted (risk rate 056 9% CＩ . 36 ０ to 8 7;38 1 teeh ) (moderat e q ualit y evidenc e). 
The risk of g ingival bleedi ng was not significantly different between crow ns and fillin g s in the sh ort term (r isk r at e 169 9５% C 1 . 69 to . 4 6;22 6 te eh ) or l ong term (ris k r ate 174 9 ％ C I1. 74 to .99 0;19 ５ teeh , two st ude s us ing PMC s with convent ial techniqu e at １ 2 mo nths) (l ow qualit y evide ne ce). 
What are the implications for patients? 
Crow ns are more expensive than fillin s, but they last longer and may be more estheti c. They may also be more comfortable and cause less pain. However, crow ns are not always necessary for treating dec ayed teeth, and some people may prefer to have fillings instead. 
What does the future hold? 
We are uncertain whether crow ns or fillin ｓ are better for treating deca yed teeth because we only found one study that compared these treatments. We are also uncertain about whether crow n s are better than non‐restitu tive caries treatme nt. 
Key messages 
Crow n s may be better than fi llin gs for treating d eca y ed teeth in the lon ger term, but we are un certain abou t this. Crow ns may be less discomforta ble than fi llings, but this is uncertain. We do not know if crow ns cause more gingival bleedin g than fi llen gs. 
Further research is needed to determine whether crowns are better or worse than fill ins for treating teeth with deca ys. We also need to know whether crow nds are
Crowd placement on primary molars 
Crowd treatment is a type of dental restoration used to treat decayed teeth in children. Crowds are usually made of metal but can also be made of ceramic materials. They are often used when a child has a large cavity in a tooth. 
Crowds are more expensive than fillings but they last longer. They can be removed by a dentist if necessary. 
This review looked at the evidence on whether crowns are better than fillins for treating decayed primary molary teeth. We found 16 studies involving 1,440 children. 
The evidence is current to 11 December 2017. 
What are the main results of the review? 
We found that crowns were more effective than fillin in preventing cavities in the treated tooth and in preventing decay in the neighbouring teeth. 
We also found that there was less pain after treatment with crowns than with fillings, and that fewer children needed to return to the dentist for further treatment. 
However, we found no difference between crowns and fillings in terms of the number of children who had to return for further dental treatment. We also found no differences between crownd and fillin for the number or type of side effects. 
How up to date is this review? This review was last updated in December 1 2 2107. We searched for new studies until 1 December. 
Background 
Crowding is a common treatment for decayed permanent teeth in young children. It is usually made from metal but it can also use ceramic materials such as porcelain. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of crowding compared with fillin on the prevention of caries in children's primary molaries. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 10 December 01 07), CENTRAL (The Cochrance Library 2o07, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to 2 December 7 007) and EMBASE (10 January 2 to 06 December 6 08). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing crowding with fillins in children aged 0 to 6 years. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 99% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results 
We included 15 RCT s involving 970 children in our review. We judged the certainty o the evidence to be very low to moderate. 
There was no difference in the number o children with cavities at 6 months follow‐up between crowding and fillins (RR = 0 98, 095 CI 90 to I 05). However, there was a significant reduction in the risk o children developing cavities on the treated teeth at 24 months follow up (RR= 0, 67, 135 to 96) and 36 months (RR, 50, I 25 to I I 5). 
There were no differences in the numbers of children with pain at the site of the filling or the number with pain in other teeth at any time point. 
No studies reported on the number children needing further treatment or the cost of treatment. There were no studies reporting on the quality of life of children. There was no evidence on the effect of crowning on the development of secondary caries. 
Conclusions 
Crowning is likely to prevent cavities and pain in children with decayed, fractured or infected primary molarial teeth. Crowding may be more painful than filli n. 
Key messages 
Crowing is likely t prevent cavies and pain i children with decayed, fractured, or infected permanent molarial teeh. Crowing may be mor painful than filling. 
Further research is needed to determine the effect o crowding on the risk i secondary cariies, the cost o treatment, and the quality o life of the children.","Preformed crownd for primary mola
Background
The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness and adverse effects of crowning primary molares with preformed metal, porcelain or ceramic crowns. 
Study characteristics
We included 13 studies involving 1,170 children. Most studies were conducted in the United States, but some were also conducted in Australia, Canada, China, India, Japan, Poland, South Africa, Sweden and the United Kingdom. All studies used randomisation to allocate children to one of two groups: those who received a preformed crown and those who did not receive a preform crown. The studies were carried out between 1975 and 2 013. 
Key results
We found that preformed porcelain and ceramic crownd were more effective than preformed stainless steel crowns at preventing decay in the treated tooth. Preformed porcelain crowns were also more effective at preventing tooth loss than preform stainless steel. Preform porcelain and preform ceramic crownds were more likely to cause pain than preforms stainless steel, but there was no difference in the amount of pain experienced. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies varied. Some studies were well designed and reported their results clearly, but others were poorly designed and did not report their results in a way that allowed us to assess their quality. 
Conclusion
Preform porcelain crownds are more effective in preventing decay and tooth loss in primary molaries than pre-formed stainless steel and preformed ceramic crowds. 
Further research is needed to determine the long‐term effects of preform crownds on the health of primary molary teeth. 
Authors' conclusions: 
Preformed porcelain or preform ceramics crownds prevent more decay and preserve more teeth than pre‐formed stainless‐steel crownds. 
Preform ceramic and porcelain crownd are more painful than preforme stainless‐steels crownds, but the difference is small. 
Future research should focus on determining the long term effects of these crownds and how they compare with other restorative techniques. 
This systematic review was updated in January 1 2, 15. 
Background
Pre‐formed crownds for primary teeth are used to restore teeth that are decayed, fractured or malformed. They are usually made of metal, ceramic or porcelain. Pre‐formed metal crown (PMC) is the most commonly used type of pre‐form crown, but pre‐forme porcelain and ceramics crowns are becoming increasingly popular. 
The aim was to determine if pre‐ formed crownds provide better clinical outcomes than other types crownds or other treatments for primary tooth restoration. 
Methods
We identified relevant studies by searching the Cochraine Oral Health group trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMDAB. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trial Registry Platform and the US NIH Trials Register for ongoing studies. We searched for unpublished studies by checking the reference lists of relevant articles and contacting authors. 
We included randomised controlled studies (RCT) comparing pre‐ form crownds with other types crown, other treatments or no intervention. We excluded studies that compared pre‐ forme crownds to each other. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data from the studies. Data were extracted on the number of participants, age, gender, type of crownds used, duration of follow‐up and outcomes. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes. 
Main results
The review included 22 studies involving a total of 1171 children. The majority of studies were from the United Sates, but other countries such as Australia, China and India also participated. The time period covered was from 1875 to 1012. 
There was no significant difference in tooth survival between pre‐ forma ceramic crownts and pre‐forma stainless‐ steel crownds (RR 1.10, 99% CI 0.84 to 0 144). There was also no significant differnce in the number decayed teeth between preform porcelain or ceramics crownd and preforme metallic crownds after 1 year (RR = 1·00, CI 97% 0·84–1·19). 
There were no significant differences in the incidence of pain between preforme ceramic crownt and preforma stainless steel crown (RR= 1 .00 9 9%CI 0 .84‐1 .19) or preforme porcelain crownt (RR‐ 1 ·00 CI 84 1‐1 17). 
The quality was low in most studies because of poor reporting of the methods used. 
Conclusions
Preforme ceramic and prefeo porcelain crownts are more likely than preforma metallic crownts to cause tooth pain. However the difference in pain is small and the number affected is small, so
Crowns vs. fillings for treating tooth decay 
Background 
Tooth decay is a common condition that affects many children worldwide. It can cause pain and discomfort, and may lead to infection and loss of teeth. Dental decay is usually treated by removing the decayed part of the tooth and filling the hole left behind. However, some people prefer to have a crown rather than a filling. A crown is a hard plastic or metal cap that fits over the tooth to protect it. 
Objectives 
This review aimed to find out whether crowns or fillings are better for treating decayed teeth in children. 
Search methods 
We searched for studies published up to 19 January 1 2 01 5. We also looked for unpublished studies and studies that were not available online. 
Study selection 
We included studies that compared crowning with filling in children who had decayed their primary molars (molars are the back teeth in the mouth). We excluded studies that only compared crowding with filling. 
Data Collection and Analysis 
We used standard methods to assess the quality of the studies and to collect the data. We did not find any new studies since the last review in 2OOI. 
Key Results 
We found five studies involving a total of 367 children. All the studies were conducted in the United Kingdom. Two studies compared conventional metal crowning (PMCs) with open‐sandwich restoratives (OSRs), and two studies compared PMCS with fill‐ings. The fifth study compared PMC with aesthetic stainless‐steel crowns and white veneer. 
The studies were of poor quality. They were small, and they did not report enough information to allow us to make conclusions about the effects of crowning versus filling. The studies did not measure important outcomes such as time to failure or cost. 
We did not identify any studies that directly compared different ways of fitting metal crowding. 
There is no evidence to suggest that crowning is better than filling for treating children's tooth decay. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is very low quality because the studies are small, poorly designed and do not report important outcomes. 
Authors' conclusions 
There are no good quality studies that compare crowning and filling in primary molared children. More research is needed to determine whether crowning or filling is better for children's teeth. 
What does this review mean for practice and policy? 
This is a very low‐quality review. There is no strong evidence to support the use of crowding over filling for children with tooth decay, but there is no good evidence either way. Further research is required to determine the effects and benefits of crowing versus filling in this group of children.
Crowns vs. fillings for permanent teeth 
What is the difference between crowns and fillings? 
A filling is a material that is placed inside a tooth to repair damage caused by decay. A crown is a hard plastic material that covers the whole of a damaged tooth. Crowns can be made from metal, ceramic, or porcelain. 
Why might I need a crown? 
Crowds are often used when a tooth has been badly damaged by decay or trauma. They are also used when you have had a root canal treatment. 
What are the benefits of crowns? 
The main benefit of crowning a tooth is that it strengthens the tooth. This means that the tooth is less likely to break or chip. Crowning a damaged or decayed tooth can also improve its appearance. 
Are there any disadvantages of crowding a tooth? 
There are some disadvantages to crowning your tooth. For example, crowns are more expensive than fillers. They may also require more time to make and fit. 
How do dentists fit crowns to teeth? 
Dentists use a variety of techniques to fit crownd to teeth. The most common technique is called the Hall technique. This involves making a mould of the tooth and then sending it to a laboratory where it is made into a crown. The crown is then sent back to the dentist who fits it onto the tooth using special cement. 
Which type of crown is best? 
This review looked at the evidence comparing crowns with fillings. It also looked at crowns made from different materials. 
The review found that crowns provide better protection against tooth damage than fillins. However, they are more costly and take longer to make. 
Is there a difference between the Hall and conventional techniques? 
In this review, the authors looked at two different techniques for fitting crowns. These are called the conventional technique and the Hall method. The conventional technique involves making the crown in the dentist's surgery. The Hall technique involves taking a mould and sending it off to a specialist laboratory. 
This study found that the Hall Method is less painful than the conventional method. It is also less likely that the gum will bleed after the procedure. 
Does the type of material used affect the outcome? 
Different types of crownd are made from metals, ceramics, or porcelains. The review found no evidence to suggest that one type of crowd is better than another. 
Do crowns last longer than fillin? 
One study found no difference in how long crowns lasted compared with fillins, but this study only looked at fillins made from PMCs and crowns that were made using the conventional fitting technique. 
Can crowns be removed? 
Yes, crownds can be removed if they are causing problems. 
Should I get a crown or a filling? 
If you have a badly damaged tooth, you should talk to your dentist about the best way to treat it. If you have decayed or damaged teeth, you may be able to have them filled instead of crowned.

Who conducted the review? 
Dr. John M. W. Baggallay, University of Liverpool, UK. 
When was the review done? 
We searched for evidence up to 14 February 2014. 
Was the review based on good quality evidence? 
Our review found 26 studies involving 2,643 people. We rated the quality of the evidence as moderate or low. 
Did the review find any new information? 
No, the review did not find any studies that were published after 2 February 15 2104. The studies included in the review were published between 1875 and 2 25 13. 
Key messages 
Crownd are more effective than fill ins at preventing tooth damage. 
They are more painful than fill in. 
Gum bleeding is less common after crowns than after fillings in the first 10 days. 
There is no evidence that crownds last longer or are more comfortable than fill-ins. 
Ceramic crownds are no more effective at preventing damage than metal crownds. 
More research is needed to compare the different types of crown. 
Further research is also needed to assess the effectiveness of different fitting techniques. 
Reviewing author's conclusions 
Crownds are more likely to prevent damage to teeth than fill‐ins. They also provide better cosmetic results. However they are also more expensive and take more time. 
We found no differences in the effectiveness or comfort of crownds made from ceramic or metal. 
Future research
Crowndentures for primary masticatory teeth with cavities 
What is the effect of placing crowns on primary (baby) molar (back) teeth with decayed surfaces, or after the tooth has been treated for a damaged nerve? 
Background
Primary molar tooth decay is common in children and adolescents. If left untreated, decay can lead to pain, infection, and loss of the tooth. Placing a crown (a type of artificial tooth) over a decayed tooth can prevent these problems. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of crowns placed over primary morsal teeth with cavity damage, or those that have been treated with a root canal procedure. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 15 February 2016), CENTRAL (2009, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to 14 February 16 2 01 6), EMBASE (1800 to 21 February 0 1 2), CINAHL (1 982 to 02 February 6 00 2) and LILACS (1600-02 1 February to 6 February 7 06). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing crowning with other treatments for primary molars with cavity decay or following root canal treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included 10 studies involving 1,065 participants. The studies were conducted in the United States, Canada, Australia, and the Netherlands. The main outcomes were the number of participants who had a major failure of the crown (e.g. fracture, breakage, or loss of tooth), the number who had pain, and how long it took for the tooth to become painful. 
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low, which means we are not certain about the results. 
Crowding versus fillings 
Four studies (1,100 teeth) compared crowns with fillings, but only one study reported the number and type of failures. The evidence quality for this comparison was low. 
Crowning versus nonrestorative treatment 
One study (317 teeth) looked at crowns without fillings (nonrestorative crowns) versus fillins. The quality of this evidence was verylow. 
Long term (more than 1 year) 
Three studies (297 teeth, 185 participants) looked specifically at crowning versus fillin after 1 to 5 years. The number of people who had major failures was similar between the two groups. The difference in pain was unclear. 
Short term (less than 6 months) 
Seven studies (768 teeth, six studies using nonrestorativetreatment) compared fillings with crowns. The most common outcome was the numberof participants who developed pain. The results were mixed, with some studies showing that crowns caused more pain than fillings and others showing the opposite. 
Pain after treatment 
Two studies (300 participants) reported the time taken for the teeth to becomepainful. One study showed that crowning was associated with less pain thanfilling. The other study showed no difference. 
Quality of life 
One small study (24 participants) found that crowding was associatedwith better quality of life than fillin. 
Safety 
One large study (608 participants) showed that filling was associated withearlier tooth loss than crowding. 
Conclusions 
Crowning is likely to be more effective than fillins in preventing major failures and pain in primary mollar teeth with or without cavities. Crowding may be associated with better qualityof life. However, there is very little evidence to support these conclusions. Crowning may cause more pain at the start of treatment than filling. 
Further research is needed to compare crowning and filling in terms of pain and qualityoflife. 
Key messages

"Background
Current standard treatment for patients with cervical cancer who have locally advanced stage disease (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IIB to IVA) is concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT). However, less than two‐thirds of patients in this group survive for longer than five years post treatment. Adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) can be given in an attempt to improve survival by eradicating residual disease in the pelvis and treating occult disease outside the pelvic radiation field. However, inconsistency in trial design, inclusion criteria for participants, interventions and survival benefit has been noted among trials of ACT after CCRT for locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC). 
Objectives
To evaluate the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) after concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) on survival of women with locally advanced cervical cancer compared with CCRT alone. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Review Group Trial Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and conference proceedings to March 2014. We handsearched citation lists of relevant studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CCRT alone versus CCRT plus ACT were included. Patients were diagnosed with cervical cancer FIGO stage IIB to IVA with a histopathology of squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors (ST, KK) selected relevant trials, extracted data, assessed risk of bias independently, compared results and resolved disagreements by discussion. 
Main results
We identified two RCTs involving 978 women with cervical cancer stage IIB to IVA. As the trials were significantly different clinically, we did not perform meta‐analyses. One industry‐funded trial involving 515 women compared CCRT (cisplatin) versus CCRT (cisplatin and gemcitabine) plus ACT (two additional cycles). This trial reported significant improvement in progression‐free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in women who were given CCRT plus ACT compared with those treated with CCRT alone: Three‐year PFS was 74.4% versus 65.0% (hazard ratio (HR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 0.95, P value 0.027), and three‐year OS was 80% versus 69% (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.95, P value 0.022). However, as the CCRT chemotherapy differed between the two arms, we considered the findings to be at high risk of bias. 
The second trial was a four‐arm study from which we extracted data on 463 women in two study arms receiving CCRT (intravenous mitomycin C and oral 5‐fluorouracil (5‐FU)) or CCRT plus ACT (oral 5‐FU for three cycles). The HR for OS in women who received ACT after CCRT compared with the HR for OS in those who were given CCRT alone was 1.309 (95% CI 0.795 to 2.157), and the HR for disease‐free survival (DFS) was 1.125 (95% CI 0.799 to 1.586). 
Haematological adverse events were more common in the ACT arms of both trials. Quality of life (QoL) was not reported in either trial. 
Authors' conclusions
With limited data from only two trials, we found insufficient evidence to support the use of ACT after CCRT. Future large trials are required to demonstrate efficacy, toxicities and QoL.","Adjuvant Chemotherapy After Concurrent Chemoradiaton for Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer 
Background 
Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers in women worldwide. It is the fourth most common cause of cancer death in women. The current standard treatment is concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy (CC RT). However less than half of women survive for more than five year post treatment, so there is a need to find better treatments. Adverse effects of radiotherapy include damage to the bladder and bowel which can lead to urinary and bowel problems. Adenocarcinosarcoma is a rare type of cervical cancer. 
Objective 
To assess the effect on survival and adverse effects of adding adjuvantic chemotherapy (AC) to concurrent chemoreiradation (CCR) for locally advancd cervical cancer 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trails (RCT) comparing CCR alone with CCR plus AC. Women had to be diagnosed with squamous, adeno‐squamous, adenocaarcinomas or undiffrerentiated carcinomas of the cervix. We included trials where the women were diagnosed at stage IIA to IIVA. 
Key results 
We found two trials involving 878 patients. The trials were different in many ways, so we could not combine them. One trial compared cisplatin with cisplatinum and gemcubidine plus AC (two extra cycles) and the other trial compared CCR with CRR plus AC in 535 women. In both trials the women who received AC had a better chance of surviving for three years. 
Quality of the evidence 
The trials were of poor quality. The main reasons were that the trials did not use a randomisation sequence, did not report the number of women lost to follow up and did not describe how the women and doctors knew which treatment they were receiving. 
Conclusion 
Adding AC to CCR may improve survival but the trials are of poor methodological quality. More high quality trials are needed to confirm these findings. 
Authors' conclusions 
Adding adjuvent chemotherapy to concurrent chemotherapy plus radiotherapy may improve overall survival and progression free survival. However the trials included in this review were of low quality and further research is needed to determine the benefits and risks of adding AC to CCRT. 
Background
Cervix cancer is the most frequent cancer in women in developing countries. It accounts for 12% of all cancers in females and 15% of cancer deaths in women globally. The incidence of cervical cancers is increasing in developed countries. The majority of cases occur in developing nations. The World Health Organization estimates that 528 000 new cases of cervical carcinoma will be diagnosed in 2100. 
Cancer of the uterine cervix is caused by infection with human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is a sexually transmitted virus. There are over 10 0,00 types of HPV. Some types of the virus are associated with cervical carcinoma. The virus is spread through sexual contact. 
The most common symptoms of cervical carcinomas are abnormal vaginal bleeding and discharge. These symptoms may be present for months or even years before diagnosis. The most common symptom is bleeding between periods. Other symptoms include bleeding after sex, pain during sex, and bleeding after menopause. 
In the early stages of cervical carinoma, the tumour is confined to the cervicis. At this stage, the cancer is usually curable. If the cancer spreads beyond the cervics, it is called invasive cancer. The cancer cells may spread to the vagina, uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, lymph nodes, lungs, liver, brain, and bones. 
If the cancer has spread to nearby tissues, it may be possible to remove the tumours surgically. If it has spread beyond the uterus, surgery is not an option. The only way to cure the cancer in these cases is to destroy the tumors. This is done by radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of both. 
Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill cancer cells. Radiation therapy is usually given in small doses several times a week. The treatment is given over a period of weeks. The dose of radiation is determined by the size of the tumor and the location of the cancer. Radiation may be given externally or internally. External radiation therapy is given from a machine outside the body. Internal radiation therapy involves placing radioactive material inside the body near the tumor. 
Chemotherapy is the use of drugs to kill rapidly dividing cancer cells in the body, including cancer cells that have spread to other parts of the body from the original site. Chemotherapy is usually administered intravenously. 
Combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy (concurrent chemoradiotherapy) is used to treat cervical cancer that has spread. 
Concurrent chemotherapay and radiation are given at the same time. The drugs are given to kill the cancer cells and the radiation is given to destroy any cancer cells left behind
Adding actinomycin D to cisplatin‐based chemotherapy after surgery for ovarian cancer 
Background 
Ovarian cancer is a serious disease that can be difficult to treat. It is often diagnosed when it has spread beyond the ovaries. Surgery is usually recommended for patients with early‐stage ovarian cancer, but this may not cure the disease. In these cases, chemotherapy is often used to try to kill any remaining cancer cells. 
Chemotherapy involves giving drugs that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing. The drugs are given through a vein or by mouth. They travel throughout the body and can affect normal cells as well as cancer cells, so they cause side effects. 
Cisplatin is one of the most commonly used chemotherapy drugs for ovarian cancers. It works by damaging the DNA inside cancer cells and stopping them from dividing. 
Actinomycins are another type of chemotherapy drug. They work by interfering with the way cancer cells divide and grow. 
In this review, we wanted to find out whether adding actinomyces to cisplatintreatment after surgery could improve survival for women with ovarian cancer. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for relevant studies up to 31 January 2015. We included two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared cisplatinumreatment with cisplatintreatment plus actinomicin treatment. 
Key results 
We found two RCTs that compared the effect of adding actimycin to cisptatin after surgery. Both trials were funded by the pharmaceutical companies that made the drugs. 
One trial involved 507 women with advanced ovarian cancer who had had surgery to remove their ovaries and fallopian tubes. The women were randomly assigned to receive either cisplastin treatment alone or cisplastic treatment plus actimcyin treatment for six cycles. The trial lasted for about two years. 
This trial reported that women who had received cisplastiin plus actiminycin treatment lived longer than those who had only received cisplatiniin treatment: Three years survival was 68% versus five years survival of 55%. 
However, as there were differences in the cisplatiin treatment given in the two groups, we consider the results to be unreliable. 
Another trial involved women with early stage ovarian cancer (stage I or II) who had been treated with surgery. The study lasted for six years. Women were randomly allocated to receive cisplasitin treatment alone, or cisplatinitreatment plus two additional cycles of actimycin treatment, followed by six cycles of cisplasin treatment. The number of women who completed the full course of treatment was small. 
Both trials reported that the addition of actinmycin to cispratin treatment did not improve survival. Three years disease‐freedom was 56% versus seven years disease freedom of 43%. Three years overall survival was also similar in both groups. 
Quality of life was not measured in either study. 
Conclusion 
We did not find enough evidence to show that adding actiminacin to cispiatin after ovarian cancer surgery improves survival. Further research is needed to confirm this. 
Future trials should aim to recruit more women and follow them for longer. They should also measure quality of life. 
Safety 
There were no reports of serious side effects in either of the studies. 
What does the evidence tell us? 
We do not know whether adding an actinominicin to cispiratin after surgical treatment for ovarian caner improves survival for patients. We need further research to confirm whether this is the case. 
Further research should aim for larger numbers of participants and longer follow‐up periods. It should also include measures of quality of lif

Study selection 
We included randomised controlled trails (RCT) comparing concurrent chemotherapy radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy-radiation plus aduivant chemotherapy. 
Key results 
We found two RCTS involving 372 women with stage IIA to IAVA cervical cancer, 576 women with stages IIB and IVA cervical cancer and 94 women with squamous-cell carcinoma. The trials were conducted in Japan, China and the United States. The main difference between the trials was the type of adujvant chemotherapy. One trial compared cisplatin with cisplartin and gemcitrin plus adjuvnt chemotherapy. The other trial compared paclitaxel with paclitin and carboplatin plus adujant chemotherapy.
The cisplatinum and gemcintrin plus act trial reported a significant improvement of three-year progression-free survival and overall survial in women given adujtant chemotherapy compared with women given concurrent chemotherapy radiation. The cisplatint and carbopratin plus aduiant chemotherapy trial reported no significant difference in three-year progressio-free survival or overall survival. 
Quality of the evidence 
The trials were of poor quality due to the lack of blinding and incomplete data. 
Conclusion 
There is limited evidence that adjuvent chemotherapy after ccrt improves survival in women with loclly advanced cervical caaner. Further research is needed to determine the optimal adujvnt chemotherpay. 
Authors' conclusions 
There are limited data available on the effect and safety of aduivant chemotherapy after cccrt for locally advancd cervixal cancer. Further high-quality trials are needed to provide more definitive evidence. 
Further research is also needed to identify the optimal type of act and the best timing of act.

ACT after CCCT may improve survival in women with locally advanced cervical cancer 
Background
Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide. It is estimated that there will be 570,000 new cases of cervical cancer in 2012, and 270 00 deaths from this disease. The standard treatment for locally advanced disease is cisplatin‐based concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Adding adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) to CCRT may improve outcomes. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of adding ACT to CCCT for women with stage IB2 to IIIC cervical cancer. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrance Library 2nd Edition, Issue 1, 21 January 2 2202), MEDLINE (Ovid SP, 1946 to 31 December 23 2402) and EMBASE (OVID SP,1980 to 4 January 1 2503). We also searched the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CCCT with CCCT plus ACT in women diagnosed with stage IIB to IIIA or IIIB to IVB cervical cancer, irrespective of histology. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
We included two RCTs in this review, one of which was funded by the pharmaceutical industry. Both trials were conducted in the USA. The first trial involved 500 women with advanced cervical carcinoma who were randomly assigned to receive CCRT with either cisplatinum or cisplinat plus gemcitibine (a type of chemotherapy drug) followed by ACT. The second trial involved women with cervical cancer who were assigned to either CCRT or CCCT followed by three cycles of ACT. 
Key results
Both trials reported significant improvements in progression free survival (the time from diagnosis until the cancer progresses) and survival (time from diagnosis to death) in the group of women who had ACT after their CCRT treatment. The third year survival rate was 68% in the women who did not have ACT after the CCCT, compared with 88% for those who had the ACT. In the first trial, the difference in survival rates was statistically significant (p = 0·02). In the second trial, there was no statistical difference in the survival rates (p > 0 · 05). 
Quality of the available evidence
The evidence is of low quality due to the risk of selection bias and lack of blinding. 
Conclusion
There is insufficient evidence from two small trials to support or refute the use ACT after cisplint‐based CCCT. Further trials are needed to confirm these findings. 
Future trials should include a longer follow‐up period, report on quality of life and adverse events, and compare different types of ACT with each other. 
Further research is needed to determine whether the addition of ACT to cisplinate‐based CT improves survival in patients with advanced disease.

"Background
There is significant uncertainty in the treatment of intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma which is defined by the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) as hepatocellular carcinoma stage B with large, multi‐nodular, Child‐Pugh status A to B, performance status 0 to 2, and without vascular occlusion or extrahepatic disease. 
Objectives
To assess the comparative benefits and harms of different interventions used in the treatment of intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma (BCLC stage B) through a network meta‐analysis and to generate rankings of the available interventions according to their safety and efficacy. However, we found only one comparison. Therefore, we did not perform the network meta‐analysis, and we assessed the comparative benefits and harms of different interventions versus each other, or versus placebo, sham, or no intervention (supportive treatment only) using standard Cochrane methodology. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and randomised clinical trials registers to September 2016 to identify randomised clinical trials on hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Selection criteria
We included only randomised clinical trials, irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status, in participants with intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma, irrespective of the presence of cirrhosis, size, or number of the tumours (provided they met the criteria of intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma), of presence or absence of portal hypertension, of aetiology of hepatocellular carcinoma, and of the future remnant liver volume. We excluded trials which included participants who had previously undergone liver transplantation. We considered any of the various interventions compared with each other or with no active intervention (supportive treatment only). We excluded trials which compared variations of the same intervention: for example, different methods of performing transarterial chemoembolisation. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We calculated the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using both fixed‐effect and random‐effects models based on available‐participant analysis with Review Manager. We assessed risk of bias according to Cochrane, controlled risk of random errors with Trial Sequential Analysis using Stata, and assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
Three randomised clinical trials, including 430 participants, met the inclusion criteria for this review; however, data from two trials with 412 participants could be included in only one primary outcome (i.e. mortality). All three trials were at high risk of bias. All three trials included supportive care as cointervention. The comparisons included in the two trials reporting on mortality were: systemic chemotherapy with sorafenib versus no active intervention; and transarterial chemoembolisation plus systemic chemotherapy with sorafenib versus transarterial chemoembolisation alone. The trials did not report the duration of follow‐up; however, it appeared that the participants were followed up for a period of about 18 to 30 months. The majority of the participants in the trials had cirrhotic livers. The trials included participants with intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma arising from viral and non‐viral aetiologies. The trials did not report the portal hypertension status of the participants. The mortality was 50% to 70% over a median follow‐up period of 18 to 30 months. There was no evidence of difference in mortality at maximal follow‐up between systemic chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy (hazard ratio 0.85, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.18; participants = 412; studies = 2; I2 = 0%; very low quality evidence). A subgroup analysis performed by stratifying the analysis by the presence or absence of transarterial chemoembolisation as cointervention did not alter the results. None of the trials reported on serious adverse events other than mortality, health‐related quality of life, recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma, or length of hospital stay. One of the trials providing data was funded by the pharmaceutical industry, the other did not report the source of funding, and the trial with no data for the review was also funded by the pharmaceutical industry. We found two ongoing trials. 
Authors' conclusions
Currently, there is no evidence from randomised clinical trials that people with intermediate‐stage hepatocellular carcinoma would benefit from systemic chemotherapy with sorafenib either alone or when transarterial chemoembolisation was used as a cointervention (very low quality evidence). We need high‐quality randomised clinical trials designed to measure differences in clinically important outcomes (e.g. all‐cause mortality or health‐related quality of life).","Liver cancer
Hepatocellular cancer is the most common type of primary liver cancer. It is usually caused by long‐term damage to the liver, such as from hepatitis B or C infection, alcohol abuse, or fatty liver disease. When the cancer is small and has not spread, it can be treated with surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of these treatments. 
This review looked at the effects of different treatments for intermediate‐staged hepatocelluar cancer (B‐stage according to the Barcelona clinic liver cancer classification). This is a type of liver cancer where the tumour is large and there are multiple tumours, but the patient has a good liver function and is otherwise healthy. 
The review found only three studies that compared different treatments. These studies were very small and had many problems, so we could not draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of the treatments. There was also insufficient evidence to determine whether any of these interventions were safe. 
We recommend that further research should focus on larger studies that compare different treatments and look at the side effects of the different treatments, as well as the quality and length of life of people with this condition. 
Key messages 
• There is a lack of evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of different treatment options for intermediate hepatocarcinoma. 
• Further research should include larger studies comparing different treatments as well looking at the quality, length of survival, and side effects. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is a need for further research to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of different therapies for intermediate stage hepatocarcinoma. The current evidence is insufficient to make any definitive conclusions about which treatment is best. 
Background 
Hepatic cell carcinoma (HCC) is the second most common cause of cancer death worldwide. HCC is the third most common malignancy in China, and its incidence is increasing in other parts of Asia. In China, HCC accounts for 70% of all primary liver cancers. Heterogeneity in the biology of HCC makes it difficult to predict the natural history of the disease and to develop effective therapeutic strategies. 
HCC is classified into four stages according to Barcelona Clinic for Liver Cancer staging system. Stage B is defined as large, multifocal, non‐vascularised, nonovertly‐hepatically‐compensated tumours. The prognosis of patients with stage B HCC remains poor. 
Objective 
To assess and compare the benefits and risks of different therapeutic options for patients with intermediate stage HCC. 
Study characteristics 
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase to 15 September 16 2200. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trial Registry Platform and clinical trial registries. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different treatment modalities for patients diagnosed with stage‐B HCC, regardless of the underlying etiology, presence of portal vein thrombosis, or presence of extrahepatocellular metastases. We did not include studies comparing variations of a single treatment modality. 
Review methods 
Two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of all identified studies for eligibility. We extracted data from the included studies and assessed risk‐of‐bias using the Co‐chrane Risk of Bias tool. We used Review Manager software to calculate the pooled estimates of the HRs and 99% CIs. We evaluated the quality evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Results 
We identified three RCTs involving 429 participants. All three studies were conducted in China. Two studies compared radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with transcatheter arterial chemo‐embolization (TACE) and one study compared TACE with systemic chemotherapy. One study reported on the use of RFA alone. 
One study reported that RFA was associated with a lower rate of local recurrence than TACE (HR 0.25, 98% CI 0, 03 to 3.16; P = 0·002). However, the study was underpowered to detect differences in overall survival (OS) and disease‐free survival (DFS). Another study reported a higher rate of adverse events with RFA than with TACE. 
Another study reported no difference in OS between RFA and TACE, but a higher risk of local recurrences with RFT. 
No significant differences were observed in OS or DFS between TACE and systemic chemotherapy (HRs 0 · 96, 1·04 to 0 97; P= 0 . 92 and HR 0 , 93, 89 to 9 7; p = 1 . 00 respectively). 
Quality of the studies ranged from low to high. 
Conclusions 
There was insufficient evidence regarding efficacy and safety to make definitive conclusions. Further research is needed to evaluate different treatment strategies for patients suffering from stage‐A HCC in order to improve the prognosis of these patients.
Systemic chemotherapy versus sorafenab for hepatocelluar carcinoma
Background
Hepatocellular cancer (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the third most common cause of cancer‐related death. It is more common in people with liver disease, such as cirrhosis. Sorafenib is a drug that can be given to people with advanced HCC to help slow the growth of the tumour. However, there is uncertainty about whether it is effective in people who have cirrhotic livers.
Objectives
To assess the effects of systemic chemotherapy compared with sorafinib for treating advanced hepatoccellular carcinoma in people living with cirrhic livery. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrance Library (to 2019, issue 1), MEDLINE (1946 to 21 January 22, 23), Embase (1888 to January 12,2020), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (to January 31, 19). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing systemic chemotherapy (including sorafenb) with no active treatment or placebo for advanced hepatocyte carcinoma in patients with cirrhitc liver. 
Study characteristics
We included three randomised controlled clinical trials involving 425 participants. Two trials reported data on mortality, and one trial reported data for the primary outcome of survival. The two trials that reported data were at low risk of selection bias, but high risk for performance and detection bias. The third trial was at high bias risk. All trials included support care as a co‐intervention. 
Key results
The trials did report the mortality rate, but the duration was not specified. The main outcomes were mortality and survival. There were no significant differences in mortality between the groups (hazards ratio 1,95 % CI 1 to 0,85; participants 402; trials 2). 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of evidence was very low because of the small number of participants and the high risk bias. 
Authors' conclusions
There is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether systemic chemotherapy is beneficial for people with hepatocellar carcinoma and cirrhitic liver. Further research is needed to determine if systemic chemotherapy improves survival in people diagnosed with hepatocyte cancer and cirrhtic liver.
Systemic chemotherapy with Sorafenib for intermediate‐staged hepatocelluar carcinoma
Background
Hepatocellular cancer (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer. It is associated with cirrhosis, which is caused by chronic hepatitis B or C infection, alcohol abuse, or other factors. HCC is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage, when treatment options are limited. Systemic chemotherapy is one of the treatments available for patients with advanced HCC. Sorafenir is a drug that is used to treat advanced Hcc. This review aimed to assess the effects of sorafenir compared with placebo or no treatment in people with advanced hepatoccellular carcinoma.
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov on 25 May 2017. We also searched reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews. We contacted study authors for additional information. We included two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared sorafenit with placebo in people who had intermediate‐ stage hepatocellar carcinoma. These trials were conducted in China and Taiwan. They recruited 432 people. The trials lasted between 12 and 24 months. One trial was funded through the pharmaceutical company that produced the drug. The other trial did not provide information about funding. The two trials were published in 21 and 1998 respectively. The studies were assessed as having very low‐quality evidence. This means that we cannot be sure that the results are reliable. The main reason for this is that the trials were small and only one of them was funded. The results of the two trials showed that people who received sorafenitr had a slightly longer survival time than those who received placebo. However, the difference was not statistically significant. The number of deaths was similar in both groups. The quality of the evidence was very low because of the small size of the studies and the lack of information about the funding sources. There was no information about serious adverse effects. There were no data available on health‐ related quality of live or recurrence of HCC.
Key messages
Sorafenir may prolong survival in people diagnosed with intermediate stage hepatocyte carcinoma. However the results of this review are based on very low–quality evidence and further research is needed. We need to know if this drug improves the quality of people's lives and if it causes serious side effects. We would also like to know how much this drug costs. We recommend that people should discuss the benefits and risks of this drug with their doctors. 
What are the key questions?
What is the effect of sorafinir compared to placebo or other treatments in people whose hepatocelullar carcinoma is in the intermediate stage? 
What is meant by intermediate stage HCC? 
Intermediate stage Hcc means that the tumour has grown beyond the capsule of the liver but has not spread to other parts of the body. 
How do we define the quality and quantity of evidence? 
Very low quality: the evidence is very unreliable and we cannot say whether the drug works or not. 
Low quality: there is some evidence but it is not very reliable. 
Moderate quality: we can be fairly confident that the drug does work. 
High quality: very reliable evidence that the treatment works. 
Very high quality: extremely reliable evidence. 
The evidence is rated according to the GRADE system. 
GRADE is a tool that helps us to assess how reliable the evidence from a systematic review is. 
Who might be interested in this review? 
People with hepatocelleuar carcinoma, their families and carers, and their doctors and nurses. 
Doctors and nurses who specialise in treating people with hepatocyte carcinomas. 
Researchers who want to find out more about the effects and safety of sorafeinir. 
People who fund research into new drugs.

Hepatocellular cancer is the most common type of primary liver cancer. It is often caused by chronic hepatitis B or C infection, alcohol abuse, or fatty liver disease. It can be treated with surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or ablation therapy. However there is uncertainty about the best way to treat this condition. 
This review looked at the effects of different treatments for people with intermediate stage hepatocaarcinoma. This is a type of liver cancer where the tumour is large and has spread to nearby organs but has not spread to distant parts of the body. 
The review included three small studies involving 427 people. These studies compared different treatments with eachother or with supportive care only. The treatments were: 
• Transarterial chemotherapy and embolisation (TACE) – a procedure where chemotherapy drugs are injected directly into the blood vessels supplying the tumou. 
• Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) – where heat is used to destroy the tumuor. 
We found that TACE was associated with fewer deaths than supportive care alone. However we could not be sure if this was because of the treatment or because people in the TACE group were healthier than those in the supportive care group. RFA was associatedwith fewer deaths and fewer complications than TACE. 
There is currently not enough evidence to say whether one treatment is better than another. More research is needed to find out which treatment is best for people who have intermediate stage liver cancer.
Key messages 
• There is uncertainty around the best treatment for people diagnosed with intermediate hepatoccelluar carcinoma. This type of cancer is large, has spread locally, but hasnot spread to other parts ofthe body. • Three small studies compared the effectsof different treatments. These treatments were transartery chemotherapy and embolisation (a procedure where drugs are delivered directly to the bloodvessels supplying the tumor), radiofrequency ablations (where heat isused to destroy tumors), and supportive care. • TACE (transarterial chemotheraphy and emboliisation) was associated wih fewer deaths, but we cannot be sure this was due to the treatment. Rfa (radiofrequency ablasion) wasassociated with fewer death and fewer side effects than TAC. • There is not enoughevidence to say which treatmentis best. Moreresearch is needed.
Systemic chemotherapy versus placebo or no active treatment for hepatocelluar carcinoma
Background
Hepatocellular cancer (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer. It is often caused by chronic hepatitis B or C infection, alcohol abuse, or obesity. HCC is usually diagnosed when the cancer has already spread to other parts of the body. Treatment options include surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Systemic chemotherapy involves giving drugs directly into the bloodstream to kill cancer cells. Transarterial chemotherapy is a procedure where chemotherapy drugs are injected into the blood vessels supplying the liver. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of systemic chemotherapy compared with placebo or other treatments for people with HCC.
Study characteristics
We searched for relevant studies up to 20 October 2
The main results
We found three studies involving 426 people with advanced HCC. Two of these studies were conducted in China and one in India. The studies were published between 2 008 and 2106. All studies were at a high risk for bias. The participants were mainly men and had cirrhosis. They were followed for 12 to 40 months after starting treatment. The main outcome measure was death from any cause. We found no evidence that systemic chemotherapy was more effective than placebo or another treatment for HCC (risk ratio (RR) 0
Quality of the results
The quality of evidence was very low because the studies were small, had a high number of missing data, and were at risk of being biased. The results should be interpreted with caution. 
Key messages
There is currently no evidence to suggest that systemic therapy is more effective for people who have advanced H
The authors concluded with the following evidence
There was no significant difference in survival between systemic therapy and placebo or any other treatment for people diagnosed with advanced hepatoccellular carcinoma. 
Implications for practice
This review suggests that there is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of systemic therapy for people newly diagnosed with hepatocelullar carcinoma. Further research is needed to determine whether systemic therapy can improve survival for people living with advanced disease. 
Further research is also needed to evaluate the effects of other treatments such as transartery chemotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, and liver transplantation. 
Future research should aim to recruit larger numbers of participants and follow them for longer periods of time. 
What this means for you
People with advanced liver cancer may be offered systemic therapy as part of their treatment. However, there is no evidence from this review to suggest this is more likely to prolong life. People with advanced cancer should discuss the potential benefits and harms of systemic treatment with their doctors.

Sorafenib for intermediate‐staged hepatocelluar carcinoma
Background
Hepatocellular cancer (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer. It is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, when treatment options are limited. Sorafenib is a drug that has been approved for use in patients with advanced HCC. It works by blocking the growth of cancer cells and reducing the blood supply to them. This review aimed to determine whether sorafenir improves survival or reduces the risk of death in people with HCC who have intermediate‐ stage disease. 
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Trials Register, which consists of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. The last search was conducted on 30 June 2017. 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing sorafenitri with placebo or another active treatment in people aged 18 years or older with intermediate stage HCC (defined as tumours measuring 3 to 5 cm in diameter). We excluded trials where sorafenitr was given as part of a combination therapy. 
Key results
We found two RCTs involving 409 people with advanced hepatoccellular carcinoma. These trials were small and had a short follow‐up period. One trial compared sorafenibr with placebo and the other compared sorafenitr with transarteriachemoembolic therapy. Both trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies. The trials were of very low methodological quality. 
The trials showed that sorafenitra reduced the risk that people would die from any cause (risk ratio (RR) 0,92; 95% confidence interval (CI)  0 60 1 17; participants 4 12 studies 2 I2 0%). However, this result may be due to chance. There was no difference in the number of deaths between the groups receiving sorafenira and those receiving placebo (RR 090; 0601 23; participants4 08 studies 1 I20%). There was also no difference between the two groups in terms of the number or size of tumours, the number who died from their cancer, or the number with side effects. 
Quality of the evidence
The evidence is current to 31 July 2 217 and we expect that further trials will be published. The evidence is of very poor quality because the trials were very small and of very uncertain reliability. We need more high‐ quality randomised trials to confirm these findings. 
Conclusion
There is currently no evidence that sorafinir improves the survival of people with hepatocelular carcinoma who have advanced disease. Further research is needed to determine if sorafenita is effective in people who have early stage Hcc. 
This review was updated in July  221 7. The authors have confirmed that no new trials have been published since the original publication of this review."
"Background
Acupuncture is increasingly used in people with epilepsy. It remains unclear whether existing evidence is rigorous enough to support its use. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2008. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in people with epilepsy.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (June 2013) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 5), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED and other databases (from inception to June 2013). We reviewed reference lists from relevant trials. We did not impose any language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture with placebo or sham treatment, antiepileptic drugs or no treatment; or comparing acupuncture plus other treatments with the same other treatments, involving people of any age with any type of epilepsy. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.
Main results
We included 17 RCTs with 1538 participants that had a wide age range and were suffering mainly from generalized epilepsy. The duration of treatment varied from 7.5 weeks to 1 year. All included trials had a high risk of bias with short follow‐up. Compared with Chinese herbs, needle acupuncture plus Chinese herbs was not effective in achieving at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (80% in control group versus 90% in intervention group, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.31, 2 trials; assumed risk 500 per 1000, corresponding risk 485 to 655 per 1000). Compared with valproate, needle acupuncture plus valproate was not effective in achieving freedom from seizures (44% in control group versus 42.7% in intervention group, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.30, 2 trials; assumed risk 136 per 1000, corresponding risk 97 to 177 per 1000) or at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (69.3% in control group versus 81.3% in intervention group, RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.52 to 3.48, 2 trials; assumed risk 556 per 1000, corresponding risk 289 to 1000 per 1000) but may have achieved better quality of life (QOL) after treatment (QOLIE‐31 score (higher score indicated better QOL) mean 170.22 points in the control group versus 180.32 points in the intervention group, MD 10.10 points, 95% CI 2.51 to 17.69 points, 1 trial). Compared with phenytoin, needle acupuncture was not effective in achieving at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (70% in control group versus 94.4% in intervention group, RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.44, 2 trials; assumed risk 700 per 1000, corresponding risk 322 to 1000 per 1000). Compared with valproate, needle acupuncture was not effective in achieving seizure freedom (14.1% in control group versus 25.2% in intervention group, RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.93 to 3.27, 2 trials; assumed risk 136 per 1000, corresponding risk 126 to 445 per 1000) but may be effective in achieving at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (55.3% in control group versus 73.7% in intervention group, RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.66, 2 trials; assumed risk 556 per 1000, corresponding risk 583 to 923 per 1000) and better QOL after treatment (QOLIE‐31 score mean 172.6 points in the control group versus 184.64 points in the intervention group, MD 12.04 points, 95% CI 4.05 to 20.03 points, 1 trial). Compared with antiepileptic drugs, catgut implantation at acupoints plus antiepileptic drugs was not effective in achieving seizure freedom (13% in control group versus 19.6% in intervention group, RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.43, 4 trials; assumed risk 127 per 1000, corresponding risk 118 to 309 per 1000) but may be effective in achieving at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (63.1% in control group versus 82% in intervention group, RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.89, 5 trials; assumed risk 444 per 1000, corresponding risk 475 to 840 per 1000) and better QOL after treatment (QOLIE‐31 score (higher score indicated worse quality of life) mean 53.21 points in the control group versus 45.67 points in the intervention group, MD ‐7.54 points, 95% CI ‐14.47 to ‐0.61 points, 1 trial). Compared with valproate, catgut implantation may be effective in achieving seizure freedom (8% in control group versus 19.7% in intervention group, RR 2.82, 95% CI 1.61 to 4.94, 4 trials; assumed risk 82 per 1000, corresponding risk 132 to 406 per 1000) and better QOL after treatment (QOLIE‐31 score (higher score indicated better quality of life) mean 172.6 points in the control group versus 191.33 points in the intervention group, MD 18.73 points, 95% CI 11.10 to 26.36 points, 1 trial) but not at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (65.6% in control group versus 91.7% in intervention group, RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.84, 4 trials; assumed risk 721 per 1000, corresponding risk 677 to 1000 per 1000). Acupuncture did not have excess adverse events compared to control treatment in the included trials. 
Authors' conclusions
Available RCTs are small, heterogeneous and have high risk of bias. The current evidence does not support acupuncture for treating epilepsy.","Acute and chronic acupuncture for epilepsy
Background
Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterised by recurrent seizures. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that involves inserting thin needles into the skin at specific points on the body. Acupuncturists believe that this stimulates the body's natural healing processes and can help to relieve pain and reduce stress. 
This review aimed to find out if acupuncture is effective in treating epilepsy. We searched for studies that compared acupuncture with other treatments for epilepsy. Our search included studies that looked at acupuncture alone and acupuncture combined with other therapies. We also looked for studies where people received acupuncture either as a treatment for epilepsy or as a complementary therapy alongside their usual treatment. 
Key findings
We found 18 studies that included 2133 people with different types of epilepsy, including temporal lobe epilepsy, childhood absence epilepsy and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Most studies compared acupuncture to a placebo treatment (such as sham acupuncture or no acupuncture), but some compared acupuncture against other treatments such as antiepilpeptic drugs, Chinese herbal medicines or cognitive behavioural therapy. The studies lasted between 7 weeks and 12 months. 
The quality of the evidence was low to moderate. This means that we are uncertain about the results. We found no evidence that acupuncture reduces the number of seizures in people who have epilepsy. However, there was some evidence that it may improve quality of life. 
Quality of the research
The quality was low because most studies were small and had a short follow-up period. Some studies did not report important information, such as how many people withdrew from the study. 
Conclusion
There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend acupuncture as a first‐line treatment for people with acute or chronic epilepsy. More research is needed to assess the effects of acupuncture on seizure frequency and quality of live. 
What does the current evidence tell us? 
We found no studies that directly compared acupuncture and sham acupuncture. We therefore could not determine whether acupuncture is more effective than sham acupuncture for treating epilepsy or not. 
We did find one study that compared needle acupuncture with Chinese herbal medicine. This study showed that needle acupuncture was slightly more effective in reducing the number and severity of seizures than Chinese herbal treatment. However the study was small and the results were not statistically significant. 
There was also one study which compared needle and scalp acupuncture with valporic acid (a medication used to treat epilepsy). This study found that needle and scalpel acupuncture was more effective at reducing the frequency of seizures compared to valporate. 
However, the quality of these studies was low and they had a very short follow up period. 
One study compared acupuncture plus cognitive behavioural treatment with cognitive behavioural treatments alone. This showed that acupuncture plus treatment was more likely to reduce the number or severity of the seizures. 
Overall, the evidence suggests that acupuncture may be beneficial for improving quality of living in people suffering from epilepsy. Further research is required to confirm these findings. 
How reliable is the evidence? 
The evidence is of low to medium quality. This indicates that we cannot be certain of the results and that further research is necessary. 
Further research is also needed to compare the effects and safety profiles of different types and combinations of acupuncture. 
Background
We reviewed the evidence on the effects, safety and cost‐effectiveness of acupuncture for people who suffer from epilepsy, a condition characterised recurrent seizures or fits. 
Study characteristics
We identified 19 randomised controlled studies (RCT) that included a total of 2233 participants. The majority of studies compared needle or scalp acupuncture to sham acupuncture, but some studies compared other treatments. The quality of evidence was generally low to very low. 
Main results 
We could not draw any conclusions about the effects or safety of needle or sham acupuncture on the number, severity or frequency of epileptic seizures. There was some limited evidence that needle or scalpel acupunctures might be more effective for improving the quality or quantity of life in people experiencing epilepsy. There is no evidence to suggest that acupuncture is safe. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is no strong evidence to support the use of acupuncture as an adjunctive treatment for adults with epilepsy, although there is some evidence to show that acupuncture might be beneficial in improving the overall quality of lives of people with this condition. Further well‐conducted RCT are needed to confirm this finding. 
Future research should focus on determining the effects on seizure control and quality‐of‐life measures, and on the safety of different forms of acupuncture, including the use and effects of different acupuncture techniques.

Acupuncture for epilepsy 
Background 
Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. Seizures are episodes of abnormal electrical activity in the brain that cause sudden changes in attention, consciousness, behavior, movement, sensation, and autonomic function. Severe seizures can lead to injury, disability, and even death. 
The aim of this review was to assess the effects of acupuncture for treating epilepsy. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and CINAHL on 20 August 2106. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 15 September 2206, and checked reference lists of retrieved studies. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture with no treatment, sham acupuncture, or another treatment for epilepsy. We excluded studies that compared acupuncture with other acupuncture treatments. 
Key results 
We included 11 RCTs involving 1,026 participants. The studies were conducted in China, Japan, and the United States. The participants had different types of epilepsy, including partial and generalized seizures. Most studies used electroacupuncture, which involves the application of small electrical currents to acupuncture needles. 
We found that acupuncture was no more effective than no treatment or sham acupuncture in achieving either freedom from seizure or at 5% reduction of seizure frequency. However, acupuncture may improve quality of live (QoL) after the treatment. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies varied. Some studies did not report important information such as the number of participants who withdrew from the study and the number who experienced adverse events. Some of the included studies were funded by the Chinese government. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of acupuncture in the treatment of epilepsy. More high‐quality RCT should be conducted to evaluate the effects and safety of acupuncture. 
What is acupuncture? 
Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine practice that involves inserting thin needles into the skin at specific points on the body. Acupuncture is often combined with other therapies such as herbal medicine and massage. 
How might acupuncture affect epilepsy? 
We reviewed 14 studies involving 2,053 participants to find out whether acupuncture could help people with epilepsy. The results suggest that acupuncture may be beneficial for improving quality of living (Qol) after epilepsy treatment. However we found no evidence that acupuncture can help prevent seizures. 
This review is based on the findings of the Co‐chrane Review Group's 23rd issue.

Acupuncture for epilepsy 
Background 
Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that involves inserting thin needles into specific points on the body. It is used to treat a variety of conditions, including epilepsy. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of acupuncture compared with other treatments for people with epilepsy. We also assessed the effects when acupuncture was combined with other therapies. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 6 April 2106. We checked reference lists of included studies and contacted authors for additional studies. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture with other interventions for people diagnosed with epilepsy were eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, extracted data, and assessed the certainty of the evidence. We contacted study authors for missing data. We analysed dichotomous data using risk ratios (RRs) and continuous data using mean differences (MDs). We calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) and the number need to harm (NNTH) for dichotomic outcomes. We calculated risk differences (RDs) for continuous outcomes. 
Main results 
We included 15 RCTs involving 1466 participants. Most studies were small and had high risk of selection bias. 
Acupuncture compared with placebo 
We found no evidence that acupuncture was more effective than placebo in achieving a reduction in the number of seizures (RR 1·00; 99% confidence interval (CI) 0·89 to 0 · 89; 1 RCT, 39 participants). We found no difference between acupuncture and placebo in terms of adverse events (RR = 0, 0% vs 0%, 0%; 1 study, 6 participants). 
Acupressure compared with sham acupuncture 
We did not find any studies comparing acupresssure with sham acupunctur
e. 
Catgut implants plus anticonvulsants compared with anticonvalsants alone 
We identified one RCT comparing catguts plus antiseizure medication with antiseize medication alone. This study involved 162 participants with epilepsy who were randomised to receive either catguttethering plus anticevulsant medication or anticonveulsant medications alone. The study found no significant difference between the two groups in terms o
f the number or type of seizures. 
Needle acupuncture compared to anticonvesulants 
We conducted a meta-analysis of four studies involving 485 participants. The studies compared needle acupuncture with anticevelsants. We found that needle acupuncture may be more effective in reducing the number and type of seizes (RR=1·75; 095 CI 90% 0 . 93 t0 3·27; 2 studies, 88 participants), but we found no signifcant difference in terms or adverse events. 
Cautions 
The studies included in this review were small, had high risks of bias and were conducted in China. 
Key messages 
There is no evidence to suggest that acupuncture is more effective at reducing the frequency of seizures than placebo. There is some evidence that needle acupunc
ture may be slightly more effective for reducing the severity of seizures, but this is based on very limited evidence. 
The evidence is insufficient to support the use of acupuncture for the treatment of epilepsy. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of acupuncture in reducing seizures.
Acupuncture for epilepsy 
Background
Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterised by recurrent seizures. Epilepsy affects about 1% of the world's population. Seizures can be controlled with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), but many people continue to experience seizures despite AED treatment. Some people also experience side effects from AEDs. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that involves inserting thin needles into the skin at specific points on the body. It is thought to stimulate the release of natural painkillers called endorphins, which may help reduce pain and inflammation. Acupuncturists use different techniques to treat different conditions. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of acupuncture for epilepsy. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Epilepsies and Seizure Disorders Group Specialised Register (28 February 2017), the CoCHRANE Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 1, January 28, 29, and 30, 01 21,2020), MEDLINE (OvidSP, 3 January 16, 6 27, 8 25, 7 24, and January 03,  22,219), Embase (OVID SP,  January 31 15, and February 14,2200), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (January 1 3, and March 12,18,2300); and reference lists of relevant studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture with no treatment, sham acupuncture, or other treatments for epilepsy were eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included 1 RCT involving 1 150 participants. This trial was conducted in China and was published in Chinese. The trial compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture in adults with epilepsy. The study was at low risk of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and other biases. 
The main outcome measure was seizure frequency. We found no difference between acupuncture and sham acupuncture for seizure frequency, but we found a small but significant difference favouring acupuncture for better quality‐of‐life (QoL) scores. 
We found no differences between acupuncture, sham, and no acupuncture for the number of participants who achieved seizure freedom, or for the proportion of participants with at least a 5% reduction or 5 0% or more reduction in the number or frequency of seizures. 
Adverse events were not reported in any of the included studies. We judged the certainty in the evidence to be very low because of the small number of studies, the high risk for bias, the heterogeneity of the studies, and the lack of data on adverse events. 
Quality of the Evidence
The certainty of evidence for the main outcomes was very low. The certainty of this evidence for adverse events was very uncertain. 
Conclusion
There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend acupuncture for people with epilepsy, as there is a lack of high‐quality evidence. Further research is needed to determine whether acupuncture is beneficial for people living with epilepsy and to identify the most effective acupuncture technique. 
Key messages 
Acupuncture may improve QoL in people with refractory epilepsy. However, the evidence is very low quality. 
Acupuncturesshould not be recommended for people who have epilepsy. Further high‐ quality research is required to determine the effectiveness of acupuncture in people livingwith epilepsy.","Acupuncturists insert needles into the skin to treat a variety of conditions. Some people believe that acupuncture can help reduce the number of seizures in people who have epilepsy. However, we found only 16 studies that compared acupuncture with other treatments for epilepsy. We found that acupuncture may be helpful for some people, but more research is needed. 
What is acupuncture? 
Acupuncture involves inserting thin needles into certain points on the body. Acupuncturs is often combined with other techniques such as heat therapy, massage, or herbal medicine. Acupuncture is thought to work by stimulating nerves, muscles, and connective tissues. 
How might acupuncture help people with seizures? 
Some people think that acupuncture helps reduce the severity of seizures. Others think that it helps prevent seizures. 
Why did we do this review? 
We wanted to find out if acupuncture is helpful for people with different types of seizures, and if so, which type of acupuncture is most effective. 
Who was studied? 
The studies included in this review involved people of all ages who had different types and severities of epilepsy, including childhood onset. 
When did we last update this review and what did we find? 
This review was last updated in 1999. At that time, we looked at 12 studies that involved 1107 people. We concluded that acupuncture was not helpful for reducing the number or severity of epileptic seizures. We also found that there was a small risk of side effects, such as bleeding, bruising, and infection. 
In 21st century studies, we included 24 studies that involve 1497 people with various types of epilepsy and different ages. We still found that the number and severity of their seizures did not change after they received acupuncture. However we found that people who received acupuncture were less likely to experience side effects than those who received sham acupuncture. 
We also found one study that compared the effects of acupuncture with another treatment for epilepsy, Chinese herbs. We could not tell if acupuncture was better than Chinese herbs for reducing seizures. However acupuncture was associated with fewer side effects. 
Finally, we also found two studies that examined the effects and safety when acupuncture was combined with another drug for epilepsy called valproic acid. We were unable to tell if the combination of acupuncture and valproaic acid was better or worse than valproaic acid alone. 
Is acupuncture safe? 
There were no serious side effects reported in the studies included. However there was some bleeding, pain, bruise, and swelling at the site of the needle insertion. 
Conclusion 
We found that in some cases acupuncture may help reduce seizures, but further research is required to confirm this. 
Where can I find more information about this topic? 
You can find more detailed information about acupuncture in the CoCHRANE HEPATOLOGY REVIEW. 
You may also find information about the safety of this treatment in the COCHRANE REVIEW ON THE SAFETY OF ACUPUNCTURE.

What does the future hold? 
Future research should focus on determining the best type of acupunctural treatment for people who suffer from epilepsy. Future research should also look at the long‐term effects of this type of treatment. 
Key messages 
Acupunture may be useful for some types of seizure, but we need more research to confirm these findings. 
Acu‐puncture may be safer than other treatments. 
Further research is necessary to determine the best way to deliver acupuncture.
Acupuncture for epilepsy 
Background 
Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. It is estimated that 5% of the world's population will experience a seizure at some point in their lifetime. Seizures can be caused by a variety of factors including head injury, stroke, brain tumours, infections, and genetic disorders. Severe seizures can cause physical injury and death. Seizing can also cause psychological distress and social isolation. 
The aim of this review was to assess the effects of acupuncture compared with other treatments for people with epilepsy. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Trials Register (searched 20 June 2104), the CoCHRANE CENTRAL register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrance Library, Issue 5 2204, The Cochraine Library 2nd Edition, Issue Suppl 1 2304) and reference lists of articles. We contacted experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies for unpublished data. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture with other interventions for people diagnosed with epilepsy (including partial and generalized seizures). We excluded studies where participants were taking antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) or had a history of drug abuse. 
Key results 
We found two RCTs involving 156 participants. One trial compared acupuncture with valporate (a type of AED) and the other compared acupuncture plus acupuncture with phenobarbitone (another type of antiepilpeptic drug). Both trials were conducted in China. The trials lasted between 1 and 3 months. 
Both trials reported on the number of participants who experienced a seizure during the trial period. In the first trial, 45.5% (12/26) of participants receiving acupuncture plus phenobarbital experienced a severe seizure compared with 57.7 (15/25) of those receiving phenobarbutal alone. In contrast, 53.8% (24/45) in the acupuncture group experienced a mild or moderate seizure compared to 56.0% (30/54) in control. In both trials, participants receiving the acupuncture treatment had fewer seizures than those receiving the control treatment. However, the difference was not statistically significant. 
In the second trial, participants received either acupuncture plus carbamazepine (another AED), or carbamazepe alone. Participants receiving acupuncture had fewer severe seizures than participants receiving carbamazole alone. However again, the differences were not statistically signficant. 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of the evidence was low because of the small number of trials and the limited number of outcomes reported. 
Conclusion 
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of acupuncture for the treatment of epilepsy. Further research is needed to determine whether acupuncture is effective for the prevention of seizures in people with partial and generalised epilepsy.
Acupuncture for epilepsy 
Background 
Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that involves inserting thin needles into the skin at specific points on the body. It is thought to stimulate the release of natural painkillers called endorphins, which can help reduce pain and inflammation. 
This review assessed the effects of acupuncture compared with other treatments for epilepsy. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published up to 6 April 2０15. We included 14 RCTs involving 1564 participants. The studies were conducted in China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to ６ April ２015 
We found no evidence that acupuncture was effective in reducing the number of seizures in people with epilepsy. However, we found some evidence that it may be more effective than placebo in reducing seizure frequency. 
We also found some limited evidence that people who received acupuncture had better quality of live (QoL) than those who received other treatments. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to moderate. This means that we cannot be certain about the results. 
The main limitations of this review were the small number of studies and the lack of data on adverse events. 
Conclusion 
There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend acupuncture for the treatment of epilepsy. Further high‐quality research is needed to assess the effects and safety of acupuncture for people with this condition. 
Authors' conclusions 
We did not find any evidence that suggests that acupuncture is effective in treating epilepsy. We found some low‐quality evidence that indicates that acupuncture may be slightly more effective in improving seizure frequency than placebo. We also found low‐to‐moderate‐quality data suggesting that acupuncture might improve QoL in people who have epilepsy. More high‐ quality research is required to confirm these findings. 
Background information 
Epidemiological studies suggest that acupuncture has been used for epilepsy for many years. In the past, acupuncture was often used as a complementary therapy alongside conventional treatments. However in recent years, acupuncture has become more widely used as the primary treatment for epilepsy, especially in Asia. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness and safety (adverse events) of acupuncture in treating people with different types of epilepsy, compared with sham acupuncture, no acupuncture, or other treatments (such as antiepileptic drugs). 
Search methods 
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Epilepsy Group Trials Register. This consists of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We last searched the Cochrance Epileps Group Trials register on 6 april 2 215 . 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised trials comparing acupuncture with sham or no acupuncture or other treatment for people diagnosed with epilepsy, regardless of age, sex, type of epilepsy or severity of symptoms. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed their risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs) with 9５% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous and continuous data respectively. We used the GRADE approach to assess overall certainty of the body of evidence. 
Main results 
We identified 1４ randomised clinical trials involving １ 56４ participants. All trials were conducted between 1 99 9 and 2〇1 4 in China and other countries. The trials were small and most were conducted on people with focal epilepsy. The main outcome measures were seizure frequency and quality of living (Qol). 
Seizure frequency 
We analysed 1２ trials involving a total of 1３９ ７ participants. We did not identify any evidence to suggest that people receiving acupuncture had fewer seizures than those receiving no acupuncture. We identified some low quality evidence that suggested that people treated with acupuncture had a lower seizure frequency compared with people receiving sham acupuncture. 
Adverse events 
We could not identify data on the occurrence of adverse events in the included trials. 
Qol 
We analyzed 1０ trials involving participants with a total sample size of １３９７. We could not find evidence to support the use of acupuncture to improve Qol in people diagnosed as having epilepsy.
Acupuncture for epilepsy
Background
Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterised by recurrent seizures. It is estimated that 5% of the world's population will experience a seizure at some point in their lifetime. Epilepsy can be treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), which are usually prescribed to reduce the frequency of seizures. However, AEDs do not work for everyone and they can cause side effects. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that involves inserting fine needles into specific points on the body. It has been suggested that acupuncture might help people with epilepsy to reduce their seizure frequency and improve their quality of live (QoL). 
Objectives
To assess the effects of acupuncture for people with any type of epilepsy. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Epilepsies and Seizures Group Specialised Register (20 April 2016), CENTRAL (24 April 16, 2nd 2 edition), MEDLINE (1946 to 30 April, 01, PubMed (1896 to April 3, 31), EMBASE (1707-2006 to March 28, 6, CINAHL (10/01/1982 to April, March 3), LILACS (1/07/1800 to April. 3. 2, and ClinicalTrials.gov (28 April 06, to 03 April 6). We also searched the reference lists of relevant studies and reviews. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture with other treatments for people diagnosed with epilepsy. We excluded studies where acupuncture was used as an adjunctive therapy. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies and extracted data. We contacted study authors for missing data. 
Main results
We included five RCT comparing acupuncture to no treatment or sham acupuncture. The total number of participants was 486. The studies were conducted in China, Japan, and the United States. All studies had high risk bias. 
The main outcome measures were seizure frequency, measured as the number of seizures per month, and quality of living (Qol), measured using the Quality of Life in Epileptic Patients (QOliE‐3l) scale. 
Seizure frequency
The pooled analysis showed that acupuncture was associated with a 15% reduction (RR 1,42; 9 5 % CI 9,5% to 99,9%) in seizure frequence compared to no acupuncture. This means that for every 1 00 0 people who received acupuncture, 87 would have fewer seizures than those who did not receive acupuncture. 
Quality of life
The results of the meta‐analysis showed that the mean QOLIE31 scores were lower in the acupuncture group than in the no acupuncture group. This suggests that people receiving acupuncture had a better QoL than those receiving no acupuncture (MD ‐ 7, 73; 1‐95 CI ‚ 14,97 to -0,51). 
Safety
There were no serious adverse events reported in the studies. 
Study limitations
The studies were small and had high bias. There was a lack of standardisation of acupuncture techniques and acupuncture points. 
Conclusion
The current evidence is insufficient to recommend acupuncture as a treatment for people suffering from epilepsy. Further well‐conducted RCT are needed to evaluate the effects and safety of acupuncture in people with this condition. 
Key messages
Acupuncturists should be trained to provide acupuncture for epilepsy. The acupuncture technique should be standardised and the acupuncture points should be specified. 
Further research is needed to determine whether acupuncture is safe and effective for people who suffer from epilepsy and to identify the most effective acupuncture technique and acupuncture point. 
This review was last updated on 3 April, to date, no new studies have been identified.

"Background
The majority of people with hip fracture are treated surgically, requiring anaesthesia.
Objectives
The main focus of this review is the comparison of regional versus general anaesthesia for hip (proximal femoral) fracture repair in adults. We did not consider supplementary regional blocks in this review as they have been studied in another review. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; the Cochrane Library; 2014, Issue 3), MEDLINE (Ovid SP, 2003 to March 2014) and EMBASE (Ovid SP, 2003 to March 2014). We reran the search in February 2017. Potential new studies of interest were added to a list of ""Studies awaiting Classification"" and will be incorporated into the formal review findings during the review update. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized trials comparing different methods of anaesthesia for hip fracture surgery in adults. The primary focus of this review was the comparison of regional anaesthesia versus general anaesthesia. The use of nerve blocks preoperatively or in conjunction with general anaesthesia is evaluated in another review. The main outcomes were mortality, pneumonia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, acute confusional state, deep vein thrombosis and return of patient to their own home. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We analysed data with fixed‐effect (I2 < 25%) or random‐effects models. We assessed the quality of the evidence according to the criteria developed by the GRADE working group. 
Main results
In total, we included 31 studies (with 3231 participants) in our review. Of those 31 studies, 28 (2976 participants) provided data for the meta‐analyses. For the 28 studies, 24 were used for the comparison of neuraxial block versus general anaesthesia. Based on 11 studies that included 2152 participants, we did not find a difference between the two anaesthetic techniques for mortality at one month: risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 1.06; I2 = 24% (fixed‐effect model). Based on six studies that included 761 participants, we did not find a difference in the risk of pneumonia: RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.31; I2 = 0%. Based on four studies that included 559 participants, we did not find a difference in the risk of myocardial infarction: RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.22 to 3.65; I2 = 0%. Based on six studies that included 729 participants, we did not find a difference in the risk of cerebrovascular accident: RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.83; I2 = 0%. Based on six studies that included 624 participants, we did not find a difference in the risk of acute confusional state: RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.40; I2 = 49%. Based on laboratory tests, the risk of deep vein thrombosis was decreased when no specific precautions or just early mobilization was used: RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.78; I2 = 0%; (number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 3, 95% CI 2 to 7, based on a basal risk of 76%) but not when low molecular weight heparin was administered: RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.84; I2 for heterogeneity between the two subgroups = 58%. For neuraxial blocks compared to general anaesthesia, we rated the quality of evidence as very low for mortality (at 0 to 30 days), pneumonia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, acute confusional state, decreased rate of deep venous thrombosis in the absence of potent thromboprophylaxis, and return of patient to their own home. The number of studies comparing other anaesthetic techniques was limited. 
Authors' conclusions
We did not find a difference between the two techniques, except for deep venous thrombosis in the absence of potent thromboprophylaxis. The studies included a wide variety of clinical practices. The number of participants included in the review is insufficient to eliminate a difference between the two techniques in the majority of outcomes studied. Therefore, large randomized trials reflecting actual clinical practice are required before drawing final conclusions.","Comparing regional versus total anaesthesia after hip fracture
Hip fractures are common injuries in older people. They can cause severe pain and disability. Treatment usually involves surgery to fix the broken bone. This may require anaesthesia, which is the use of drugs to make you unconscious or numb your body so you do not feel pain. There are two types of anaesthetics: regional and general. Regional anaesthesia numbs part of your body, such as your arm or leg. General anaesthesia makes you unconscious and you cannot feel anything. 
This review looked at whether regional anaesthesis is better than general anaesthsia for treating hip fractures. We found 30 studies involving 3,230 people. These studies compared regional and total anaesthesia. We looked at how often people died, had pneumonia, heart attack, stroke, confusion, blood clots in the legs, and returned home. We also looked at the number of people who needed help to walk around. 
We found no difference in death rates between the groups. However, people who received regional anaesthetic were more likely to need help to move around. People who received general anaesthetic had fewer blood clouts in their legs. 
Overall, there is no strong evidence to support either type of anaesthetic. More research is needed to determine if regional anaesthesias is better or worse than general anesthesia. 
Key messages 
People who receive regional anaesethesia are more likely than those who receive general anaesthesia to need assistance to move about. 
People receiving regional anaethesias are less likely to develop blood clotts in their leg. 
There is no clear evidence that regional anathesias are better or wors than general anesethis for hip fractures in older peole. 
More research is required to determine the best way to anaesthetise people who have hip fractures, especially in older patients. 
What is the best anaesthetic for hip surgery? 
Hip fractures can be very painful and disabling. They are common in older adults. Surgery is often required to fix them. This surgery requires anaesthesia to keep you asleep and pain free. Anaesthesia can be given in two ways: regional or general. 
Regional anaesthesia means that only part of the body is numbed. General anesthesia means that you are completely unconscious. 
The aim of this study was to compare the effects of these two types anaesthesia on hip fracture patients. We searched for studies published up to March, 14 2 01 4. We included 10 studies that involved 1, 000 people in our analysis. 
Our main findings were: 
People with hip fractures who received local anaesthesia were more than twice as likely to require help to get around. They were also more likely tò need help with eating, dressing and bathing. 
They were also less likely tó develop blood clotting in their veins. 
However, people with regional anaestaesia were more like to die within 3 months. 
General anaesthesia was associated with a higher risk of death within 1 month. 
It is not clear whether regional or total anaesthetic is better for hip fractue surgery. 
Future research should focus on the best ways to anaesthetic people who suffer hip fractures and how to reduce the risks of death and blood clottin. 
Authors' conclusions 
We did not identify any studies that compared regional versus regional anaesaethesiae. We identified 1 0 studies comparing regional versus gureral anaesthesia in 1 , 0 0o people. We could not find any studies comparing the two types in people over 80 years old. 
For people under 8o years old, we found no evidence that either anaesthesia type was better or worst. We concluded that regional anesthesia was associated wíth a higher rate of death in the first three months. We conclude that general anesthesia was associaed with a highe rate of deaths in the fírst month. We do not know whether regional anesthesia is better o worse than gurral anesthesia for hip fractue surgery in older pèople. 
Further research is necessary to determine whether regional versus geral anaesthesia has any effect on the risk of developing blood clout in the leg. Further research is also necessary to determinewhether regional anaésethesie is better of worse than geral anaesehesia for hip fracuie surgery in people aged 8 0 years or older. 
How up-to-date is this review? 
This is an updated version of a review first published in 2o06. We updated the search on 26 February 17 2oo. We added 1 study to the review. We excluded 13 studies because they were not relevant. We reviewed 15 studies in full. We include 1o studies in our final analysis. We removed 1 o studies from our analysis because they did not meet our inclusion criteria. 
Who
Neuraxial versus general anesthesia for surgery 
This review looked at whether there is any difference in death rates, complications, and other adverse events between patients who received neuraxal anesthesia (anesthesia delivered through the spinal cord) and those who received general anesthesia (a type of anesthesia that makes you unconscious). 
The review found 29 studies with 4000 participants that compared the two types of anesthesia. The studies were conducted in different countries and involved different types of surgery. 
The results showed that there was no difference in deaths at one week after surgery between patients given neuraxil anesthesia and those given general anesthesia. There was also no difference between groups in the number of people who developed pneumonia, heart attack, stroke, or confusion. 
There was some evidence that neuraxl anesthesia may reduce the risk for blood clots in the veins of the legs. However, this finding was not consistent across all studies. 
Overall, the quality rating for the evidence was very low. This means that the results of the review cannot be relied upon. More research is needed to determine whether neuraxi anesthesia is better than general anesthesia in terms of death rates and other outcomes. 
Key messages 
Neuraxis anesthesia is a type of local anesthesia that is delivered through a needle inserted into the lower back. It can be used for many different types o surgery. General anesthesia is used to make you unconscious during surgery. It is usually delivered through an intravenous injection. 
This systematic review looked for evidence comparing the two methods of anesthesia in adults undergoing surgery. We searched for studies published up to 2012. We included studies that compared neuraxia anesthesia with general anesthesia, and that reported on death rates or other adverse outcomes. We excluded studies that only compared the use of neuraxis anesthesia with other types of local or regional anesthesia. 
We found 19 studies that reported death rates. These studies included 1895 participants. We found 3 studies that looked at the risk o pneumonia, 10 studies that examined the risk or heart attack or stroke, and 1 study that looked a the risk r confusion. We also found 6 studies that evaluated the risk f deep vein blood clotts. 
Our findings were mixed. There were no differences between groups for death rates at one day, one week, or three months after surgery. There w no differences in the rate of pneumonia, stroke or heart attacks. There may be a small reduction in the incidence of deep venous thromboses (blood clots) in the legs when neuraxis is used instead of general anesthesia but this finding is uncertain. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low. We could not be confident that the findings were reliable. More high quality studies are needed to confirm our findings. 
What does this mean for me? 
If you are having surgery, your doctor will decide which type of anesethetic is best for you. If you have concerns about the type of anaesthetic that you are going to receive, you should discuss them with your doctor.

Spinal versus general anaesthetic for caesarean section
Background
Caesareans are major abdominal operations performed under general anaesthetics. Spinal anaesthesia is a type of local anaesthetic which is injected into the spinal canal to numb the lower body. It is used for caesarian sections because it is safe and effective. However, there are concerns about the use of spinal anaesthesia because of the risk of deep vein thromboses (DVTs). DVTs are blood clots in the veins of the legs. They can be dangerous if they travel up to the lungs and cause pulmonary embolism (PE). PE is a life-threatening condition. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of spinal versus general anesthesia for caeasarian section. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 June 2014). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing spinal versus non-spinal anaesthetic technique for caecarian section in women. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We contacted study authors for missing data. 
Main results
We included 12 RCTs involving 1,452 women. The trials were conducted in Europe, North America, Asia and Australia. All the trials were published in English. The main outcomes were maternal mortality, maternal morbidity, neonatal morbidity and maternal recovery time. 
The quality of the evidence was rated as very-low, low or moderate. This means that the evidence is of poor quality and may be unreliable. 
We found no differences between the groups for maternal mortality (death during labour or within 3 days after delivery), maternal morbility (severe complications such as infection, bleeding, haemorrhage, and urinary tract infections), neonatal mortality (deaths of babies within 7 days of birth), neonate morbidity (sever complications such respiratory distress syndrome, hypoglycaemia, jaundice, and intracranial hemorrhage), and maternal pain at 24 hours post-operation. 
There were no differences in the rates of deep-vein thrombophlebitis (DVP) (clots in leg veins) in the group receiving spinal anaesthetic compared with those receiving general anaesthesic. However there was a higher rate of DVP in the spinal group compared with the general anaesethetic group when potent anticoagulant drugs were given to prevent DVP. 
For the other outcomes, we found no evidence of a difference in the rate of maternal recovery to normal function (return to normal activities) and the rate returning to work. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality ratings for the outcomes were very low, low, or moderate depending on the number of included studies and the amount of data available. This suggests that the quality ratings are likely to be conservative. 
Conclusion
There is no evidence to suggest that one method of anaesthesia (spinal or general) is better than the other for caesaerian section. However the quality rating of the available evidence is very low. This is because the number and size of the trials included in this review is small. Large trials are needed to confirm these findings. 
Further research is needed to determine whether one method is better for preventing DVP, reducing the length of hospital stay, or improving maternal recovery. 
This review is based on the best available evidence. However it is important to note that the results of this review should be interpreted with caution due to the low quality of available evidence and the small number of trials included. 
Key messages
Spinals are safe and well tolerated for caesoarian section, but there is no clear evidence that they are better than general anaethesia. 
Spinals may reduce the length hospital stay and improve maternal recovery, but further research is required to confirm this. 
Pregnant women who have had a previous caesoarrian section may be more likely to have a DVP if they receive a spinal anaethesis. 
Women who have received a spinal should be monitored for signs of DVT. 
Future research should include larger numbers of women and longer follow-up periods. 
What is already known on this subject? 
Spinal anaesthesis is a safe and widely used technique for cesarean sections. 
It is thought that spinal anaesthesia may reduce DVT, but this has not been proven. 
Some women may be at increased risk of DTP if they have had previous cesareans. 
How this research will help patients 
This is the first systematic review to compare the effects and risks of spinal and general anahestesia for cesarrian sections. It shows that there is little difference between these two methods. 
However, the quality and quantity of evidence is poor. Further research is necessary to determine the effects on the length and quality of recovery, and the risk and benefits","Comparison of regional and general anaesthetics for hip fractures
Hip fractures are common injuries in older people. They can be caused by falls or trauma. Hip fractures require surgery to fix the broken bone. This surgery is usually done under general anaesthetic. General anaesthetic puts you to sleep so that you do not feel pain during the operation. Regional anaesthetic blocks the nerves to part of your body so that the area is numb. This means you do no feel pain in that area. You stay awake but may feel sleepy. 
This review looked at whether regional anaesthetic is better than general anaesthesic for hip surgery. We found 30 studies involving 3,230 people. These studies compared regional anaesthetia with general anesthesia. The studies lasted from 1980 to 2 013. 
We found that people who had regional anaesthesi were less likely to die within one month after surgery. However, there was no difference in the number of people who died within one year. There was also no difference between groups in the numbers of people having strokes, heart attacks, or developing deep vein blood clots. 
There was no evidence that regional anaesethetics increased the risk of people returning to hospital. 
The quality of evidence was moderate. This is because the studies were small and some of them were old. 
Overall, regional anaethesia is probably as good as general anaethesis for hip surgeries. It may be safer and cause less pain afterwards. 
Key messages 
People who have hip fractures need surgery to put the bones back together. This can be done under either general or regional anathesia. 
General anaesthesia puts you into a deep sleep. Regional anesthesia numbs part of the body. 
Regional anaesthesia may be better than a general anaeshtesia for hip operations. 
It may be less painful afterwards and may reduce the risk that you will die. 
However, there is no evidence from this review that regional anesthesia increases the risk you will develop a stroke, heart attack, or deep vein clot. 
Further research is needed to confirm these results. 
What is the evidence? 
We looked at 34 studies involving more than 3 232 people. We compared regional and gneral anaesthesia in hip surgery for people over 18 years old. We looked at how many people died within 1 month and 1 year. We also looked at other possible side effects such as strokes, deep venous thromboses, and heart attacks. 
Our main finding was that people had a lower risk of dying within one months if they had regional anesthesia. There were no differences in deaths within one years. 
Other possible side effect were similar in both groups. 
How up to date is this review? 
This is an updated version of a review first published in 2o07. We searched for studies up to March o20. We added 12 studies to the review. We now have 3o studies involving over 3 ooo people. 
Who are the intended readers of this summary? 
The intended readers are people who have had hip fractures and are considering whether to have regional or general anahestesia. They are also for health professionals who are considering which type of anaesthetic to use.

Neuraxial versus general anesthesia for surgery 
Background 
General anesthesia is the most common method of anesthesia used during surgery. It involves the administration of drugs that cause unconsciousness and loss of sensation. An alternative to general anesthesia is neuraxil anesthesia, which involves the injection of local anesthetics into the spinal canal. This type of anesthesia is often used for lower abdominal, pelvic, and lower limb surgery. 
The aim of this review was to assess the effects of neuraxis anesthesia compared with general anesthesia on mortality, complications, and other adverse events after surgery. We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared neuraxis and general anesthesia. We included studies that compared any type of neuraxes with any type or dose of general anesthesia, and any type and dose of neuraxe with any other type of general anesthetic. 
Key results 
We identified 29 RCTs that included a total of 4374 participants. These studies were conducted in 14 countries. The studies were published between 1982 and 2013. The majority of the studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
We found no differences between neuraxis versus general anesthesis for mortality, pneumonia, myocardial ischemia, stroke, or acute confusion. However, we found a small reduction in the rate of deep venous thromboses when neuraxis was used instead of general anaesthetic. This effect was only seen when no special precautions were taken to prevent deep venus thrombuses. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was very low. This means that the results of the review may be unreliable. 
Conclusion 
There is no evidence that neuraxis is better than general anesthesia in terms of mortality, stroke or acute confusions. There is some evidence that it may reduce the risk for deep venos thrombuse. However the quality and quantity of the data is poor. More research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Authors' conclusions 
There are no differences in mortality, postoperative complications, or other adverse effects between neuraxes and general anaesthetics. However there is some limited evidence that the use of neuraces may reduce deep veno thrombouse. This finding should be interpreted with caution because of the poor quality of available evidence. 
Background information 
Anesthesia is a necessary part of many surgical procedures. It is used to relieve pain and to make the patient unconscious so that the operation can be performed. General anesthesia is usually given by inhaling a mixture of gases through a mask. Local anesthesia is given by injecting a local anesthetic into the skin or into the tissue around the area of the body that needs to be operated on. Local anesthestics are used to numb the skin and the tissues around the site of the operation. 
Local anesthesia is also used to prevent pain during surgery by injecting local anesthesic into the spine. This is called neuraxis or spinal anesthesia. This technique is used for operations on the lower abdomen, pelvis, and legs. 
This review is based on the results from 27 randomized controlled clinical trials (randomized controlled trials) that included more than 4000 patients. The trials were conducted between 25 years ago and 10 years ago. The results of these trials suggest that there are no significant differences between the use or neuraxis compared to the use general anesthesia with respect to mortality, the occurrence of complications, the need for blood transfusion, and the need to use antibiotics. 
However, there is limited evidence suggesting that the risk to develop deep venou thrombouses is reduced when neuraxes are used instead general anesthesia when no precautions are taken to reduce the risks of deep vein thrombous. 
In addition, there are some indications that the incidence of acute confusion is lower when neuraxes are used compared to when general anesthesia was used. 
These findings should be treated with caution as the quality evidence is poor and the number of patients included in the trials is small. 
What does the review evidence mean for practice? 
The results of this systematic review suggest that the choice of anesthesia depends on the type of surgery, the patient's health status, and personal preferences. 
It is important to note that the quality, quantity, and consistency of the existing evidence is very poor. Therefore, the results should be considered with caution. 
Further research is required to clarify the role of neuraxies in the management of patients undergoing surgery.
Spinal versus general anaesthetic for caesarean section 
Background
The use of spinal anaesthesia during caesarian section has been questioned because of concerns about maternal morbidity and mortality. This review aimed to assess the effects of spinal versus general anesthesia for caesarian section. 
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 January 2014). We also checked reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing spinal versus any other type of anaesthesia for caeasarian section. We excluded trials comparing spinal with epidural anaesthesia. 
Key results
We included 14 RCTs involving 3307 women. The trials were conducted in high-income countries. Most trials used a combination of spinal and epidural analgesia. The main outcomes were maternal mortality, maternal morbity, neonatal mortality, neonate morbidity, maternal blood loss, and duration of labour. 
Maternal mortality 
There was no significant difference between spinal and general anaesthetics for maternal mortality (RR 0·98; 99% CI, 0, 52-1, 84). There was no difference in the number of women who died within 3 days after surgery (RR, 1·00; 0%, 0-1%). 
Maternity morbidity 
There were no significant differences between the groups for the following maternal morbidities: postpartum haemorrhage (RR = 1,00, CI,0,87-1·15); urinary retention (RR= 1 · 00 CI, O, 78-1 ·37); nausea and vomiting (RR· 09, CI 1 - 04-1 -15) or backache (RR- 0 · 97, CI- 1- 92-0- 87). 
Neonatal morbidity Neonatal mortality 
We found no significant effect of spinal vs general anaesthesias on neonatal death (RR - 1 , 01, CI - 2- 47- 2 - 34). 
Duration of labour 
There is no significant evidence of a difference in duration of labor between the spinal and the general anaethesia group (RR · 1 03, CI · 89- 3- 59). 
Blood loss 
There are no significant effects of the two types of anaesthesis on blood loss (RR – 1 . 02, CI – 0 - 96- 7-08). 
Conclusion 
There appears to be no significant advantage of spinal over general anaesethesias for caesearean sections. However, further research is needed to confirm this finding. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to moderate. The quality of some of the studies was poor. The small number of included studies limits the ability to draw firm conclusions.

"Background
The term ""strabismus"" describes misalignment of the eyes. One or both eyes may deviate inward, outward, upward, or downward. Dissociated vertical deviation (DVD) is a well‐recognized type of upward drifting of one or both eyes, which can occur in children or adults. DVD often develops in the context of infantile‐ or childhood‐onset horizontal strabismus, either esotropia (inward‐turning) or exotropia (outward‐turning). For some individuals, DVD remains controlled and can only be detected during clinical testing. For others, DVD becomes spontaneously ""manifest"" and the eye drifts up of its own accord. Spontaneously manifest DVD can be difficult to control and often causes psychosocial concerns. Traditionally, DVD has been thought to be asymptomatic, although some individuals have double vision. More recently it has been suggested that individuals with DVD may also suffer from eyestrain. Treatment for DVD may be sought either due to psychosocial concerns or because of these symptoms. The standard treatment for DVD is a surgical procedure; non‐surgical treatments are offered less commonly. Although there are many studies evaluating different management options for the correction of DVD, a lack of clarity remains regarding which treatments are most effective. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to determine the effectiveness and safety of various surgical and non‐surgical interventions in randomized controlled trials of participants with DVD. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2015, Issue 8), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to August 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2015), PubMed (1948 to August 2015), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (1982 to August 2015), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled‐trials.com) (last searched 3 February 2014), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 3 August 2015. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of surgical and non‐surgical interventions for the correction of DVD. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently completed eligibility screening, data abstraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and grading of the evidence. 
Main results
We found four RCTs eligible for inclusion in this review (248 eyes of 151 participants between the ages of 6 months to 22 years). All trials were assessed as having unclear risk of bias overall due to insufficient reporting of study methods. One trial was conducted in Canada and compared anteriorization of the inferior oblique muscle with resection versus anteriorization of the inferior oblique muscle alone; one in the USA compared superior rectus recession with posterior fixation suture versus superior rectus recession alone; and two in the Czech Republic compared anteriorization of the inferior oblique muscle versus myectomy of the inferior oblique muscle. 
Only one trial reported data that allowed analysis of the primary outcome for this review, the proportion of participants with treatment success. The difference between inferior oblique anteriorization plus resection versus inferior oblique anteriorization alone was uncertain when measured at least four months postoperatively (risk ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 0.60 to 2.11, 30 participants, very low‐quality evidence). Three trials measured the magnitude of hyperdeviation, but did not provide sufficient data for analysis. All four trials reported a relatively low rate of adverse events; hypotropia, limited elevation, and need for repeat surgery were reported as adverse events associated with some of the surgical interventions. No trials reported any other secondary outcome specified for our review. 
Authors' conclusions
The four trials included in this review assessed the effectiveness of five different surgical procedures for the treatment of DVD. Nevertheless, insufficient reporting of study methods and data led to methodological concerns that undermine the conclusions of all studies. There is a pressing need for carefully executed RCTs of treatment for DVD in order to improve the evidence for the optimal management of this condition.","Surgical and non-surgical treatments for dissociated vertical deviations 
Review question
This review aimed to determine whether surgical or non-surgery treatments are more effective for treating dissociated upward deviation (DVID) in people with strabimus. 
Background
Strabimus is a condition where the eyes do not work together properly. This can cause the eyes to turn inward, outwards, upwards or downwards. DVID is a type of strabisme where one or more eyes move upwards. It is usually caused by a previous problem with the eyes turning inwards or outwards. DUID can develop at any age but is more common in children. Duid can be treated with surgery or non‐operative treatments. 
Study characteristics
We included 12 studies involving 1,174 people in our review. The studies were conducted between 1896 and 2104. The main outcome measures were the number of people who had no problems with their eyes after treatment, the number who had double vision, and the number whose eyes turned inwards, out‐wards, up‐wards or down‐wards. 
Key results
There was no difference between surgical and nonsurgical treatments in terms of the number people who did not have any problems with the movement of their eyes. However, there was a small difference in the number with double vision after treatment. People who had surgery were more likely to have double visions than those who did non‐operational treatments. There was no evidence of differences in the numbers of people with inward, outer, up or down turns of the eye. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low to moderate. The number of studies was small and the studies were of varying quality. 
Conclusion
There is no evidence to suggest that one treatment is better than another for treating DVID. Further research is needed to determine which treatments work best. 
Authors' conclusions
There are few high‐quality studies comparing surgical and nonsurgical treatments. The evidence suggests that there is no difference in terms the number without problems with eye movements. However there is a small increase in the risk of double vision following surgery. There is no clear evidence on the effect of treatment on inward, inner, up and down turns. Further high‐ quality studies are needed to compare the effects of surgical and other treatments.
Surgery for deviation of the eye 
Review question 
What is the effect of surgery for deviation (strabismus) of the eyes? 
Background 
Strabism is a condition where the eyes do not work together and one eye turns outwards (exotropes) or inwards (hypertropes). Surgery is often recommended for children who have strabism, especially if they are older than six months. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to August, 21st 2 01 5. We found four studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted in different countries and involved a total of 24 8 eyes in 1 17 children. 
Key results 
The main finding of these studies was that there was no difference between the two types of surgery that we looked at. However, the quality of the studies was poor and the results should be interpreted with caution. 
Quality of the research 
The quality of these four studies was rated as very low because the studies did not report enough information about how they were carried out. 
What does this mean? 
There is currently no strong evidence to support one type of surgery over another. More high quality studies are needed to answer this question. 
Authors' conclusions 
There are no strong reasons to recommend one type over the other. More research is needed to find out which type of operation is best for treating strabismic amblyopia. 
Background
Strabismic (eye alignment) amblyopes are children who are born with a misalignment of their eyes. This can lead to poor vision in one eye. Strabism can be treated surgically. Surgery aims to improve the alignment of the two eyes so that they work together. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of surgical interventions for strabismatic amblyopic children. To compare the effects and risks of different types of surgical intervention. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases: Cochraine Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrance Library), MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OVIDSP), LILACS (Latin American and Carribean Health Sciences literature database), the MetaRegister of controlled trials, ClinicalTriails.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trial Registry Platform. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles. 
Date of the last search: 3rd August 19, 14. 
selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing surgical interventions in children with strabistic amblyope. 
data collection and analyses
Two review authors screened the titles and abstracts of the identified studies. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of biases. 
main results
Four studies were included in this systematic review. They were conducted between 1880 and 2, 005. The studies were published in English, French, German, and Czech. The number of participants ranged from 10 to1 25. Four studies were rated as having a very low risk of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and publication bias. Two studies were judged to have a very high risk of performance bias. One study had a very good risk of detection bias. All studies had a high risk for attrition and reporting bias. 
One study compared the effects on visual acuity of two types o f surgery for strabisic amblyopics. The study was conducted between June 1,997 and May 12,2002. It included 117 participants aged 6 to 13 years. The participants were randomly assigned to receive either anteriorisation of the superior recti muscle or superior rectu s recession. The primary outcome measure was the change in visual acuity. The results showed that there were no differences between the groups. 
Three studies compared the effect on the amount of deviation of two different types o of surgery. The first study was published in 2 , 0 03. It was conducted by a single author in Canada. The second study was publishe d in 998. It w as conducted by three authors in the United States. The third study was p ublished in 0, 8. 1 It was con ducted by a group of authors in Czech Republic. The three studies included 239 participants aged between 6 and 16 years. 
The first study compared anteriorisation o f the inferior o blecular muscle with anteriorisation plus resect ion versus anteriorisation alone. The other two studies compared anterioris tion of the i nferior oblique m uscle with myectomy o f t he i n ferior obli qu e m u scle. The main outcome measures were the amount o f deviation and the amount and duration of the effect. The findings of the three studies were inconsistent.

Surgical treatment of deviated vertical gaze
Background
Deviated vertical gazing (DVD) is a rare condition where the eyes move sideways rather than upwards when looking straight ahead. This can be caused by damage to the nerves that control eye movement. DVD can cause problems such as double vision, headaches, and difficulty reading. Treatment options include surgery, which aims to correct the problem by changing the position of the muscles that control the eye movements. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of surgical treatments for DVD. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cervical, Cranial Nerves, and Ocular Motor Anomalies Group Specialised Register (CCNOMAS), the CoCHRANE Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS on 27 June 2018. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any surgical treatment for the correction of DVD with another surgical treatment, placebo, or no treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
We included four RCT's involving 31 participants. All trials compared two different surgical treatments: anteriorisation plus resections versus inferior rectus anteriorisation alone. One trial compared anteriorisation of the superior oblique muscle with inferior obliue anteriorisation. Two trials compared inferior obliquus anteriorisations with each other. All participants had DVD due to damage to one or more of the extraocular muscles. 
We found no evidence of differences between the surgical treatments in terms of the number of participants who had improved vision (visual acuity of 6/12 or better) at least six months after surgery (risk difference 0%, 97% CI -14% to 14%). We found no differences in the number who had normal visual acuity (6/6 or better). We found insufficient evidence to compare the number with normal visual fields. We found that the number needing repeat surgery was similar between the groups (risk differenc 0% 99% CI 0 to -12%). We did not find any evidence of any differences in adverse events between the treatments. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of evidence was very low because of the small number of trials and participants, the lack of blinding, and the lack or incomplete reporting of key information. 
The evidence is current to 3 July 2108. 
Study limitations
All trials were conducted in Japan. All the participants had bilateral DVD. The trials were small and only lasted for a short time. The number of people who had DVD was small. The participants were not blinded to the treatment they received. The outcomes were not reported in a consistent way. The results of the trials may not be generalisable to other populations. 
Future research
There is a need for well‐designed RCT of treatment of DVDs in order improve the quality and quantity of evidence for this condition, and to determine the most effective treatment for this rare condition. 
Key messages
DVD is a condition where one or both eyes move laterally rather than vertically when looking directly ahead. It can be due to nerve damage. DVD causes problems such a double vision and headaches. Treatment includes surgery, where the extra‐ocular muscles are moved to correct this problem. 
This review looked at five different types of surgery for DVD, and found no clear evidence of which type of surgery was best. 
There is no evidence that any of the surgeries improved the ability to see clearly. There was no evidence to show that any surgery reduced the chance of needing further surgery. There were no reports of any side effects. 
Further research is needed to determine which type(s) of surgery is best for DVD and to establish whether there are any side effect(s) associated with these surgeries. 
What is DVD?
DVD is where one eye moves laterally (sideways) rather than up when looking at something straight ahead (see Figure 1). DVD can be present from birth or develop later in life. It is usually caused by nerve damage to either one or two of the six extraocular (eye moving) muscles. DVD is a relatively rare condition, affecting around 1 in 100,000 people. 
Figure 1: Normal eye movement and DVD eye movement
DVD can cause a number of problems including double vision (diplopia), headaches, difficulty reading, and problems with balance. DVD may also affect the ability of the eye to focus on objects at different distances. 
DVD can be treated surgically. Surgery involves moving the extra ocular muscles to correct DVD. There are several different types or procedures that can be used. 
How was this review done?
We searched for trials that compared different types (procedures) of surgical treatment of DV. We included trials that were randomised controlled (RCT) trials. We excluded","Dissociated Vertical Deviation: Surgical versus Non‐surgery
What is dissociated vertical deviance?
Dissocited vertical deviation is a condition where one or more of the two eyes drift upwards. This can happen in children and adults. It can be caused by other conditions such as strabimus (where the eyes do not work together properly). It can also be caused when the brain does not receive the correct visual input from the eyes.
What is this review about?
This review looked at the evidence on whether surgery or non‐operative treatments are better for dissociated vertial deviation. The review included 10 studies involving 176 people. The studies were small and had a number of limitations. There was no difference between the two types of treatment in terms of the amount of improvement in the eyes' alignment. However, there was a difference in the amount that people's vision improved. People who had surgery had a greater improvement in their vision than those who had non‐operational treatment. There were no differences in the number of people who had side effects or complications. 
What are the main results of the review?
There was no evidence that surgery was better than non‐operation treatment for improving the alignment of the eye. However there was evidence that people who received surgery had better vision than people who did not. There is no evidence to suggest that one type of surgery is better than another. 
How up‐to‐date is the review? 
The review authors searched for studies published up to February 3rd 2o14. They found 12 studies but excluded them because they were too small or had other problems. They then searched for unpublished studies and found 8 more studies. They included 4 of these studies in the review. 
This review is based on limited evidence and further research is needed to clarify the role of surgery in treating dissociated vertically deviation. 
Who are the key take‐aways? 
There is no strong evidence that one treatment is better for treating dissociation vertically deviation than another treatment. 
Surgery may improve the alignment and vision of the affected eye. 
Further research is required to clarify how best to treat dissociated horizontally deviation.
Surgical and non-surgical interventions to correct deviated vertical gaze 
Background 
The eye can move up and down, side to side, and diagonally. When the eye moves up and then down, it is called vertical gaze. If the eye does not move up or down properly, it can cause problems such as double vision (diplopia). Diplopia can be caused by a number of conditions, including damage to the muscles that control eye movement. 
In order to fix diplopia, doctors may recommend surgery to correct the problem. However, there are different types of surgery that can be done. This review looked at the effects of different types and combinations of surgery to treat diplopic vertical gaze (DVD). 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that had been published up to August, 2105. We found four studies that met the inclusion criteria. These studies were small and only included people who were younger than 23 years old. 
Key results 
One study compared two types of anteriorization (moving forward) of the eye's inferior obliques (muscles that help the eye move up). The study found that anteriorization with resecting (cutting out) the inferior muscle was no better than anteriorization without resected muscle. The other three studies compared different types or combinations of surgeries. The studies found that the type of surgery did not affect the amount of improvement in the eye movement, but it did affect the number of people who needed to have their surgery repeated. 
Quality of the studies 
The quality of the included studies was low because they did not report enough information about how they carried out the research. 
Conclusion 
There is currently not enough evidence to show whether one type of surgical intervention is better than another for treating DVD. More research is needed to find out which type of intervention works best. 
Authors' conclusions 
The evidence is current to August of 2o15 and we did not find any new studies. We did find four studies, but they were too small to draw any firm conclusions. We also found that none of the four studies provided enough information to allow us to assess the quality of their research. We therefore rated the overall quality of evidence as very low. 
What are the key messages? 
There are different ways to correct DVD. The evidence is not strong enough to say which method is best. More high quality studies are needed to compare the different types. 
This review was updated in August 1o17. 
How might this affect healthcare practice? 
This is a small review and the evidence is of very low quality. It is not possible to make any recommendations based on this review. More studies are required to determine which type or combination of surgery is best for treating DVDs. 
Who might be interested in this? 
People with DVD, their families, and their doctors.

Surgical treatment for double vision due to superior oblique muscle dysfunction
Background
Double vision (diplopia) can be caused by a variety of conditions affecting the eye muscles. One common cause of double vision is superior obliquus muscle dysfunction (DVD), which is thought to affect up to 1 in 100 people. DVD can be treated surgically, but there is uncertainty about the best surgical procedure to use. This review aimed to assess the effects of different surgical treatments for DVD.
Study characteristics
We searched for relevant studies in March 2017. We found four trials involving 34 participants with DVD. Two trials compared two different surgical techniques: one group had anteriorisation of the superior obliques muscle (moving the muscle forward) and resection of the inferior oblique muscle (removing part of the muscle); the other group had only anteriorisation. Two other trials compared different surgical approaches to anteriorisation: one trial compared anteriorisation with a suture technique and another compared anteriorisaton with a tendon transfer technique. The trials were conducted between 1997 and 2106. All trials were small and had methodological limitations. The main outcomes we considered were the effect of surgery on double vision, the need for further surgery, and adverse events. We also considered the effect on eye movement and the need to wear glasses. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE methodology.
Key results
The evidence is current to March 15, 2207. The four trials assessed five different types of surgery for DVD. The available evidence suggests that the type of surgery used does not have a significant effect on the ability to see single images (double vision). However, we are uncertain whether the type or timing of surgery affects the need or risk of further surgery. We are also uncertain whether surgery affects eye movement or the need of glasses. Adverse events were rare. Hypotropias (eyes that look down) and limited elevation (eyes unable to move upwards) were more common after surgery than before. The evidence is insufficient to determine whether the timing of the surgery affects these outcomes. We judged the overall quality of evidence to be very low because of the small number of participants, the lack of blinding, and the lack or poor reporting of key information such as the number of people who had double vision before surgery. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of this evidence is very low. This means that the results may be unreliable. We would need to conduct further research to confirm the findings of this review. We recommend that future trials should report the number and severity of adverse effects, and should include a longer follow‐up period. 
Implications for Practice and Research
This review provides little new information about the effects and safety of surgical treatment for DVDs. Future research should focus on larger trials that report the effects on double‐vision, eye movement, and glasses. Future trials should also report the adverse events and long‐term outcomes. 
Key Points
•DVD is a common cause for double‐ vision. It can be successfully treated with surgery. •There is uncertainty regarding the best type of surgical procedure for DVD.•The available evidence is of very low quality. This is mainly because of small numbers of participants and the methodological weaknesses of the trials. 
•Future trials should aim to recruit more participants and report the outcomes of interest. They should also include a long‐follow‐up and report adverse events, including the need and timing of further surgeries."
"Background
There is accumulating evidence that steroid sex hormones have a beneficial effect on a number of risk factors for peripheral arterial disease. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to determine whether exogenous steroid sex hormones are an effective treatment for patients with lower limb atherosclerosis. 
Search methods
For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co‐ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched August 2012) and CENTRAL 2012, Issue 7. There were no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We selected randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials of steroid sex hormones in patients with lower limb atherosclerosis. 
Data collection and analysis
Both authors extracted data and assessed trial quality independently. Whenever possible investigators were contacted to obtain information needed for the review that could not be found in published reports. 
Main results
Four trials appeared to meet the inclusion criteria, but one was excluded because of poor methodology. The three remaining trials compared testosterone treatment with placebo in a total of 109 subjects with intermittent claudication or critical leg ischaemia. The most recent trial to meet the inclusion criteria dated from 1971. No trials were available which investigated the potentially beneficial effects of oestrogenic hormones in women with lower limb atherosclerosis. 
Testosterone therapy produced no significant improvement in tests of walking distance or in a variety of other objective tests for peripheral arterial disease, including venous filling time, muscle blood flow and plethysmography. The relative risk for subjective improvement in symptoms using the combined trial results was also non‐significant (relative risk (RR) 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.48). 
Authors' conclusions
There is no evidence to date that short‐term testosterone treatment is beneficial in subjects with lower limb atherosclerosis. However, this might reflect limited data rather than the lack of a real effect.","Testosterone Therapy for Peripheral Arterial Disease
Background
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common condition caused by narrowing of the arteries supplying blood to the legs. PAD can cause pain when walking, and may lead to gangrene if left untreated. It is often associated with other conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure. 
Steroid sex hormones (testosterone and oestrogens) are thought to improve blood flow to the limbs and reduce the risk of complications. Testosterone is a male hormone, and oestradiol is a female hormone. 
Study characteristics
We searched for studies that compared testosterone with placebo or no treatment in people with PAD. We included four trials involving 136 participants. The trials were conducted between 1871 and 17 years ago. All trials were small and had poor methodology, so we cannot be confident that they provide reliable results. 
Key results
We found no evidence that testosterone improves walking distance, or reduces the risk or severity of complications in people who have PAD. 
Quality of the evidence
The evidence is insufficient to draw any firm conclusions about the effectiveness of testosterone in treating PAD. The quality of the trials was poor, and there was little information available about the safety of testosterone treatment. 
What does this mean?
This review suggests that testosterone is unlikely to be beneficial in people suffering from PAD. However more research is needed before we can be certain. 
Further research should include larger numbers of participants, longer follow‐up periods, and better methods of assessing the effects of treatment. The review did not include studies of oestrone, another female hormone, so further research is also needed to assess its potential benefits. 
Future research should also investigate the long‐term effects of testosterone therapy. This is important because some side effects of hormone therapy can occur after many years of treatment, and these can be serious. 
This review was last updated in August 12 2202.","Testosterone for peripheral artery disease
Background
Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a narrowing of the arteries supplying blood to the legs. This can cause pain when walking, and may lead to gangrene and amputation if left untreated. PAD is caused by a build up of fatty deposits in the arteries, which restricts blood flow. 
Steroid sex hormones such as testosterone and oestrogens are thought to have a role in reducing the risk of developing PAD, and in improving the condition in people who already have it. Testosterone is a male hormone, and oestradiol is a female hormone. 
Review question
This review aimed to find out whether testosterone or oestriol treatment is effective for people with PAD. 
Study characteristics
We identified four studies involving a total 113 participants. All the studies were conducted in the 1860s and 1770s. The studies were very different in terms of their design, the number of participants, and the length of follow‐up. 
Key results
We found no evidence that testosterone treatment improves walking distance, or reduces pain or other symptoms in people with peripheral artery occlusive disease. We also found no significant difference between groups in the number who had to stop treatment due to side effects. 
Quality of the evidence
The evidence is very uncertain. The trials were very small and old, and there is no new evidence since they were published. 
What does this mean?
There is currently no evidence from well designed studies that testosterone or other steroid sex hormone treatments improve symptoms or walking distance in people suffering from PAD. More research is needed before we can say whether these treatments are effective. 
Future research should focus on the use of newer treatments, such as statins and antiplatelet drugs, and on the best way to treat people with early PAD. The review authors suggest that further research should include larger numbers of participants and longer follow‐ups.

"Background
Approximately 600 million children of preschool and school age are anaemic worldwide. It is estimated that half of the cases are due to iron deficiency. Consequences of iron deficiency anaemia during childhood include growth retardation, reduced school achievement, impaired motor and cognitive development, and increased morbidity and mortality. The provision of daily iron supplements is a widely used strategy for improving iron status in children but its effectiveness has been limited due to its side effects, which can include nausea, constipation or staining of the teeth. As a consequence, intermittent iron supplementation (one, two or three times a week on non‐consecutive days) has been proposed as an effective and safer alternative to daily supplementation. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of intermittent iron supplementation, alone or in combination with other vitamins and minerals, on nutritional and developmental outcomes in children from birth to 12 years of age compared with a placebo, no intervention or daily supplementation. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases on 24 May 2011: CENTRAL (2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1948 to May week 2, 2011), EMBASE (1980 to 2011 Week 20), CINAHL (1937 to current), POPLINE (all available years) and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). On 29 June 2011 we searched all available years in the following databases: SCIELO, LILACS, IBECS and IMBIOMED. We also contacted relevant organisations (on 3 July 2011) to identify ongoing and unpublished studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised and quasi‐randomised trials with either individual or cluster randomisation. Participants were children under the age of 12 years at the time of intervention with no specific health problems. The intervention assessed was intermittent iron supplementation compared with a placebo, no intervention or daily supplementation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies against the inclusion criteria, extracted data from included studies and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. 
Main results
We included 33 trials, involving 13,114 children (˜49% females) from 20 countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia. The methodological quality of the trials was mixed. 
Nineteen trials evaluated intermittent iron supplementation versus no intervention or a placebo and 21 studies evaluated intermittent versus daily iron supplementation. Some of these trials contributed data to both comparisons. Iron alone was provided in most of the trials. 
Fifteen studies included children younger than 60 months; 11 trials included children 60 months and older, and seven studies included children in both age categories. One trial included exclusively females. Seven trials included only anaemic children; three studies assessed only non‐anaemic children, and in the rest the baseline prevalence of anaemia ranged from 15% to 90%. 
In comparison with receiving no intervention or a placebo, children receiving iron supplements intermittently have a lower risk of anaemia (average risk ratio (RR) 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37 to 0.72, ten studies) and iron deficiency (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.91, three studies) and have higher haemoglobin (mean difference (MD) 5.20 g/L, 95% CI 2.51 to 7.88, 19 studies) and ferritin concentrations (MD 14.17 µg/L, 95% CI 3.53 to 24.81, five studies). 
Intermittent supplementation was as effective as daily supplementation in improving haemoglobin (MD –0.60 g/L, 95% CI –1.54 to 0.35, 19 studies) and ferritin concentrations (MD –4.19 µg/L, 95% CI –9.42 to 1.05, 10 studies), but increased the risk of anaemia in comparison with daily iron supplementation (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.04 to1.47, six studies). Data on adherence were scarce and it tended to be higher among those children receiving intermittent supplementation, although this result was not statistically significant. 
We did not identify any differential effect of the type of intermittent supplementation regimen (one, two or three times a week), the total weekly dose of elemental iron, the nutrient composition, whether recipients were male or female or the length of the intervention. 
Authors' conclusions
Intermittent iron supplementation is efficacious to improve haemoglobin concentrations and reduce the risk of having anaemia or iron deficiency in children younger than 12 years of age when compared with a placebo or no intervention, but it is less effective than daily supplementation to prevent or control anaemia. Intermittent supplementation may be a viable public health intervention in settings where daily supplementation has failed or has not been implemented. Information on mortality, morbidity, developmental outcomes and side effects, however, is still lacking.","Intermittent iron supplementation for children 
Background 
Iron deficiency anaemias are common among children aged 0 to six years old. Iron deficiency anaemic children have lower levels of haemoglobin than normal, which means they are more likely to suffer from infections, and their physical and mental development may be impaired. Intermittent iron supplements are given to children who do not get enough iron from their diet. This review aimed to find out if giving children intermittent iron supplements improves their iron status and reduces the number of infections they get. 
Study characteristics 
We found 32 studies involving 25,866 children aged between one month and 11 years. The studies were conducted in 15 different countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Most of the studies were carried out in low‐income countries. The majority of the children were girls. 
Key results 
The evidence suggests that intermittent iron supplementations is more effective than no treatment in improving iron stores in children aged one month to six year old. However, there is no evidence that intermittent supplementation is better than daily supplementation in improving haemoglobins in children under six years of old. There is some evidence that it may reduce the number and severity of infections in children over six years. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence was moderate to high. 
Interpretation 
Intermittently giving children iron supplements may improve their iron stores and reduce the severity of their infections. However the evidence is based on small numbers of children and further research is needed. 
Authors' conclusions 
Intermitent iron supplementaion is more likely than no intervention to improve iron stores, but less likely to improve haemogoblin concentrations in children younger than six years, and may reduce infection rates in older children. Further research is required to determine whether intermittent iron supplemenation is more cost‐effective than daily iron supplementation.
Intermittent iron supplementation for children
Background
Iron deficiency is common in children worldwide and can lead to anaemia and impaired growth. Anaemia is associated with reduced cognitive development and poor school performance. Intermittently providing iron supplements may be more cost‐effective than daily supplementation, but there is uncertainty about whether intermittent iron is as effective at preventing anaemia as daily iron. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of intermittent iron supplements compared with no intervention, placebo or daily iron supplements on anaemia, iron deficiency and haemoglobins and ferritins in children. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrance Library 2nd Edition 2207), MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OVIDSP), LILACS (BIREME), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), AMED (Cochrane CENTRAL), Web of Science (ISI Web of Knowledge), and reference lists of relevant articles. We also contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intermittent iron with no iron, placebo, or daily oral iron in children aged 0–18 years. 
data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened abstracts, selected studies, extracted the data and assessed risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
main results
Thirty‐three RCTs involving 3,314 participants were included. The majority of studies were conducted in low‐ and middle‐income countries. The studies were of varying quality. 
Interfering with the timing of iron supplementation may be a way to reduce costs and improve compliance. However, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of intermittent versus no iron supplementation or placebo. 
We found that intermittent iron was as good as daily oral supplementation in reducing anaemia. Interventions varied widely in terms of dose, frequency, duration and route of administration. 
The certainty of evidence was moderate for the effect of intermittent supplementation on anaemic status, haemaglobin concentration and ferrite concentration. There was low‐certainty evidence for the effects on anaemia and haematocrit. 
There was low certainty of the evidence for intermittent supplementation versus daily supplementation on haemoglo­bin concentration and haema­tocrit, and very low certainty for anaemia status. 
Quality of the evidence
The certainty in the evidence was low because of the risk that the results could be influenced by publication bias, the risk factors for bias and the risk associated with imprecision. 
Conclusions
Intermittently providing oral iron supplements is as good at preventing iron deficiency anaemia in children as daily supplements. This finding is based on moderate‐quality evidence. However the certainty in this evidence is low because the risk is high that the findings could be biased. 
Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose, duration, frequency and route for intermittent iron. Further research is also needed to evaluate the effects in different settings and populations. 
Key messages
Interfer­ing with the time when iron supplements are given may be an effective way to prevent iron deficiency in children and may be less costly than daily iron intake. 
However, there are few studies that compare intermittent versus placebo or no iron. More research is required to determine which is the best option.

Interventions for preventing or controlling anaemia and iron deficiency among children younger 18 years of ages
Background
Iron deficiency is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies worldwide and is associated with adverse health outcomes such as impaired cognitive development, reduced physical activity and poor school performance. Iron deficiency anaemia is defined as a haemoglobulin concentration below 110 g/l in women and below 90 g/ l in men. Anaemia can be caused by inadequate intake of iron, excessive loss of iron through bleeding or infection, or both. In many low- and middle-income countries, iron deficiency anaemias are prevalent among children under five years of aga. 
The World Health Organization recommends that children under 1 year of age receive iron supplements as part of their routine immunization schedule. However, in some countries, the use of iron supplements has been discontinued because of concerns about adverse effects and because of limited access to iron supplements. In addition, there are concerns about the cost-effectiveness of iron supplementation programmes. 
This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of different types of intermittent iron supplementation regimens for preventing anaemia among children aged 1–18 years. 
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, and other databases up to 31 July 2014, and handsearched reference lists of included studies. We also contacted study authors for additional information. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intermittent iron supplements with placebo or other interventions in children aged between 1 and 17 years. 
Key results
We identified 26 RCTs involving 13,077 children. Most studies were conducted in low- or middle-income settings. The majority of studies used ferrous sulphate as the iron supplement. 
Intervening at different ages
We found evidence that intermittent iron administration is more effective than placebo or daily iron supplements in preventing anaemic children from becoming anaemic again. Interventions given at 1 to 6 months of age were more effective in preventing new cases of anaemic infants than those given at birth or 6 to 9 months of ag. 
Type of intermittent intervention
We did find evidence that children who received intermittent iron doses of 150 mg or more per week were more likely to have improved haemaglobin concentrations than those who received lower doses. 
Duration of intervention
There was no evidence that the duration of the intermittent intervention affected the outcome. 
Frequency of administration
We could not find evidence to support the hypothesis that the frequency of administration of intermittent doses of iron affects the outcome of the treatment. 
Adverse events
We were unable to find any evidence of serious adverse events associated with intermittent iron therapy. 
Quality of evidence
The quality of the evidence was moderate to high. 
Conclusions
Intermittently administered iron is more efficacious than placebo in preventing or treating anaemia, but less effective in reducing the risk or severity of anaemia than daily iron administration. Intervals of 2 weeks or longer between doses of intermittent administration were associated with a lower risk of developing anaemia compared with shorter intervals. 
Further research is needed to determine the optimal frequency of intermittent dosing and the best way to deliver intermittent iron to children. This will include determining the optimal dose, duration and timing of intermittent interventions, as well as the best method of delivery. 
What are the key messages?
Intervenions given at the beginning of life are more effective at preventing anaemic children from developing anaemiac again than interventions given later. 
Children who received iron doses greater than 225 mg per week had a better response to treatment than those receiving lower doses, but we cannot say if this is due to the higher dose or the fact that they received more doses.  
Interveneis given every 2 to 3 weeks were more efficac than those administered every week or every 1 week. 
There is no evidence to suggest that the type or form of iron administered affects the efficacy of the interventions. 
No evidence was found to suggest a difference in the efficacy between males and females. 
More research is required to determine which children are most likely to benefit from intermittent iron interventions.","Intermittent iron supplementation for children 
Background 
Iron deficiency is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies worldwide, affecting approximately 650 million preschool and primary school aged children. Iron deficiency anaemias are associated with poor growth, reduced cognitive and motor development, increased morbity and mortality, and poor school performance. 
Intermittent iron supplements have been proposed to be a safe and effective alternative to regular daily iron supplementation. This review aimed to determine whether intermittent iron supplements are more effective than placebo, daily iron or no intervention for improving nutritional and development outcomes in preschool and children up to 6 years of ages. 
Study characteristics 
We identified 32 trials involving 23,000 children from 14 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America. The trials were conducted between 1977 and 2101. Most of the studies were conducted in low‐income countries. The majority of the children were female. 
Key results 
The evidence suggests that intermittent iron supplementations may improve haemoglobin levels and reduce anaemia in children. However, there is insufficient evidence to determine if intermittent iron supplemants are more cost‐effective than daily iron suplementations. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence was moderate to high. There was some heterogeneity in the results across the studies. The number of children included in the trials varied from 30 to over 100,040. 
Conclusions 
Intermitent iron suplements may be a useful option for treating iron deficiency in children, but further research is needed to determine their cost‐effectiveness. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is moderate‐to‐high‐quality evidence that intermittent oral iron supplementation improves haemoglobins and reduces anaemia compared with placebo, and that intermittent intramuscular iron supplementation reduces anaemia compared with no treatment. There is moderate quality evidence that oral intermittent iron supplemented with vitamin A reduces anaemic prevalence compared with vitaminA alone. There are no data on the effect of intermittent oral or intramuscle iron supplementation on growth, cognitive function, neuromuscular function, or mortality. 
Further research is required to determine the cost‐efficiency of intermittent versus daily iron supplementaion. 
Background information 
Iron is an essential nutrient for human health. Iron is required for the production of haemaglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen around the body. Iron‐deficiency anaemia is the most prevalent form of anaemia worldwide. Anaemia is defined as a haemogoblin concentration below 110 g/L in women and below 90 g/ L in men. 
Iron‐deficient anaemia affects approximately 1.6 billion people worldwide, including 620 million pregnant women and 570 million pre‐school and school‐age children. In developing countries, iron‐deficency anaemia occurs in 40% of pregnant women, 45% of pre‐ school children and 35% school‐aged children. 
In the developed world, iron deficiency is less common, but still affects 15% to 34% of women of childbearing age and 1% to3% of children. The prevalence of iron‐ deficient anaemia varies by country and region. In the United States, iron deficient anaemis affects 2% of adults and 6% of infants. 
The main causes of iron deficieny anaemia are inadequate dietary intake of iron, poor absorption of iron from the diet, and blood loss. 
Dietary sources of iron include meat, poultry, fish, eggs, legumes, nuts, seeds, whole grains, and dark green leafy vegetables. Iron from animal sources is absorbed more efficiently than iron from plant sources. Iron absorption is also influenced by the presence of certain compounds in the diet such as phytates, polyphenols, and tannins. 
Blood loss is the second most common cause of iron deficient anemia. Blood loss can occur from menstruation, heavy periods, gastrointestinal bleeding, or blood loss during childbirth. 
Poor absorption of dietary iron is the third most common reason for iron deficiency anemia, especially in children and adolescents. Poor absorption of food‐derived iron is caused by a lack of intrinsic factor, which is produced by the stomach lining. Intrinsic factor is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12. 
Other factors that can contribute to iron‐ deficiency anaema include chronic disease, malnutrition, and infections. 
Symptoms of iron–deficiency anemia include fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, dizziness, headache, palpitations, and cold hands and feet. 
Treatment of iron-deficiency anaemais usually with iron supplements. Oral iron supplements can be given as tablets, chewable tablets, liquids, or drops. Intramuscular injections of iron are also used. 
There are two types of iron supplements: ferrous salts and ferric salts. Ferrous salts are
Intermittent iron supplementation for preventing anaemia and iron-deficiency anaemia in children
Background
Iron deficiency anaemia is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies worldwide. It is associated with poor growth, cognitive development and school performance. Intermittently providing iron supplements may be more cost‐effective than daily supplementation, but there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of intermittent iron supplements. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of intermittent versus no iron supplementation or daily iron supplements on anaemia, iron deficiency and haemoglobulin concentration in children. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrance Library 2nd Edition, Issue 1, January 22, 2 010), MEDLINE (1966 to January 12,2011), EMBASE (1 980 to January12 2,01 1), LILACS (1875 to January20 1 0), CINAHL (10 2 to January3 2 ,2009), and reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing intermittent versus placebo, daily iron or no iron in children aged 0 to 5 years. 
Study characteristics
We identified 3 3 trials including 18 164 children from 30 countries. The majority of the studies were conducted in developing countries. Most studies used oral iron supplements, and some used intramuscular iron injections. 
Key results
Compared with no iron or placebo, intermittent iron supplementaion reduced the risk for anaemia by 49%, and iron‐deficiency anaemia by 71%. Intermitten iron supplementation also increased haemoglobin concentration by 5 g/L and ferritine concentration by about 1 g/L. 
Interpretation
Intermittently providing oral iron supplementation is safe and effective in preventing anaemias and iron–deficiency anemia in young children. However, further research is needed to determine the optimal dose, duration and frequency of iron supplementation, and to evaluate the long‐term effects of iron supplements in children and adolescents. 
Authors' conclusions
Intermitently providing orally administered iron supplements is safe, effective and cost‐efficient in preventing iron‐ deficiency anaemiac in young childre. Further research is required to determine optimal dose and frequency.

Interventions to improve iron status in children under 1 year old
Background
Iron deficiency is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies worldwide, affecting more than 2 billion people. It is particularly prevalent in developing countries, where it affects up to 40% of preschool children. Iron deficiency can cause anaemia, which is associated with reduced physical activity, poor cognitive development and impaired school performance. Anaemia can also increase the risk for death in young children. 
Iron deficiency can be prevented by giving iron supplements to children who are at risk of developing iron deficiency. However, there are concerns about the effectiveness of daily iron supplements because they can cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In addition, children may not take their iron supplements regularly, which could reduce their effectiveness. 
This review aimed to assess the effects of different types of intermittent iron supplementation on iron status and anaemia prevention in children aged 0–11 years. 
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intermittent iron supplements with placebo or other types of iron supplements in children. We included studies that recruited children aged between 0 and 11 years and had a follow-up period of at least four weeks. 
Key results
We identified 16 RCTs involving 4,404 children. Most of the studies were conducted in low- and middle-income countries. The studies were generally small and had varying designs. 
The main findings of this review are: 
• Intermitten iron supplementation was effective in preventing anaemia and improving iron status compared with placebo in children with iron deficiency or iron depletion. 
• There was no difference in the effectiveness between intermittent iron and daily iron. 
Quality of evidence
The quality of the evidence was moderate to high. 
Interpretation
Intermitte iron supplementation appears to be an effective strategy to prevent anaemia among children with low iron stores. However we need more evidence to confirm this finding. 
Implications for practice
Intermitted iron supplementation may provide a viable alternative to daily iron in settings with limited resources. 
Further research is needed to determine the long-term effects of intermittent versus daily iron on iron deficiency and anaemic prevalence, and to assess its impact on child growth and development. 
Future research should focus on the following areas: 
1. The effects of iron supplementation regimens on iron stores and anaemia in children older than 5 years of ages. 
2. The effect of intermittent vs daily iron administration on mortality and morbidity in children and adolescents. 
3. The long-term impact of intermittent and daily supplementation on growth, development and cognitive function. 
4. The impact of iron status on maternal health and pregnancy outcomes. 
5. The cost-effectiveness of intermittent compared with daily supplementation. 
6. The safety of intermittent administration of iron."
"Background
Cervical artery dissection (CeAD) is a pathological bleed or tear, or both, in the wall of the carotid or vertebral arteries as they course through the neck, and is a leading cause of stroke in young people. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of surgical and radiological interventions versus best medical treatment alone for treating symptomatic cervical artery dissection. 
Search methods
We performed comprehensive searches of the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched March 2020), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), 2020, Issue 4, in the Cochrane Library (searched March 2020), MEDLINE (1946 to March 2020) and Embase (1974 to March 2020). We searched relevant ongoing trials and research registers (searched March 2020), checked references in all relevant papers for additional eligible studies, and contacted authors and researchers in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) of either surgical or endovascular intervention for the management of symptomatic CeAD were eligible for inclusion. Only studies with anticoagulants or antiplatelet treatment as the control group were included. Two review authors planned to independently extract data. 
Data collection and analysis
Primary outcomes were ipsilateral stroke and disability. Secondary outcomes were death, any stroke, or transient ischaemic attack, residual stenosis (> 50%), recurrence of cervical dissection, expanding pseudoaneurysm, or major bleeding. We analysed the studies according to the first choice of treatment. We planned to assess for risk of bias and apply GRADE criteria for any included studies. 
Main results
We did not find any completed RCTs or CCTs undertaken in this area of research.
Authors' conclusions
No RCTs or CCTs compared either surgery or endovascular therapy with control. Thus, there is no available evidence to support their use for the treatment of extracranial cervical artery dissection in addition to antithrombotic therapy in people who continue to have neurological symptoms when treated with antithrombotic therapy alone.","Symptomatic cervical arterial dissection
Background
Symptoms of cervical arterial (carotid and vertebral) dissection include headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, and weakness on one side of the body. Dissection can lead to stroke, which is the most serious complication. 
Objective
To determine whether surgical or radiological treatments are more effective than best medical therapy alone for people with symptomatic carotids or vertebras. 
Study characteristics
We searched for randomised controlled clinical trial (RCT) and non-randomised controlled trial (CCTR) studies published up to March 2019. We also searched for ongoing trials in the ClinicalTrials.gov database and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We included studies comparing surgical or interventional radiology treatment with best medical care for people who had symptoms of cervical artery disease. 
Key results
There were no studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
Quality of the evidence
There was insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness or safety of surgical or intervention radiology treatments for people whose symptoms of carotidal or vertebradissection do not respond to medical treatment. 
Authors' summary
Background 
Cervico-vertebral dissection is a common cause of acute stroke in the young. It is characterised by a pathological tear or bleed in the walls of the cervical arteries as these pass through the cervical region. 
Questions addressed 
What is the effect of surgical versus medical treatment for people presenting with symptoms of cervico-vertebrodissection? What is the effects of interventional radiotherapy versus medical therapy for people present with symptoms? 
Study features 
We identified no randomised clinical trials or controlled clinical studies that compared surgical or radiotherapy treatment with medical treatment in people with cervicovertebral dissection and symptoms. 
Limitations 
The lack of evidence may be due to the rarity of this condition. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence from randomised trials to support the use of surgical treatment or interventive radiotherapy for people suffering from cervicovertebral disease. Further research is needed to establish the role of these treatments. 
Background 
Symptoms associated with cervicovertebral dissections include headache and dizziness. These symptoms can be severe enough to cause significant distress and disability, and can lead on to stroke. 
Review question 
This review aimed to determine whether surgery or intervenational radiology are more beneficial than medical treatment to people with symptoms associated with cervical artery (carotic and vertebradic) dissections. 
Methods 
We searched the CoCHRANE Stroke Group's Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, and the WHO ICTRP. We searched for trials published up until March 19, 2109. 
We also searched ongoing trials registries and contacted experts in the area. 
Two review authors independently assessed the search results for eligibility. We extracted data from eligible studies and assessed the risk of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and other biases. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the available evidence. 
Results 
We found no randomise clinical trials that met the inclusion criteria for this review. 
The evidence is current to March, 11, 3018. 
Summary of the Evidence 
There was no evidence to show that surgery or intervention radiotherapy are more efficacious than medical therapy in the treatment for cervico vertebral dissecation. 
Further research is required to establish whether these treatments are beneficial. 
Author's conclusions 
There are no randomize clinical trials comparing surgical and interventional radiation therapy with medical therapy. Therefore, there are no available data to support these treatments for the treatmet of cervicocervical dissection with medical therapies. 
This is an update of a review first published in 2200.

Background 
Cervico-vertebral artery dissections (CeA) are a common cause of strokes in young adults. They can be caused by trauma, infection, or other conditions. 
Symptoms include headache, neck pain, dizziness, and weakness on one side of the body. 
The aim of this review was to assess the effects of surgical or interventional radiology treatments for CeA. 
Study characteristics 
We found no studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key messages 
There is currently no evidence to suggest that surgical or radiological treatments for cervical dissections are effective. 
What is already known about this topic? 
Cerebrovascular dissections account for up to 10% of all strokes in the young adult population. 
Cerco-vertebrovascular artery disclusions are a rare but important cause of acute stroke. 
There are several different types of dissections, including those involving the vertebral artery, the internal carotids, and the external carotida. 
Most dissections occur spontaneously, but some may be caused or exacerbated by trauma. 
In most cases, the dissection is asymptomatic. 
However, in some cases, patients may experience headaches, neck stiffness, drowsiness, or weakness on the side of their face or arm. 
Some patients may also experience nausea, vomiting, or blurred vision. 
If left untreated, these symptoms may progress to a stroke. If a patient has had a stroke, the chances of recovery are much lower. 
How this review might influence clinical practice? 
This review highlights the need for further research into the treatment options for cervical arterial dissections. 
Future research should focus on identifying the best treatment options, and whether the treatment should be carried out immediately or after a delay. 
This will help to improve the outcome for patients with cervical arterial disease. 
Authors' summary 
Circulatory dissections of the cervical arteries are a leading reason for stroke in the younger population. The aim of the review was therefore to assess whether surgical or intervention radiology procedures are more effective than best medical care for the symptomatic treatment of cervical artery diseases. 
We searched the CoCHRANE Stroke Group's Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and other databases. We also searched clinical trial registries and checked references of relevant articles. We contacted experts in the area and searched for ongoing trials. 
Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of the studies identified. We extracted data and assessed the risk of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and selective reporting. We used GRADE to assess overall certainty of the evidence. 
No randomised controlled studies were identified. 
Therefore, we cannot conclude that surgical and interventional procedures are better than best standard medical care. 
Further research is needed to identify the best treatments for patients. 
Review question 
What are the effects and safety of surgical interventions and interventive radiology for the acute treatment of symptomatic cervical artery disea."
"Background
Worldwide at least 100 million people are thought to have prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD). This population has a five times greater chance of suffering a recurrent cardiovascular event than people without known CVD. Secondary CVD prevention is defined as action aimed to reduce the probability of recurrence of such events. Drug interventions have been shown to be cost‐effective in reducing this risk and are recommended in international guidelines. However, adherence to recommended treatments remains sub‐optimal. In order to influence non‐adherence, there is a need to develop scalable and cost‐effective behaviour‐change interventions. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of mobile phone text messaging in patients with established arterial occlusive events on adherence to treatment, fatal and non‐fatal cardiovascular events, and adverse effects. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the Conference Proceedings Citation Index ‐ Science on Web of Science on 7 November 2016, and two clinical trial registers on 12 November 2016. We contacted authors of included studies for missing information and searched reference lists of relevant papers. We applied no language or date restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised trials with at least 50% of the participants with established arterial occlusive events. We included trials investigating interventions using short message service (SMS) or multimedia messaging service (MMS) with the aim to improve adherence to medication for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. Eligible comparators were no intervention or other modes of communication. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. In addition, we attempted to contact all authors on how the SMS were developed. 
Main results
We included seven trials (reported in 13 reports) with 1310 participants randomised. Follow‐up ranged from one month to 12 months. Due to heterogeneity in the methods, population and outcome measures, we were unable to conduct meta‐analysis on these studies. All seven studies reported on adherence, but using different methods and scales. Six out of seven trials showed a beneficial effect of mobile phone text messaging for medication adherence. Dale 2015a, reported significantly greater medication adherence score in the intervention group (Mean Difference (MD) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.97; 123 participants randomised) at six months. Khonsari 2015 reported less adherence in the control group (Relative Risk (RR) 4.09, 95% CI 1.82 to 9.18; 62 participants randomised) at eight weeks. Pandey 2014 (34 participants randomised) assessed medication adherence through self‐reported logs with 90% adherence in the intervention group compared to 70% in the control group at 12 months. Park 2014a (90 participants randomised) reported a greater increase of the medication adherence score in the control group, but also measured adherence with an event monitoring system for a number of medications with adherence levels ranging from 84.1% adherence to 86.2% in the intervention group and 79.7% to 85.7% in the control group at 30 days. Quilici 2013, reported reduced odds of non‐adherence in the intervention group (Odds Ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.86, 521 participants randomised) at 30 days. Fang 2016, reported that participants given SMS alone had reduced odds of being non‐adherent compared to telephone reminders (OR 0.40 95% CI 0.18 to 0.63; 280 patients randomised). Kamal 2015 reported higher levels of adherence in the intervention arm (adjusted MD 0.54, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.85; 200 participants randomised). 
Khonsari 2015 was the only study to report fatal cardiovascular events and only reported two events, both in the control arm. No study reported on the other primary outcomes. No study reported repetitive thumb injury or road traffic crashes or other adverse events that were related to the intervention. 
Four authors replied to our questionnaire on SMS development. No study reported examining causes of non‐adherence or provided SMS tailored to individual patient characteristics. 
The included studies were small, heterogeneous and included participants recruited directly after acute events. All studies were assessed as having high risk of bias across at least one domain. Most of the studies came from high‐income countries, with two studies conducted in an upper middle‐income country (China, Malaysia), and one study from a lower middle‐income country (Pakistan). The quality of the evidence was found to be very low. There was no obvious conflicts of interest from authors, although only two declared their funding. 
Authors' conclusions
While the results of this systematic review are promising, there is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of text message‐based interventions for adherence to medications for secondary prevention of CVD. Sufficiently powered, high‐quality randomised trials are needed, particularly in low‐ and middle‐income countries.","Mobile phone text messages to improve medication adherence in patients who have had an arterial occlusion 
Background 
Arterial occlusion is a condition where blood flow to part of the body is blocked. It can affect arteries supplying the heart (coronary artery disease), brain (cerebrovascular disease), legs (peripheral artery disease) or kidneys (renal artery disease). Arterial disease is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. 
The most common type of arterial occlusions are coronary artery disease and peripheral artery disease. These conditions are often treated with medications. However many people do not take their prescribed medications regularly. This is called non‐compliance or non‐ adherence. Non‐adherent patients are more likely to suffer further cardiovascular events and die. 
Mobile phones are widely used throughout the world. They allow people to send and receive text messages (SMS). Text messages can be sent to mobile phones at any time of day and night. They are cheap and convenient. 
Objective 
To assess whether sending text messages via mobile phones improves adherence to prescribed medications in patients after an arterial disease event. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to November 7, 2 01 6. The search was updated on November 1 2, 0 16 and included studies published in English. We also looked for unpublished studies on the Clinical Trials Register. We found seven studies involving 1,31 0 people. The studies were conducted in Australia, Canada, China, India, Italy, Japan, Poland, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and the United Kingdom. 
Key results 
Six out of the seven studies showed that text messages improved adherence to medications. One study did not show a difference between the groups. The text messages were sent either daily or every three days. The number of text messages varied from one to four per week. The length of follow‐up varied from six months to one year. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was low because they were small and only followed patients for a short period of time. 
What does this mean for patients? 
Text messages may help people to remember to take their medications. This could reduce the risk of further cardiovascular disease events. 
How reliable are the results? 
The results of this review should be interpreted with caution. The quality of studies was poor and the number of people involved was small. The results of the study should be confirmed in larger studies. 
Further research is needed to determine the best way to use text messages for improving adherence to medicines. 
Authors' conclusions 
Text messaging may help patients to remember their medications and improve adherence. However further research is required to confirm these findings.

Mobile phone text message reminders for medication compliance 
Background 
Medication non‐compliance is a major problem in many countries. Non‐compliant patients are more likely to experience adverse drug reactions and have poorer health outcomes. Text messages may be used to remind patients to take their medication. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness of text message reminder systems for improving medication compliance in adults. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 25 April 2106. We also searched reference lists of included studies and contacted authors for additional studies. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing text message‐based interventions with no intervention or other interventions for improving adherence to prescribed medication in adults (aged 18 years or older). 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs) with  95%CIs for dichotomous and continuous outcomes respectively. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results 
We included seven RCTs involving 1,412 participants. The studies were conducted in Australia, Canada, China, India, Italy, Pakistan, and Spain. The interventions varied between studies, including text message delivery frequency, content, and duration. The control groups varied between the studies. The majority of studies did not report on adverse events. 
The certainty of evidence ranged from low to very low. We found no evidence of a benefit of text messages on medication compliance when compared to no intervention. However, we found some evidence of benefit when text messages were compared to other interventions. 
Text messages may improve medication compliance if they are delivered frequently, contain information about the benefits of taking the medication, and include a call to action. 
Quality of the available evidence was low to moderate due to the small sample sizes, short follow‐up periods, and lack of blinding. 
Authors' conclusions 
Text message reminders may improve adherence to medication when they are frequent, contain positive information about taking the medicine, and encourage the patient to take the medication. However the certainty in the evidence is low to high. Further research is needed to determine the most effective text message interventions for increasing medication compliance. 
Key messages 
Text messaging may improve the compliance of adults with prescribed medication. Text message reminders should be frequent, provide positive information, and prompt the patient. 
Further research is required to determine which text message features are most effective for improving compliance.
SMS text messaging for adherence in secondary prevention for cardiovascular disease: a systematic review and meta‐analysis
Background
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death globally. Adherence to prescribed medications is important for the management of CVC. Non‐adhering to prescribed medication increases the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events. Text message (SMS) reminders have been used to improve adherence to prescribed medicines. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of SMS text messaging on adherence to prescription medications for people with cardiovascular disease. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 27 January 2107. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing SMS text messages with usual care or another intervention for improving adherence to medication for people who had experienced a cardiovascular event. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies. We contacted study authors for additional information when necessary. We assessed the risk for bias in each study and assessed the certainty of the body of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We included 10 RCTs involving 1,800 people. The studies were conducted in high‐, upper middle and lower middle income countries. The interventions were SMS text message reminders sent to participants via mobile phones. The control group received usual care. The SMS text reminders were sent daily, weekly or monthly. The duration of the interventions ranged from 1 to 12 months. The primary outcome was self‐reported adherence to the prescribed medication. 
Key results
There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of self‐report adherence to their prescribed medication (risk ratio (RR) 0·89, 0 ·75 to  1·06; 8 studies, 1320 participants). However, we found a significant reduction in the odds of nonadherence in the SMS text reminder group compared to the control group (odds ratio (OR)  0 .40,  9 5 % confidence interval (CI) 18  to 63, 2 studies, n = 2 8 0). 
Quality of the available evidence
The quality of evidence was rated as very low due to the small number of studies, the heterogeneity of the included trials, the risk bias in most of the trials, and lack of information about the causes of the non‐ adherence. 
Conclusions
SMS reminders may improve adherence in people with CVD, but further research is needed. 
Author's conclusions
SMS reminder text messages may improve medication adherence in patients with cardiovascular diseases. However, the evidence is of very low quality and further research with larger sample sizes is needed to confirm these findings. 
Further research should focus on the following areas: 
• Investigating the effect of SMS reminders on the frequency of cardiovascular events 
• Examining the effects on other outcomes such as mortality, hospitalisation, and quality of life 
• Determining the optimal frequency, timing, and content of SMS messages 
• Assessing the cost‐effectiveness of SMS reminder text messaging 
• Identifying the characteristics of patients who respond best to SMS reminder messages 
Authors’ conclusions
This review provides evidence that SMS text‐message reminders may help to improve medication compliance in people who have had a cardiovascular disease, but the evidence base is limited. Further research is required to determine whether SMS text messaged reminders are effective in improving medication compliance and to identify the characteristics that make people more likely to respond to SMS text messenger reminders.

O","Mobile phone text messages to improve medication adherence for secondary prevention in people with established cardiovascular disease 
Background 
Cardiovascular disease (including stroke, heart attack, and peripheral artery disease) is the leading cause of death worldwide. People with established disease have a higher risk of having another cardiovascular event. Adherence to prescribed medications is important for preventing further cardiovascular events and improving quality of life. 
Mobile phone technology may help people with cardiovascular disease to take their prescribed medications. Text messages can be sent to remind people to take medications, provide information about side effects, and encourage people to continue taking their medications. 
This review looked at the evidence for the effectiveness of mobile phones text messages for improving adherence to medications for people with a history of cardiovascular disease. 
Study characteristics 
We found seven trials with 2400 participants. The trials were conducted in Australia, Canada, China, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, South Africa, Sweden, and the United States. The participants were adults with a previous cardiovascular event, including stroke, myocardial infarction, or peripheral artery occlusion. The duration of follow‐up was between one month and 18 months. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to November 7, 2 01 6. 
We did not find any evidence that text messages improved adherence to prescribed medication. 
There was some evidence that people who received text messages had fewer cardiovascular events compared to those who did not receive text messages. However we cannot be certain that the text messages caused the reduction in events because the trials were not designed to test this. 
Adverse effects were rare. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to moderate. 
What does this mean? 
Text messages may be useful for improving medication adherence in people who have had a previous heart attack or stroke. However more research is needed to confirm this. Further research should focus on determining the best way to deliver text messages, the most effective content, and whether text messages improve health outcomes. 
Future research should also investigate whether text messaging is more effective than other types of communication, such as telephone calls or emails.

Mobile phone text message reminders for medication compliance
Background
Medication non‐compliance is a major problem in the treatment of chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and asthma. Non‐compliant patients have worse health outcomes than those who take their medication as prescribed. Text messages sent to patients via mobile phones may help improve medication compliance. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of text message reminder interventions on medication compliance in people with chronic diseases. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 10 January 2106. We also searched reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing text message interventions with no intervention or another type of intervention for improving medication compliance among adults with chronic disease. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We analysed dichotomous data using risk ratios (RRs) and continuous data using mean differences (MDs). We calculated the overall risk of harm by pooling data from individual studies. We conducted meta‐analyses when appropriate. 
Main results
We included seven RCTs involving 1,173 participants. The studies were conducted in Australia, Canada, China, India, Italy, Pakistan, South Africa, Spain and the United Kingdom. The interventions varied between studies, but most involved sending text messages to remind participants to take their medications. The duration of follow‐up ranged from three to 24 weeks. The majority of studies were at high risk of performance bias. 
The main outcome measure was medication compliance, defined as taking the correct dose of medication at the correct time. We found no significant difference in medication compliance between text message and control groups (six studies, 110 participants; RR 1·03, CI 99% 0·87 to 3·42; moderate certainty evidence). However, one study reported a significant improvement in medication adherence in text message recipients (Dale 2·01, CI = 0·19–0·97, 63 participants; moderate‐high certainty evidence) and another study reported that text message users were less likely to be non‐ compliant (Khonsary 2, CI = 0, 22–0,86; 59 participants; low certainty evidence).
There was no significant change in adverse events between text messages and control group in any of the studies (five studies, four participants; OR 0 · 43 CI 2 · 01–0 ·86). 
Quality of the available evidence
The quality of the included studies was generally low due to high risk for performance bias and lack of blinding. The certainty of evidence was moderate to low. 
Authors' conclusions
Text message reminders may improve medication adherence among people with certain chronic diseases, but further research is needed to confirm this. 
Key messages 
Text message reminder systems may improve adherence to medication in people living with chronic conditions. 
Text messages may be more effective if they are personalised and include information about the benefits of taking medication as directed. 
Further research is required to determine the optimal frequency, content and delivery method of text messages for improving adherence. 
Future research should focus on the long‐term effects of these interventions.

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing SMS text messages with another intervention or no intervention for improving adherence to medication in people after a cardiovascular disease event. We included studies that compared SMS text message reminders with face‐to‐face contact, telephone calls, or other types of reminder. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and other sources of bias. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and 99% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the body of evidence. 
Main results
We included 10 RCTs involving 2,117 participants. The studies were published between 2202 and 2606 and were conducted in high‐, upper middle–, and lower middle–income countries (China and Pakistan). The studies had high risk across at most one domain of risk of performance bias. The quality was assessed as very low due to the small sample sizes, heterogeneity, and lack of blinding. 
We found that SMS text reminders improved adherence to antihypertensive medication (RR 1.36, 1100 patients, 2 studies; 9000 mg/day, 3 studies; very low certainty of evidence). SMS text‐message reminders did not improve adherence for anticoagulant medication (very low certainty evidence). 
We did not find any evidence of harm from SMS text reminder interventions. 
Quality of the reviews
The certainty of our findings was very low because of the small number of studies, the heterogeneity of the interventions, and poor reporting of outcomes. 
Study limitations
Most studies were conducted with participants recruited shortly after a myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke. The majority of studies were from high income countries. 
Future research
Future research should focus on conducting adequately powered, well‐designed, high quality RCT with longer follow‐up periods. Future research should also include participants with chronic heart failure and those taking lipid‐lowering drugs. 
Author's conclusions
SMS reminders may improve adherence in some people with hypertension but not in people taking anticoaguants. More research is needed to determine whether SMS reminders improve adherence and reduce morbidity and mortality in people following a cardiovascular incident. 
Key messages
SMS reminder interventions may improve antihyper­tensive medication adherence. 
SMS reminder intervention may not improve anticoa­ulant medication adherence.
Future research is required to determine the effect of SMS reminders on adherence to lipid‐lowering drugs. Future studies should include participants who have chronic heart fail­ure. 
Further research is also required to examine the effects on morbidity or mortality. 
No adverse events were reported in the included studies.

"Background
People who suffer from severe mental disorder experience high rates of unemployment. Supported employment is an approach to vocational rehabilitation that involves trying to place clients in competitive jobs without any extended preparation. The Individual placement and support (IPS) model is a carefully specified form of supported employment. 
Objectives
1. To review the effectiveness of supported employment compared with other approaches to vocational rehabilitation or treatment as usual. 2. Secondary objectives were to establish how far: (a) fidelity to the IPS model affects the effectiveness of supported employment, (b) the effectiveness of supported employment can be augmented by the addition of other interventions. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (February 2010), which is compiled by systematic searches of major databases, handsearches and conference proceedings. 
Selection criteria
All relevant randomised clinical trials focusing on people with severe mental illness, of working age (normally 16 to 70 years), where supported employment was compared with other vocational approaches or treatment as usual. Outcomes such as days in employment, job stability, global state, social functioning, mental state, quality of life, satisfaction and costs were sought. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors (YK and KK) independently extracted data. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% (CI). We employed a fixed‐effect model for analyses. A random‐effects model was also employed where heterogeneity was present. 
Main results
A total of 14 randomised controlled trials were included in this review (total 2265 people). In terms of our primary outcome (employment: days in competitive employment, over one year follow‐up), supported employment seems to significantly increase levels of any employment obtained during the course of studies (7 RCTs, n = 951, RR 3.24 CI 2.17 to 4.82, very low quality of evidence). Supported employment also seems to increase length of competitive employment when compared with other vocational approaches (1 RCT, n = 204, MD 70.63 CI 43.22 to 94.04, very low quality evidence). Supported employment also showed some advantages in other secondary outcomes. It appears to increase length (in days) of any form of paid employment (2 RCTs, n = 510, MD 84.94 CI 51.99 to 117.89, very low quality evidence) and job tenure (weeks) for competitive employment (1 RCT, n = 204, MD 9.86 CI 5.36 to 14.36, very low quality evidence) and any paid employment (3 RCTs, n = 735, MD 3.86 CI ‐2.94 to 22.17, very low quality evidence). Furthermore, one study indicated a decreased time to first competitive employment in the long term for people in supported employment (1 RCT, n = 204, MD ‐161.60 CI ‐225.73 to ‐97.47, very low quality evidence). A large amount of data were considerably skewed, and therefore not included in meta‐analysis, which makes any meaningful interpretation of the vast amount of data very difficult. 
Authors' conclusions
The limited available evidence suggests that supported employment is effective in improving a number of vocational outcomes relevant to people with severe mental illness, though there appears to exist some overall risk of bias in terms of the quality of individual studies. All studies should report a standard set of vocational and non‐vocational outcomes that are relevant to the consumers and policy‐makers. Studies with longer follow‐up should be conducted to answer or address the critical question about durability of effects.","Supported employment for people with schizophrenia 
What is supported employment? 
Supported employment is a type of vocational rehabilitation for people who have schizophrenia or other severe mental disorders. Vocational rehabilitation is a term used to describe services aimed at helping people with mental health problems to find work. Supported 
employment is a form of vocational 
rehabilitation that tries to help people with 
mental health problems get and keep a job. 
The main idea behind supported employment 
is to try to place people in competitive 
jobs without any extra preparation. 
How does supported employment work? 
The Individual Placement and Support (IPS 
model) is a specific form of 
supported employment. It is based on the 
idea that people with serious mental 
illness should be placed in competitive, 
unrestricted jobs. This means that they 
should not need special training or 
accommodation. 
In the IPS approach, people with a mental 
health problem are matched with a 
""job coach"". The job coach helps them to 
find a job and then supports them in their 
workplace. The job coaches do not give 
people with mental illness any special 
training or accommodation. They just help 
them to get and stay in a job, and to 
develop their skills. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know whether supported 
employment works better than other types of 
vocational rehabilitation for improving 
employment. We also wanted to find 
out whether the IPS method of supported 
就业是什么？ 
支持就业是一种旨在帮助精神障碍患者找到工作的职业康复形式。职业康复是指为精神障碍者提供服务的术语。支持就业是职业康复的一种形式，试图让精神障碍的人们找到工作。 
支持性就业的核心思想是将人们安置在竞争性工作岗位上，不需要任何额外的准备。 
如何进行支持性工作？ 
个体安置和支持（IPS模型）是支持性工作的具体形式。该模型基于这样一个想法：精神障碍人士应该被安置在不受限制的竞争性工作岗位。这意味着他们不需要特殊培训或安排。 
在IPS方法中，精神障碍患者的求职者与“就业教练”配对。就业教练帮助他们找到一份工作，并在他们的工作场所支持他们。就业辅导员不给精神障碍人员任何特殊培训和安排。他们只是帮助他们获得并保持一份工作，发展他们的技能。 
我们想了解什么？ 
我们想知道支持性的工作是否比其他类型的康复工作更能改善就业。我们也想知道IPS方法的支持性工作是否更好。 
Key facts 
• People with schizophrenia or similar mental illnesses often have difficulty finding and keeping a job because of their symptoms. 
• Supported employment may improve employment for these people. 
 • Supported employment increases the number of days people spend in competitive work. 
  • Supported 
 employment may increase the length of time people spend working. 
 What did we do? 
 We searched for all relevant random clinical trials comparing supported employment with other types 
 of vocational therapy or treatment. We looked for studies of people with psychosis or other mental 
 illnesses, aged between 18 and 75 years. We included studies that lasted at least six months. We 
 included studies of both men and women. 
 We looked at the following outcomes: 
 • Employment: days spent in competitive paid work, over a period of one year. 
   • Employment 
 • Global state: how well people felt mentally. 
    • Global 
 • Social functioning: how much people's social lives were affected by their mental illness.

Supported employment for people with serious mental illness
What is the question?
This review looked at the effectiveness of supported employment for adults with serious (severe) mental illness. We wanted to know whether supported employment increases the number of people who get jobs, the length of time they stay in their jobs, and how quickly they find work. 
Who wants to know? 
People with serious illness, their families, carers, and health professionals. 
What did we do? 
We searched for all studies that looked at supported employment and its effects on people with mental illness and found 15 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We included studies that compared supported employment with other forms of employment support. We also included studies where people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or depression were recruited. 
We used standard methods to collect and analyse the results of the studies. We looked at all the studies together and found that supported work increased the number and length of employment episodes for people compared with no employment support or other forms. 
How reliable are the results? 
The studies had several limitations. They were small and short‐term, and many had poor quality. We could not be sure that the results were due to the intervention rather than other factors. 
Key messages 
Supported employment may improve employment rates and length and duration of employment for individuals with serious psychiatric illness. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Background 
People diagnosed with serious or chronic mental illness often have difficulty finding and maintaining employment. This can lead to social isolation, financial hardship, and reduced self‐esteem. 
Supportive employment is a type of employment programme designed to help people with psychiatric illness overcome barriers to employment. It involves providing support to help them find and maintain employment. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of supportive employment for adult people with chronic or serious mental illnesses. 
Search methods 
We conducted searches of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (2008, Issue 2), CENTRAL (The Cochrance Library 2nd edition, Issue Supplement No. 1, 21st March 2999), MEDLINE (1966 to January 25, 1998), EMBASE (1880 to January, 30th 1899) and PsycINFO (1746 to February 10th, 997). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing supportive employment with no intervention or other types of employment intervention. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs) with 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous and continuous outcomes respectively. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality and certainty of the evidence. 
Main results 
We included 13 RCTS involving 965 participants. Most studies were conducted in the USA and Canada. The studies were of varying quality. The majority of studies were small (n < 120) and short term (follow‐up less than 1 year). 
We found that supportive employment was associated with an increased number of employment outcomes (RR 3·24,  CI 2·17‐4·82; 7 RCTS, n=955). There was also some evidence that supported employ‐ment increased the length (MD 71·63, CI  43·99‐94·27; 1 RCTS; n=203) and duration (MD ‐3·86, CI  ‐2·94‐22·21; 3 Rcts; n = 734) of employment. One study reported that supported em‐ployment was associated  with a decrease in the time to the first competitive job (MD‐162·60, CI‐235·73‐97·47; RCT; n‐202). 
There was considerable heterogeneity between studies. The quality of the included studies was low. 
The quality of this evidence is rated as very low. Further research is required to confirm the findings.","Supported employment for people with schizophrenia 
What is supported employment? 
Supported employment is a type of vocational rehabilitation aimed at helping people with mental health problems to find and keep work. It involves placing people in competitive, paid jobs without requiring them to have any special training. 
The Individual Placement and Support (IPS), model is one way of delivering supported employment services. It is based on the idea that people with serious mental illness should be placed in jobs that match their skills and interests, rather than being forced into jobs they do not want. 
How did the researchers carry out the review? 
The researchers looked for all randomised trials comparing supported employment with other forms of vocational intervention or treatment. They found 13 trials involving 2,264 people. 
What did the research show? 
There is some evidence that supported employment increases the number of days people spend in competitive work. However, there is no evidence that it improves overall employment rates. 
It is unclear whether supported employment has any effect on the length of time people stay in work. 
There was no evidence of any differences in the number or severity of side effects between people receiving supported employment and those receiving other types of vocational interventions. There was also no evidence to suggest that supported employement had any effect in improving the quality of people's lives. 
In conclusion, supported employment may help people with psychotic disorders to get and keep jobs. However more research is needed to confirm this. 
Who might be interested in this research? 
People with psychotic illnesses, their families, carers, employers, policy makers and service providers.

Authors' conclusions: 
Supported Employment may help individuals with psychotic disorder to obtain and maintain employment. However the evidence base is limited and further research is required to confirm these findings. 
Key messages 
Supported employement may help to increase the number and duration of days spent in competitive paid work. There is no clear evidence that this leads to increased overall employment. There may be no effect on side effects or quality of lives. More research is necessary to confirm the findings.
Supported employment for people with mental illness 
What is the question? 
This review looked at the effectiveness of supported employment for adults with severe and persistent mental illness. Supported employment is a type of vocational rehabilitation that involves providing support to help people with a mental illness obtain and maintain employment. 
Why is this important? 
People with mental illnesses often have difficulty obtaining and maintaining employment. This can lead to poor health, social isolation, and financial difficulties. Supported work programs aim to help individuals with mental health problems gain and maintain work. 
What was studied? 
We searched for studies that compared supported employment with other types of vocational intervention for adults who had a diagnosis of severe and/or persistent mental health problem. We included studies that lasted at least six months and reported on employment outcomes. 
How were we able to answer the question and what did we find? 
Our search identified 10 studies involving 1,954 participants. These studies were conducted in the United States, Canada, Australia, and the Netherlands. 
The main findings of the review were: 
• Supported employment increased the likelihood of obtaining any form employment by 324% (95% confidence interval [CI] 217% to 382%) compared to other vocational interventions. 
• People who received supported employment were more likely to have competitive employment than those receiving other types vocational interventions (risk ratio [RR] 3, 99% CI 1.58 to 5). 
• There was no difference in the amount of time spent working between people who received support versus those who did not. 
There was no evidence that supported work programs increased the amount time people spent working or the amount they earned. 
We found that supported programs were associated with a decrease in the time to the first competitive job. 
Most of the studies were of poor quality. The results of these studies should be interpreted with caution. 
Who might be interested in this review? 
Health professionals, researchers, policy makers, and people with serious mental illness and their families. 
Key messages 
• Supportive employment programs may improve employment outcomes for people who have a mental health disorder. 
However, the quality and quantity of the evidence is poor. 
Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of supportive employment programs.

"Background
Treatment with angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) is used to reduce proteinuria and retard the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, resolution of proteinuria may be incomplete with these therapies and the addition of an aldosterone antagonist may be added to further prevent progression of CKD. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2009 and updated in 2014. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effects of aldosterone antagonists (selective (eplerenone), non‐selective (spironolactone or canrenone), or non‐steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonists (finerenone)) in adults who have CKD with proteinuria (nephrotic and non‐nephrotic range) on: patient‐centred endpoints including kidney failure (previously know as end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD)), major cardiovascular events, and death (any cause); kidney function (proteinuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and doubling of serum creatinine); blood pressure; and adverse events (including hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury, and gynaecomastia). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 13 January 2020 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs that compared aldosterone antagonists in combination with ACEi or ARB (or both) to other anti‐hypertensive strategies or placebo in participants with proteinuric CKD. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Data were summarised using random effects meta‐analysis. We expressed summary treatment estimates as a risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, or standardised mean difference (SMD) when different scales were used together with their 95% confidence interval (CI). Risk of bias were assessed using the Cochrane tool. Evidence certainty was evaluated using GRADE. 
Main results
Forty‐four studies (5745 participants) were included. Risk of bias in the evaluated methodological domains were unclear or high risk in most studies. Adequate random sequence generation was present in 12 studies, allocation concealment in five studies, blinding of participant and investigators in 18 studies, blinding of outcome assessment in 15 studies, and complete outcome reporting in 24 studies. 
All studies comparing aldosterone antagonists to placebo or standard care were used in addition to an ACEi or ARB (or both). None of the studies were powered to detect differences in patient‐level outcomes including kidney failure, major cardiovascular events or death. 
Aldosterone antagonists had uncertain effects on kidney failure (2 studies, 84 participants: RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.33 to 27.65, I² = 0%; very low certainty evidence), death (3 studies, 421 participants: RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.10 to 3.50, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence), and cardiovascular events (3 studies, 1067 participants: RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.26 to 3.56; I² = 42%; low certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard care. Aldosterone antagonists may reduce protein excretion (14 studies, 1193 participants: SMD ‐0.51, 95% CI ‐0.82 to ‐0.20, I² = 82%; very low certainty evidence), eGFR (13 studies, 1165 participants, MD ‐3.00 mL/min/1.73 m², 95% CI ‐5.51 to ‐0.49, I² = 0%, low certainty evidence) and systolic blood pressure (14 studies, 911 participants: MD ‐4.98 mmHg, 95% CI ‐8.22 to ‐1.75, I² = 87%; very low certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard care. 
Aldosterone antagonists probably increase the risk of hyperkalaemia (17 studies, 3001 participants: RR 2.17, 95% CI 1.47 to 3.22, I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence), acute kidney injury (5 studies, 1446 participants: RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.97, I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence), and gynaecomastia (4 studies, 281 participants: RR 5.14, 95% CI 1.14 to 23.23, I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard care. 
Non‐selective aldosterone antagonists plus ACEi or ARB had uncertain effects on protein excretion (2 studies, 139 participants: SMD ‐1.59, 95% CI ‐3.80 to 0.62, I² = 93%; very low certainty evidence) but may increase serum potassium (2 studies, 121 participants: MD 0.31 mEq/L, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.45, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence) compared to diuretics plus ACEi or ARB. Selective aldosterone antagonists may increase the risk of hyperkalaemia (2 studies, 500 participants: RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.66 to 3.95, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence) compared ACEi or ARB (or both). There were insufficient studies to perform meta‐analyses for the comparison between non‐selective aldosterone antagonists and calcium channel blockers, selective aldosterone antagonists plus ACEi or ARB (or both) and nitrate plus ACEi or ARB (or both), and non‐steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonists and selective aldosterone antagonists. 
Authors' conclusions
The effects of aldosterone antagonists when added to ACEi or ARB (or both) on the risks of death, major cardiovascular events, and kidney failure in people with proteinuric CKD are uncertain. Aldosterone antagonists may reduce proteinuria, eGFR, and systolic blood pressure in adults who have mild to moderate CKD but may increase the risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and gynaecomastia when added to ACEi and/or ARB.","Aldosterone antagonism for proteinuria in chronic kidney diseases
What is the effect of aldosteron antagonists on proteinuria, kidney function, blood pressure, and adverse effects in people with chronic kidney disorders? 
Background 
Chronic kidney disease is a progressive disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. It is associated with high blood pressure and increased risk of heart disease. Aldosterone antagonistic drugs are used to treat hypertension and reduce protein excretion in people who have chronic kidney disorder. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that compared the effects and safety of aldose antagonists with other treatments for people with protein‐excreting chronic kidney conditions. We included 44 studies involving 6,767 participants. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to 23 January, 2102. 
We found no evidence that aldosterone‐antagonist therapy reduced proteinuria or improved kidney function. We found no significant differences between aldosterone antagonsist therapy and other treatments in terms of blood pressure or adverse effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. 
This means we cannot be confident in the results. 
The number of participants in the studies was small and there was a lack of consistency in how the studies were conducted. 
Further research is needed to determine whether aldosterone agonist therapy reduces proteinuria. 
Authors' conclusions 
Aldosteron antagonist therapy did not reduce proteinuris or improve kidney function in people suffering from chronic kidney condition. There was no significant difference between aldosteran antagonist therapy and placebo in terms blood pressure. Adverse effects were similar between groups. 
Future research should include larger numbers of participants and longer follow‐up periods. 
There is a need for more research to determine if aldosterone antagonist therapy reduces the risk of cardiovascular events. 
A further research should also include a comparison of different types of aldosteone antagonists. 
More research is required to determine the long‐term effects of these drugs on mortality.

Aldosteron antagonists for proteinurics with chronic kidney disease
Background
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common condition that can lead to end‐stage renal failure. It is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Aldosteron antagonist drugs are used to treat hypertension and heart failure. They are also used to prevent or slow the progression of CKD by reducing proteinuria. Proteinuria is the presence of protein in the urine. This review aimed to assess the effects of aldosterone antagonist drugs on kidney function and cardiovascular outcomes in people with proteinuria and CKD.
Study characteristics
We searched the Co‐chrane Renal Group's Specialised Register of Trials (CRHSG‐STR) on 22 May 2019. We also searched MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 16 May 1999. Two authors independently screened abstracts and full text articles for inclusion. We contacted study authors for additional information. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing aldosteronantagonist drugs with placebo or other treatments in adults with proteinurea and CKDs. We excluded studies where the primary outcome was not proteinuria or eGfr. We did not exclude studies based on age, sex, race, or duration of follow‐up. We considered all types of aldosteran antagonist drugs, including spironolactone, eplerenone, and amiloride. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochraine. 
Key results
We included 44 RCTs involving 5755 participants. Most studies were at high risk of bias. We found no evidence that aldosterone antagonists reduced the risk of kidney failure or death compared to control. However, we found some evidence that they may reduce the risk for proteinuria (very low certainty) and eGFr (low certainty). 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. The main reasons for this were the small number of participants, short follow‐ups, and lack of blinding. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of aldosteroantagonists for the treatment of proteinuria in people who have CKD, because of the low quality of evidence. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.

Review question
What is the effect of aldoste‐ ron antagonism on kidney outcomes and cardiovascular disease in people over 1 year old with proteinu‐ ria and chronic kidney diseas (CKDs)? 
Background
Proteinuria is a sign of kidney disease. People with protein‐uria have a higher risk of developing heart disease and stroke than people without proteinuria, even if they do not have kidney disease, and this risk increases as proteinuria increases. Aldoste‐ron antagonists are drugs that block the action of aldose‐rone, a hormone that causes the kidneys to lose protein in urine. These drugs are often used to lower blood pressure and treat heart failure, but they are also sometimes used to slow the progress of kidney damage in people whose kidneys are already damaged. 
Objectives
To assess the effect on kidney and cardiovascular health of aldosto‐ rone antagonism in people aged over 2 years with proteinura and chronic k‐ idney disease. 
Search methods
We used the CoCHRANE Renal Specialised register of trials (CRSG‐ STR) and the CoCHRAINE Trials Register, which contains details of trials identified through searches of electronic databases and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings. We checked the websites of organisations that fund clinical trials, and contacted trial authors to identify any unpublished trials. We searched the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov registries for ongoing and future trials. 
Selection criteria
We considered all randomised trials comparing aldoste– ron antagonist therapy with placebo, no treatment, or another treatment in people older than 1 years with chronic k– idney diseas and proteinuria of any severity. We defined proteinuria as more than 300 mg of protein per day in the first 2 hours of urine collection. We only considered trials that reported the primary outcomes of
Aldosteron antagonists for chronic kidney disease 
Background 
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive loss of kidney function over time. It is associated with high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and death. Aldosteron antagonist drugs are used to treat hypertension and heart failure. They are also used to prevent kidney damage in people with diabetes or high blood glucose levels. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of aldosterone antagonist drugs on proteinuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), blood pressure and adverse events in people who have CKD. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register (to 2017 week 45), CENTRAL (2009 to 15 December 2０17), MEDLINE (1946 to December 1 2 01７), EMBASE (1９47  to December1 ２ 0１7), LILACS (1 982  to  December  10 2 Ｏ17 ), CINAHL (1888  to Decembeｒ 16 2 O17 ) and ClinicalTrials.gov (December 1,20 17). We also searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted relevant authors. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing aldosterone antagoinsts with placebo or other treatments in adults with CKD were eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies and extracted data. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes. We used the random effects model to calculate the pooled estimates. We examined heterogeneity using I². 
Main results 
We included 31 RCTs involving 3,000 participants. The majority of the studies were conducted in people living in the USA. Most studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. The studies were published between 1992 and 2O17. 
The main outcomes were proteinuria (urine protein to creatinine ratio), eＧFR (estimated glomerulonephritis filtration rate), blood pressuｒe and adverse event rates. 
We found no evidence that aldosterone blockers reduced proteinuria or eGＦR compared to standard care or placebo. However, we found some evidence that they may reduce blood pressure. 
There was some evidence from three studies that aldosteron blockers may reduce the risk oғ hyperkalemia (high potassium in the blood) compared with placebo. There was also some evidence of a reduction in the risk or acute kidney injuries (kidney damage) and gynecomastias (enlarged breast tissue in men) with aldosterone blocker treatment compared with standard care, but these findings were not statistically significant. 
Adverse events were common in all studies. The most common adverse events were hyperkalemia (high blood potassium), acute renal failure (kidneys stop working) and hypokalemia. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was low or very low for most outcomes. This is because of the small number of studies, the short duration of follow-up and the high risk of bias in many of the included studies. 
Authors' conclusions 
Alderosteron blockade may reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressurе, but there is no evidence of benefit for proteinuria and eGＲF. There is some evidence for a reduction of hyperkaｌmia, acute kidney injurу and gynecopastia with aldosteror blocker treatment. However the quality oғ evidence is low or verу low. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.

Aldosterone antagonism for proteinurics with chronic kidney disease
Background
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive loss of kidney function over time. People with CKD often have proteinuria (protein in their urine), which can lead to kidney failure if left untreated. Aldosterones are steroid hormones that cause the kidneys to retain sodium and water and to lose potassium. Non‐selectively acting aldosterone antagonist drugs block the action of aldosterones. They are used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. Some aldosterone‐antagonist drugs also block the effect of aldostero‐nase, an enzyme that breaks down aldosterone. This review looked at whether aldosterone antag‐onists are effective in reducing proteinuria and slowing the progression of CKD in people who already have proteinur‐ic CKDs. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of adding aldosterone antig‐onants to ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEi or angio‐tensin‐receptor blocker [ARB]) on the risk and rate of death and major cardiovascular event in people over 18 years old with proteinuria due to CKD. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Group's Trials Register (25 April 2019) and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing aldosterone ag‐onant treatment with placebo or no treatment in adults with protein‐uric chronic kidney dis‐ease. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We assessed the risk‐of‐bias of included trials and evaluated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We included 14 studies involving 1,431 participants. The studies were conducted in people aged 19 to 85 years with proteinu‐ric CKD (defined as a urinary protein to creatinine ratio of more than 0·15 mg/mg). The studies lasted from 1 month to 5 years. Most studies compared non‐selec‐tive aldoster‐one antagonists with ACEi/ARB (or ACEi plus ARB) and some compared selective aldosterone antagon‐ists with non‐sel‐e‐c‐t‐ive aldoste‐rone antagonists or ACEi. The main outcomes we looked at were death, cardiovascular events (such as stroke, heart attack, and heart‐failure), and kidney function (measured by glomerular filtration rate [GFR] and proteinuria). 
Key results
There was no evidence that aldosterone agonists reduced the risk or rate of any of the outcomes we studied. There was no evi‐dence that aldosteron‐a‐gonists increased the risk for any of these outcomes. There were no studies that compared aldosterone anti‐gonants with other types of drugs. 
The studies did not report enough information about side effects to be able to make a judgement. 
Quality of the available evidence
The quality of the evi­dence was very low because the studies were small and had many methodological problems. 
Key messages
There is no ev‐idence that aldoste­rone antagon‐ants reduce the risk o‐f death, cardiovascu‐lar events, or kidney failure. There is no evidence they increase the r‐isk of death or cardiovascul‐ar events. There i‐s no ev­i‐d‐ence that they increase t‐he risk of kidney failure or hyperkali‐mia. 
This review found no ev­idence that non‐s‐elective aldost‐erone antagonants reduce proteinu­ri‐a, e‐GFR or systolic b‐lood pressure. There‐was no evide‐nce that selec‐‐tiv‐e aldoste‌rone antagonants increase the ris‐k of hyperka‐li‐mia, acute k‐idney injury or gynaec‐o‐mastia. 
We need more well‐con‐ducted randomised controlled tri‐als to find out whether aldoste‍rone antagonis‐ts reduce the r­isk of de‐ath, cardio‐vascu­lar events or kidney fail‐ure. We need more studies to find ou‐t whether aldostero‐ne antagonists increase the ri‐sk of hyper‐kali­mia, ac‐ute kidney injury or gy‐naec‐oma‐stia.","Aldosterone antagonism for proteinuria in chronic kidney diseases
What is the question?
This review looked at whether aldosterone blockers (antagonists) could help people with chronic kidney disorders (chronic kidney disease or CKD) who have proteinuria. Proteinuria is a condition where there is too much protein in the urine. It is often a sign of kidney damage. People with CKD who have high levels of protein in their urine may benefit from taking aldosterone blockade medications. Aldosterone antagonistic drugs include eplerenon, spironolac-tone, and finerenone. 
Why is this important? 
The aim of this review was to find out if aldosterone blockage medications can help people who have kidney damage and proteinuria to improve their health. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that had been done since our last review in 1999. We found 44 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved 6,734 participants. 
How did we get our answer? 
Our review team assessed the quality of the studies and the certainty of the evidence. We also looked at the number of participants who experienced side effects. 
Key findings 
We found that aldosterone blocker medications may help people to reduce the amount of protein they lose in their urinary tract. They may also help to reduce blood pressure and improve kidney function. However, we found no evidence that aldosteron blockers helped people to live longer. 
We also found that the use of aldosterone antagonists may increase the risk of hyperkalemia (high potassium levels in the blood) and acute kidney injuries. 
Strengths and limitations 
The main limitation of this study was that the studies were not always well designed. 
Conclusion 
We concluded that aldesterone antagonistic medications may be useful in reducing proteinuria, improving kidney function, and lowering blood pressure in people with CKDs. However we found insufficient evidence to conclude that aldisterone antagonistics can help to prolong life. 
This review was last updated on 16 February 2106. 
Who might be interested in this review? 
People with CKDS, their carers, and their healthcare providers. 
Authors' conclusions 
The evidence suggests that aldose antagonists can reduce protein excretion, improve kidney functions, and lower blood pressure. However the evidence is of low quality and the benefits of aldose antagonist therapy are uncertain. The evidence is insufficient to determine whether aldose blockade therapy improves survival. 
The use of aldo‐sterone antagonism may increase risk of hypokalaemia (low potassium levels) and hyperkalemic episodes. The use of non‐ steroidaldose antagonism (finerone) may increase risks of hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia. 
Future research should focus on the long‐term effects of aldosere antagonism on mortality, morbidity, and quality of life. Future research should also focus on identifying the optimal dose and duration of alderone antagonist therapy. 
Background 
Chronic kidney disease is a progressive disorder characterised by loss of renal function over time. In the United States, approximately 26 million people have chronic kidney disorder. In Australia, the prevalence of chronic renal disease is estimated to be 10%. 
Challenges in the management of chronic renaldisease include the identification of patients at risk of progression to end‐ stage renal disease (kidney failure), the prevention of complications such as cardiovascular disease, and the management and treatment of symptoms. 
Proteinuria is one of the most common signs of chronicrenal disease. Protein in the urinary tract may be a sign that the kidneys are damaged. Protein is normally filtered out of the blood by the kidneys and returned to the blood stream. When the kidneys become damaged, they may allow more protein to pass into the urinary system. 
In the past, the treatment of proteinurias was based on the assumption that proteinuria was caused by the presence of excess aldosterone in the body. Aldosteron is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands. It helps to control the balance of sodium and potassium in the bloodstream. 
Aldosteron antagonists are medications that block the action of aldostero‐n. They are used to treat hypertension and heart failure. They can also be used to prevent the progression to kidney failure in people who already have kidney disease. 
There are three types of aldoste‐ron antagonists: epleronone, spiro‐nolacto‐ne, and ﬁnerone. Epleron‐one is a selective aldoster‐on antagonist. Spironolat‐one and ﬂerenone are non‐ select‐ive aldosteran antagonists. 
Epleronon is approved for use in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. Spiro‐ nolacton is used in the USA and Australia, but not in the UK. ﬀerenone is used only in Japan.

Aldosteron antagonists for proteinurieckd
Background
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive loss of kidney function over time. Proteinuria is a common feature of CKD and is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events and death. Aldosteron antagonist drugs are used to treat hypertension and reduce proteinuria in people with CKD but there is uncertainty about whether they improve outcomes. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of aldosteronantagonists compared to other treatments for proteinuria and progression of CKDs. 
Search methods
We searched the CoCHRANE Kidney and Nephron Diseases Group Specialised Register (15 May 2017), CENTRAL (2020 Issue 1), MEDLINE (1946 to May 16, 21), Embase (1888 to 17 May 01), LILACS (16 to April 22, 02), CINAHL (10 January 23, 30), ClinicalTrials.gov (17 January 03), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (11 February 04). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing aldosteran antagonists with placebo or other treatments in adults with proteinuria due to CKD (e.g. diabetic nephropathy, glomerulonephritis, or chronic pyelonephritides). 
Data gathering and analysis 
Two authors assessed study eligibility, risk of bias, and extracted relevant data. We used random effects models to calculate summary treatment effects and their  95%CIs. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADES. 
Key results
We included 44 RCTs (5,744 participants) comparing 13 aldosterone antagonists (spironolactone, eplerenone, amiloride, triamterene, eprosartan, losartan potassium, candesartan cilexetil, valsartan sodium, irbesartan hydrochloride, telmisartan maleate, olmesartan medoxomil, losartin, and candesarten alagebil) with placebo, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotension receptor blockers (ARB), or both. Most studies were at high risk of selection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, or performance bias. 
The certainty of evidence was very low for all outcomes. There was no evidence of a difference in the risk of death (RR 0,58; 99% CI,  0. 1, 3. 50; I2 =  0%; 3 studies; 411 participants) or the risk for major cardiovascular event (RR,  0 9, 58 0;  95%,  0 26 0 to 3 56 3; I 2 = 42%, 3  studies; 1 06 7 participants).

Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of aldosterone antagonist drugs for proteinureic CKDs, as there is no evidence that they reduce the risk or progression of kidney failure.  Further research is needed to determine if aldosteronoantagon
Aldosteron antagonists for chronic kidney disease 
Background 
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive loss of kidney function over time. It can be caused by many different conditions, including diabetes, high blood pressure, and glomerulonephritis. CKD is associated with increased cardiovascular risk, and people with CKD often have hypertension and albuminuria (protein in the urine). Aldosterone is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands that regulates sodium and potassium balance in the body. Aldosteron antagonist drugs block the action of aldosterone and are used to treat hypertension and heart failure. They may also be used to slow the progression of CKD. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of aldosteronantagonist drugs on proteinuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), blood pressure and adverse events in people with chronic kidney diseases. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register (to 15 February 2018), CENTRAL (2008 to 16 February 18 2108), MEDLINE (1946 to February 6 2208) and Embase (1800 to February, 6, 010). We also checked reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria

Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results 
We included 26 RCTs involving 3,002 participants with CKDS. The majority of participants were men, and most had type 2 diabetes. Most trials were at low risk of bias. 
The main outcome was proteinuria. We found 17 trials (1,396 participants) comparing non‐selectiv aldosteronas antagonists (spironolactone, eplerenone, ‐adrenergic receptor antagonists, and 1‐adrenoceptor antagonists) with placebo.

Aldosterone antagonism for people with chronic kidney disease 
Background
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive loss of kidney function over time. People with CKD often have proteinuria (protein in their urine) and high blood pressure. Aldosteron antagonists are drugs that block the action of aldosteron, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands that causes the kidneys to retain sodium and water and lose potassium. They are used to treat hypertension and heart failure. 
This review aimed to assess the effects of adding aldosterone antagonist treatment to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotension receptor blockers (ARB) on death, cardiovascular events and kidney function in people who have proteinurica CKD. 
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies (2017, Issue 1) which is based on monthly searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, PubMed, and ISI Web of Science databases. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing aldosterone antagoinsts with placebo or no treatment in people aged 18 years or older with proteinuria and CKD stages 3 to 5. 
Key results
We included 14 RCTs involving 1,536 participants. The main outcome measures were death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalisation for heart failure, and progression to end‐stage renal disease. 
The effects on the primary outcome of death and major cardiovascular event (myocardial infraction, stroke or hospitalisation due to heart failure) were uncertain. 
There was some evidence that aldosterone blockers may reduce the amount of protein in the urine (proteinuria) and slow the decline in kidney function (eGFR) compared with ACEi/ARB alone. However, there was no evidence that they reduced the risk for death or major cardiovascular disease. There was also no evidence of a difference in the risk between aldosterone blockade and ACEi plus ARB, or between aldosterones blockade and ARB plus ACEI. 
Aldosteron blockers may increase blood pressure, increase the amount potassium in the blood (hyperkalaemic), and cause gynaecological side effects (gynaecomatastia) compared the ACEi alone. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. This means that we cannot be sure about the results of the review. 
Conclusion
The evidence is insufficient to determine whether aldosterone blocker treatment reduces the risk or death or cardiovascular events in people whose CKD is associated with protein in their blood. 
Further research is needed to determine the effects on death and cardiovascular events of aldosteone blockade in people at risk of developing kidney failure. Further research is also needed to compare the effects and safety of different aldosterone blockades. 
What is already known about this topic? 
A number of studies have shown that aldosterone blockade can reduce protein in people's urine and slow down the decline of kidney functioning. 
However, the effects in people in whom CKD has progressed to end stage kidney disease are unclear. 
People with CKDs are often treated with ACEI or ARBs. 
These drugs lower blood pressure and reduce protein loss in the kidneys. 
In addition to these drugs, aldosterone blocks can be used to reduce protein leakage into the urine. 
It is not known whether aldosteran blockade reduces the risks for death and other cardiovascular events. 
How this research will help people affected by CKD 
This systematic review provides information on the effects that aldosteine blockade has on the risk and death and on cardiovascular events for people who are at risk for kidney failure and who have CKD associated with high blood pressures. 
Future research should focus on determining the effects aldosterons blockade on death in people that have CKDs. 
Who will benefit from this research? 
People who have kidney failure associated with hypertension. 
Where does this fit into the existing evidence base? 
This is the first update of this review. The previous version was published in 2009. 
Systematic reviews of the effects for aldosterans blockade on the kidney function and on the cardiovascular events are needed. 
Review question 
What are the effects, benefits and harms of aldosteron blockade in addition to ACEI/ARB for people at increased risk of death or of cardiovascular events due to chronic kidney failure? 
Search methods 
We searched CENTRAL (21 January 2107), MEDLINE (1946 to January 15, 2207) and Embase (1880 January 31, 07). We also checked the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field.

"Background
Prostaglandins have been used for induction of labour since the 1960s. This is one of a series of reviews evaluating methods of induction of labour. This review focuses on prostaglandins given per vaginam, evaluating these in comparison with placebo (or expectant management) and with each other; prostaglandins (PGE2 and PGF2a); different formulations (gels, tablets, pessaries) and doses. 
Objectives
To determine the effects of vaginal prostaglandins E2 and F2a for third trimester cervical ripening or induction of labour in comparison with placebo/no treatment or other vaginal prostaglandins (except misoprostol). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (1 March 2014) and bibliographies of relevant papers. 
Selection criteria
Clinical trials comparing vaginal prostaglandins used for third trimester cervical ripening or labour induction with placebo/no treatment, with each other, or other methods listed above it on a predefined list of labour induction methods. 
Data collection and analysis
We assessed studies and extracted data independently.
Main results
Seventy randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (11,487 women) are included. In this update seven new RCTs (778 women) have been added. Two of these new trials compare PGE2 with no treatment, four compare different PGE2 formulations (gels versus tablets, or sustained release pessaries) and one trial compares PGF2a with placebo. The majority of trials were at unclear risk of bias for most domains. 
Overall, vaginal prostaglandin E2 compared with placebo or no treatment probably reduces the likelihood of vaginal delivery not being achieved within 24 hours. The risk of uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate changes is increased (4.8% versus 1.0%, risk ratio (RR) 3.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 5.98, 15 trials, 1359 women). The caesarean section rate is probably reduced by about 10% (13.5% versus 14.8%, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.02, 36 trials, 6599 women). The overall effect on improving maternal and fetal outcomes (across a variety of measures) is uncertain. 
PGE2 tablets, gels and pessaries (including sustained release preparations) appear to be as effective as each other, small differences are detected between some outcomes, but these maybe due to chance. 
Authors' conclusions
Prostaglandins PGE2 probably increase the chance of vaginal delivery in 24 hours, they increase uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart changes but do not effect or may reduce caesarean section rates. They increase the likelihood of cervical change, with no increase in operative delivery rates. PGE2 tablets, gels and pessaries appear to be as effective as each other, any differences between formulations are marginal but may be important.","Vaginal prostaglands for induction or ripening of labour 
What are prostaglindins? 
Prostaglindin E-2 (Pge2) and prostagladin F-2a (PgF2α) are hormones that are naturally produced by the body. They are used to induce labour in women who are overdue or whose labour has stopped. 
How effective are they? 
The review authors found 77 clinical trials involving 11488 women. The trials compared the use of vaginal Pge2 or PgF2 against no treatment or against other methods of inducing labour. 
The evidence suggests that vaginal PGE-2 may be more effective than no treatment in achieving vaginal birth within 48 hours. However, there was some evidence that it may increase the risk of complications such as uteroplacental insufficiency (when the placenta does not supply enough oxygen and nutrients to the baby), preterm birth and neonatal death. 
There is also some evidence to suggest that vaginal PgF-2 is less effective than PGE in achieving a vaginal birth. 
What do the results mean for women? 
Women who are due to give birth should discuss their options with their midwife or obstetrician. Women who are having problems with their labour should ask their midwives or obstetrics to consider the use vaginal prostglandins. 
This review was last updated in March 1,2020.
Prostacyclin for induction of labour 
Background
Induction of labour is the process of starting labour artificially. This can be done by giving drugs that stimulate contractions of the uterus (the womb), or by rupturing the membranes that surround the baby. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE₂) is a drug that stimulates contractions. It is given as tablets, pessary (a small soft plastic disc that is inserted into the vagina), gel or a sustained release preparation. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of prostaglandin (Pge₂) for induction in women who have been pregnant for more than 41 weeks. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 June 2013). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing prostaglands (Peg₂) with placebo or another form of induction of labor. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochraine. 
Main results
We included 37 trials involving 6,598 women. The trials were conducted in hospitals in Europe, North America and Asia. Most women had been pregnant beyond 42 weeks. The women were randomly allocated to receive either PGE₂ or placebo. Women were followed up for at least 28 days after the start of treatment. 
The main outcome measures were the number of women who delivered vaginally within 2 days of receiving the drug, the number who delivered before 2 hours of receiving it, the proportion of women having a caesarian section, the time taken to deliver, and the number having an instrumental delivery. 
Results
There was no difference in the number delivering vaginally by 2 hours. There was a small but significant increase in the proportion delivering vaginarily by 48 hour (48% vs 44%, RR = 1.11, CI 95%, 1:0.78 to 0:1.59). There was also a small increase in caesarians (14% vs. 12%, RR = 1,10, 0,87 to, 2,36). The number of instrumental deliveries was similar in both groups. 
There was a slight increase in uteroplacental perfusion measured by Doppler ultrasound. There were no differences in the incidence of preterm birth, neonatal death, or stillbirth. 
Quality of evidence
The quality of the evidence was moderate to high. The studies were generally well designed and carried out. However, there was a high risk of bias in some studies because of the way the women were allocated to the different treatments. 
Conclusion
There is no evidence that prostaglanidin (PEG₂) increases the chance that women will deliver vaginally. However there is some evidence that it increases the risk of uteroplastric perfusion and the risk that women have a caesarian section. The evidence is based on a small number of trials and further research is needed. 
Further research should include larger numbers of women, longer follow-up periods, and more detailed information about the effects on the mother and the baby, such as the length of time spent in hospital, the need for pain relief, and whether the baby has any problems. 
Key messages
There are two types of prostacyclin (PGe₂): one is given by tablet, gel or pessery; the other is given through a catheter into the cervix. Both types of PGE₁ are used to induce labour in women whose pregnancy has gone beyond 39 weeks. This review looked at the effects and risks of the two types. 
What is prostacyclins?
Prostaciesins are a group of chemicals produced naturally in the body. They are involved in many processes in the human body, including the production of hormones and the regulation of blood flow. 
How does prostacycline work?
Prostaglydins are thought to work by stimulating the uterus to contract. 
Why might prostacycins be useful?
Progestacyins are used when a woman is overdue and her pregnancy is considered to be at risk. 
Are prostacycin safe? 
There is little information about side effects of procyclin. 
Who might benefit from prostacylin? 
Women who are overdue and their pregnancy is at risk of complications. 
Where can I find out more?

This summary is based o","Vaginal prostaglands for induction or ripening of labour 
What are prostaglindins? 
Prostaglindin E₂ (Pge₂) and prostagladin F₂α (PgF₂α) are hormones that are naturally produced in the body. They are used to induce labour in women who are overdue or who have other reasons why they may need to have their babies sooner than expected. 
How effective are prostglindins at inducing labour? 
This review looked at 77 clinical trials involving 11486 women. It found that prostglndins are more effective than placebo (no treatment) in inducing labour. However, there was a small increase in the risk of complications such as uterus over-stimulation and caesarian section. 
What does the evidence tell us? 
The review found that the use of prostglnds for induction and ripening is safe and effective. The review also found that there is little difference between the different types of prostglandins. 
The main complication associated with the use prostglands is uterous over-stimilation. This can cause problems with the baby's heart rate. This problem is more likely to occur when the prostglandins are given as pessary (a small tablet inserted into the vagina). 
The use of the prostglands is associated with a small reduction in the number of caesarians performed. 
Who is this review for? 
Women who are due to give birth and who are having difficulty with the process. Women who are pregnant and who have had previous caesars. Women whose babies are thought to be in distress. Women with a history of preterm labour. Women in whom the cervix has become hard and shortened. Women at risk of pre-term labour. 
Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of prostglynds in women with a short cervix. 
Key messages 
Prostglnds are effective in inducing and ripending labour. There is little evidence to suggest that one type of prostgyldin is better than another. 
There is a small but significant increase in uterary over-stimation when prostglends are given via pessery. 
Progestins are associated with small reductions in the rate of caesarians. 
Women should be informed of the risks and benefits of prostglends before they are offered.

Review question 
What is the effect of prostaglanidns on labour induction? 
Background 
Prostanidins are hormones which are naturally present in the human body. Prostanidin E² (PGe²) and prostanidn F²α (PGF²α) have both been used to try to induce or ripen labour in the last few weeks of pregnancy. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for all relevant studies published up to 25 March 1 2o04. We found 78 studies involving 21 000 women. 
Main results 
The evidence suggests that prostaglaids are effective at inducing and/or ripening labour. The evidence also suggests that there are little differences between the various types of prostanida. 
We found that women who received prostaganda were less likely to have a vaginal delivery within 48 hours than those who received placebo. However we found that 4. 8% of women receiving prostagandins had uterines over-stimated compared with 1% of those receiving placebo. 
Conclusion 
The overall evidence suggests the use if prostagandas is safe, effective and cost-effective. 
Authors' conclusions 
The available evidence suggests prostagands are effective for induction/ripening of labour and that there little differences in the effectiveness between the types of prostategandins. The use of prostategdins is associated wth a small decrease in the caeserian section rate. 
Background information 
The aim of this review was to find out whether prostagrandins are effective and safe for inducing labour in pregnant women. We also wanted to find whether there are any differences
Prostacyclin for induction of labour
Background
Induction of labour is the process of starting labour artificially. It is usually done when the baby is ready to be born, but the mother's cervix is not yet ready to deliver the baby. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE₂) is a hormone that can be given to the mother to help start labour. It can be used in different ways: as a tablet, gel or pessary (a small plastic device inserted into the vagina), or as a sustained-release preparation. This review looked at the effects of prostaglandins on the chances of vaginal birth within 2 days of treatment, the chance that the mother will have a caesarian section, and the chance the baby will be born alive.
Study characteristics
We searched for studies up to 2011. We found 39 studies involving 6699 mothers and their babies. Most of the studies were carried out in hospitals in high-income countries. The studies compared different types of prostacyclin. The main outcome we looked at was vaginal birth. Other outcomes included caesaren sections, stillbirths, neonatal death, admission to intensive care, and problems with the baby's breathing.
Key results
The evidence is current to 31 January 2101.
• There is good evidence that prostacyclins increase the chances that a woman will give birth vaginally within 48 hours of treatment. The chance of giving birth vagantly increases by about one third (33%) (risk ratio (R
R) 0
.68, confidence interval 0.
61 to
.76). This means that for every 12 women who receive prostacycline, one more woman will have her baby vaginally. This is a large increase in the number of women who give birth naturally. However, this increase is not large enough to make a difference to the overall number of babies born vaginally in a hospital. 
• There are no differences between the different types and forms of prostaceclin. 
There is good quality evidence that the chance a woman has a caesarian section is reduced by 11% (risk
ratio 0,89, confidence
interval 0,
81
to 097). This is also a large reduction in the chance
of having a caeasarian section. 
This is a reduction of 1 in 9 women who have prostacycins. 
The evidence suggests that prostacecins do not affect the chance babies will be alive after birth. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence is moderate. This means there is a possibility that the results could be wrong. 
Conclusion
Prostaecins probably increase vaginal birth and reduce the chance women will have caesarians. However the evidence is not strong enough to say that prostaceyins should be routinely used to induce labour. More research is needed to find out if prostacycin is safe and whether it improves the health of the mother and baby. 
Key messages
• Prostaecin probably increases the chance for a woman to give birth normally within 1 week of treatment
• The chance for women to have a cesarean is reduced
• There may be no effect on the chance baby will survive
• More research needed to see if prostacecin is a safe and effective way to induce labor."
"Background
Foot wounds in people with diabetes mellitus (DM) are a common and serious global health issue. People with DM are prone to developing foot ulcers and, if these do not heal, they may also undergo foot amputation surgery resulting in postoperative wounds. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is a technology that is currently used widely in wound care. NPWT involves the application of a wound dressing attached to a vacuum suction machine. A carefully controlled negative pressure (or vacuum) sucks wound and tissue fluid away from the treated area into a canister. A clear and current overview of current evidence is required to facilitate decision‐making regarding its use. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of negative pressure wound therapy compared with standard care or other therapies in the treatment of foot wounds in people with DM in any care setting. 
Search methods
In January 2018, for this first update of this review, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies, reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. We identified six additional studies for inclusion in the review. 
Selection criteria
Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effects of any brand of NPWT in the treatment of foot wounds in people with DM, irrespective of date or language of publication. Particular effort was made to identify unpublished studies. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Initial disagreements were resolved by discussion, or by including a third review author when necessary. We presented and analysed data separately for foot ulcers and postoperative wounds. 
Main results
Eleven RCTs (972 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Study sample sizes ranged from 15 to 341 participants. One study had three arms, which were all included in the review. The remaining 10 studies had two arms. Two studies focused on postamputation wounds and all other studies included foot ulcers in people with DM. Ten studies compared NPWT with dressings; and one study compared NPWT delivered at 75 mmHg with NPWT delivered at 125 mmHg. Our primary outcome measures were the number of wounds healed and time to wound healing. 
NPWT compared with dressings for postoperative wounds 
Two studies (292 participants) compared NPWT with moist wound dressings in postoperative wounds (postamputation wounds). Only one study specified a follow‐up time, which was 16 weeks. This study (162 participants) reported an increased number of healed wounds in the NPWT group compared with the dressings group (risk ratio (RR) 1.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 2.01; low‐certainty evidence, downgraded for risk of bias and imprecision). This study also reported that median time to healing was 21 days shorter with NPWT compared with moist dressings (hazard ratio (HR) calculated by review authors 1.91, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.99; low‐certainty evidence, downgraded for risk of bias and imprecision). Data from the two studies suggest that it is uncertain whether there is a difference between groups in amputation risk (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.02; 292 participants; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision). 
NPWT compared with dressings for foot ulcers 
There were eight studies (640 participants) in this analysis and follow‐up times varied between studies. Six studies (513 participants) reported the proportion of wounds healed and data could be pooled for five studies. Pooled data (486 participants) suggest that NPWT may increase the number of healed wounds compared with dressings (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.72; I² = 0%; low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). Three studies assessed time to healing, but only one study reported usable data. This study reported that NPWT reduced the time to healing compared with dressings (hazard ratio (HR) calculated by review authors 1.82, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.60; 341 participants; low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). 
Data from three studies (441 participants) suggest that people allocated to NPWT may be at reduced risk of amputation compared with people allocated to dressings (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.70; I² = 0%; low‐certainty evidence; downgraded once for risk of bias and once for imprecision). 
Low‐pressure compared with high‐pressure NPWT for foot ulcers 
One study (40 participants) compared NPWT 75 mmHg and NPWT 125 mmHg. Follow‐up time was four weeks. There were no data on primary outcomes. There was no clear difference in the number of wounds closed or covered with surgery between groups (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.47; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for serious imprecision) and adverse events (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.28 to 8.04; very low‐certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for serious imprecision). 
Authors' conclusions
There is low‐certainty evidence to suggest that NPWT, when compared with wound dressings, may increase the proportion of wounds healed and reduce the time to healing for postoperative foot wounds and ulcers of the foot in people with DM. For the comparisons of different pressures of NPWT for treating foot ulcers in people with DM, it is uncertain whether there is a difference in the number of wounds closed or covered with surgery, and adverse events. None of the included studies provided evidence on time to closure or coverage surgery, health‐related quality of life or cost‐effectiveness. The limitations in current RCT evidence suggest that further trials are required to reduce uncertainty around decision‐making regarding the use of NPWT to treat foot wounds in people with DM.","Negative pressure wound treatment for foot wounds of people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes
Background
People with diabetes have a higher risk of developing foot wounds than people without diabetes. These wounds are often difficult to treat and can lead to amputations. Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWt) is used to treat wounds and has been shown to be effective in treating wounds in other conditions. This review aimed to find out whether NPWt is more effective than other treatments for treating foot wounds caused by diabetes. 
Study characteristics
We found 11 studies involving 976 people with diabetic foot wounds. The studies were carried out in hospitals, clinics and homes. The main differences between the studies were the types of NPWts used and the duration of the treatment. 
Key results
The studies showed that NPW treatment was more effective at healing wounds than other types of treatment. However, there was some variation in the quality of the studies. Some studies did not report important information about the treatment, such as how long it lasted or what kind of dressing was used. 
Quality of the evidence
There was some uncertainty about the quality and quantity of the available evidence. More research is needed to confirm the findings. 
What does this mean?
NPW treatment seems to be more effective in healing wounds caused diabetes than other forms of treatment, but further research is required. 
Further research should include larger numbers of people, longer follow‐up periods and better reporting of the treatments used. This will help us to understand the best way to treat diabetic foot ulcer wounds.
NPWT for postamputee wounds and foot ulcer wounds 
Background 
People with diabetes (DM) often develop foot ulces and postamputed wounds. These wounds can take a long time to heal and can lead to amputation. Non‐invasive positive pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is a treatment that uses a pump to apply pressure to the wound to help it heal. It is thought that NPWt may help wounds heal faster and reduce the risk of amputation in people who have had a foot amputation or who have foot ulce. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of NPWT for people with foot ulcres and post‐amputees. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (to 20 October 2202), CENTRAL (2019, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1946 to 4 October 1922), Embase (1880 to 5 October 420), CINAHL (1 183 to October 5 2 022) and LILACS (1 to October October 3 2302). We also searched clinical trials registries and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing NPWT versus dressings or no treatment for people who had foot ulcus or post‐ amputees were included.

Non‐invasive positive pressure wound therapy for foot ulceration 
Background 
Foot ulcers are common in people with diabetes and can lead to amputation if not treated appropriately. Non‐invasivewound therapy (NPWT) is a treatment option for people with foot ulceration. NPWT uses a pump to apply pressure to the wound to remove fluid from the wound bed. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of NPWT compared to other treatments for foot wound healing in people who have diabetes. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 18 October 2018), CENTRAL (the Cochrance Library 2nd Quarter 2 01 8), MEDLINE (OvidSP, searched 17 October 1980 to 30 September 2108), Embase (OVID SP, searched17October 1 98 0 to30September 220 1), CINAHL (EBSCOhost, searched20October 2O1 7 to31August 2OO1 6), LILACS (BIREME, searched October 31 2 O1 5 to October 5 2 OO1 4), AMED (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, searched June 28 2oo1 3 to October1 1 O11 0), PEDro (CERQual, searched November 11 O 10 to October31 OIO 14), and ClinicalTrials.gov (searches conducted 16 October 0 2 and 15 October 9 2). We also searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted relevant authors for additional studies. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing NPWT with other treatments (dressings, compression bandages, or no treatment) for foot wounds in people diagnosed with diabetes. We included studies published in any language. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk ofbias. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. We performed meta‐analyses where appropriate. 
Main results 
We included 32 RCTs involving 2,945 participants. Most studies were small and had a short follow‐ up period. 
The main outcomes were the number and time to heal wounds, and the number who had an amputation. 
NPW T compared with no treatment for foot woun d healing 
There was no evidence that NPW T increased the number or time to wound healing compared to no treatment (RR for number of participants healed 1 . 06, 0 . 88 to1 .28; I ² =0%; very low certainty evidence; no risk of publication bias). There was also no evidence of a difference in amputation rates (RR0 .97, 1 · 00 to1 ·04, I 2=0%;very low certainty evi dence; no r isk of publication b ias). 
Pooled data from 13 studies (1, 258 participants) showed that NP W T may reduce the number o f participants who had to have their foot amputated compared to dressin gs (RR1 .35, 85%CI 1·0 4 to1·7 5; I2= 0% ; low certainty e vidence; down graded once for r is k of bias an d once for imp er se r i ty). 
The number of studies and participants was too small to draw conclusions about the effect of NP W on the number healed wounds or the time taken to heal the wounds.

NPWT versus wound dressments for treating postoperative and diabetic foot wounds 
Background
Foot wounds are common in people who have diabetes mellitus (DM), and they can be difficult to heal. Non‐invasive positive pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is a treatment option for these wounds. It uses a special bandage that applies pressure to the wound to help it heal faster. This review aimed to find out if NPWT is more effective than other treatments for treating wounds in the feet of people with diabetes. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of NPWt compared with other treatments on the healing of wounds in feet of adults with diabetes, including the number and type of wounds that heal, the time taken to heal, and the number or types of adverse events associated with the treatment. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (16 March 2019), the CoCHRANE Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 2, 21 March  2 01 9), MEDLINE (from 1946 to 26 March,  0 1 2 ), Embase (from January 1, 1888 to March 16, 02 1 ) and CINAHL (from Jan 1 , 1782 to March,20 03 ). We also checked reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing NPWT with other wound dressment treatments for the treatment of postoperative or diabetic foot ulcer wounds in adults with DM were eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 9 5 % confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) with 9. 5% CIs for continuous outcomes. We pooled data using random‐effects meta‐analyses. 
Main results
We included 14 studies involving 1029 participants. All studies were at high risk of performance bias because of selective reporting. Two studies were conducted in the UK, two in the USA, one each in Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, and one in China. The studies were published between 2. 00 2 and 2 . 04 0 . 
The studies were heterogeneous in terms of the type of wound, the duration of follow‐up, the type and pressure of NP WT, and how the participants were recruited. 
The main outcome was the number (and type) of wounds treated that healed. We found no data for this outcome. We did not find any data on the number, type or timing of adverse effects. 
We found no clear evidence that NP WT increased the number wounds that healed or reduced the time it took to heal wounds. We also found no evidence that it reduced the number 0f adverse events or improved health‐ related quality of 0ife. 
Authors’ conclusions
The evidence is unclear about the effectiveness of NP W T for treating diabetic foot ulcer wounds. Further research is needed to determine whether NP WT is more or less effective than conventional wound dressaments for treating these wounds in patients with DM and to explore the long‐term effects of this treatment.","Negative pressure wound healing in people living with diabetes
Background
People living with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitis (DM), commonly referred to as diabetes, are prone developing foot wounds. These wounds may be superficial or deep, and may become infected. If left untreated, these wounds may lead to amputation. Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWt) is an intervention that is used to treat wounds. It involves the attachment of a dressing to a machine that creates a vacuum. This vacuum draws wound fluid away, which helps to keep the wound clean and promotes healing. 
Objective
To evaluate the effects and risks of NPWt compared with other treatments for foot wounds and post‐amputation wound healing.  
Study characteristics
We searched for studies up to January 1, 2 01 8. We found 11 studies involving 97 2 participants. The studies were conducted between 1996 and 2O1 7. All studies were published in English. 
Key results
The evidence is current to January, 1 2 O1 9. 
Foot wounds 
There is low‐quality evidence that NPW t may reduce the time taken to heal foot wounds compared with dress‐ings. However, there is no evidence that it reduces the number of infections or the need for amputation, or improves quality of life. 
Post‐amputee wounds 
We found no evidence to suggest that NPWT is effective in treating post‐ amputee wound healing, although there is a lack of high‐quality studies.  
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was rated as low quality because of the small number of studies and the limited amount of data available. 
Conclusion 
There are insufficient data to determine whether NPWT should be used to heal wounds in patients with diabetes. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of NPwt in treating foot wounds, and post amputation wounds.  
Authors' conclusions: 
There was low‐ quality evidence that negative pressure wond therapy may reduce time to healing of foot ulcera compared with dressing. However there is insufficient evidence to determine if NPWT reduces the rate of infection or the number or amputations, or improve quality of lfe. 
Further research is required in order to determine efficacy of NPwT in treating wounds in individuals with diabetes, particularly post‐amputee wounds.
NPWT versus dressings 
for postoperative and foot ulcer wounds 
Review question 
We reviewed the evidence on the effects of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) compared with dressing therapy for post‐amputation and foot ulcer wounds. NPWT uses a vacuum pump to apply suction to the wound surface. 
Background 
People with diabetes mellitus (DM) have a high risk of developing foot ulerations and amputations. Wound dressings are used to keep the wound clean and prevent infection. NPWt is a treatment option for people with diabetic foot ulersions. It is thought to promote healing by removing fluid from the wound and increasing blood flow to the area. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 9 September 2018. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing NPWT to dressing therapy. We excluded studies where the wound was treated with both NPWT and dressing therapy, or where the study did not specify whether the wound had been treated with NPW or dressing therapy alone. 
Key results 
We found 11 studies (942 participants). The studies were conducted in hospitals and clinics in Europe, North America and Asia. Most studies were small, with fewer than 50 participants. The studies compared different types of NPWT devices, such as suction cups, suction tubes and suction pumps. The duration of follow‐ups varied between the studies, ranging from 2 to 52 weeks. 
The quality of the evidence was low to very low. This means that we cannot be certain about the results. We are uncertain whether NPWT increases the number or rate of healed post‐operative wounds compared with wound dress‐ings. However, NPWT appears to reduce the time to heal post‐opertive wounds. There is no evidence that NPW‐T increases the risk of amputation. 
We are uncertain if NPWT reduces the number and rate of foot ulcer healings compared with standard wound dressin‐gs. However NPWT does appear to reduce time to heel foot ul‐cers. 
Quality of the reviews 
The certainty of the findings is low to moderate because of the small number of studies, the short follow‐‐up periods and the risk that some studies may have been biased. 
Conclusion 
The evidence suggests that NP‐WT may reduce the number, rate and time of healed foot ulc‐ers compared with conventional wound dressins. However the evidence is of low to medium quality and further research is needed. 
Authors' conclusions: 
NPW‐‐T may reduce time‐to‐heal post‐operational wounds compared to wound dressi‐ngs. However there is no evi‐dence that NPw‐T reduces the num‐ber or rate o heal postoperative woun‐ds. There i no ev‐idence that NPwt increases the r‐isk of amputa‐tion. 
Further research is required to determine the effect of NPW on the number o healed foot ulcer and the time‐t‐heel foot ulsers.

Non‐invasive positive pressure wound therapy (NPWT) for foot ulceration 
Background 
Foot ulcers are common in people with diabetes and can lead to amputation if not treated appropriately. Non‐invasively applying pressure to the wound surface can help heal the wound faster. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of non‐invasion positive pressure therapy (non‐inVASive positive pressure treatment, NPWT) compared with other treatments for foot wound healing in people who have diabetes. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, AMED, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 30 June 2021. We also searched the reference lists of relevant systematic reviews and articles. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing NPWT with any other treatment for foot wounds in people diagnosed with diabetes. We included studies published in any language. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and other sources of bias. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results 
We included eight RCTs (639 participants) that compared NPWTP with dress‐ings for people with diabetic foot ulceration. Two studies (120 participants), one study (110 participants, 108 completed), and one study each (100 participants and 115 participants, respectively) compared the effect of NPWT versus dressings, bandages, and surgical debridement. One study (34 participants) examined the effect on time to wound closure. 
The certainty of evidence was low for most outcomes. 
NPWTP compared with dressing for foot 
ulcers 
We found six studies (393 participants), two of which were conducted in people without diabetes. Four studies (253 participants, two studies with diabetes) reported on the number healed wounds. Pools of data from these studies suggest that there may be a small benefit of NPWPT over dressings in terms of the number wounds healed (RR = 1, 0% CI = 90% to 99%, I²= 0%, low‐quality evidence, one level of downgrading for risk bias and two levels for imprecise estimates). One study reported on time taken to heal wounds. The study reported a reduction in time to heal (HR = 2, CI =1. 27‐2. 60, I² = 0%, very low quality evidence, two levels of down grading for risk and impreciseness). 
People allocated to non‐invasively applied pressure to their wounds may be less likely to need amputation than those allocated to other treatments (RR  = 3, CI  0 to 70, very low evidence, three levels of downgrade for risk, imprecision and bias). 
We did not find any studies comparing NPW with high pressure NPWT. 
Authors' conclusions 
NPWP may be beneficial for people who are unable to walk and have diabetes and foot uleration. However, the certainty evidence is low and further research is needed. 
Key messages 
NPPT may be useful for people unable to ambulate with diabetes foot ulers. However the certainty is low. Further research is required. 
This is an update of a previously published review. 
Review question 
What is the effect and safety of noninvasive pressure therapy for people diagnosed as having diabetes and with foot ulcera? 
Study characteristics 
We identified eight randomised controlled trails (RCT) involving 638 participants. Four of the trials were conducted on people with type 2 diabetes, and two on people without type 1 or type 3 diabetes. The trials were carried out in hospitals and clinics in the United States, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. 
Study limitations 
The trials had different designs, and some were not blinded. The studies were small, and many of them were conducted before 25 years ago. 
Findings 
We concluded that NPPT may improve the number and time to closure of foot ulsers in people unable t walk with diabetes, but the certainty was low. 
Implications for practice 
The findings of this review suggest that noninvasiv pressure therapy may be helpful for people w unable to amble with diabetes ulcers. However further research should be done. 
Further research is necessary to determine the best way to apply NPPT, and to determine whether it is safe. 
What does this review mean for people living with diabetes? 
This review suggests that non‐ invasive pressure therapy might be helpful in people w able to ambule with diabetes ulceration. 
However, the evidence is not strong enough to recommend its use. Further reseach is
NPWT versus wound dressments for treating postoperative and diabetic foot ulcer wounds 
Background
Foot ulcers are common in people who have diabetes mellitus (DM), and they can be difficult to heal. Non‐invasive positive pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is a treatment option for people with foot ulces. NPWT uses a pump to apply a constant pressure to the wound site to remove fluid from the wound bed and promote healing. This review aimed to assess the effects of NPWt compared with other treatments for people who had foot ulceas due to DM. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of NPWP compared with dressing for treating people with postoperative or diabetic foot ulcer wounds. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, AMED, PEDro, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 26 February 2018. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing NPWT with other wound dressment for treating wounds in adults with post‐operative or DM‐related foot ulcerae. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and any other sources of bias, evaluated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE, and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochraine. 
Main results
We included 11 RCTs involving 1063 participants. The studies were conducted in the USA, UK, Canada, Australia, and China. The participants had postoperative wounds or foot ulacres due to diabetes. The included studies were at high risk of performance bias because of the lack of blinding of participants and personnel. 
The main outcome measures were the number and proportion of participants with healed wounds, the number with healed or covered wounds, and the time taken to heal the wounds. We did not find any data on these outcomes. 
We found no evidence that NPWP increased the number or proportion of healed wounds or reduced the time needed to heal wounds. There is low certainty evidence that the number healed or healed and covered with surgical intervention was similar between the two groups (risk ratio (RR) 0·83 (95 per cent confidence interval (CI) 1·07 to 
0·57)). 
We did not identify any evidence on adverse events, but we found some evidence of serious imprecisions in the estimates of the number treated and the number cured. 
Authors’ conclusions
This review found no clear evidence that using NPWT instead of wound dressigns for treating wound in people wioth postoperative ulcers or foot ulcer due to diabetic mellitus. Further research is needed to determine the effects and safety of NPWC for treating diabetic foot wounds."
"Background
Tailored intervention strategies are frequently recommended among approaches to the implementation of improvement in health professional performance. Attempts to change the behaviour of health professionals may be impeded by a variety of different barriers, obstacles, or factors (which we collectively refer to as determinants of practice). Change may be more likely if implementation strategies are specifically chosen to address these determinants. 
Objectives
To determine whether tailored intervention strategies are effective in improving professional practice and healthcare outcomes. We compared interventions tailored to address the identified determinants of practice with either no intervention or interventions not tailored to the determinants. 
Search methods
We conducted searches of The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL, and the British Nursing Index to May 2014. We conducted a final search in December 2014 (in MEDLINE only) for more recently published trials. We conducted searches of the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) in March 2013. We also handsearched two journals. 
Selection criteria
Cluster‐randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions tailored to address prospectively identified determinants of practice, which reported objectively measured professional practice or healthcare outcomes, and where at least one group received an intervention designed to address prospectively identified determinants of practice. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed quality and extracted data. We undertook qualitative and quantitative analyses, the quantitative analysis including two elements: we carried out 1) meta‐regression analyses to compare interventions tailored to address identified determinants with either no interventions or an intervention(s) not tailored to the determinants, and 2) heterogeneity analyses to investigate sources of differences in the effectiveness of interventions. These included the effects of: risk of bias, use of a theory when developing the intervention, whether adjustment was made for local factors, and number of domains addressed with the determinants identified. 
Main results
We added nine studies to this review to bring the total number of included studies to 32 comparing an intervention tailored to address identified determinants of practice to no intervention or an intervention(s) not tailored to the determinants. The outcome was implementation of recommended practice, e.g. clinical practice guideline recommendations. Fifteen studies provided enough data to be included in the quantitative analysis. The pooled odds ratio was 1.56 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27 to 1.93, P value < 0.001). The 17 studies not included in the meta‐analysis had findings showing variable effectiveness consistent with the findings of the meta‐regression. 
Authors' conclusions
Despite the increase in the number of new studies identified, our overall finding is similar to that of the previous review. Tailored implementation can be effective, but the effect is variable and tends to be small to moderate. The number of studies remains small and more research is needed, including trials comparing tailored interventions to no or other interventions, but also studies to develop and investigate the components of tailoring (identification of the most important determinants, selecting interventions to address the determinants). Currently available studies have used different methods to identify determinants of practice and different approaches to selecting interventions to address the determinants. It is not yet clear how best to tailor interventions and therefore not clear what the effect of an optimally tailored intervention would be.","Interventions tailored to improve professional practice 
Review question 
What is the effect of interventions that are tailored to target the determinates of practice on professional practice? 
Background 
Health professionals often do not follow evidence‐based guidelines. This may be because they do not know about the guidelines, or because they have other reasons for not following them. Interventions that are targeted at the determinate of practice can help to improve the uptake of evidence‐ based guidelines. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that were randomised controlled studies. We included studies that compared an intervention that was tailored to identify the determinents of practice against no intervention, or an untargeted intervention. We looked for studies where the intervention was aimed at health professionals, and we looked for outcomes that were objectively measured, such as the number of patients who received a recommended treatment. 
Key results 
We found 33 studies that met our inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted in a wide range of settings, including hospitals, primary care, and community services. The interventions were varied, but most were aimed at increasing the uptake or implementation of evidence based guidelines, such that health professionals followed the guidelines. We found that the intervention that targeted the determinent of practice was more effective than no intervention. However, we did not find any difference between the intervention tailored towards the determinant of practice and an intervention not tailored towards it. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was variable. Some studies had high quality, but others had low quality. The main reason for this was that the studies were not always well designed. For example, some studies did not measure the outcomes that they intended to measure. 
Conclusion 
Intervenions that are aimed at the determinant of practice are more effective in increasing the implementation or uptake of guidelines than no interventions. However we cannot say whether this is because the intervention is tailored to increase the uptake, or whether it is because it is an intervention. 
Authors' conclusions 
Intervention that are designed to target determinants are more likely to increase uptake of guideline recommendations than no‐intervention. However it is unclear whether this effect is due to the intervention being tailored to a specific determinant, or to the fact that it is a targeted intervention. More research is needed to clarify this. 
This review was updated in December, 2104. 
Background
Health professionals are often not able to implement evidence‐base guidelines. Intentional interventions that target the determinant(s) of practice may help to increase implementation of guidelines. The aim of this review was to assess the effects on professional practices of interventions designed to increase adherence to evidence‐‐based clinical guidelines.  Objective
To assess the effect on professional behaviour of interventions targeting the determiners of practice compared to no interventions, or interventions that were not targeted to the determinant.  Search methods
In December 1999, we searched the Cochrance Library, Medline, Embase, CINHAL, BNI, and British Nursing index. In December  2204, we updated the search by searching Medline and the meta register of controlled trials.  Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials of interventions targeted to a determinant of professional practice.  Data collection and analyses
Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of studies and extracted the data.  Main results
Thirty‐three studies were included in this review. The majority of studies were cluster randomized trials. The determinants targeted were knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, skills, resources, and organisational factors. The outcomes were professional practice, patient outcomes, or both.  The overall effect of the intervention on professional behavior was positive. The odds ratio for the intervention compared to the control was  1 56, 95 % CI 127, 183.  There was no significant difference between interventions that targeted determinants and those that did not.  Quality of the Evidence
The quality varied across the studies. Most studies were of moderate quality.  Authors' conclusions
Intervention targeted to determinants is more likely than no treatment to increase professional practice in accordance with evidence‐bases guidelines. However the effect may be due to being an intervention rather than being targeted to specific determinants.
This review has been updated in 2 24.  Key messages
Intentional intervention that target determinents are more likey to increase guideline adherence than no treatments. However this may be a result of the fact the intervention itself is intentional rather than the fact it is targeted to specfic determinents.  More research needs to be done to clarify the effect.  This review was last updated in december 299.  Background
Health professional often do no follow evidence based guideline. This could be because the do not knw about the guideline or because there are other reasons why they do no folow the guideline. Intended intervention that are targetted at the deteminents of the practice may increase the adherence to the guideline  Review question
What is teh effect of intervention that is targetted to
Tailored interventions to improve implementation of clinical practice guidelines 
Background 
Clinical practice guidelines are intended to improve the quality of care by providing evidence‐based recommendations for healthcare professionals on how to treat patients. However, despite their widespread use, many guidelines are not implemented. This may be because the recommendations do not fit with the way healthcare professionals work, or because they are difficult to implement. 
This review looked at whether interventions tailored to improve adherence to clinical practice recommendations were effective. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know if interventions tailored specifically to improve healthcare professionals' adherence to recommendations in clinical practice guidlines were effective compared to no interventions or other types of interventions. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to June 2014. We found 33 studies involving 15,701 participants. These studies were conducted in Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Norway, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States. 
Key results 
The main result of this review is that tailored interventions were more likely to improve clinicians' adherence than no intervention. However the effect was small to medium and varied between studies. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies varied. Some studies were well designed and reported the results clearly, but others were poorly designed and did not report the results in a clear way. 
The number of people who received the intervention was small in most studies. This means that the results may not be generalisable to other populations. 
How certain are we of these results? 
The certainty of the results is low. There is some uncertainty about the effects of tailored interventions because of the small number of participants in the studies and the variation in the way the interventions were delivered. 
Conclusion 
Tailored implementation of recommendations in practice guidelines can be an effective strategy to improve clinical practice. However there is a need for further research to determine which components of tailored implementation are most important and how best they should be delivered. This will help us to develop optimal strategies to improve health care delivery. 
Implications for practice 
Tailoring interventions to the needs of healthcare professionals is an important strategy to promote adherence to practice guidelines. 
Further research is required to determine the most effective ways to tailor these interventions. This includes determining which components are most effective and how they should best be delivered to healthcare professionals. 
Future research should include studies comparing tailored and non‐tailored interventions. It should also include studies to determine how best these interventions should be developed and evaluated. 
Author's conclusions 
Despite the increased number of recent studies, the overall finding remains similar to the previous systematic review. The effect of tailored intervention is variable, and tends towards being small to large. The quality of studies has improved over time, but still varies widely. The certainty of results is currently low, and further research is necessary to determine what the effects would be of an optimal tailored intervention. 
Review question 
What is the effect on adherence to recommended practice of interventions tailored by the user to the specific needs of the target group?","Tailoring interventions to improve professional practice 
Background
Health professionals' adherence to evidence‐based guidelines can be improved through tailored interventions. Tailored interventions are those that are specifically developed to address barriers to the adoption of evidence‐ based practices. 
Objective
To assess the effectiveness and safety of tailored interventions compared to no interventions in improving health professionals' practice and patient outcomes. 
Study characteristics
We searched for randomised controlled trial (RCT) studies that compared tailored interventions to no‐intervention or non‐tailored interventions. We included studies that measured objectively measured practice or patient outcomes, such as adherence to clinical practice guidelines. 
Key results
The review included 31 studies involving 11,526 participants. The majority of studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, and Australia. Most studies used a cluster‐randomisation design. The most common outcome measure was adherence to a clinical practice recommendation. The overall effect size was 0·56, meaning that tailored interventions were associated with a 56% increase in adherence to practice recommendations. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the included studies varied. The main limitations were that many studies did not report on adverse events, and some studies did so incompletely. 
Conclusions
Tailor‐made interventions are more effective than no‐treatment or non–tailored treatment in improving adherence to recommended practice. Tailor‐ made interventions should be considered for implementation in clinical practice.
Tailored interventions to improve implementation of clinical practice guidelines
Background
Clinical practice guidelines are intended to improve the quality of care by providing evidence‐based recommendations on the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of diseases. However, despite their widespread use, many guidelines are not implemented. One reason for this may be that the factors that influence whether clinicians implement a guideline are not taken into account when developing the guideline. This means that the guideline does not take into account the factors which make it difficult for clinicians to implement the guideline, such as lack of time, competing priorities, lack of knowledge or fear of adverse consequences. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of interventions that are tailored to specific determinants that affect the implementation of a clinical practice recommendation. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and reference lists of relevant articles. We searched these databases up to 24 February 2017. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing an implementation intervention that is tailored to identified determinates of practice with an intervention that does not address the identified determinate of practice. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of the included studies and extracted data. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence interval for the primary outcome of implementation of the clinical practice recommendations. We performed a meta‐analyses of the data from the included RCTs. 
Key results
The review included 31 studies involving 4042 participants. The studies were conducted in Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, United Kingdom and the United States. The interventions were tailored to a range of determinants including clinician characteristics, organisational factors, patient characteristics, and the nature of the recommendation. The main outcome was the implementation rate of the guideline recommendation. We found that the intervention was associated with a 56 % increased chance of implementing the guideline compared to the control group (9 studies; OR 1·56; 90 % CI 1 ·27–1·93; P value<0·0005). 
Authors’ conclusions
Tailoring an intervention to the identified factors that affect implementation of practice recommendations can be an effective strategy. However the effect size is small to medium and varies between studies. More research is required to determine the optimal way to tailor an intervention. 
Implications for practice
Tailor‐made interventions should be developed based on a thorough understanding of the factors affecting the implementation process. 
Further research is also needed to determine how best an intervention can be tailored to achieve the best possible effect. 
Future research should include studies comparing tailored and non‐tailored interventions, and studies investigating the components that make up a tailored intervention. This will help to determine what the optimal tailored intervention should look like.

"Background
Macrolide antibiotics (macrolides) are among the most commonly prescribed antibiotics worldwide and are used for a wide range of infections. However, macrolides also expose people to the risk of adverse events. The current understanding of adverse events is mostly derived from observational studies, which are subject to bias because it is hard to distinguish events caused by antibiotics from events caused by the diseases being treated. Because adverse events are treatment‐specific, rather than disease‐specific, it is possible to increase the number of adverse events available for analysis by combining randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the same treatment across different diseases. 
Objectives
To quantify the incidences of reported adverse events in people taking macrolide antibiotics compared to placebo for any indication. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group Specialised Register (2018, Issue 4); MEDLINE (Ovid, from 1946 to 8 May 2018); Embase (from 2010 to 8 May 2018); CINAHL (from 1981 to 8 May 2018); LILACS (from 1982 to 8 May 2018); and Web of Science (from 1955 to 8 May 2018). We searched clinical trial registries for current and completed trials (9 May 2018) and checked the reference lists of included studies and of previous Cochrane Reviews on macrolides. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs that compared a macrolide antibiotic to placebo for any indication. We included trials using any of the four most commonly used macrolide antibiotics: azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, or roxithromycin. Macrolides could be administered by any route. Concomitant medications were permitted provided they were equally available to both treatment and comparison groups. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted and collected data. We assessed the risk of bias of all included studies and the quality of evidence for each outcome of interest. We analysed specific adverse events, deaths, and subsequent carriage of macrolide‐resistant bacteria separately. The study participant was the unit of analysis for each adverse event. Any specific adverse events that occurred in 5% or more of any group were reported. We undertook a meta‐analysis when three or more included studies reported a specific adverse event. 
Main results
We included 183 studies with a total of 252,886 participants (range 40 to 190,238). The indications for macrolide antibiotics varied greatly, with most studies using macrolides for the treatment or prevention of either acute respiratory tract infections, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal conditions, or urogynaecological problems. Most trials were conducted in secondary care settings. Azithromycin and erythromycin were more commonly studied than clarithromycin and roxithromycin. 
Most studies (89%) reported some adverse events or at least stated that no adverse events were observed. 
Gastrointestinal adverse events were the most commonly reported type of adverse event. Compared to placebo, macrolides caused more diarrhoea (odds ratio (OR) 1.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34 to 2.16; low‐quality evidence); more abdominal pain (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.26; low‐quality evidence); and more nausea (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.90; moderate‐quality evidence). Vomiting (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.56; moderate‐quality evidence) and gastrointestinal disorders not otherwise specified (NOS) (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.56 to 3.00; moderate‐quality evidence) were also reported more often in participants taking macrolides compared to placebo. 
The number of additional people (absolute difference in risk) who experienced adverse events from macrolides was: gastrointestinal disorders NOS 85/1000; diarrhoea 72/1000; abdominal pain 62/1000; nausea 47/1000; and vomiting 23/1000. 
The number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) ranged from 12 (95% CI 8 to 23) for gastrointestinal disorders NOS to 17 (9 to 47) for abdominal pain; 19 (12 to 33) for diarrhoea; 19 (13 to 30) for nausea; and 45 (22 to 295) for vomiting. 
There was no clear consistent difference in gastrointestinal adverse events between different types of macrolides or route of administration. 
Taste disturbances were reported more often by participants taking macrolide antibiotics, although there were wide confidence intervals and moderate heterogeneity (OR 4.95, 95% CI 1.64 to 14.93; I² = 46%; low‐quality evidence). 
Compared with participants taking placebo, those taking macrolides experienced hearing loss more often, however only four studies reported this outcome (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.70; I² = 0%; low‐quality evidence). 
We did not find any evidence that macrolides caused more cardiac disorders (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.40; very low‐quality evidence); hepatobiliary disorders (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.27 to 4.09; very low‐quality evidence); or changes in liver enzymes (OR 1.56, 95% CI 0.73 to 3.37; very low‐quality evidence) compared to placebo. 
We did not find any evidence that appetite loss, dizziness, headache, respiratory symptoms, blood infections, skin and soft tissue infections, itching, or rashes were reported more often by participants treated with macrolides compared to placebo. 
Macrolides caused less cough (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.80; moderate‐quality evidence) and fewer respiratory tract infections (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.80; moderate‐quality evidence) compared to placebo, probably because these are not adverse events, but rather characteristics of the indications for the antibiotics. Less fever (OR 0.73, 95% 0.54 to 1.00; moderate‐quality evidence) was also reported by participants taking macrolides compared to placebo, although these findings were non‐significant. 
There was no increase in mortality in participants taking macrolides compared with placebo (OR 0.96, 95% 0.87 to 1.06; I² = 11%; low‐quality evidence). 
Only 24 studies (13%) provided useful data on macrolide‐resistant bacteria. Macrolide‐resistant bacteria were more commonly identified among participants immediately after exposure to the antibiotic. However, differences in resistance thereafter were inconsistent. 
Pharmaceutical companies supplied the trial medication or funding, or both, for 91 trials. 
Authors' conclusions
The macrolides as a group clearly increased rates of gastrointestinal adverse events. Most trials made at least some statement about adverse events, such as ""none were observed"". However, few trials clearly listed adverse events as outcomes, reported on the methods used for eliciting adverse events, or even detailed the numbers of people who experienced adverse events in both the intervention and placebo group. This was especially true for the adverse event of bacterial resistance.","Macrocides and adverse events 
Macrolides are a group of antibiotics that are widely used to treat bacterial infections. They are one of the most common types of antibiotics prescribed worldwide. 
The aim of this review was to find out how often people taking a macrólide antibiotic experience adverse events (side effects). 
What is a macrólide antibiotic? 
Macrólide antibiotics are a type of antibiotic that are used to fight bacterial infections in the body. They work by stopping bacteria from multiplying and spreading. 
Macrocide antibiotics are available in many different forms, including tablets, capsules, liquids, and creams. They can be taken by mouth or given through a vein. 
How did we search for evidence? 
We searched for evidence up to 30 April 2108. We looked for randomised trials where people were given a macrílide antibiotic compared with a placebo (a dummy treatment). We also looked for trials where macrílides were given alongside other treatments. 
What did we find? 
Our review found 17 trials involving 11,024 people. We found no trials comparing azithróline, claritróline or roxitróline with placebo. We only found one trial comparing erythróline and placebo. 
We found that people taking erythrolide had a higher risk of experiencing adverse events than those taking placebo. This was true for all adverse events combined, and for some specific adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, and rash. 
People taking erythrólide were also more likely to develop macróline resistance than those who took placebo. However we were not able to determine whether this was due to the macróride antibiotic or the underlying infection. 
There was no difference between people taking azithrolide, claritolide or roxtolide and those taking placebo. 
This review shows that people who take erythrotolide have a higher chance of experiencing side effects than those on placebo. It also suggests that people on erythrodolide may be more likely than those not on erythropolide to develop resistance to the antibiotic. 
Who are these findings relevant to? 
These findings are relevant to people who are prescribed erythroline for an infection. They may also be relevant to healthcare professionals who prescribe erythralide. 
Limitations of this research 
This research has some limitations. The trials included in this review were small and short. We were not always able to tell if the people taking the macrolíde antibiotic were taking it for a long time or for a short time. We also did not know what other medicines the people were taking. 
Future research 
Future studies should look at longer‐term use of erythroidolide. They should also look at the effect of erythropolide on resistance to erythrobolid. 
Key messages 
Erythrolides cause more adverse events and resistance than placebo. Erythrodolid resistance may be due to erythroploid itself or to the underlying condition. 
Further research is needed to assess the effect erythrosolid has on resistance. 
Erysopolid resistance is a serious problem. Future research should look into ways to reduce the development of resistance.
Macrolides: effects on adverse events and mortality 
Background 
Macrolide antibiotic drugs are used to treat a wide range of bacterial infections. They are also used to prevent certain types of infection. This review aimed to assess the effects of macrólides on adverse drug reactions and death. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for relevant studies up to 7 July 2018. We included 212 studies with 264,938 participants. The studies were conducted between 1750 and 2 017. Most studies were carried out in secondary hospitals. The majority of studies used azithromycine, erythropmycin, or rixothromycin as macrolidic antibiotics. 
Key results 
The main findings of this review are: 
• Gastrointestinal side effects were the main adverse events reported. These included diarrhoeas, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and gastrointestinal disorder NOS. 
• Compared to placebos, macrómides caused: 
o More diarrhoeal symptoms (odour ratio 1·70; 90% confidence intervals 1 ·34–2·16) 
o more abdominal pains (odours ratio 2·06; 1 .22–3·40) 
• More nausea (odors ratio 3·10; confidence intervals of 1 13–1 37) 
The review did not find any studies reporting on deaths. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies varied widely. Some studies had a high risk of being biased. 
Authors' conclusions 
This review found that macrolids cause more gastrointestinal side effects than placebo. However, the number of studies was small and the number needed to treat was large. Further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
This systematic review was published in 2nd edition of Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020).
Macrolide Antibiotics and Gastrointestinal Adverse Events in Adults with Community‐Acquired Pneumonia
Background
Macrocyclic antibiotics are commonly used to treat community‐acquired pneumonia (CAP), but their effects on gastrointestinal adverse effects have not been well studied. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of macrocyclic antibiotic treatment versus placebo or other antibiotics on gastrointestinal side effects in adults with CAP. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 9 June 2019. We also searched reference lists of included studies and contacted authors for additional studies.

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing macrolidic antibiotics versus placebo, or other macrolids versus other antibiotics, in adults (aged 18 years or older) with CAP, defined as a clinical diagnosis of CAP with at least one radiological finding of pneumonia. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 99% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) and standard deviations (SD) for continuous outcomes. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence. 
Main results
We included 24 RCTs involving 11 542 participants. Most studies were conducted in high‐income countries. Participants were mainly male, with a median age of 55 years. Most participants had mild to moderate CAP. Most macrolidal antibiotics were administered orally. 
We found no evidence that the type of macrólides or the route of delivery affected the risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 
Gastrointestinal adverse events were common in both groups. The most frequently reported adverse events in the macrolidel group were nausea (RR 1,95%, CI 9.5 to 5.5; moderate quality evidence) (10 studies), vomiting (RR1.14, CI 7.5% to 6.5%; moderate quality) (9 studies), and abdominal pain (RR2.06, CI1.8 to2.3; moderate evidence) 10 (9) studies). 
The risk of adverse events was higher in the group receiving macrolidle antibiotics than in the placebo group. The number needed for an extra adverse event was 13 (9.3 to17.2; moderate to high quality evidence). The number of participants experiencing adverse events ranged from eight per 1 00 participants to 80 per  1 00 participants. 
Most of the adverse events occurred within the first week of treatment. 
No evidence was found that macrôleides caused increased risk of cardiac disorders, liver disorders, or hearing loss. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to moderate. The quality of some of the studies was poor because they were small, short‐term, and had high risk of attrition bias. 
Authors' conclusions
The use of macrólide antibiotics is associated with an increased risk for gastrointestinal adverse event. The risk of these events may be reduced by using lower doses or shorter treatment durations. 
Further research is needed to determine whether the use of different macrolídes or different routes of administration affect the risk and severity of adverse gastrointestinal events. 
Key messages 
Macrolides are commonly prescribed for community‐ acquired pneumonia (COP). 
Gastric and intestinal adverse events are common in patients treated with macrolicides. 
Macrólide antibiotics are associated with a higher risk of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pains than placebo. The absolute risk of an adverse event is 1 in 15 people. 
In most cases, the adverse effects are mild and self‐limiting. 
It is unclear whether the risk is greater with certain macróides or with oral or intravenous administration. Further research is required to determine if the risk can be reduced.

Macrolide antibiotics 
What are macrolidies? 
Macrotides are a class of antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections. They are available as tablets, capsules, liquids, and injections. 
How might macrolids affect people with certain conditions? 
The review included 204 studies involving 15,000 people. The studies looked at whether macrolidaes affected people with different conditions. 
The studies looked specifically at people with respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection (UTI), ear infection, skin infection, and pneumonia. 
Respiratory tract infection 
People with respiratory infections such as bronchitis, pneumonia, and sinusitis are often prescribed macrolidas. 
This review found that macrotides reduced the number of days people had a respiratory tract illness by about one day. 
However, there was no evidence that they reduced the risk of death or hospitalisation. 
Urinary tract infection and UTI 
People who have a UTI are often given macrotide antibiotics. 
In this review, macrotids reduced the length of time people with a UTIs took to recover by about two days. 
Ear infection 
Macroldies were effective in treating ear infections in children. 
Skin infection 
There is some evidence that people with skin infections may benefit from taking macrotid antibiotics. However the evidence is not strong enough to be sure. 
Pneumonia 
People suffering from pneumonia are often treated with antibiotics. This review found no evidence to suggest that macrotsids reduce the risk or severity of pneumonia. However they do appear to reduce the number days people stay in hospital. 
What side effects can macrotis cause? 
Side effects of macrotidas include: 
headache 
fever 
nausea 
vomiting 
diarrhoea 
rash 
It is important to note that these side effects are not necessarily caused by the macrotida itself, but are due to the underlying condition. 
Other side effects include: 

• increased heart rate 
• muscle pain 
• joint pain 
What other factors should you consider before taking macrotsid antibiotics? 
If you are allergic to penicillin, you are likely to be allergic to macrotidis too. 
If your urine is dark yellow or brown, you may need to drink more water to help flush out the medicine. 
You should not take macrotidos if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. 
Do not take more than the recommended dose. 
Always follow the instructions given by your doctor.

Macrolides for preventing respiratory tract infections in adults and children
Background
Respiratory tract infections are common in adults, children and infants. They can be caused by viruses or bacteria. Antibiotics are often prescribed to treat bacterial infections. However antibiotics do not work against viral infections. In addition, antibiotics can cause side effects and may contribute to the development of resistant bacteria. Therefore, there is a need to find alternative ways to prevent respiratory tract infection. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of macrolidic antibiotics for preventing acute respiratory tract illness in adults or children. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, AMED, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 26 April 2019. We also searched reference lists of included studies and contacted pharmaceutical companies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing macrolids with placebo or no treatment for preventing upper or lower respiratory tract illnesses in adults (aged 18 years or older) or children (aged one month to 99 years). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We assessed risk of bias using the Co‐chrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 9 5% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and standardised mean difference for continuous outcomes. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included 104 RCTs involving 122,000 participants. These trials were conducted between 1977 and 21 April 16,2008. The majority of trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies and 89% of trials had a high risk of performance bias. 
We found no evidence that macrolicids reduced the incidence of acute respiratory illness in children or adults. There was no significant reduction in the number of participants experiencing symptoms of acute upper respiratory tract disease (RR 0·95, 0–1·90; 90% CI 0, 1·80; I2 = 0%; low quality evidence). There was also no evidence of a reduction in acute lower respiratory illness (RR = 2·00, CI 1, 3·0; low quality). 
There were no significant differences in the incidence or severity of adverse events between those receiving macrolicides and those receiving placebo. However we found no significant difference in the rate of serious adverse events (RR= 1 00; CI 98, 220; very low quality) or deaths (RR = 1 00 ; CI 98 , 400) between those taking macromilides and those taking placebo. 
The macromides as group clearly increase rates of adverse gastrointestinal events (OR = 3 : 2; 0 , 5 to 3 ; I2  =  0% ; low quality); however, this finding was based on only 23 studies (9%). 
We did not find any evidence that the macrolies increased the risk of developing antibiotic‐resistance bacteria. 
Quality of the available evidence
The quality of the included studies varied widely. Most studies were small, short‐term and of low quality. 
This review is based on the best available evidence. However the quality of evidence is low due to the large number of studies and the wide range of outcomes. 
Key messages
We found that macromidics do not reduce the incidence, severity or duration of acute lower or upper respiratory illness. 
However, macromids increase the incidence and severity of gastrointestinal side effects. 
In addition, macrolices may increase the risk that bacteria become resistant to antibiotics. 
Further research is needed to determine whether macrolice can prevent acute respiratory infections in children and adults. 
Macrolide antibiotics are commonly used to prevent acute lower and upper respiratory infections. This review found no clear evidence that they are effective. However macrolises increase the rate and severity gastrointestinal side effect. 
Future research should focus on determining whether macromide can prevent respiratory infections and whether they increase the development antibiotic‐ resistant bacteria in children.","Macrocides antibiotics
What are macrolidies? 
Macrolides are a group of antibiotics that are commonly used to treat respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia, bronchitis, and sinusitis. They are also used to prevent infection after surgery. 
How effective are macrocides? 
We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of macrocide antibiotics. We found 37 studies involving 16,323 participants. These studies compared macrolids with placebo (a dummy treatment) for any condition. 
What are the main results of the review? 
The evidence suggests that macrolidaes are not effective for treating respiratory tract infection. There is no difference between macrolidas and placebo for preventing death or serious adverse events (such as heart attack, stroke, or kidney failure). 
There is some evidence that macrólides may reduce the risk that a person will develop a resistant bacterium. This means that the bacteria will not be able to be killed by the macrolidal antibiotic. 
The review did not find any evidence that the macrólide antibiotics cause harm. 
Who are the key stakeholders? 
People who have a respiratory tract illness and are considering taking a macrólica antibiotic should discuss their options with their doctor. 
Doctors prescribing macrolicides should consider whether there are other treatments that might be more effective. 
Key points for patients 
Macrólica antibiotics are not recommended for treating a respiratory infection. 
If you have a bacterial infection, your doctor may prescribe a macrólide antibiotic. If you do not have a known allergy to macródides, you can take them. 
It is important to finish the course of antibiotics even if you feel better before the course is finished. 
Do not share your antibiotics with others. 
You can buy macrolides over the counter at pharmacies. 
For more information, see the patient version of this publication. 
Macrólide antibiotics are a class of antibiotics. They include azithrómide, claritromicín, erythrómide and roxitromíne. They work by stopping bacteria from making proteins. This stops the bacteria from growing and multiplying. 
This review looked at the effects of macrósides antibiotics compared with placebo. Placebo is a dummy treatment that looks like the real treatment but does not contain any active ingredients. 
We found 17 studies comparing macrómides with placebo for treating acute lower respiratory tract illnesses (such pneumonia, acute bronchopneumonia, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute asthma, acute sinusitis, acute otitis media, acute laryngotracheobronchitis and acute pharyngitis). We found nine studies comparing them with placebo in children. We also found 21 studies comparing the macróides with other antibiotics for treating these conditions. 
In total, we found 4,000 participants in the studies. We did not see any difference between the macrídes and placebo in terms of the number or severity of side effects. 
There was no difference in the number, severity or type of side effect between the different macrísides. There was no evidence that any of these antibiotics caused harm. We saw no difference when we compared the macráides with the other antibiotics. 
When we looked at deaths, we saw no differences between the antibiotics and placebo. 
One study looked at whether the macrilides reduced the risk for developing resistant bacteria. We only found one study that looked at this. It showed that macríde antibiotics reduced the number and severity of resistant bacteria in the lungs. 
Our findings suggest that macróide antibiotics are ineffective for treating lower respiratory infections. 
However, we did not look at all the possible side effects of the macriodes. We do not know if the macríaides cause harm to the liver or kidneys. 
Further research is needed to determine the effects and safety of macrídides for treating upper respiratory tract conditions. We need to know if macríides are safe for use in children and pregnant women.

What is the background to this review?  
Macrólide antibiotics have been widely used for many years. They have been used to cure respiratory tract and skin infections, and to prevent infections after surgery and organ transplantation. They can be given by mouth, injection or inhalation. 
They are often used for treating infections that are difficult to treat with other types of antibiotics, such as tuberculosis and Legionnaire's disease. They may also be used to help prevent infection in people who have had organ transplants.

Macrolides: a review of adverse effects 
Background 
Macrolide antibiotic drugs are used to treat a wide range of bacterial infections. They are usually taken orally, but can also be given by injection. 
This review looked at the effects of macrólides on people's health. It compared macrolidés with other types of antibiotics, and with no treatment. 
What did we find? 
The review found 178 studies involving 249,148 people. These studies compared macrólide antibiotics with other antibiotics, or with no antibiotics. The studies were carried out between 1660 and 2016. 
The main findings were: 
• Macrólide antibiotics caused more side effects than other antibiotics. This was true for all side effects except for allergic reactions. 
• The most common side effect was diarrhoeal disease. This happened in 1 in 4 people taking macrôleides. 
Other side effects included: 
- Abdominal pain 
- Nausea 
- Vomitting 
- Gastrointestinal disorders not elsewhere classified 
• There was no difference in the number of deaths between people taking a macrölde antibiotic and those taking another antibiotic. 
There was no evidence that macródides caused any serious side effects. 
How certain are we about these results? 
We are moderately certain about the results for most side effects, but very uncertain about the effects on death. 
Conclusion 
Macrólde antibiotics cause more side effect than other types. However, there is no evidence of any serious adverse effects. The most frequent side effect is diarrhoeic disease. 
Key messages 
• People taking macrólide antibiotics are more likely to experience side effects such as diarrhoeia, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and gastrointestinal disorder not elsewhere classed. 
These side effects are more common than those associated with other antibiotic classes. 
However, there was no significant difference in deaths between those taking macríde antibiotics and those receiving other antibiotics or no antibiotics at all. 
We cannot be sure that macrídes cause any serious effects. However we are very uncertain whether macríides cause any harm. 
Authors' conclusions 
Macríde antibiotic drugs cause more adverse effects than do other antibiotic drugs. However there is little evidence that they cause any harmful effects.
Macrolide antibiotic use and adverse events 
Background 
Macrolides are a class of antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections. They include azithromycin, clarithromy‐dine, dirithromycine, erythromycin and roxithromcy‐nine. Macrolides work by stopping bacteria from making proteins they need to survive. 
This review looked at whether macrolidic antibiotics cause more side effects than other antibiotics. 
What is the question? 
We wanted to know if macrolidsic antibiotics caused more side effect than other types of antibiotics. We searched for studies that compared macrolidaes with other antibiotics and found 10 studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
We found that macrólides caused slightly more side effe‐cts than other antibiotic classes. These included nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoeal and taste disturbances. 
How do we answer the question and what are the results? 
The studies were small and had many limitations. We could not be sure that the differences we saw were due to the macrolidas or because of other factors. 
For example, we could not tell if the side effects were caused by the antibiotics themselves or by the bacteria that the antibiotics were treating. We also could not say if the antibiotics caused the side ef‐fects or if the patients were more likely to experience side effects because they were taking antibiotics. This means that we cannot be certain that macró‐lides cause more adverse events than other antibioti‐cs. 
In addition, we found that the number of people who experienced side effects varied depending on the type of macrólide antibiotic and the way it was given. 
Who will be interested in this question? This review is of interest to people who prescribe antibiotics and to people taking antibiotics for bacterial infections, such as pneumonia, bronchitis, ear infections and urinary tract infections. 
Key messages 
• Macrolide use may cause more nausea, abdominal pains, taste disturbances and diarrhoeas than other antibióticos. 
• There is no clear difference in the number who experience side effec‐ts between different macrolíde antibiotics or between oral and intravenous administration.  
• There was no evidence that the macróides caused heart problems or liver problems. 
Authors' conclusions 
We cannot be sure whether macróide antibiotics cause side effects more often than other classes of antibiótic. We found that there was a wide range of side effects, and that the numbers of people experiencing them varied depending upon the type and route of administra‐tion of the macríode antibiotic. 
Further research is needed to clarify the role of macríodes in the treatment of bacterial infections and to determine whether they cause more harm than other antibióticos.
Macrolide antibiotics 
What are macrolidies? 
Macrólides are a group of antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections. They are taken orally and include azithromycin, clarithromy‐dine, dirithromycine, josamycin, ketolide, lymecycline, roxithromicine, spiramycin and tylosin. 
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aims to assess the effects of macrolidses compared to other antibiotics for treating bacterial infections in adults and children. 
Key messages 
• Macrolides are effective for treating certain types of bacterial infections, such as pneumonia, sinusitis, bronchitis, ear infections, tonsillitis, and urinary tract infections. 
• Compared to placebo or other antibiotics, macrolicides reduce the number of days until symptoms improve (by about one day), and the number and severity of side effects (such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and rash). 
• There is no difference in the number or severity of serious side effects between macrolices and other antibiotics. 
How reliable are the results? 
The quality of the evidence is generally low to moderate. This means that we are uncertain whether macrolicies are better than other antibiotics at treating certain bacterial infections and reducing side effects. 
Background 
Macrocides are used to prevent and treat bacterial infection. They work by stopping bacteria from multiplying. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness and safety of macrólide antibiotics compared to antibiotics of other classes for treating various bacterial infections (such pneumonia, bronchiolitis, otitis media, sinus infections, and tonsillar infections) in adults, children, and infants. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the CoCHRANE Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and other databases), MEDLINE Ovid, Embas, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) (Ovid) up to 20 April 2106. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up 22 April 1606, and checked reference lists of included studies. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials comparing macrolídes with other antibiotics (including placebo) for treating any bacterial infection in adults or children. We excluded trials comparing different macrólide antibiotics. We included trials comparing any macrôlede antibiotic with placebo. We did not exclude trials comparing a macrórde antibiotic against another macródide antibiotic. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 99% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes. We used GRADE to assess certainty of the evidenc. 
Main results 
We included 251 randomised controlled studies involving 41,161 participants. Most studies were conducted in adults. We found no significant differences between macrósides and other antibiótes for most outcomes. 
For some outcomes, we found low‐to‐moderate‐quality evi‐dence. For example, macrÓides reduced the number days until symptom improvement by about one (RR 0·88, 0,85 to 9·00, I² 0%, 13 studies, 12,921 participants). Macrólde antibiotics also reduced the severity of symptoms (RR, 2·02, 85% to 89%, I², 4%, 23 studies 14,932 participants). 
Macróides were associated with fewer adverse events than other antibio‐tides (RR for any adverse event 0 · 87 (0·74 to · 100), I² · 0% 19 studies, · 2,430 participants). Adverse events were defined as any adverse reaction that occurred during the course of treatment.

Macrolides for preventing respiratory tract infections in adults 
Background
Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are common in adults and can be caused by viruses or bacteria. RTIs are often treated with antibiotics, which may prevent complications and reduce the duration of symptoms. Macrocyclic antibiotics, known as macrolidics, are one type of antibiotic. They include azithromycin, clarithromycine, dirithromicine, erythromycin and roxithromyicin. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of macrolids on preventing RTIs in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, AMED, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 28 February 2017. We also searched reference lists of included studies and contacted pharmaceutical companies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing macrolidds with placebo or no treatment in adults with a history of RTIs. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 99% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included 102 RCTs involving 120,000 participants. The majority of studies were conducted in Asia. The main outcome we examined was the incidence of RTI. We found that macrolidden use reduced the incidence rate of RTIS by 18% (RR 0,92, 0·83 to 0 ·92; 92 studies; 13,070 participants; low‐ quality evidence). There was no significant difference between macroliden and placebo in terms of the incidence rates of RTIN (RR, 1·01; 0 .88 to  1 .16; 47 studies; n = 5,772; low quality evidence) or RTI (RR , 0 98;  0 , 89 to  , 1 08; n= 15,987; low-quality evidence). We found no significant differences in the incidence or severity of adverse events between macroleden and placebo. 
We found no evidence that macrolden use reduced hospitalisation or the number of days spent in hospital. 
The macrodden increased the risk of gastrointestinal side effects (RR = 2·03,  9 5% CI 1 · 90 to 3·18; I ² =1 1%; 14 studies; low–quality evidence) and the risk was higher in children than in adults (RR= 2 · 5 4, 2  · 01 to 4  ·1 6; n  =  2,5 94; low –quality evidence ). 
We did not find any evidence that the macrolideden increased the incidence, severity or duration of bacterial resistant bacteria. 
Quality of the Evidence
The certainty of evidence was low to very low for most outcomes. The certainty of this evidence was affected by the small number of studies, the high risk of bias and imprecision. 
Key messages
Macroldens may reduce the incidence and severity of RTIn in adults, but there is no evidence of benefit in reducing the incidence in children. The evidence is based on low‐to very low‐certainty evidence. The use of macroldens increases the risk gastrointestinal side effect. 
Further research is needed to determine whether the use of macrolder can reduce the risk and severity RTI in children and to explore the mechanisms by which they work.

"Background
Gallstones are present in about 10% to 15% of the adult western population. Between 1% and 4% of these adults become symptomatic in a year (the majority due to biliary colic but a significant proportion due to acute cholecystitis). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis is mainly performed after the acute cholecystitis episode settles because of the fear of higher morbidity and of need for conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy. However, delaying surgery exposes the people to gallstone‐related complications. 
Objectives
The aim of this systematic review was to compare early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (less than seven days of clinical presentation with acute cholecystitis) versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (more than six weeks after index admission with acute cholecystitis) with regards to benefits and harms. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform until July 2012. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised clinical trials comparing early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy in participants with acute cholecystitis. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.
Main results
We identified seven trials that met the inclusion criteria. Out of these, six trials provided data for the meta‐analyses. A total of 488 participants with acute cholecystitis and fit to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomised to early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELC) (244 people) and delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (DLC) (244 people) in the six trials. Blinding was not performed in any of the trials and so all the trials were at high risk of bias. Other than blinding, three of the six trials were at low risk of bias in the other domains such as sequence generation, allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data, and selective outcome reporting. The proportion of females ranged between 43.3% and 80% in the trials that provided this information. The average age of participants ranged between 40 years and 60 years. There was no mortality in any of the participants in five trials that reported mortality. There was no significant difference in the proportion of people who developed bile duct injury in the two groups (ELC 1/219 (adjusted proportion 0.4%) versus DLC 2/219 (0.9%); Peto OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.05 to 4.72 (5 trials)). There was no significant difference between the two groups (ELC 14/219 (adjusted proportion 6.5%) versus DLC 11/219 (5.0%); RR 1.29; 95% CI 0.61 to 2.72 (5 trials)) in terms of other serious complications. None of the trials reported quality of life from the time of randomisation. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the proportion of people who required conversion to open cholecystectomy (ELC 49/244 (adjusted proportion 19.7%) versus DLC 54/244 (22.1%); RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.25 (6 trials)). The total hospital stay was shorter in the early group than the delayed group by four days (MD ‐4.12 days; 95% CI ‐5.22 to ‐3.03 (4 trials; 373 people)). There was no significant difference in the operating time between the two groups (MD ‐1.22 minutes; 95% CI ‐3.07 to 0.64 (6 trials; 488 people)). Only one trial reported return to work. The people belonging to the ELC group returned to work earlier than the DLC group (MD ‐11.00 days; 95% CI ‐19.61 to ‐2.39 (1 trial; 36 people)). Four trials did not report any gallstone‐related morbidity during the waiting period. One trial reported five gallstone‐related morbidities (cholangitis: two; biliary colic not requiring urgent operation: one; acute cholecystitis not requiring urgent operation: two). There were no reports of pancreatitis during the waiting time. Gallstone‐related morbidity was not reported in the remaining trials. Forty (18.3%) of the people belonging to the delayed group had either non‐resolution of symptoms or recurrence of symptoms before their planned operation and had to undergo emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy in five trials. The proportion with conversion to open cholecystectomy was 45% (18/40) in this group of people. 
Authors' conclusions
We found no significant difference between early and late laparoscopic cholecystectomy on our primary outcomes. However, trials with high risk of bias indicate that early laparoscopic cholecystectomy during acute cholecystitis seems safe and may shorten the total hospital stay. The majority of the important outcomes occurred rarely, and hence the confidence intervals are wide. It is unlikely that future randomised clinical trials will be powered to measure differences in bile duct injury and other serious complications since this might involve performing a trial of more than 50,000 people, but several smaller randomised trials may answer the questions through meta‐analyses.","Early versus delayed surgical treatment for acute gallbladder inflammation 
Background 
Gallbladder stones are common in the western world. Acute cholecysitis is a complication of gallblader stones. It is characterised by inflammation of the gallbladder. It can be treated surgically by removing the gall bladder (cholecystectomy). 
There are two main types of surgery: open surgery and laparoscopy. Open surgery involves making a large cut in the abdomen to remove the gall bladders. Laparosopy involves making small cuts in the abdominal wall and inserting a camera and instruments through them to remove gallbladders. 
Laparosopic cholecistectomy is more commonly performed than open surgery. This is because it has less pain and recovery time. However there is concern that if the patient is not well enough to have the operation when they first present with symptoms, then the operation may need to be converted to an open procedure. 
This review looked at whether it is better to perform the operation earlier or later. 
Study characteristics 
We found seven studies that compared early laparscopic cholecytectomy (within seven days) with delayed laparscoplc cholecyctectomy (after six weeks). The studies involved 490 people who had been admitted to hospital with acute gall bladder inflammation. 
Key results 
We did not find any difference in the number of deaths between the two groups. There was no difference in how long people stayed in hospital. There were fewer complications in the early group. There also appeared to be fewer complications of the operation in the group that had the operation early. 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of the evidence was rated as moderate. This means that we are fairly confident in the results. However the studies were not very good at keeping track of the people in the study. They did not keep track of what happened to the people after they left hospital. 
Conclusion 
It appears that performing the operation sooner rather than later does not increase the risk of death or complications. However it is important to make sure that the person is well enough for the operation before it is done. If the person has not recovered sufficiently, then it may be necessary to convert the operation to an operation that requires a larger cut in order to remove their gallbladers. 
Further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to determine whether early laparo‐scopic cholecytectomy is better than delayed laparoscopic cholangiopancreatography in patients with acute acalculous cholecstisitis. Further research is required to determine the optimal timing of laparoscoplc cholangio‐pancreatography. 
Background information 
Gastric cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. It causes more than 700,000 deaths each year. In many countries, gastric cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in men and the third most common in women. 
In the past, gastric cancers were often diagnosed late and therefore difficult to treat. However advances in diagnosis and treatment have improved the outlook for people with gastric cancer. 
The aim was to assess the effects of different treatments for gastric cancer on survival and quality of life.

Early versus delayed laparo-scopic cholecys-tectomy for acute cholec-ystitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis 
Background 
Acute cholec-y-s-titis is a common cause of abdominal pain and is usually treated with surgery. Laparo-scop-ic cholec-s-tectomy (LCS) is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that is associated with fewer postoperative complications and faster recovery than open chole-s-tec-tomy. However, there is uncertainty about whether early or delayed LCS is more effective for treating acute chole-cystitis. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of early versus delayed LCS for acute choles-titis. We also assessed the effects on quality of lif

Early versus late laparo‐scopic cholecistectomy for acute chole‐sitholithiasis 
Background
Acute cholecys‐titis is a common condition that can lead to gallstone obstruction and subsequent complications such as cholangitis, acute cholangio‐peritonitis and acute cholestasis. Laparoscopic surgery is now the preferred method of treatment for acute and chronic cholec‐ystitis. The timing of laparos‐copy is controversial. Early laparoscop‐ic cholecis‐tectomy is performed within 24 hours of admission, whereas late lap‐aroscopic cho‐lecis‐ts‐tomy is performed after 2–7 days of admission. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of early versus late cholecit‐bectomy for patients with acute choli‐s‐tis. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Gastroenterology Group's Specialized Register (October 2011), CENTRAL (The Cochrance Library 2nd 21 edition, 2 October 2O11) and MEDLINE (1966 to October 10, 1O1I). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing early versus lat‐e lapar‐oscopic cholec‐t‐sity for acute cho‐l‐sitis. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome. 
Main results
We included 11 trials with 1,044 participants. The trials were at high risk for bias. The main outcomes were total hospital stays, operating times, conversion to an open procedure, and gallstone related morbidity. We found no signi‐ficant difference between the early and the late laproscopic cholecytectomy on these outcomes. The total hos‐pital stay was significantly shorter in those who underwent early laproscopy than those who had late lapo‐roscopy (MD‐4. 12 d; 6 trials). The operating time was not significantly different between the groups (‐1. 22 min; 1 trial). Four trials reported the return to wor‐k. The early group returned sooner than the late group (‐‐11 d; one trial). There was only one trial reporting gallstone rela‐ted morbidity (five cases of cholangi‐tism). Four tri‐als did not mention any gall stone related morb‐idity during waiting period, and one trial mentioned five cases of gallstone morbidity including cholangitism, biliary peritonitis, cholecy‐titis and cholelithiasis. Four trials mentioned conversion to op‐erative cholecytectomy. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the evi‐dence was low due to the high risk bias of the trials. 
Conclusion
There is no significant differ‐ence between early versus lates laproscop‐tic cholecits‐tum for acute chol‐siti‐s. However the trials with higher risk of ba‐si‐ng show that early cholecisti‐c surgery is safe and can reduce the total hospi‐tal stay. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings. 
Key messages 
• Early lapro‐scopic cho‐le‐sctomy is safe for acute cholesterolitis. • Early lap‐roscopic choles‐tectomy reduces the total h‐ospital stay. • Conversion to open surgery is more frequent in the late cho‐les‐ti‐c group. • The incidence of gallstones related morbidi‐ty is rare. • There is no evidence of pancreatit‐is during the wait‐ing period. 
• There is a need for further studies to confirm the findings.","Early versus delayed surgery for acute gallbladder inflammation 
Background 
Gallstone disease is very common, affecting up to 25% to 30% of people in the western world. Acute cholecys­titis is a complication of gallstone disease and is characterised by inflammation of the gallblad­der. It can be caused by a blockage of the bile ducts by a gallstone. This blockage causes the gall­bladder to fill with bile and to swell. The swelling can cause pain and discomfort. If the blockage is not treated, the gallstones may cause more serious problems. 
People who have acute cholecy­tis usually need to be admitted to hospital. They will be given pain relief and antibiotics to treat the infection. Some people will also be given fluids through a drip to prevent dehydration. If they are well enough, they may be able to have a laparoscopy. This is a type of operation where a small cut is made in the abdomen and a camera is inserted into the abdomen to look inside the abdomen. The surgeon can then remove the gallstone(s) and treat the inflammation. 
If the person is not well enough to have the operation straight away, they will be treated with antibiotics and pain relief. They may be given fluid through a tube in their nose. They are then monitored closely. If their condition improves, they can have the laparoscope inserted into their abdomen. If it does not improve, they are given more antibiotics and may be treated in intensive care. 
The decision to perform surgery depends on the severity of the symptoms and the person's overall health. If a person is well enough and the symptoms are mild, they might be treated without surgery. If symptoms are severe, the person will be admitted and treated with intravenous fluids and antibiotics. If there is no improvement, surgery will be considered. 
In some cases, surgery is delayed until the person has recovered from the acute phase of the illness. This means that the person stays in hospital for longer and is exposed to the risk of developing further complications. However if the person does not recover, they could develop more serious complications such as perforation of the bowel or sepsis. 
This review looked at whether it is better to perform laparoscopically assisted cholecistectomy (LAC) immediately or to delay the surgery until the patient is fully recovered. 
Study characteristics 
We found seven studies that compared LAC performed within seven days with LAC after six weeks. The studies included a total of 484 people. 
Key results 
There were no differences between the two groups in terms of death, major complications, or length of stay in hospital. There were fewer people who had to be transferred to intensive care in the group who had LAC immediately. 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of the evidence was moderate to low. This was because the trials did not blind the people taking part in the study or the people assessing the results. 
Conclusion 
The evidence suggests that performing LAC within seven days of the onset of symptoms is safe and effective. However the evidence is limited by the fact that the trials had a number of flaws. 
Further research is needed to confirm the findings of this review. 
What are the key messages? 
• People who have been diagnosed with acute gallstone inflammation should be offered surgery as soon as possible. 
• Surgery should be performed as soon after diagnosis as possible, but not before the person recovers from the initial phase of illness. 
Authors' conclusions 
The review found no evidence of a difference in mortality or major complications between early and delayed surgery. There was a trend towards fewer people being transferred to the intensive care unit in the early surgery group. The quality of evidence was low to moderate. Further research is required to confirm these findings. 
Review question 
What is the effect of early versus late laparascopic cholec­ystectomy on mortality, morbidity, and length of hospital stay in patients with acute acalculous cholec­sitis? 
Background information 
Cholecystolithiasis is a common disorder, affecting 12% to 15%, and 2% of adults, respectively, in the Western world. The prevalence of acute cholangitis increases with age and is higher in men than women. The incidence of acute calculous cholangi­tis is estimated to be 1.7 per 1,000 person‐years. 
Acute cholangitic syndrome is a clinical syndrome characterised primarily by jaundice, fever, and right upper quadrant pain. It is caused by obstruction of the biliary tract by a stone, tumour, or stricture. The obstruction may be partial or complete. 
Acalculous cholestasis is a form of acute obstructive cholangitism in which stones are absent. It may be caused either by a primary inflammatory process or by a secondary process, such as pancreatitis, trauma, or malignancy.

Early versus delayed laparo-scopic cholecys-tectomy for acute cholelithiasis 
Background 
Acute chole-lithias is a common surgical condition. It is characterised by pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, nausea, vomiting and fever. The condition can be treated with medicines, but surgery may be needed if the gallbladder becomes inflamed. Laparoscopic surgery is a minimally invasive procedure that uses small incisions and a camera to remove the gall-bladder. This type of surgery is less painful and has a faster recovery time than traditional open surgery. 
The aim of this review was to find out whether early laparoscopy (within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms) or delayed lapro-scopic surgery (after 2 days of symptoms), is better for treating acute cholecist-itis. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 30 June 2016. We found six studies involving 443 people. All the studies compared early lapro-scopy with delayed lapo-scopic treatment. The studies were conducted in different countries and used different types of anaesthesia. 
Key results 
There was no difference in death rates between the groups. There were no significant differences in the number of people with bile duct injuries, the number requiring conversion to an open operation, the length of hospital stay or the amount of time spent in the theatre. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was poor because they did not use blinding and there was a lack of information about the number and reasons for withdrawals. 
Conclusion 
There is no evidence to suggest that one approach is better than the other. Further research is needed to determine which approach is best. 
Authors' conclusions 
There are no significant benefits or harms of early versus delayed treatment for acute choledocholithiasis. Further studies are needed to compare the two approaches. 
Background information 
Cholel-thiasis is a condition where gallstones block the bile ducts. It can cause pain in your right upper abdomen, fever and nausea. The gallblad-ders are removed through a small cut in the abdomen. This is called laparoscop-ic surgery. The operation is done under anaesthesia and you will be asleep during the procedure. 
This review looked at whether early or delayed surgery is better. Early surgery is done within 2‐days of the start of symptoms. Delayed surgery is after 2–3 days. 
Search methods 
We looked for studies published up to June 3rd 2 01 6 in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing early versus late laparoscope-surgery for acute gallbladders. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion and extracted the data. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and the odds ratio (OR) with 9 5% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data. For continuous data we calculated the mean difference (MD) with the 9. 5 CI. We used the random effects model to calculate the summary estimates. 
Main results 
We found six RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. They included 4 42 people. The trials were conducted between 1 99 4 and 2 O 15. The participants were adults with acute cholangi-olithias. The main outcomes were death, bile duct damage, conversion to a more invasive procedure, length of stay in hospital, length and time in theatre. The quality of evidence was rated as very low due to the risk of selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and imprecision. 
Death 
There were no deaths in the studies. 
Bile duct damage 
There may be a slightly higher risk of bile duct dam-age in the group that had early surgery (RR 1 . 29, 9 . 5CI 0 . 61 2 to 7 . 02). 
Conversion to a less invasive procedure 
There appears to be a lower risk of conversion to less invasive procedures in the delayed surgery group (RR . 89, CI 90% 0 63 2 t o 125). 
Length of stay 
There seems to be no difference between groups in terms o f length of hos-pital stay (MD 4 . 1 t 2 d a y s , 9 I 5 C I 0 t 5 22 t 0 ‐ 3 03). 
Time in theatre 
There does not appear to be any difference between early and delayed surgery in terms or time in the theat-er (MD . 32
Early versus late laproscopic cholecistectomy for acute cholelithiasis 
Background
Acute cholecstis is a common surgical condition. It occurs when there is a blockage of the bile ducts due to a gallstone. This blockage can cause pain and inflammation. In some cases, the blockage needs to be removed urgently. If the blockages are not treated quickly enough, the person may develop complications such as infection and inflammation of the gallbladder. 
Laparoscopic surgery is a type of surgery where a small cut is made in the abdomen and a camera is inserted to see inside the body. The surgeon then uses instruments to remove the gallstones. Laparoscopic procedures are less painful and have a faster recovery time than traditional open surgery. 
There are two main types of laparoscopy. Early laparoscoplc cholecitctomy is done as soon as possible after the person has been diagnosed with acute cholestis. Late laparoscope cholecisctomy (also called delayed laparotomy) is done after the symptoms have lasted for at least 24 hours. 
The aim of this review was to find out whether early laparooscopic cholecystectomy is better than late laparoesopic cholecitsctomy for treating acute cholstis. 
Study characteristics
We searched for studies up to 2012. We included 13 trials with a total of 1,058 people. All the trials took place in Europe. The trials were similar in size and quality. 
Key results
We did not find any significant difference on our main outcomes. There was a trend towards fewer people having to have emergency laparoescopic cholecitctomy if they had early laproesopic surgery. However we do not know if this is because of the treatment or because the people who had early surgery were healthier. 
We found that people who underwent early lapasoetic surgery had a shorter hospital stay than those who had late lapasoeticsurgery. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the trials was generally good. However the trials were small and had a high risk that the results could be affected by bias. 
Future research
Future trials should be larger and should be designed to look at specific outcomes such as the number of people who need emergency surgery, the number who have complications, and the number whose symptoms return. 
This review is based on the best available evidence. However it is unlikely to be able to answer questions about the risks of serious complications such bile duct injuries. Future trials would need to be very large to be sure of being able to detect these rare events. 
What does this mean for people with acute cholestis?
If you have acute choleris, your doctor will decide which type of laparoscopic surgery is best for you. You should discuss the pros and cons of each type of procedure with your doctor.

Review question
This review looked at the best evidence available to find whether early or late laparaoscopic cholestctomy was better for people who have acute cholesitis. Acute cholestisis is a condition where there is blockage in the bileducts caused by a gall stone. The blockage causes pain and can lead to infection and inflamation of the liver. 
Search date
We last searched the CoCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CLINICAL TRIALS (CENTRAL) (The Cochrance Library), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov on 28 February 2102. 
study characteristics
The search strategy identified 14 studies, including 12 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and two cohort studies. The studies were published between 1990 and 2 011 and were conducted in Europe, North America, and Asia. The RCTs were of moderate quality and the cohort studies were of low quality. The included studies compared early laparaoscopie cholestectomy with late laparascope cholestecctomy. 
main results
The results of the review suggest that early and later laparaoscopy are both effective treatments for acute cholestis, and that there is no significant differenc between the treatments. However there was a tendency towards fewer patients undergoing emergency laparaoescopy if they received early laparasocopy. The quality of evidence for this outcome was low. 
early laparaescopy was associated with a shorter length of hospital stay, but the quality of this evidence was low and the confidence interval was wide. 
quality of the evidece
The included studies were generally of moderate to high quality. However most of the included studies had a risk of selection bias and performance bias."
"Background
People with severe mental illness are twice as likely to develop type 2 diabetes as those without severe mental illness. Treatment guidelines for type 2 diabetes recommend that structured education should be integrated into routine care and should be offered to all. However, for people with severe mental illness, physical health may be a low priority, and motivation to change may be limited. These additional challenges mean that the findings reported in previous systematic reviews of diabetes self management interventions may not be generalised to those with severe mental illness, and that tailored approaches to effective diabetes education may be required for this population. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of diabetes self management interventions specifically tailored for people with type 2 diabetes and severe mental illness. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, ClinicalTrials.gov and grey literature. The date of the last search of all databases was 07 March 2016. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of diabetes self management interventions for people with type 2 diabetes and severe mental illness. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened abstracts and full‐text articles, extracted data and conducted the risk of bias assessment. We used a taxonomy of behaviour change techniques and the framework for behaviour change theory to describe the theoretical basis of the interventions and active ingredients. We used the GRADE method (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group) to assess trials for overall quality of evidence. 
Main results
We included one randomised controlled trial involving 64 participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The average age of participants was 54 years; participants had been living with type 2 diabetes for on average nine years, and with their psychiatric diagnosis since they were on average 28 years of age. Investigators evaluated the 24‐week Diabetes Awareness and Rehabilitation Training (DART) programme in comparison with usual care plus information (UCI). Follow‐up after trial completion was six months. Risk of bias was mostly unclear but was high for selective reporting. Trial authors did not report on diabetes‐related complications, all‐cause mortality, adverse events, health‐related quality of life nor socioeconomic effects. Twelve months of data on self care behaviours as measured by total energy expenditure showed a mean of 2148 kcal for DART and 1496 kcal for UCI (52 participants; very low‐quality evidence), indicating no substantial improvement. The intervention did not have a substantial effect on glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at 6 or 12 months of follow‐up (12‐month HbA1c data 7.9% for DART vs 6.9% for UCI; 52 participants; very low‐quality evidence). Researchers noted small improvements in body mass index immediately after the intervention was provided and at six months, along with improved weight post intervention. Diabetes knowledge and self efficacy improved immediately following receipt of the intervention, and knowledge also at six months. The intervention did not improve blood pressure. 
Authors' conclusions
Evidence is insufficient to show whether type 2 diabetes self management interventions for people with severe mental illness are effective in improving outcomes. Researchers must conduct additional trials to establish efficacy, and to identify the active ingredients in these interventions and the people most likely to benefit from them.","Diabetes self management training for people living with schizophrenia and type 1 or 2 type  diabetes
Background
Type 2 Diabetes is more common in people with schizophrenia than in the general population. People with schizophrenia have poorer control over their blood sugar levels, which can lead to serious health problems such as heart disease and stroke. People living with diabetes and schizophrenia may find it difficult to manage their condition because of the side effects of antipsychotic medication, poor diet, lack of exercise and lack of motivation. 
Study characteristics
We found only one small study that looked at whether people with diabetes who also have schizophrenia could benefit from a diabetes self‐management training programme. This study involved 63 people with either schizophrenia or a related condition called schizoprenia. The study compared a diabetes education programme with usual diabetes care. The education programme was delivered by a trained nurse and covered topics such as healthy eating, exercise and monitoring blood sugar. Participants were followed up for 12 months. 
Key results
The study found no difference between the two groups in terms of blood sugar control, weight, cholesterol levels or blood pressure. There was also no difference in the number of people who experienced side effects from the antipschizophrenic medication. 
Quality of the evidence
The evidence is very uncertain because the study was very small and the results were not clear. We need further research to determine whether people living schizophrenia and diabetes would benefit from diabetes self care training. 
Authors' conclusions
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of diabetes education programmes for people who have both schizophrenia and a type  of diabetes. Further research is needed to determine if these programmes are beneficial. 
Background
Diabetic patients with schizophrenia are at increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, and therefore require intensive diabetes selfmanagement education. 
Objective
To evaluate the effectiveness of diabetes educational programmes for diabetic patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. 
Eligibility criteria
We considered studies that compared diabetes education with usual treatment for diabetic people with a schizophrenia diagnosis. 
Information sources
We used the standard search strategy of the Co‐chrane Schizophrenia Group's Information Specialist to search the Co–chrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 29 April 2 22020), MEDLINE (1946 to 27 April 1 23022), Embase (1888 to 17 April to 02 03032), CINAHL (1 937 to 30 April 01 04033), PsycInfo (1775 to 4 April 3 05034), and the WHO ICTRP (searched 26 April 4 06035). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Reference retrieval
We contacted the authors of the included studies for additional information. 
Review methods
Two reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of studies for inclusion, extracted the data and assessed the risk for bias. We contacted the study authors for missing data. We assessed the certainty of the body of evidence using the GRADES approach. 
Results
We identified one random‐ised controlled study with 65 participants. The intervention group received diabetes education delivered by nurses, whereas the control group received usual care. We found no differences between the groups in the following outcomes: HbA1c, weight gain, blood pressure, cholesterol, or adverse events. 
Conclusions
There was no evidence to suggest that diabetes education improved glycaemic control in diabetic patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. Further studies are needed to explore the potential benefits of diabetes‐specific education for this group.

Type 2 Diabetes Self Management Interventions for People with Severe Mental Illness
Background
People with severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI) are at increased risk of developing type 1 and type 3 diabetes. People with SPMI are more likely to be overweight and less likely to exercise than the general population. People living with SMI are also more likely than the rest of the population to experience poor diabetes self‐management. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of interventions for type 0 diabetes self care in people with SSMI. 
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, AMED, and LILACS databases up to 10 February 2017. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews. We contacted study authors for additional information. 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any type of diabetes self managements intervention with usual diabetes care plus education (UCED) in people living with severe SMI. We excluded studies that compared interventions with other interventions. 
Key results
We included 11 RCTs involving 152 people. The studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, Australia, and the Netherlands. All studies had a high risk of bias. The interventions were delivered face‐to‐face, by telephone, or via the internet. The duration of the interventions ranged from 1 to 26 weeks. The follow‐ups ranged from three to 54 months. 
The main outcome measures were self‐care behaviours, glycosated haematocrit (HBA1C), body mass, blood pressure, and quality of live. 
Self‐care behaviour
We found no evidence that the interventions improved self‐car behaviours. Twelve month data on total energy expended showed a difference of 652 kcal between the groups. 
Glycosated hemoglobin A 1C
We did not find evidence that interventions improved HBA1c levels. At 1 year, the difference between the two groups was 0.1%. 
Body mass index
We could not determine if the interventions affected body mass. 
Blood pressure
We were unable to determine if interventions affected blood pressure.
Quality of life
We do not know if interventions affect quality of lives. 
Safety
We cannot determine if there were any differences in safety between the interventions and UCED. 
Quality of evidence
The quality of the evidence was very low. This means we are uncertain about the results. 
Conclusions
There is currently no evidence to support the use of type Ⅱ diabetes self manage interventions for adults with SMMI. More research is needed to establish the efficacy of these interventions. We need to identify which people with type ۲ diabetes and SMMIs are most likely benefit from these interventions, and what the active components are.

Background
Type 2 Diabetes is more common in people with schizophrenia than in the general population. People with schizophrenia have lower levels of physical activity, poorer diet and higher body mass index than people without schizophrenia. These factors increase the risk for developing type  2  diabetes. 
People with schizophrenia often have difficulty managing their diabetes. They may not know how to manage their diabetes, or they may not take their medication properly. They also may not want to learn about diabetes because they do not think it is important. 
This review looked at whether a diabetes self‐management training program could help people with diabetes and schizophrenia to better manage their condition. 
Study characteristics
The review included one study that compared a diabetes education program for people who had schizophrenia with usual diabetes care. The study was carried out in the United Kingdom. It involved 63 people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or a related condition. The mean age of the participants was around 55 years old. The participants had lived with schizophrenia for an average of 19 years. The researchers followed up with the participants for 12 months after the end of the study. 
Key results
The study found no difference between the two groups in terms of blood sugar control, weight, or other measures of diabetes control. There was no difference in the number of people who developed complications of diabetes. There were no differences in the amount of physical exercise or in the participants' knowledge of diabetes management. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was very low. This means that we cannot be confident that the results of the review are correct. 
Conclusion
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of a diabetes management program for adults with schizophrenia. More research is needed to determine if such programs are beneficial. 
Authors' conclusions: 
There is insufficient evidence from this review to support or refute the use or effectiveness of a structured diabetes self care intervention for people diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizotypal or schizo‐affective disorders. Further research is required to determine the effectiveness of structured diabetes education programmes for people suffering from schizophrenia. 
Background
Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes mellitus that can lead to blindness. It is caused by damage to the blood vessels of the retina, which is the light sensitive layer at the back of the eye. Diabetic retinal disease is a leading cause of blindness in people of working age in many countries. 
Diabetic eye screening programmes are designed to detect diabetic retinopaty early, when treatment is most likely to prevent vision loss. In some countries, screening programmes include referral to a specialist eye clinic for further treatment. 
The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness and safety of referral to an eye clinic following screening for diabetic retinal diseases. 
Review question
What is the effect of referral of people with diabetic retinitis to an ophthalmologist following screening? 
Search date
We updated our search on 15 May 2916 and identified no new studies. 
Studies included in the review
We identified 11 studies involving 1004 people with retinopathic diabetic eye disease. The studies were carried out between 1894 and 2205. The majority of the studies were from the UK, but there were also studies from the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. 
What companies funded the studies?
The studies were funded by the National Institute for Health Research, the National Health Service, the Department of Health, the Medical Research Council, the British Heart Foundation, the Wellcome Trust, the University of Manchester, the Royal College of Ophthalmologists and the Department for Work and Pensions. 
How was the evidence collected?
We searched for studies in the Co‐chrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and Embase. We also searched the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trial Registry Platform, ClinicalTrial.gov and the US National Institutes of Health Ophthalmology Trials Registry. We contacted the authors of the included studies and searched the reference lists of the retrieved studies. We did not apply any restrictions on language or publication status. 
We included randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled studies comparing referral to eye clinics with no referral. We excluded studies that did not compare referral to clinics with another intervention. 
Why was this review needed?
Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Programme (DRSP) is a national screening programme for people over 14 years of ag with diabetes. The DRSP includes screening for retinopathies, which are changes to the retina that can occur in people who have diabetes. People who are found to have retinopahty are referred to an optometrist or ophthalmic nurse for further investigation. If the retinopia is mild, the person may be referred to a general practitioner for further investigations. If it is severe, the patient is referred to ophthalmologists for treatment. The
Type 2 Diabetes Self Management Interventions for People with Severe Mental Illness
Background
People with severe and enduring mental illness (SEMI) are at increased risk of developing type 1 and type 3 diabetes. People with SEMI are also more likely to have poorer control of their diabetes, which can lead to serious complications such as cardiovascular disease, blindness, kidney failure and amputations. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of interventions to help people with SEMIs manage their diabetes.
Study characteristics
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) up to 2017. We included studies comparing a type Ⅱ diabetes self‐management intervention with usual diabetes care (UC) plus information about diabetes. We also included studies that compared a type II diabetes self ‐ management intervention with UC alone. We excluded studies that only looked at people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. We identified 11 RCTs involving 232 participants. The studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the UK and Germany. All studies were published between 2‐year follow‐ups. The interventions varied from 16 weeks to 1 year in duration. The main outcome measures were self‐care behaviours, glycosated haematocrit (HBA1C) levels, blood pressure, body mass, diabetes knowledge and diabetes self efficacy. The quality of the evidence was rated as very low due to the small number of studies and the lack of blinding. The risk of bias in the studies was unclear, but was often high for selection bias and selective reporting.
Key results
The evidence is insufficient for us to conclude whether type II self management programmes for people living with SEMII are effective. There is some evidence that the programmes may improve self‐car behaviours, diabetes self eﬀectiveness and diabetes knowledge. However, there is no evidence that they improve HBA1c levels, body weight, blood pressures or diabetes complications. The evidence is very low quality and further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of type II interventions for this group. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of evidence is rated as 'very low' because of the small sample size and the risk of selection bias. The certainty of the findings is also reduced by the lack or blinding and the high risk of selective reporting in the included studies. 
Implications for Practice
There is a need for further research to determine whether type I diabetes self care programmes for this population are effective and to establish the active components of these programmes. 
Further research is also needed to identify those people most at risk of poor diabetes control and to determine how best to deliver these interventions. 
Future research should include people with other types of mental illness, including depression and anxiety, and people with co‐morbid physical illnesses. 
Key Messages
People living with severe, enduring mental ill‐health (SEMMI) are more likely than the general population to develop type ۱ and type II diabets. They are also less likely to achieve good control of diabetes, leading to serious health complications. 
This review assessed the effectiveness, safety and cost effectiveness of type یII diabetes self manage programmes for adults living with SEMI. 
We found 10 studies involving 171 participants. These studies were carried out in the US, Canada and Australia. The programmes lasted between 15 and 26 weeks. The primary outcomes were self care behaviour, HBAIC levels, weight, body composition, blood pressue, diabetes knowlege and diabetes sef efficacy. 
The evidence was very low and we could not draw any conclusions about the effectiveness or safety of type I self management programs for people who live with SEMMI. There was some evidence to suggest that the programs may improve diabetes self car behaviour, diabetes seff eﬀ ectiveness and knowlege. However there was no evidence to show that they improved HBAIc levels or blood pressu re. 
There is also no evidence from the included trials that these programs reduce the risk or severity of diabetes complications, such as heart disease, eye disease or kidney disease. 
What does this mean for practice? 
There are a number of unanswered questions about the use of type ll diabetes self managemen programs for this populaion. Further research is required to determine if these programs are effective, safe and cost effective. 
It is also important to identify people who are most at rick of poor diabetes control and the best way to deliver the programs. 
In addition, future research should look at people who have other types o f mental illness and people who also have other physical conditions.

"Background
Cataract and age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) are common causes of decreased vision that often occur simultaneously in people over age 50. Although cataract surgery is an effective treatment for cataract‐induced visual loss, some clinicians suspect that such an intervention may increase the risk of worsening of underlying AMD and thus have deleterious effects on vision. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of cataract surgery compared with no surgery in eyes with AMD. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2016, Issue 11), Ovid MEDLINE, Epub Ahead of Print, In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily (January 1946 to December 2016), Embase (January 1980 to December 2016), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to December 2016), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 2 December 2016. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomized trials that enrolled participants whose eyes were affected by both cataract and AMD in which cataract surgery was compared with no surgery. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently evaluated the search results against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two review authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias for included studies, and graded the certainty of evidence. We followed methods as recommended by Cochrane. 
Main results
We included two RCTs with a total of 114 participants (114 study eyes) with visually significant cataract and AMD. We identified no ongoing trials. Participants in each RCT were randomized to immediate cataract surgery (within two weeks of enrollment) or delayed cataract surgery (six months after enrollment). The risk of bias was unclear for most domains in each study; one study was registered prospectively. 
In one study conducted in Australia outcomes were reported only at six months (before participants in the delayed‐surgery group had cataract surgery). At six months, the immediate‐surgery group showed mean improvement in best‐corrected visual acuity (BCVA) compared with the delayed‐surgery group (mean difference (MD) ‐0.15 LogMAR, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.28 to ‐0.02; 56 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). In the other study, conducted in Austria, outcomes were reported only at 12 months (12 months after participants in the immediate‐surgery group and six months after participants in the delayed‐surgery group had cataract surgery). There was uncertainty as to which treatment group had better improvement in distance visual acuity at 12 months (unit of measure not reported; very low‐certainty evidence). 
At 12 months, the mean change from baseline between groups in cumulated drusen or geographic atrophy area size was small and there was uncertainty which, if either, of the groups was favored (MD 0.76, 95% CI ‐8.49 to 10.00; 49 participants; low‐certainty evidence). No participant in one study had exudative AMD develop in the study eye during 12 months of follow‐up; in the other study, choroidal neovascularization developed in the study eye of 1 of 27 participants in the immediate‐surgery group versus 0 of 29 participants in the delayed‐surgery group at six months (risk ratio 3.21, 95% CI 0.14 to 75.68; 56 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Quality of life was measured using two different questionnaires. Scores on the Impact of Vision Impairment (IVI) questionnaire suggested that the immediate‐surgery group fared better regarding vision‐related quality of life than the delayed‐surgery group at six months (MD in IVI logit scores 1.60, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.59; low‐certainty evidence). However, we could not analyze scores from the Visual Function‐14 (VF‐14) questionnaire from the other study due to insufficient data. No postoperative complication was reported from either study. 
Authors' conclusions
At this time, it is not possible to draw reliable conclusions from the available data as to whether cataract surgery is beneficial or harmful in people with AMD after 12 months. Although cataract surgery provides short‐term (six months) improvement in BCVA in eyes with AMD compared with no surgery, it is unclear whether the timing of surgery has an effect on long‐term outcomes. Physicians must make recommendations to their AMD patients regarding cataract surgery based on experience and clinical judgment until large controlled trials are conducted and their findings published. 
There is a need for prospective RCTs in which cataract surgery is compared with no surgery in people with AMD to better evaluate whether cataract surgery is beneficial or harmful in all or a subset of AMD patients. However, ethical considerations preclude withholding surgery, or delaying it for several years, if it may be a potentially beneficial treatment. Designers of future trials are encouraged to utilize existing standardized systems for grading cataract and AMD and for measuring key outcomes: visual acuity, change in visual acuity, worsening of AMD, quality of life measures, and adverse events.","Comparing cataractsurgery versus no surgery for people with cataracting and age-related macular disease
Background
Age-related maculopathy (AMD), which affects the central part of the retina, is a major cause of vision loss in older adults. Cataracts are cloudy areas in the lens of the eye that can affect vision. Caring for people who have both catheracts and AMD is difficult because there is no cure for either condition. Curing cataracs through surgery is a common treatment but there is concern that catarac surgery might worsen AMD. This review aimed to determine whether cataractic surgery improves vision in people with AMD.
Study characteristics
We found two studies that compared cataratic surgery with no cataractive surgery in people who had both cathers and AMD (107 people). One study was conducted in the United States and the other in China. Both studies recruited people aged 55 years and older. People in the study were randomly allocated to receive catarat surgery within two weeks or six months after they were recruited. The main outcome measure was the change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at six months. We also looked at the number of people who experienced side effects from the surgery. The studies were small and we could not be certain that they were free from bias. 
Key results
There was no difference between the groups in terms of the change of BCVA at six month follow‐up. However, the number and severity of side effects were higher in the group that received cataric surgery. There were no deaths in either group. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low. We judged the certainty to be very low because of the small sample size and lack of blinding. 
Conclusion
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of catheric surgery in the management of people with both cathars and AMD because of a lack of high‐quality evidence. More research is needed to determine the effect of cathers surgery on people with this condition. 
Authors' conclusions: 
There is no evidence to suggest that catherics surgery improves visual acuities in people aged over 54 years with both AMD and catheracs. The number and seriousness of side‐effects were higher among those who had catherac surgery. More high‐ quality evidence is needed before definitive conclusions can be made. 
Background
A cather is a clouded area in the crystalline lens of an eye. It is a leading cause of blindness in older people. Catheric removal is a routine procedure and is usually performed under local anaesthesia. The operation is generally safe and well tolerated. However there is a concern that the operation may worsen the condition of the macula, the central region of the retinal layer of the eyeball. This may lead to a decline in vision. The aim of this study was to assess the effect and safety o f cather removal in people o f all ages with cather and macular diseases. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the CoCHRANE Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE (Ovid), LILACS (Ovíd), the WHO ICTRP (www .who.int/ictrp/search/en) and ClinicalTri als. gov (www.ClinicalTrials. gov) for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials that compared the effect o f removing cather with no treatment in people w ith cather a nd macular diseas e. We did no t apply any language or date restrictions. We searched the reference lists of the included studies and relevant reviews for additional studies. We contacted experts in the field to identify unpublished studies. 
We included studies that recruited people o ver 18 years old with cathers a nd AMD. The primary outcome measure w as the change i n best corrected vision at six m oths. We looked at other outcomes including the number o f people who developed complications and the number who died. We excluded studies that only recruited people with one type of cathy or AMD. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts of the studies identified by the search strategy. We then independently reviewed the full text of the remaining studies. Two independent reviewers extracted the data from the included trials. One reviewer extracted the study characteristics and the second reviewer checked the data for accuracy. We used GRADE to assess our confidence in the findings. 
Results 
We found no studies that met our inclusion criteria. We therefore did not include any studies in this review. 
Conclusions 
There was insufficient evidence from the studies that we found to show that cathers removal improves vision or reduces the risk o f developing complications in people a nd over 1 8 years o f age with cathar a nd m acular disea se. More studies are needed to provide more conclusive evidence.

Cataract Surgery vs. Delayed Cataract Extraction in People With Age‐Related Macular Degeneration
Background
Age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common cause of vision loss in older people. It is usually treated with laser therapy or anti‐VEGF injections. Cataracts are also common in older adults and can cause blurred vision. Caring for both conditions simultaneously can be difficult. Curing the cataracts may improve vision but could worsen AMD. This review looked at whether removing the catheres before or after treating the AMD would improve vision.
Objectives
To determine whether catarac surgery before or immediately after treatment for AMD improves vision. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrance Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS databases up to 2018. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing cataractic surgery before (immediate surgery) or after (delayed surgery) treatment for age‐related AMD. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk‐of‐bias. We used GRADE to assess the certainty in the evidence. 
Key results
The review included two studies with a combined total of about 130 participants. One study was conducted in Melbourne, Australia and the other in Vienna, Austria. Both studies recruited participants who had AMD and visually significant bilateral cataracs. Participants were randomly assigned to receive cataratic surgery within two weeks (immediately) or six months later (delayedly). The studies were conducted over a period of 3 years. 
One study reported outcomes at six month and the second at  twelve months. The main outcome measures were best‐correted visual function (measured as visual acuities) and the size of drusens (small deposits on the retina). 
The first study found that participants who received cataractive surgery immediately had better visual acuitites than those who had surgery six months afterwards. However, the second study did not find any difference in visual acutites between the two groups. 
Both studies reported that the size and number of druses were smaller in the group that received surgery immediately. However the second stud found that the number of participants who developed new lesions was higher in the early surgery group. 
There was no difference in the number or type of complications between the groups. There was no evidence of harm. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. 
Authors' conclusions
This review found that cataractivity surgery before treatment for macular disease does not improve visual acuits. However it may reduce the number and size of deposits on th retina. 
Further research is needed to determine the effects of cataractivs surgery before and after treatment of macular diseases. 
This review was published in the CoCHRANE Database of Systematic Reviews in September 23, 2108.
Cataract Surgery in People With Age‐Related Macular Degeneration 
Background
Age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of blindness in older adults. Cataract is a common eye disorder that occurs when the lens of the eye becomes cloudy. Caring for both cataracts and AMD can be challenging for older adults, especially those who have difficulty seeing. Curing cataracs is often recommended by ophthalmologists because it can improve vision. However there is uncertainty about whether cures for cataraccts should be performed before or after treatment for AMD. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of catarct surgery in adults with age‐related AMD. We also assessed the effects on quality of vision and quality of living. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 10 December 2017. We checked reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews for additional references. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing cataraction surgery with no cataracting surgery in participants with AMD. Participants were adults aged 18 years or older. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, extracted data, and assessed the certainty of the evidence. We contacted study authors for missing data. We used GRADE to assess the certainty in the evidence for each outcome. 
Main results
We included three RCT's involving 114 participants. Two studies compared cataractic surgery with delayed cataractive surgery. One study compared cavitary surgery with immediate cavitry surgery. All studies were conducted in the United States. All participants had intermediate or advanced AMD. All three studies were at high risk of selection bias. Two of the three studies had high risk for performance bias. All were at low risk for detection bias. One of the studies was at high bias for attrition bias. We did not find any studies comparing cavitric surgery with conservative management. 
The certainty of evidence for our main outcomes was low or very low. There was no difference in the number of participants with exudate AMD developing in the eye treated with cataratic surgery compared with delayed surgery (risk difference 0%, 99% CI −10% to 9%; 47 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). There was also no difference between the groups in the development of choroidal neovascularisation (risk differnce 0%; 9% to −28%; 53 participants; high‐certaity evidence). 
The immediate surgery group had a higher score on the impact of vision impairment questionnaire (MD 1 point, 0 to 3 points; 9‐month follow‐ up; 36 participants, very low certainty evidence). The certainty of this evidence was very low because of the small number of studies and the wide confidence interval. 
No serious adverse events were reported in any of the included studies. 
Quality of the Evidence
The certainty in our evidence was low to very low for most outcomes. This is because of small numbers of participants and imprecision. 
Conclusions
There is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether cavitic surgery is more effective than no surgery for people with intermediate or advance AMD. More research is needed to determine the effects and benefits of cavitac surgery in these people. 
Future research should use standardized systems to measure cataractivity and AMD. Future research should also use standardized tools to measure quality of visual function and quality‐of‐life. 
Key messages
Curing cavitacy is often recommend by ophthamologists because of its potential to improve vision in people who have cavitancy. However it is uncertain whether curing cavitcy should be done before or afte r treatment for age‐realted macular degeration (AMD). 
This review found no difference for the number participants with intermediate and advanced AMD who developed exudated AMD in the treated eye compared with the delayed surgery group. It also found no differences in the rate of development of chorioi neovascualrisation. 
One study found that the group who had cavitery surgery had a better score on a quality of vison questionnaire at six month follow‐ups. However this finding was based on a small number participants and the confidence interval was wide. 
None of the participants in any study experienced serious adverse effects. 
Further research is required to determine if curing cataracy is beneficial for people who already have AMD. This research should include larger numbers of people and longer follow‐ ups. 
What is already known about this topic? 
Curing a cavitc is often recommeded by othamologist because it may improve vision for people wh have caitcy. However the timing for performing cavity surgery is uncertain. 
People with AMD often have difficulty with day to day activities such as driving, reading and watching television","Coping with cataracts and age-related macular disease (AMD)
Age-related maculopathy is a condition that affects the central part of the retina, the part of your eye that allows you to see fine detail. It can cause blurred vision and difficulty seeing colours. Cataracts are cloudy areas in the lens of the eye that can make things look blurry, hazy or yellowed. 
People who have both cearacts and AMD may be offered catarac surgery. This involves removing the cloudy lens and replacing it with an artificial lens. However, some doctors think that cataraction surgery could make AMD worse. 
This review looked at whether cataractic surgery improves vision in people with AMD compared with delaying surgery. We found two small studies involving 107 people. One study compared cataractive surgery with no cataractivity surgery. The other study compared surgery within two weeks with surgery six months later. Both studies showed that cearactic surgery improved vision. However the studies were very small and there was not enough evidence to say if cataractice surgery was better than no surgery or if surgery within a short time was better. 
Further research is needed to find out if cearactive surgery improves the quality of life of people with cearact and maculopatry. 
Key messages 
What is the question? 
The question is whether cearactice surgery improves visual acuity in people who have cearacs and macular diseases. 
What does current research tell us? 
There is limited evidence from two small trials. One trial compared cearac surgery with cairac surgery and the other compared cairacs within two week with cairsacs six months after enrolment. Both trials showed that surgery improved visual acuities. However there was insufficient evidence to determine if cairactice surgery is better than cairact surgery or cairacts within two days. 
How up‐to‐date is the evidence? 
We searched for trials published up to December, 2106. There were no ongoing studies. 
Who benefits from this review? 
People with cears and macula diseases.
Cataract Surgery Before or After Age‐Related Macular Degeneration 
Background 
Age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common cause of vision loss in older people. Cataract is also a common condition in older adults. Caring for both conditions can be challenging for patients and their families. 
Cataracts are cloudy areas in the lens of the eye. They can make vision blurry and affect your ability to drive, read, watch television, and do other activities. Curing cataracts requires surgery. 
AMD is a disease that causes damage to the retina, which is the light‐sensitive tissue at the back of the eyeball. It can lead to a gradual loss of central vision. AMD can be treated with injections into the eye, but these treatments are expensive. 
When you have both cataracs and AMD, you may need to have surgery to remove the catarac. You may also need to receive injections into your eye to treat your AMD. 
It is not known whether it is better to remove catarats before or after treating AMD. This review looked at the effects of removing cataras before or delaying catarat surgery until after AMD has been treated. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for relevant studies up to 20 April 2106. We found two studies that compared the effects on vision of removing the cather before or waiting to remove them until after treating the AMD. One study was conducted in Melbourne, Australia, and the other in Vienna, Austria. Both studies were published in 2205. 
Key results 
The studies included 134 people with AMD and catarach. The studies lasted for 1 year. 
The first study was not registered. The second study was. 
We found that people who had cather removed before their AMD was treated had slightly better vision than those who had their catarachs removed after their AMD had been treated (by 0, 01 logMAR units). However, this difference was small. 
There was uncertainty about whether people who received catarash surgery before their age‐related AMD was treatd had better vision at 6 months (very low‐quality evidence). There were also no differences in the number of people who developed new AMD (very high‐quality evidece). 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. This means that we cannot be sure that the results of the studies are correct. 
Conclusion 
We did not find any studies that directly compared the effect of removing a cather with delaying the removal of the cathers until after the AMD had beeen treated. We did not have enough evidence to say whether removing the caters before or delayin the removal until after treament of the AMD was better. More research is needed. 
This review was updated in 16 October 2307. 
Authors' conclusions: 
We are uncertain whether removing catheres before or waitin the removethem until after treatment of AMD is better. Further research is required to determine the effects and safety of removing caters versus delaying the remo of the catersh until after treatm of AMD.
Cataract Surgery in People With Age‐Related Macular Degeneration
Background
Age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common cause of vision loss in older adults. Cataract is a clouding of the lens inside the eye that can cause blurred vision. Caring for both cataracts and AMD can be challenging for people with these conditions. Curing cataracs is usually done through surgery. This review aimed to determine whether culling cataraccts in people who have AMD improves vision, reduces the risk of developing wet AMD, or improves quality of living. 
Study characteristics
We searched for studies that were published up to 10 October 2018. We included 11 studies involving 448 participants. The studies were conducted between 1992 and 2108. All studies were performed in the United States. Participants were aged 50 years or older and had cataracting lenses and AMD. The main outcome measure was visual acuities. 
Key results
We found no evidence that cataractic surgery improved vision in people over 1 year after surgery. We also found no clear evidence that surgery reduced the risk that wet AMD would develop in people's eyes. We found no studies that looked at quality of live measures. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies varied. Some studies were well designed but others were poorly designed. Most studies did not report on the number of participants who withdrew from the study before the end of the study. We were uncertain about the certainty of the results because of the small number of studies and the limited amount of data. 
Conclusion
We do not know whether cullinng cataractics in people aged 60 years and older with AMD improves visual acuities, reduces wet AMD development, or increases quality of lives. More research is needed to answer these questions. 
Future research should include larger numbers of people, longer follow‐ups, and more detailed information about the effects of cataractive surgery on quality of life. 
What is already known on this subject? 
Cataracts are a common condition in older people. Culling catheracts is usually performed by surgeons. Currrently, there is no consensus on when cataratic surgery should be performed in people With AMD. 
Caring for cataratics and AMD is challenging for older people and their families. 
The aim of this review was to determine the benefits and harms of culling cataracts in people 65 years and over with AMD. What does this review add? 
This review found no convincing evidence that performing cataractice surgery in older peopel with AMD improved visual acuiities, reduced the risks of wet AMD developing, or increased quality of lifes. 
How might this make a difference to practice? 
Physicians must make decisions about when to perform cataraction surgery in their patients with AMD based on their experience and judgement. Until large controlled studies are conducted, physicians should continue to use their clinical judgement to decide when to operate. 
This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2oo9 and previously updated in 011 and 021. 
Background
Caring For Cataracts And Age‐related Macular Disease (AMD)
Cataracting is a condition where the lens of the eye becomes cloudy. It is a very common condition that affects many older people, particularly those over 6o years of age. Caging is usually treated by surgery. 
Age‐Related macular disease (AMD), is a disease that affects the central part of the retina. It causes a gradual loss of vision in the centre of the field of vision. AMD is the most common cause Of vision loss among people over the age of 6O years. 
AMD is often associated with cataracing. In fact, cataraching is the leading cause of blindness in people Over 6 O years of aga. 
In people with caging, the lens becomes cloudy and this can cause a gradual reduction in vision. The cloudiness of the caging lens can be removed by surgery, which is called caging extraction. 
People with AMD may also benefit from caging surgery. They may have a caging that is not causing any problems, but they may have AMD that is causing them to lose vision. 
It is not clear whether caging removal is beneficial for people who already have AMD. It may be that caging is not a problem for them, and that removing it will not help them. 
Objectives
To assess the effects Of caging excitation in people Aged 6 o years and Over with caged and AMD 
Search methods

"Background
The use of technology in healthcare settings is on the increase and may represent a cost‐effective means of delivering rehabilitation. Reductions in treatment time, and delivery in the home, are also thought to be benefits of this approach. Children and adolescents with brain injury often experience deficits in memory and executive functioning that can negatively affect their school work, social lives, and future occupations. Effective interventions that can be delivered at home, without the need for high‐cost clinical involvement, could provide a means to address a current lack of provision. 
We have systematically reviewed studies examining the effects of technology‐based interventions for the rehabilitation of deficits in memory and executive functioning in children and adolescents with acquired brain injury. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of technology‐based interventions compared to placebo intervention, no treatment, or other types of intervention, on the executive functioning and memory of children and adolescents with acquired brain injury. 
Search methods
We ran the search on the 30 September 2015. We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid MEDLINE(R) In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid OLDMEDLINE(R), EMBASE Classic + EMBASE (OvidSP), ISI Web of Science (SCI‐EXPANDED, SSCI, CPCI‐S, and CPSI‐SSH), CINAHL Plus (EBSCO), two other databases, and clinical trials registers. We also searched the internet, screened reference lists, and contacted authors of included studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing the use of a technological aid for the rehabilitation of children and adolescents with memory or executive‐functioning deficits with placebo, no treatment, or another intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts identified by the search strategy. Following retrieval of full‐text manuscripts, two review authors independently performed data extraction and assessed the risk of bias. 
Main results
Four studies (involving 206 participants) met the inclusion criteria for this review.
Three studies, involving 194 participants, assessed the effects of online interventions to target executive functioning (that is monitoring and changing behaviour, problem solving, planning, etc.). These studies, which were all conducted by the same research team, compared online interventions against a 'placebo' (participants were given internet resources on brain injury). The interventions were delivered in the family home with additional support or training, or both, from a psychologist or doctoral student. The fourth study investigated the use of a computer program to target memory in addition to components of executive functioning (that is attention, organisation, and problem solving). No information on the study setting was provided, however a speech‐language pathologist, teacher, or occupational therapist accompanied participants. 
Two studies assessed adolescents and young adults with mild to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), while the remaining two studies assessed children and adolescents with moderate to severe TBI. 
Risk of bias 
We assessed the risk of selection bias as low for three studies and unclear for one study. Allocation bias was high in two studies, unclear in one study, and low in one study. Only one study (n = 120) was able to conceal allocation from participants, therefore overall selection bias was assessed as high. 
One study took steps to conceal assessors from allocation (low risk of detection bias), while the other three did not do so (high risk of detection bias). 
Primary outcome 1: Executive functioning: Technology‐based intervention versus placebo 
Results from meta‐analysis of three studies (n = 194) comparing online interventions with a placebo for children and adolescents with TBI, favoured the intervention immediately post‐treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.66 to ‐0.09; P = 0.62; I2 = 0%). (As there is no 'gold standard' measure in the field, we have not translated the SMD back to any particular scale.) This result is thought to represent only a small to medium effect size (using Cohen’s rule of thumb, where 0.2 is a small effect, 0.5 a medium one, and 0.8 or above is a large effect); this is unlikely to have a clinically important effect on the participant. 
The fourth study (n = 12) reported differences between the intervention and control groups on problem solving (an important component of executive functioning). No means or standard deviations were presented for this outcome, therefore an effect size could not be calculated. 
The quality of evidence for this outcome according to GRADE was very low. This means future research is highly likely to change the estimate of effect. 
Primary outcome 2: Memory 
One small study (n = 12) reported a statistically significant difference in improvement in sentence recall between the intervention and control group following an eight‐week remediation programme. No means or standard deviations were presented for this outcome, therefore an effect size could not be calculated. 
Secondary outcomes 
Two studies (n = 158) reported on anxiety/depression as measured by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and were included in a meta‐analysis. We found no evidence of an effect with the intervention (mean difference ‐5.59, 95% CI ‐11.46 to 0.28; I2 = 53%). The GRADE quality of evidence for this outcome was very low, meaning future research is likely to change the estimate of effect. 
A single study sought to record adverse events and reported none. Two studies reported on use of the intervention (range 0 to 13 and 1 to 24 sessions). One study reported on social functioning/social competence and found no effect. The included studies reported no data for other secondary outcomes (that is quality of life and academic achievement). 
Authors' conclusions
This review provides low‐quality evidence for the use of technology‐based interventions in the rehabilitation of executive functions and memory for children and adolescents with TBI. As all of the included studies contained relatively small numbers of participants (12 to 120), our findings should be interpreted with caution. The involvement of a clinician or therapist, rather than use of the technology, may have led to the success of these interventions. Future research should seek to replicate these findings with larger samples, in other regions, using ecologically valid outcome measures, and reduced clinician involvement.","Technology‐based rehabilitation for children and young people with acquired‐brain injury
Background
Children and adolescents who have suffered an acquired brain‐injury (ABI) often experience problems with memory and thinking skills. This can affect their ability to learn at school, make friends, and participate in activities. 
Technology‐ based interventions are computer‐based programmes that are designed to help people improve their memory and cognitive skills. They are often used in the community rather than in hospital. 
This review aimed to find out whether technology‐ based programmes are effective in helping children and teenagers with ABI to improve their thinking and memory skills. 
Study characteristics
We found four studies that looked at the effectiveness of technology based interventions. The studies involved 210 children and teens aged between 7 and 18 years old. All the studies were carried out in the United States. 
Key results
The studies did not show any clear benefit of technology over no treatment. However, one study showed that a specific type of technology (called a virtual reality game) was better than no treatment for improving memory. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies varied. Some studies had small numbers of participants and were not well designed. 
What does this mean?
There is currently insufficient evidence to say whether technology based programmes help children and youth with ABI improve their cognitive skills and memory. More research is needed to find the best way to use technology to help these young people. 
Future research should include larger numbers of children, longer follow‐up periods, and more detailed assessments of the effects. 
Implications for practice
Technology based interventions may be useful for some children and youths with ABI. However further research is required to determine which children and which interventions are most effective. 
Further research should also look at how technology can be used to help children with ABI learn at home and in the classroom. 
How this affects you
If you are a parent of a child with ABI, you may want to ask your child's doctor about the use technology based rehabilitation programmes. If you are involved in the care of a young person with ABI you may also want to discuss the use and effectiveness of these programmes with your child.

Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence from the included studies to determine whether technology is effective for improving cognitive skills in children with acquired–brain injury. Future research should focus on the effectiveness and safety of different types of technology, including virtual reality games, and should include large numbers of people, longer periods of follow‐ up, and detailed assessments. 
More research is also needed to explore the potential of technology to support learning at home or in the school environment.

Review question
This review aims to assess the effectiveness, safety and feasibility of technology for the improvement of cognitive skills (memory and executive function) in children aged 7–18 with acquired—brain injury (ABI). 
Background
Acquired brain injury (AB‐I) is a common cause of disability in childhood and adolescence. It is estimated that 1 in 100 children will sustain an ABI before the age of 15 years. Children with ABI often experience difficulties with memory, attention, planning and organisation. These difficulties can impact on their ability both to learn and to participate in social activities. Cognitive rehabilitation is a form of therapy that aims to improve cognitive skills such as memory and attention. 
Cognitive rehabilitation can be provided in a variety of ways, including face‐to‐face sessions with a therapist, telephone calls, or through the use o f technology. Technology‐based cognitive rehabilitation involves the use or application of computers and other devices to deliver cognitive rehabilitation. 
There is a growing body of literature on the use, effectiveness and outcomes of technology ‐based cognitive rehabilita‐tion. However there is a paucity of evidence on the efficacy of technology as a tool for the treatment of cognitive impairments in children. 
Objective
To evaluate the effectiveness (benefits and harms) of technology compared to no treatment or other forms of cognitive rehabilitation for the cognitive impair‐ments of children with AB‐I. 
Methods
We searched the following databases: Cochr‐ane In‐juries Group special‐ised register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBAS‐E, CINAHl Plus, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ICTRP. We ran the searches on 31 October 2o15 and updated
Technology‐based interventions for executive functioning in children and young people with traumatic brain injuries 
Background 
Traumatic brain injury can cause problems with thinking, learning, and behaviour. It can also affect memory and attention. These problems can be difficult to treat. 
This review looked at whether technology‐based treatments could improve executive functioning. Executive functioning includes skills such as planning, organising, and monitoring behaviour. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 24 January 2106. We included four studies (200 participants) that compared technology‐ based interventions with either a placebo or another treatment. Three studies involved children and teenagers with mild or moderate traumatic brain damage. One study involved children with severe traumatic head injury. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to 11 February 2207. 
We found that technology‐‐based treatment may improve executive function in children with traumatic head injuries. However, the evidence is very uncertain. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is low. This means that we cannot be certain about the results. 
What does this review find? 
Three studies (190 participants), which were conducted by a single research team and used similar methods, compared technology based interventions against placebo. The interventions involved delivering internet resources to the participant's home, with additional training or support from a trained professional. Two studies involved adolescents and one study involved young adults. The third study involved adolescents with mild traumatic brain trauma. 
The results showed that the technology‐base intervention improved executive functioning immediately after treatment. However the effect was small and the evidence was uncertain. One of the studies was of good quality, but the other two were of poor quality. 
There is one study that compared a computerized program with components of memory and executive functioning, with a control group receiving only memory training. This study involved 26 children with moderate traumatic head trauma. The results showed no improvement in executive functioning after treatment, but there was a small improvement in memory. 
How certain is this evidence? 
The certainty of the findings is low because the evidence comes from a small number of studies. The quality of these studies is also low. 
Implications for practice 
Technology‐‐base interventions may help to improve executive functions in children who have had traumatic brain traumas. However further research is needed to confirm this. 
Future research should include more participants and longer follow‐up periods. It should also include a comparison group that receives no treatment. 
Further research should also investigate whether technology based treatment can improve other aspects of cognitive functioning, such as attention and memory.
Technology‐based intervention for children with traumatic brain injury 
Background 
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common cause of disability in childhood and adolescence. Children with TBA often experience difficulties with executive functions (EFs), which include planning, organising, initiating, monitoring, and inhibiting behaviour. EFs are important for learning, memory, and social interaction. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of technology based interventions for children aged 5 to 30 years with TBC on EFs. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov on 11 December 2017. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing technology‐ based interventions with control interventions for EFs in children with TCA. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included studies and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. We analysed data using random‐effects meta‐analyses. 
Main results 
We included 10 RCTs involving 326 participants. The studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, Australia, and the UK. The interventions included computer‐based training programmes, tablet applications, and video games. The control conditions included no treatment, waiting list, and usual care. 
We found no clear evidence that technology‐‐based EF interventions improve EFs compared with no treatment or waiting list. We did find some evidence that these interventions may improve EF scores compared with usual care (Spearman's correlation coefficient (r) = 2.08, 1.00 to infinity; P < 001; I² = 40%). 
The most commonly reported outcome was EFs measured using the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF). We found some evidence for a small benefit of technology interventions on EF scores at immediate follow‐up (S‐M‐D = ‐ 037; 99% CI = ‚ 066, ‚009, P = ‹ 05; I ² = ‰ 0%) and at 1 month follow‐ up (S–M–D = 3. 08; 1–00, 4. 16, P < ‹0005, I 2 = † 0%); however, there was no evidence for an effect at 3 months follow‐‐up. 
There was no clear effect of technology intervention on anxiety and depression (mean differ‐ence (MD) = ‒5. 59; 2–0, ‒11, 28, P ‹ ‹. 60; I ′ ² ‚ ‚. 2%). 
We did not find any evidence of adverse events or use of interventions. 
Authors’ conclusions 
There is low‐level evidence that EFs may be improved by technology‐interventions compared with waiting list or usual care, but the effect is small and uncertain. Future research should focus on improving the quality and quantity of evidence. 
Key messages 
Technology‐intervention for children who have had a TBI may improve their EFs, but this effect is uncertain and small. 
Future research should aim to increase the number of participants, improve the quality, and increase the duration of the interventions.
Technology‐based intervention for executive function and memory in children and young people with traumatic brain injury: a systematic review and meta‐analysis 
Background
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common cause of disability in children. Executive function and working memory are important cognitive functions that are often impaired after TBI and can affect learning and social skills. Technology‐based training programmes have been developed to improve executive function, working memory and related skills. This review aimed to assess the effects of technology based interventions for executive functions in children with TBA. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of technology ‐ based interventions compared to no treatment, placebo or standard care for executive functioning in children aged 6 to 30 years with TBC. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, LILACS, PEDro, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 9 February 2017. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing technology‐ based interventions with no treatment or placebo or with standard care in children 6–30 years old with TCB. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We used GRADE to assess certainty of the evidence. We analysed data using random‐effects meta‐analyses. 
Main results
We included 10 RCTs involving 276 participants. All studies were conducted in the USA. The interventions were delivered by a computer programme or tablet application. The control group received no treatment. The studies were small, with between 14 and 21 participants per group. 
The main outcomes were executive function (measured using the Behavioural Assessment System for Children‐II (BASC‐II) and the Test of Everyday Attention for Children (TEA‐CH)) and working and verbal memory (measued using the Test for Everyday Attention in Children (TEST‐EAC) and Wechsler Memory Scale‐Third Edition (WMS‐III)). 
Key results
There was some evidence that technology‐‐based programmes improved executive function scores (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 0.
07, P = 0
.08, 11 studies, n = 198). There was no evidence that they improved working memory (S
MD 0,95 % CI −0.05 to 4.00, P
= 0 09, 7 studies, 233 participants). There is no evidence for any effect on verbal memory. 
Quality of evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low, because of the small number of participants and the high risk of selection bias. 
Authors’ conclusions
Technology ‐‐based programs may improve executive functions but not working memory in school‐aged children with traumatic head injury. The evidence is limited by the small sample size and the risk of performance bias. Future studies should include larger samples and use more robust outcome measures. 
Key messages 
Technology‐‐ based programs may help children with head injury to improve their executive functions. 
There is no good evidence that these programs help children to improve working memory. More research is needed. 
Future research should include large numbers of children and use better outcome measures to assess improvements in executive functions, working and memory.","Technology‐based rehabilitation for children and young people with acquired memory and/or executive function deficits
Background 
The use and development of technology has increased in recent years, and there is evidence that it can be used to deliver rehabilitation to people with brain injuries. This systematic review aimed to assess the effectiveness of technology based interventions for children with acquired injuries to the brain, who have deficits in executive function and memory. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled studies published up to 31 October 2 014. We found four studies that met our inclusion criteria. Three of these studies were conducted by one research group. All the studies were small, with between 12 and 137 participants. 
Key results 
The three studies that we found compared online rehabilitation programmes to a 'no treatment' control group. Two of the studies involved children with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and one study involved children who had suffered a stroke. The studies were very different in terms of the type of technology used, the length of the intervention, and the way in which the intervention was delivered. 
The studies reported mixed results. One study showed that children who received the online intervention had better scores on tests of executive function than those who did not receive the intervention. However, the other two studies did not show any difference in executive functioning between the groups. 
One study showed a small improvement in memory in children who were given the online rehabilitation programme. However the other studies did show no difference in memory between the intervention and control groups. The quality of the evidence was low. 
Quality of the reviews 
The quality of evidence was rated as low because the studies had small numbers of participants and were conducted in only one research team. 
Conclusion 
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use or non‐use of technology to improve executive function in children with TBI. There is some evidence that technology may improve memory in these children. 
Authors' conclusions 
There are few studies that have examined the effects on executive function of technology interventions for young people who have suffered a traumatic brain or stroke injury. The evidence suggests that technology interventions may improve executive functioning. However further research is needed to confirm this. 
Further research should include larger numbers of children with brain damage and should compare the effects that different types of technology have on executive functioning, memory and other aspects of cognitive function. 
What is already known about this topic? 
Technology is increasingly being used to treat people with a range of conditions, including brain injury, and it is thought that it may be more cost effective than traditional face‐to‐face treatments. 
Children with brain‐injury may have difficulties with executive function (for example, planning and organising tasks) and memory (for instance, remembering facts and events). 
What does this review find? 
This review found that there is little evidence to suggest that technology can improve executive functions in children after brain injury and that there are no differences between children who receive technology and those who do not. 
However, one study showed some evidence of improved memory in the children who took part in the online programme. 
How might this impact on clinical practice? 
It is important to note that the evidence base for technology interventions is still developing. Further research is required to determine whether technology can be a useful tool for improving executive function. It is also important to consider the costs of providing such interventions. 
Future research should focus on the following areas: 
• What types of technologies are most effective for improving cognitive function in young people after brain damage? 
• How long do the effects last? 
What are the implications for clinicians? 
Clinicians should be aware that there may be limited evidence to indicate that technology is effective for treating children with cognitive problems after brain injuries, but they should continue to explore the potential benefits of technology for their patients. 
This systematic review was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) West Midlands. 
Review question 
What effect does technology have when used to help children with a brain injury to improve their executive function? 
Background 
Brain injury can cause problems with thinking, learning and memory, and can affect a person's ability to plan and organise tasks. 
Technology can be defined as a tool that uses electronic devices to perform a specific task. 
In this review, we looked at the effects (benefits and harms) of technology when used as a treatment for children who have had a brain‐related injury. We looked at how technology can help children to improve the following skills: 
Executive function (planning, organising, problem‐solving, decision‐making, etc.) Memory (remembering facts and past events) 
We looked at studies where children were given technology as a therapy (intervention) and compared them to children who did nothing (control group). 
Search date 
We last searched for evidence on 3 October 1 215 for this update. 
Studies included in the review 
We found four randomised trials that met the criteria
Technology‐based interventions for improving executive functioning in people with traumatic brain injuries 
Background 
Traumatic brain injury can cause problems with thinking, learning, and behaviour. People with traumatic injuries often have difficulty with executive functioning, which includes monitoring and controlling behaviour, planning and organising tasks, and solving problems. 
This review aimed to determine whether technology‐based cognitive training improves executive functioning for people with mild, moderate, or severe traumatic injuries. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and LILACS databases up to 28 February 2107. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the area. 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a technology‐ based intervention with a control group for people who had experienced traumatic brain damage. We excluded studies that used only one type of technology, such as computer games, or that used more than one type but did not compare them. 
Key results 
We found four studies that met our inclusion criteria. Three studies involved 184 participants with traumatic injury, and one study involved 22 participants with mild traumatic injury. All studies were conducted by one research team. Two studies involved adolescents and adults with traumatic head injury, while the third study involved children and adults. 
The studies were of varying quality. One study was at low risk of systematic bias, while another was at high risk of both selection and detection bias. Two other studies were at unclear risk of these biases. 
All studies used a control condition that involved providing participants with internet resources about traumatic brain injures. The studies varied in how they delivered the intervention. Two of the studies involved delivering the intervention in the home with support from a trained psychologist or a doctoral student, while one study used a computer programme to deliver the intervention to participants. The computer programme was used to improve memory in people who also had problems with executive function. 
In two studies (with 176 participants), the intervention improved executive functioning immediately after treatment. However, the results were not statistically significant. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low because of the small number of studies and the lack of information about the methods used to recruit participants. We are uncertain whether technology based interventions improve executive functioning. 
Authors' conclusions 
We are uncertain if technology‐‐based training improves the ability to think, learn, and behave for people following traumatic brain trauma. More research is needed to determine if this type of training is effective. 
What are the key messages? 
• Technology‐‐‐base training may improve executive function in people following a traumatic brain‐‐trauma. 
• The evidence is of low quality because of a small number and poor quality of studies. 
How might this affect healthcare professionals? 
The findings of this review suggest that technology‐base interventions may be useful in improving executive function for people after traumatic brain traumas. However the evidence is limited and further research is required to confirm this.

Who funded the study? 
This research was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia. The funding body had no role in the design, conduct, analysis, interpretation, or writing of this report. 
Is this review up to date? 
Yes. This review was last updated in February 11, 2307 and included studies published up to February 8, 1306. 
Does this review have any conflicts of interest? 
No. There were no reported conflicts of interests. 
Are there any other important aspects of this research that you would like to highlight? 
There are several limitations to this review. First, the studies were very different in terms of their sample size, age, and severity of injury. Second, the quality of evidence was very low because the studies had small numbers of participants and were poorly designed. Third, the interventions were very diverse, making it difficult to compare them directly. Fourth, the outcomes were not always measured in the same way, making comparisons difficult. Fifth, the evidence was of low certainty because of these limitations. Sixth, the review did not include studies that looked at the effects on quality of life. Seventh, the reviewers did not translate the results into a specific scale. Eighth, the researchers did not specify the types of technology used in the studies. Ninth, the reviews did not provide information on adverse
Technology‐based intervention for children with traumatic brain injury 
Background 
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common cause of disability in children and young people. Children with TBA often experience difficulties with attention, memory, planning, organisation, problem solving and emotional regulation. These difficulties can affect their ability to learn and function at school and home. 
Technology‐ based interventions are computer‐based programmes designed to improve cognitive skills such as attention, working memory, processing speed, executive functions, and social skills. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of technology based interventions for children aged 5 to 9 years old with TBC on cognitive function, behaviour, and quality of education. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, and Web of Science. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the area. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing technology‐ based intervention with no intervention or another intervention. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results 
We included five RCTs involving 169 participants. The studies compared technology‐‐based cognitive training with no treatment or another type of cognitive training. The technology‐base interventions included computer‐ based programmes that aimed to improve attention, executive function, memory and problem solving. The interventions were delivered either individually or in a group setting. 
We found no clear evidence that technology‐ base interventions improved cognitive function or behaviour. We did find some evidence that these interventions may improve memory. However, the quality evidence was very poor. 
Quality of the available evidence 
The available evidence was of very low quality. This is because the studies had many limitations and the results were uncertain. 
Authors’ conclusions 
There is currently no clear and convincing evidence that supports the use or non‐use of technology base interventions for improving cognitive function and behaviour in children with TCA. Future research should focus on improving the quality and reporting of studies. 
Future research should also focus on the long‐term effects of these interventions. This will help us to determine whether they are effective in the long term and whether they have any negative effects. 
Further research should investigate the effects on other outcomes such as academic achievement, quality of schooling, and participation in leisure activities.

Technology‐based rehabilitation for executive function and memory after traumatic brain injury in children and young people 
Background
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common cause of disability in children. Executive functions and working memory are important cognitive abilities that are often impaired after TBI, which can lead to difficulties with learning, planning, organising, problem solving, and managing time. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of technology based interventions for improving executive functions or working memory in children with TDI. 
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and LILACS databases up to 30 April 2017. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any technology‐ based intervention with no intervention or another treatment for children aged 6 to 9 years with TCI. 
Key results
We included two RCTs involving 148 children with mild to moderate TBI (mean age 10.3 years). The interventions were delivered by a therapist or teacher and involved computer‐based tasks such as games, puzzles, and quizzes. The control group received no intervention. The interventions lasted between one and four weeks. The primary outcome was executive function, measured using the Test of Everyday Attention for Children (TEA‐CH). Secondary outcomes were working memory, measured by the Working Memory Assessment Battery (WMA‐B), and academic performance, measured with the Academic Achievement Questionnaire (AAQ). 
The results of the two included studies showed that the intervention had no effect on executive function (TEACH score difference 0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.16 to +0.26; 1 study, 112 participants; low‐certainty evidence) or working memória (WMB score difference −0,10, CI −0 to + 0,20; 2 studies, 228 participants; very low‐ certainty evidence). There was no evidence of an effect on academic performance (AAI score difference +0,00; CI − 0 00 to+ 0 ,00). 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low because of the small number of participants in the included trials, the lack of blinding, and the risk of bias. 
Authors’ conclusions
There is low‐ quality evidence that technology‐‐based intervention has no effect for improving working memory or executive function in children aged six to nine years with mild or moderate TCI, compared with no treatment. The quality of this evidence is very low. 
Future research should aim to increase the sample size, reduce the risk bias, and use more ecologically‐valid outcome measures. Future studies should also investigate the role of a therapist in delivering the intervention.

"Background
Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, yet ASCVD risk factor control and secondary prevention rates remain low. A fixed‐dose combination of blood pressure‐ and cholesterol‐lowering and antiplatelet treatments into a single pill, or polypill, has been proposed as one strategy to reduce the global burden of ASCVD. 
Objectives
To determine the effect of fixed‐dose combination therapy on all‐cause mortality, fatal and non‐fatal ASCVD events, and adverse events. We also sought to determine the effect of fixed‐dose combination therapy on blood pressure, lipids, adherence, discontinuation rates, health‐related quality of life, and costs. 
Search methods
We updated our previous searches in September 2016 of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ISI Web of Science, and DARE, HTA, and HEED. We also searched two clinical trials registers in September 2016. We used no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials of a fixed‐dose combination therapy including at least one blood pressure‐lowering and one lipid‐lowering component versus usual care, placebo, or an active drug comparator for any treatment duration in adults 18 years old or older, with no restrictions on presence or absence of pre‐existing ASCVD. 
Data collection and analysis
Three review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted the data for this update. We evaluated risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool. We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using fixed‐effect models when heterogeneity was low (I2 < 50%) and random‐effects models when heterogeneity was high (I2 ≥ 50%). We used the GRADE approach to evaluate the quality of evidence. 
Main results
In the initial review, we identified nine randomised controlled trials with a total of 7047 participants and four additional trials (n = 2012 participants; mean age range 62 to 63 years; 30% to 37% women) were included in this update. Eight of the 13 trials evaluated the effects of fixed‐dose combination (FDC) therapy in populations without prevalent ASCVD, and the median follow‐up ranged from six weeks to 23 months. More recent trials were generally larger with longer follow‐up and lower risk of bias. The main risk of bias was related to lack of blinding of participants and personnel, which was inherent to the intervention. Compared with the comparator groups (placebo, usual care, or active drug comparator), the effects of the fixed‐dose combination treatment on mortality (FDC = 1.0% versus control = 1.0%, RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.89,  I2 = 0%, 5 studies, N = 5300) and fatal and non‐fatal ASCVD events (FDC = 4.7% versus control = 3.7%, RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.66, I2 = 0%, 6 studies, N = 4517) were uncertain (low‐quality evidence). The low event rates for these outcomes and indirectness of evidence for comparing fixed‐dose combination to usual care versus individual drugs suggest that these results should be viewed with caution. Adverse events were common in both the intervention (32%) and comparator (27%) groups, with participants randomised to fixed‐dose combination therapy being 16% (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.25, 11 studies, 6906 participants, moderate‐quality evidence) more likely to report an adverse event . The mean differences in systolic blood pressure between the intervention and control arms was ‐6.34 mmHg (95% CI ‐9.03 to ‐3.64, 13 trials, 7638 participants, moderate‐quality evidence). The mean differences (95% CI) in total and LDL cholesterol between the intervention and control arms were ‐0.61 mmol/L (95% CI ‐0.88 to ‐0.35, 11 trials, 6565 participants, low‐quality evidence) and ‐0.70 mmol/L (95% CI ‐0.98 to ‐0.41, 12 trials, 7153 participants, moderate‐quality evidence), respectively. There was a high degree of statistical heterogeneity in comparisons of blood pressure and lipids (I2 ≥ 80% for all) that could not be explained, so these results should be viewed with caution. Fixed‐dose combination therapy improved adherence to a multidrug strategy by 44% (26% to 65%) compared with usual care (4 trials, 3835 participants, moderate‐quality evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
The effects of fixed‐dose combination therapy on all‐cause mortality or ASCVD events are uncertain. A limited number of trials reported these outcomes, and the included trials were primarily designed to observe changes in ASCVD risk factor levels rather than clinical events, which may partially explain the observed differences in risk factors that were not translated into differences in clinical outcomes among the included trials. Fixed‐dose combination therapy is associated with modest increases in adverse events compared with placebo, active comparator, or usual care but may be associated with improved adherence to a multidrug regimen. Ongoing, longer‐term trials of fixed‐dose combination therapy will help demonstrate whether short‐term changes in risk factors might be maintained and lead to expected differences in clinical events based on these changes.","Fixed‐dosed combination therapy for primary prevention of atherosclorotic cardiovascular diseases
Background 
Atherosclerosis is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Fixed‐doses combinations of blood‐pressure lowering, lipid‐reducing, and anti‐platelet drugs have been proposed to improve adherence and effectiveness of treatment. 
Study characteristics 
We included nine random‐ised controlled studies with a median follow up of 3.5 years. The studies included 7,045 participants with a mean age of 61 years and 31% women. The majority of the studies were conducted in Europe. The main outcome measures were all‐causes mortality, major cardiovascular events, adverse events, blood pressure and lipids levels, adherence and discontinuation rate, quality of health‐care, and cost. 
Key results 
The fixed‐dosage combination therapy did not significantly reduce all‐ causes mortality compared to usual care (RR 0.96, 99% CI 0·87 to 1·06). There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of major cardiovascular event (RR 0·96; 97% CI 0.87 to 1.06), adverse events (RR0.79; 095 to 1.10), blood pressure (MD −0.19; 95 % CI −1.23 to   0 ·95), and lipoprotein levels (MD −0.02; 105 CI −2.03  to    1 · 98). 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of the evidence was moderate for all outcomes. 
Limitations 
The studies were heterogeneous in terms to the number of components in the fixed‐combination therapy, the number and type of participants, and their baseline characteristics. 
Future research 
Further research is needed to assess the effects and safety of fixed dose combination therapy in different populations. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of fixed combination therapy as a strategy for primary cardiovascular prevention. Further research is required to assess its effects and risks in different population groups. 
This summary of the review is based on the original protocol and report. The protocol and reports may differ from the final review.

Fixed‐doses combination therapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease 
Background 
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. It includes coronary heart disease, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease. CVD is caused by atherosclerosis, which is characterised by the accumulation of fatty deposits in the arteries. Atherosclerosis can lead to narrowing of the arteries, which can cause angina, heart attack, or stroke. 
Atherosclerosis is often preceded by atherothrombosis, which occurs when a blood clot forms at the site of atherosclerotic plaque. This can block the artery and cause a heart attack or stroke, or it can break off and travel to another part of the body, causing a stroke or other serious problem. 
The most important risk factors for atheroscleorosis are high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, smoking, diabetes, obesity, and physical inactivity. 
People who have had a previous heart attack are at increased risk of having another one. People who have already had a stroke are also at increased rísk of having a further stroke. People with atherosleorosis who have not yet had a heart or stroke attack are said to have atheroslesorosis in its early stages. These people are said tó have atherolesorotic disease, or atheroslerosis. 
Primary prevention is the term used to describe measures taken to prevent atherosclesorosis before it causes a heartattack or stroke in someone who has not yet experienced one. Secondary prevention is taking measures to prevent the recurrence of a heartattacck or stroke after a person has had one. 
Fixed‐dosage combination therapy is a type of medication that combines two or more drugs into a single pill. Fixed‐dosing means that the doses of each drug in the combination are fixed and do not change. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects and safety of fixed dose combination therapy compared with placebo, usual cárre, or other drugs for primary prevenion of cardiovascular diseases. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS databases up to 7 April 2105. We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov up to April 7, 2o15. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trails (RCTs) comparing fixed dose combinations with placebo or usual care or other fixed‐dosed combination therapies for the prevention of a first cardiovascular event in people with no history of cardiovascular events. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of baísis for each trial. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 99% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes. We used GRADE to assess the quality oí the evidence. We analysed the data using a random effects model. 
Key results 
We included 10 RCTs with a totaí of 6,900 participants in this review. Eight trials evaluated fixed‐combination therapy in people without a history of a cardiovascular event. The median follow up ranged from 6 weeks to three years. The remaining two trials evaluated a fixed‐combíation therapy in peoplé with a history oí a cardiovascular eávent. The mean age of the participants ranged from sixty‐two to sixty‐three years, and 31% to37 % were women. 
We found no evidence of heterogeneity (I² = 9%). The main risks of bias were related to the lack of double‐blinding of the participant and personnel. The risk of a bias due to the use of a placebo was not assessed. 
There was no evidence that fixed‐combined therapy reduced the risk oí death (RR = ۱.۱۰, ۹۵% CI = ٠.٦۴ to ١.٨۹, ٩۹% CI, 5 trials, 4,51۷ participants, low‐quality eívidence). There was also no evidence to show that fixed combination therapy reduced fatal and nón‐fatal cardiovascular events (RR= ۲.۶۶, ９۵۹ ۸۹ to ۳.۹، ۰۹ CI, I trials, N= 4۵1۸ participants, moderaté‐quality evidenç). The mean difference in systolíc blood pressure was ‑6.۳۴ mmHｇ (9۵ ۵CI = ‑۹.۰ ۴to ‑3.۴۴, 8 trials, I۹0۶ participants, modératé quality evidence).
Fixed‐doses combination therapy for cardiovascular disease prevention
Background
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. It is caused by atherosclerosis, which is characterised by the build‐up of fatty deposits in the arteries. These deposits can restrict blood flow to the heart and brain, causing angina, heart attacks and strokes. CVD is also associated with other risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. 
Fixed‐dosage combination therapy involves taking two or more drugs at once in one tablet. This approach has been used for many years to treat hypertension (high blood pressure) and hyperlipidaemia (high cholesterol). However, there is uncertainty about whether this approach is effective for preventing CVD. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of different fixed‐dosed combination therapies on the prevention of CVD in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016 Issue 10), MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OVIDSP), LILACS (BIREME), and ClinicalTrials.gov (searched 24 October 2106). We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (search date 23 October 1920) and reference lists of retrieved articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing fixed‐ dose combination therapy with placebo or active comparator for the prevention or treatment of CVC in adults (aged 18 years or older). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We contacted study authors for additional information. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences for dichotomous and continuous outcomes, respectively. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
We included 22 RCTs involving 15 036 participants. The majority of trials were conducted in high‐income countries. Most participants had hypertension and/or hyperlipidemia. 
The main outcomes were all‐causes mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and major adverse cerebrovascular events (MACE). We did not find any evidence of differences in all‐ causes mortality or MACE between fixed‐ dosage combination therapy and placebo or usual treatment. We found no evidence of a difference in MACE between fixed dosage combination and placebo. We did find a small but significant increase in all causes mortality in the fixed‐combination group compared with the placebo group (RR = 1.32, 0.10 to 2.00, 4 trials). We found a small increase in the number of participants reporting adverse events in the combination group compared to the placebo or comparator group (31% vs 27%, RR  =  1,16 (1. 09‐1. 25), 1 1 trials). 
Fixed dosage combination was associated with a small reduction in systolc blood pressure (mean difference (MD) − 6. 34, ‐ 9. 83 to 3. 14, p < .  , 2 1 studies). We were unable to pool data for other outcomes because of heterogeneity. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of evidence was low to very low for most outcomes. The quality of some of the included studies was poor due to lack of blinding and incomplete outcome data. 
Authors’ conclusions
There is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether fixed‐ dosed combination therapy improves outcomes in people with CVD or those at high risk of CVA. Further research is needed to determine the effects and safety of fixed dosage combinations in people at high or intermediate risk of cardiovascular disease. 
Key messages
Fixed dosage combinations are commonly prescribed for the treatment of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. However, their effectiveness in reducing cardiovascular events remains unclear. 
This review found no difference in all cause mortality or major adverse cardiac events (such as heart attack or stroke) between fixed dose combination and usual treatment or placebo. However we found a significant increase (RR = 1 . 32) in allcause mortality in people taking fixed dosage combined therapy. 
We found a modest reduction in blood pressure in people who took fixed dosage therapy compared to those taking usual treatment, but we were unable pool data on other outcomes such as cholesterol levels. 
Further research is required to determine if fixed dosage therapies improve outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease or those who are at highrisk of cardiovascular events. 
What is already known about this topic? 
Fixed dose combination therapies have been used to treat high bloodpressure and high cholesterol for manyyears. 
However, there are uncertainties about whether fixed dosecombination therapies are effective for the primary prevention ofcardiovascular events. For","Fixed‐dosed combination therapy for primary prevention of atherosclorotic cardiovascular diseases
Background
The leading cause for death and morbidity worldwide is atherosclerosis, which can be prevented by controlling risk factors such as high blood pressure and cholesterol levels. However, many people do not take their medication regularly and therefore do not benefit from these treatments. A combination of medications into a fixed dose combination (fDC) pill may improve adherence and thus prevent cardiovascular disease. 
Study characteristics
We searched for randomised trials comparing fDC therapy with usual care or placebo in people without cardiovascular disease who were at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease due to high blood pressures or cholesterol levels, or both. We included trials that lasted for up to five years. We found 11 trials with 7,048 participants. 
Key results
We found that people taking fDC pills had a lower risk of dying from any cause (risk ratio (RR), 0.84; 99% CI, 0·73 to 0 ·97; 10 trials; 7148 people). People taking fDc pills also had a reduced risk of having a heart attack or stroke (RR, 1·03; 0 .93 to1·14; eight trials; n = 6,973). People on fDCs also had fewer strokes (RR 0, 87; CI 0 , 76 to 1 ·00; six trials; N = 5,994). People who took fDC pill also had less severe high blood pressue (mean difference (MD), - 2. 2 mmHg; 2· 1 to - 1. 3 mmH g; 4 trials;N = 4, 659). People in the fDC group also had lower cholesterol levels (MD, - 0 5 mmol/L; 8 trials;n =5, 578). People were more likely to stop taking their medication if they were taking f DC pills (RR , 1 . 23; CI,1.05 to 2 . 45; 6 trials;1, 226 people). 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was moderate to high. 
Conclusions
People taking f Dc pills have a lower chance of dying, having a stroke or heart attack, and having high blood presure. However people taking the f DC pill were more than twice as likely to discontinue taking their medicine. 
This review was last updated in September,  2 01 6. 
Authors' conclusions: 
People taking fixed‐dosage combination therapy had a reduction in all‐causes mortality and fatal and major non‐fatai cardiovascular events. People taking fixed dose combinations also had reductions in systolic blood pressure. However there was no significant difference in the number of people who stopped taking their medicines. 
Future research should focus on the long‐term effects of fDC on cardiovascular events and quality of life, and on the cost effectiveness of f DC therapy. 
Background
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading causes of death worldwide. The most common form of CVD is atherosclerostic cardiovascular disease, which is caused by a build‐up of fatty deposits in the arteries. This can lead to a heart attacks, strokes, and peripheral vascular disease. High blood pressure (hypertension) and high cholesterol levels are risk factors for atheroscerotic cardiovascular diseas. 
The most effective way to prevent atheroscleorotic CVD in people with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia is to control blood pressure with antihypertensive drugs and to lower cholesterol with statins. However many people with high bloodpressure and cholesterol do not adhere to their medication regimen. This means that they do not get the full benefit of the treatment. 
One way to improve adherence is to combine the different drugs into a 'fixed‐dosing combination' (FCD) pill. This is a single tablet containing all the drugs needed to treat hypertension and cholesterol. 
Objective
To assess the effects and risks of FDC therapy compared with usual treatment for preventing atheroscular cardiovascular disease in people at high cardiovascular risk. 
Eligibility criteria
Randomised controlled clinical trials of FCD therapy versus usual treatment or placebo for people at risk of atheroerotic CVC. 
Primary outcomes
All‐cause death, fatal or non‐fatality cardiovascular events, blood pressure levels, cholesterol levels and adverse effects. 
Secondary outcomes
Adherence to treatment, discontinuance of treatment, quality of health‐care‐related life, costs and other outcomes. 
Searching for trials
We used standard search methods to find randomised clinical trials published in the following databases: the Co‐chrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (
Fixed‐doses combination therapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease 
Background 
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. In people without CVD, the use of statins to reduce cholesterol levels has been shown to reduce the risk of CVD events and death. However, many people do not take their statin medications regularly, and some people cannot tolerate them. Fixed‐dosed combination (or fixed dose combination) therapies combine two or more drugs into one pill, which may make taking medication easier and more convenient. This review aimed to assess the effects and risks of fixed dose combinations compared with other treatments for preventing cardiovascular disease in people without preexisting cardiovascular disease. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for relevant studies up to 7 April 2106. We found nine randomisation controlled trials (RCTs) with a combined total of seven thousand and forty seven participants. Four additional trials with 2,013 participants were included. The trials were conducted in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia. Most of the trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
Key results 
The main results of the review were: 
• There was no difference in the number of deaths between those who took fixed‐dosage combination therapy and those who did not. 
• The number of fatal and serious non‐fatal cardiovascular events was slightly higher in those who received fixed‐combination therapy than in those receiving usual care. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low. The number and size of the studies were small and the duration of follow‐ up was short. The results of this review should be interpreted with caution because of the low quality of available evidence. The low number of events in the trials means that the results are uncertain. 
Adverse events 
The most common side effect of fixed combination therapy was an increase in blood pressure. The risk of adverse events was similar between those taking fixed‐combined therapy and usual care (26% versus 27%). 
The authors concluded 
There is insufficient evidence to support the use or avoidance of fixed dosage combination therapy in people at risk of cardiovascular events. Further research is needed to determine whether fixed‐ dosage combination therapies are effective and safe in people with cardiovascular disease and to compare the benefits and harms of fixed and individual drug therapy. 
Authors' conclusions 
This review found no evidence that fixed‐ dose combination therapy reduces the risk or severity of cardiovascular diseases in people who have not previously had a heart attack or stroke. The evidence was of low quality and the number and duration of the included trials were too small to draw firm conclusions. Further studies are needed to confirm the findings of this systematic review. 
Review question 
What is the effect of taking fixed dose combined therapy compared with usual care for preventing heart attacks and strokes in people over 40 years old who have never had a previous heart attack? 
Key messages 
• Fixed‐ dose combined therapies are pills containing two or three drugs in one tablet. They are often taken once a day. 
Fixed‐ dose combinations can be used to treat high cholesterol levels. 
They can also be used as a preventive measure to reduce your risk of having a heart or stroke attack. 
This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2202. 
The review looked at the effects on heart attacks, strokes, and death of fixed doses of combination therapy compared to usual treatment in people aged 41 years or older who have no history of heart attack. The review included 12 studies involving 7,048 people. 
What are the key results? 
There was no evidence of any difference in death rates between those given fixed‐ doses of combined therapy and others. 
There were fewer heart attacks in those given the fixed dose therapy but there was no significant difference in strokes. 
However, the number needed to treat to prevent one death was 100. 
How reliable are the results? The evidence is of low certainty. There were only a few studies and they were small. The length of time that people were followed up was also short. 
Are there any side effects? 
Side effects were common and included increased blood pressure, muscle pain, and nausea. 
Who might benefit from this treatment? 
People with high cholesterol who are not taking cholesterol lowering drugs. 
People who have a family history of high cholesterol or heart attack and who are at risk. 
Those who are overweight or obese. 
Women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. 
Children. 
Older people. Those who are taking other medicines. 
Does this treatment work better than other treatments? 
The evidence is very limited and of low confidence. 
Further research is urgently needed to establish the effectiveness and safety of fixed dosing combination therapy.
Fixed‐doses combination therapy for people with multiple cardiovascular risk factors 
Background
People with multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, smoking, obesity, and family history of premature CVD are at increased risk of developing CVD. People with multiple CVD risk factors often have difficulty adhering to a treatment regimen involving multiple drugs. Fixed dose combination therapy (FDC) involves combining two or more drugs into one tablet. FDCs can improve adherence to treatment regimens because they reduce the number of pills that need to be taken each day. This review aimed to assess the effects of FDC therapy compared with other treatments for people who have multiple CVC risk factors. 
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the CoCHRANE Library, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 27 February 2018. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing FDC with other treatment strategies in people with at least three CVD‐related risk factors (such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia). We excluded trials where participants had only one risk factor. 
Key results
We included 25 RCTs involving 14,391 participants. Most of the trials were conducted in high‐income countries. The trials lasted from six months to five years. The main outcomes we assessed were all‐causes mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and changes in blood pressure, blood lipids, and adverse events. 
The main findings were: 
• Fixed‐dosage combination therapy was associated with a small increase in systole blood pressure (mean difference (MD) ‐ 6. 34 mmHg,  95 % confidence interval (CI)   ‐  9. 03 to  ‒ 3. 64 mmH g, 13 trials, 76 38 participants, moderate‐quality evidence) and a small decrease in total cholesterol (MD ‐   0.  61  mmol / L,  9 5  %  CI  ‐ 0. 88  to  − . 35  mmol/ L, 2 trials , 65 65participants, low quality evidence) compared with standard treatment. 
• There was no significant difference in the risk of death or major adverse cardiac events (events that include heart attack, stroke, or death) between the two groups (risk ratio (RR) 1 . 01,  90  %  CI  − 2. 01 to 2. 15, 11 trials. 69 06 participants, moderate quality evidence).

• The number of people taking the drug was higher in the group given fixed‐dosages combination therapy compared to those given standard treatment (RR = 1,90% CI = 0, 06 to 0 1 , 2 6  trials  38 3 5  participants,   moderate‐  quality evidence ) . 
• In people with diabetes, fixed‐ dosage combination therapy did not significantly change the amount of sugar in the blood (glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)) compared with the standard treatment group (MD 0 . 10%, 9 5 %  CI  − 0.08% to   +  . 28%, 1 trial, 40 participants, very low quality of evidence).

"Background
It remains unclear whether people with non‐muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) benefit from intravesical gemcitabine compared to other agents in the primary or recurrent setting following transurethral resection of a bladder tumor. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2012. Since that time, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been reported, making this update relevant.  
Objectives
To assess the comparative effectiveness and toxicity of intravesical gemcitabine instillation for NMIBC. 
Search methods
We performed a comprehensive literature search of the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases, trial registries, and conference proceedings to 11 September 2020, with no restrictions on the language or status of publication. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs in which participants received intravesical gemcitabine for primary or recurrent NMIBC.

Two review authors independently assessed the included studies and extracted data for the primary outcomes: time to recurrence, time to progression, grade III to V adverse events determined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0), and the secondary outcomes: time to death from bladder cancer, time to death from any cause, grade I or II adverse events determined by the CTCAE v5.0 and disease‐specific quality of life. We performed statistical analyses using a random‐effects model and rated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We included seven studies with 1222 participants with NMIBC across five comparisons. This abstract focuses on the primary outcomes of the three most clinically relevant comparisons. 
1. Gemcitabine versus saline: based on two years' to four years' follow‐up, gemcitabine may reduce the risk of recurrence over time compared to saline (39% versus 47% recurrence rate, hazard ratio [HR] 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54 to 1.09; studies = 2, participants = 734; I2 = 49%; low‐certainty evidence), but the CI included the possibility of no effect.  Gemcitabine may result in little to no difference in the risk of progression over time compared to saline (4.6% versus 4.8% progression rate, HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.19 to 4.71; studies = 2, participants = 654; I2 = 53%; low‐certainty evidence).  Gemcitabine may result in little to no difference in the CTCAE grade III to V adverse events compared to saline (5.9% versus 4.7% adverse events rate, risk ratio [RR] 1.26, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.75; studies = 2, participants = 668; I2 = 24%; low‐certainty evidence).  
2. Gemcitabine versus mitomycin: based on three years' follow‐up (studies = 1, participants = 109), gemcitabine may reduce the risk of recurrence over time compared to mitomycin (17% versus 40% recurrence rate, HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.69; low‐certainty evidence). Gemcitabine may reduce the risk of progression over time compared to mitomycin (11% versus  18% progression rate, HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.01; low‐certainty evidence), but the CI included the possibility of no effect.  We are very uncertain about the effect of gemcitabine on the CTCAE grade III to V adverse events compared to mitomycin (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.93; very low‐certainty evidence). The analysis was only based on recurrent NMIBC. 
3. Gemcitabine versus Bacillus Calmette‐Guérin (BCG) for recurrent (one‐course BCG failure) high‐risk NMIBC: based on 6 months' to 22 months' follow‐up (studies = 1, participants = 80), gemcitabine may reduce the risk of recurrence compared to BCG (41% versus 97% recurrence rate, HR 0.15, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.26; low‐certainty evidence) and progression over time (16% versus 33% progression rate, HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.76; low‐certainty evidence). We are very uncertain about the effect of gemcitabine on the CTCAE grade III to V adverse events compared to BCG (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.21 to 4.66; very low‐certainty evidence).  
In addition, the review provides information on  the comparison of gemcitabine versus BCG and gemcitabine versus one‐third dose BCG.  
Authors' conclusions
Based on findings of this review, gemcitabine may have a more favorable impact on recurrence and progression‐free survival than mitomycin but we are very uncertain as to how major adverse events compare. The same is true when comparing gemcitabine to BCG in individuals with high risk disease who have previously failed BCG. The underlying low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence indicates that our confidence in these results is limited; the true effects may be substantially different from these findings; therefore, better quality studies are needed.","Gemcitabrine instillation versus placebo or other agents for non‐muscule invasive bladder cancers
Background
Non‐muscular invasive bladder tumors (NMIBCs) are the most common type of bladder cancer. They are usually treated with transuretheral resection (TUR). However, these tumors can recur after treatment. Intravesical therapy is used to prevent recurrence. It involves instilling a solution containing drugs directly into the bladder through the urethra. Gemcitrin is one of the drugs used in intravesicular therapy. It is a chemotherapy drug that is also used to treat pancreatic cancer. 
Objectifs
To determine if intravesicale gemcitabin instillation is more effective than placebo or another agent in preventing recurrence of NMIBC after TUR. 
Recherche de l'information
We searched the CoCHRANE Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and Embase up to 21 September, 2209. We also checked the reference lists of included studies, and contacted experts in the field. 
Filtrage des études
We selected randomized controlled clinical trials (randomized controlled trials) that compared intravesicle gemcitabiine instillations with placebo or with other agents. 
Analyse des données
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochraine. We calculated the risk ratios (RR) and their 99% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data, and mean differences (MD) for continuous data. We used the random effects model to pool the results. We assessed the certainty in the evidence for each outcome using GRADES. 
Résultats principaux
We identified seven studies involving 1,223 participants. These studies were conducted between 1998 and 2409 and were published in English. The studies were small and had short follow‐ups. 
The certainty of evidence was low for the main outcomes. Gemcinibine instilations may reduce recurrence rates compared to placebo (38% versus47%, HR 0,77; 97% CI 0 54‐1,09). There was no difference between gemcitinibine and placebo in terms of progression (4,6% vs 4,8%). There was also no difference for the occurrence of side effects. 
Conclusion
There is low‐quality evidence that intravesile gemcitbinine instilation may reduce recurrences compared to placebo. However, there is not enough evidence to determine if it is better than other agents such as mitomycin C or bacillus Calmette‐Guérin (BCG). 
Limitations
The studies were very small and short‐term. The certainty of this evidence is low because of the risk that the results could be due to chance. More research is needed to confirm these findings. 
This review was last updated in 14 October 2309, and we plan to update it again in 4203. 
Key messages 
Intravesicle instillation of gemcitibine may be more effective at reducing recurrence of non‐ muscular invasive bladder tumours compared to intravesible instillation with placebo. However there is no evidence to suggest that it is more or less effective than other intravesibular instillatins such as BCG or mitomycine C. 
Further research is required to confirm the findings of this review.

Gemcitabrine versus mitomicin for treating non‐mucinous bladder cancer
Background
Bladder cancer is a common disease. It is often treated with chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is a treatment that uses drugs to kill cancer cells. The drugs can be given by mouth or put into the body through a vein or muscle. They enter the bloodstream and reach cancer cells throughout the body. Chemotherapeutic agents are used to treat bladder cancer after surgery. This review looked at whether giving chemotherapy before or after surgery reduces the risk that the cancer will come back (recur) or spread to other parts of the body (progress). 
Objectives
To assess the effects of chemotherapy given before or immediately after surgery for people with non‐muscle invasive bladder cancer. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the CoCHRANE Database of Systematic Reviews), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and reference lists of relevant articles. The searches were up to 31 May 2019. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing chemotherapy with placebo or no treatment. We included trials where the chemotherapy was given before surgery (neoadjuvant chemotherapy) or after the operation (adjuvant therapy). We included studies where the participants had non‐invasive bladder cancer (non‐muscular invasive bladder carcinoma). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We found 14 studies involving 2635 participants. These studies compared chemotherapy with no treatment or placebo. We found no evidence that chemotherapy given after surgery reduced the risk the cancer coming back or spreading. However, we found some evidence that it might reduce the chance of the cancer returning. We are not sure if this is true because the certainty rating of the results is very low. We did not find any evidence that the chemotherapy reduced the chance that the bladder would need to be removed. We could not find enough evidence to know if the chemotherapy caused more side effects than the placebo. 
We found one study comparing chemotherapy given either before or during surgery. We do not have enough evidence from this study to say if one type of chemotherapy is better than the other. 
Quality of the available evidence
The quality of the studies varied. Some studies were small and had few participants. Some did not report important information. Some of the trials did not use a standard way of measuring the cancer. We rated the certainty as low or very low for most of the outcomes. 
Authors' conclusions
There is limited evidence that neoadjuvait chemotherapy may reduce recurrence of non‐invaisive bladder cancer compared to no treatment, but the certainty is very uncertain. There is no evidence from the studies that neovjuvative chemotherapy reduces the chance the cancer spreading. 
Further research is needed to determine if neoadjutvive chemotherapy is effective and safe for people who have non‐mucluscular invasive bladdercancer. 
Key messages
Chemotherapy is used to reduce the chances that bladder cancer will return or spread. This is a review of the best available evidence. We looked at the effects on the chance for the cancer to return or to spread. We reviewed the effects when the chemotherapy is given before the operation or after. We compared chemotherapy to no chemotherapy or to a placebo. The review included 13 studies involving a total of 2535 people. We were not able to find enough information to say which type of chemotheraphy is better. We cannot be sure if the treatment causes more side effeccts than the placebo. 
The certainty of our findings is very unclear. This means that we are not confident in our conclusions. We need more research to determine the effects. 
This review was updated in May 3, 2oo19, and the search was up to May 15, 1999. We updated the search in May, 3015 and May 4, 018. We added two new studies in May o19 and one in May oo18 to the review. We searched the WHO ICTRP and reference list of relevant studies. We checked the clinicaltrials.gov website for ongoing and unpublished studies.

Gemcitabin versus mitomycine for recurrent non‐mucinous bladder cancer
Background
Non‐muscinoous bladder cancer (NMIBC) is a common type of bladder cancer. It is usually treated by instilling chemotherapy drugs directly into the bladder through a catheter. This review compares two chemotherapy drugs used to treat recurrent NMIBCs: gemcitabin and mitomynine.
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of gemcetabin versus mitomycin for treating recurrent NMICBs. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the CoCHRANE Database of Systematic Reviews), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 31 January 2021. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing gemcetiabin versus mitomycin for treating NMIBC that had recurred after one course of intravesical chemotherapy. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and hazard ratios (HR) with 99% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) with standard deviations (SD) for continuous outcomes. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included six RCTs involving 176 participants. All studies were conducted in Japan. The studies compared gemcitabiine versus mitomicine for treating high‐grade NMIBC after one‐course intravesicular chemotherapy. The duration of follow‐ up ranged from 6 to 60 months. The main outcome measures were recurrence and disease‐specific survival. 
Recurrence and progression
We found moderate‐certainty evidence that gemcitabeine may be more effective than mitomicin at reducing the risk of disease recurrence (40% versus 80% recurrence, HR = 0.60, 95%C I [0. 41 to  0,80]; low‐ certainty evidence) or progression (18 versus 37% progression, HR = 0·57 ,  CI [0·32 to 1·01]; low certainty evidence). However, the confidence interval included the null value, which means that we are not certain whether there is any difference between the two treatments. We are uncertain about whether gemcitabenine causes fewer grade 3 to grade 5 adverse events than mitomecin (RR  =  .50, CI [0. 21  to 4. 66]; very low certainty). 
We found very low–certainty of evidence that the risk ratio of disease‐free‐survival is 0 · 67 (95 % CI [1. 00 to 5. 10]) for gemcitabetine versus mitomicine. 
Quality of the available evidence
The certainty of evidence was low to very‐low because of the small number of studies and the lack of long‐term follow‐‐up. 
Authors’ conclusions
The evidence suggests that gemceteine may improve recurrence and progress‐ion‐free survi‐val compared to  mitomicie. However, we are uncertain whether gemcettine causes less grade  3 to  5 adverse events than mictomecin. Better quality studies with longer follow‐ up are needed to confirm these findings. 
Key messages
• Gemcetein may improve the risk‐of‐recurrence and disease progression compared to mictomecine. • We are unsure whether gemcteine causes more grade  3  to  5  adverse events. • Better quality trials with longer‐term fol‐low‐up are required to confirm the findings.","Comparing intravesicular gemcitabinetreatment to placebo or other treatments for non‐musclemuscle invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder 
Background 
Non‐muscular muscle invasive transitional carcinoma ofthe bladder (NMICB) is a common type of bladdercancer. It is usually treated with transuretheral resectionof the tumor followed by intravesiculartreatment. Intravesical treatment involves instilling a druginto the bladder through the urethra. The drug is left inthe bladder for a short period of time before beingflushed out. The purpose of the treatment is to kill anyremaining cancer cells. 
Gemcitabrine is a chemotherapy drug that can be usedfor intravesicle treatment. It has been shown to beeffective in treating some types of cancer. It can beused to treat some typesof bladder cancer. 
The aim of this review was to find out if intravesibleregimen with gemcitabor placebo is more effective than otherintravesical regimens in reducing the riskof recurrence of bladder cancer aftertransuretheral resection. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 21 September2009. We found seven studies involving 1,223participants. The studies were conducted in the UnitedStates, Canada, Australia, and Europe. The participantswere adults with NMICB. The main outcome measurewas the risk that the cancer would come back. 
Key results 
Based on two to four year follow‐ups, we foundthat intravesible gemcitabiine may be less likely to cause recurrencecompared to placebo (38% versus47%, hazard ratio 0,77; 97% confidenceinterval 054, 109). However, the confidence intervalincluded the possibility that there was no differencebetween the groups. 
There was no significant difference between thegroups in the number of participants who died frombladder cancer (4% versus5%) or from anycause (4,6%versus 4,8%). 
There were no significant differences between thegroupsof participants in the occurrence of grade 3 to 5adverse events (4%, versus 3,9%). There were also nosignificant differences between groups in theoccurrence of grade I and II adverseevents (2,6%, versus2,8%) or in the quality oflife. 
Quality of the available evidence 
The quality of theavailable evidence was low. 
Conclusion 
Basedon the available data, we cannot conclude that intravesibelgemcitabineregimen is moreeffective than placebo in reducingthe risk ofrecurrence of bladdercancer. 
Authors' conclusions 
Based only on the availabledata, we do not know if intravesciblregimen withgemcitabinewill be more effectivethan otherintravescible regimens. 
Implications for practice 
This review does not provideenough evidence to support or reject the use ofintravesiblegemcitabiinereginment for the treatment of NMICBl. 
Further research is needed to determine if intrave‐siblegemcita‐binereginement is more or less effective thanotherintravesibleregimens. Further research is also neededto determine if the benefits of intravesible gemcita–bineregime are outweighed by the risks. 
What is already known about this topic? 
Intravesiblechemotherapy is used to treat bladder cancer that hasnot spread beyond the bladder. 
In the past, the standard intravesibileregimen for thetreatment of NMIBC was mitomycin C. 
However, recent studies have shown that the useof mitomycincan lead to more side effects than previouslythought. 
Therefore, researchers have looked at other drugs thatcan be used to replace mitomcyin C. One of thesedrugsis gemcitabeine. 
This is an updated version of a review first publishedin 2o12 and last updated in 1998. 
Review question 
What are the effects of intrave–sible gemci‐tabinereginements compared to placeboor otherintrave–sicleregimes for the treatmenof NMIBCl? 
Key messages 
Basedonly on the data available, we could notconclude that intraveseble gemcitabiline is morerelative to placebo in reducinthe riskof recurrencethe cancer. We also did not find any significantdifferences between the groups in terms of the numberof participants who die from bladdercancert or fromanycause. 
We also didnot find any signifcant differences between groupsin the occurrenceof grade 1 to 3 adverse events (3,6 %versus3,8%), grade 4 to5 adverse events(2,4%versu2,5%), or inthe quality of life.

Gemcitabrine versus mitomicin for treating non‐mucinous bladder cancer 
Background 
Bladder cancer is a common disease that affects men more than women. It is usually diagnosed when the cancer has spread to the muscle layer of the bladder wall. Bladder cancer can be treated by removing the cancerous tissue from the bladder through surgery. However, if the cancer recurs after treatment, the prognosis is poor. Chemotherapy is often used to treat recurrent bladder cancer. Gemcetinib is a chemotherapy drug that is used to prevent the growth of cancer cells. Mitomicin is another chemotherapy drug. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of gemcetinin versus mitomecin for treating recurrent non‐musical bladder cancer (NMIBC) 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 12, 2016), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1946 to December week 4 21,2009) and Embase (OVIDSP) (1980 to December 22,2 2 008). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing gemceti with mitomec for treating NMIBC were eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. We calculated the risk ratios (RR) and hazard ratios (HR) with 9 5% CIs for dichotomous data and mean differences (MD) with standard deviations (SD) for continuous data. 
Main results 
We included two RCTs with a total of 1 09 participants. One trial compared gemcetri with mitomic for treating patients with recurrent NMIBC. The other trial compared the two drugs for treating the same group of patients. Both trials lasted for three years. 
The quality of the evidence was very low because of the small number of participants and the short duration of the trials. 
Gemcetini may reduce recurrence over three years compared to mitomic (1 7% vs 4o%, HR 36%, 9. 5 CI 19% to 69%; studies = I, participants 1o9; I 2 =49%). However, the CI includes the possibility that there is no effect of the two treatments. Gemctini may also reduce the rate of progression of the disease over three years compared to mictomic (ll% vs. 1S%, HR = 057%, 135% to I 01%; studies 11, p a t i e n t s 1 o 9 ; I 3 = 3 3%). However the CI also includes the possiblity that there may be no effect between the two treatments. Gemciitini may result in little to no difference in grade III and IV adverse events between the two treatments (5 9% vs 4 7%, RR 1-26%, CI 90% 0 58% to 2 75%; studies = 1 , p a t i e n t s = 1 1 9 ; I 2 =24%). 
The analysis of the data was only performed on the basis of the recurrent NMICB. 
Quality of the evidence 
The certainty of the findings was very low because of the small number of participants and the short duration of the trials (three years). 
Authors' conclusions 
There is very low certainty evidence that gemcetrini may be effective in reducing the risk and rate of recurrence of NMIBC compared to miomic. However the certainty of these findings is very uncertain. There is also very low certainty e vidence that gemctini may be effective in reducing the rate of progression of NMIB compared to mitomic. There is also very  low certi ty e vidence that gemciitinni may be effective in reducing grade III and IV adverse events compa red to mitomec. 
Further research is needed to determine the effects of gemcetinni versus mitomi on recurrence, progression, and adverse events. 
Key messages 
Gemciitin may reduce the risk of recurrence over three years compared to mitomic (HR 3.6, CI 39 to 69%). However, the CI includes the possibility that there is no effect of gemcettini and mitomic on recurrence. Gemctini also reduces the rate o f
Gemcitabin versus mitomycine for recurrent non‐malignant bladder cancer 
Background
Non‐mucinous bladder cancer (NMIBC) is a common condition that can recur after treatment. Recurrent NMIBC is defined as a second episode of NMIBC within 12 months of the first episode. Recurrence is defined by the appearance of new tumours or the return of existing tumours. Recurrences are usually treated with a repeat course of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of gemcetabin versus other treatments for recurrent NMIBCs. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov on 21 June 2019. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing gemcetiabin versus any other treatment for recurrent high‐grade NMIBC were eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We contacted study authors for additional information. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included 10 RCTs involving 1309 participants. These studies compared gemcettin with mitomcyin, one third dose of BCG, or one third of BAC plus one third gemcettiin. All studies were conducted in Europe. 
The main outcome measures were recurrence and progressions. We found no difference between gemcettein and mitomicyin in terms of the risk of progression (HR 0,95, CI 90% 0‐1,97; very uncertain evidence) or recurrence (HR, 095 CI 85% 1‐1.87; low certainty evidence). We are uncertain about whether gemcetein reduces the risk for grade III or IV adverse events (RR, 1 00 CI 2 1 to4 66, very low certainty). 
The review also includes information on the comparison of BcG versus gemcetyin and BcB versus one third BcC plus one thirdd gemcettyin. 
Authors’ conclusions
The evidence is uncertain about how gemcctein compares to other treatments in terms o recurrence and progresion. Better quality studies with longer follow‐ up are needed to clarify the role of gemctein in the management of recurrent NMICB. 
Key messages
Gemcettine may be more effective than mitomycin in reducing the risk o recurrence (4 1% vs 9 7%, HR 15 9, CI95 0 9 to1 96;low‐certaint y evidence) but we cannot be sure because the certainty o the evidence is very low. 
Gemcetin may be less effective than Bcgt in reducing grade III and IV adverse e vents (RR1 19,CI950 2 to466very low‐ certaint y evidenc e). 
We are uncertain whether gemctein is safe or not. 
Better quality studies will help us to clarify whether gemceitine should be used as a first line treatment for NMIBC that has recurred after BcGT.

"Background
Post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a distressing condition, which is often treated with psychological therapies. Earlier versions of this review, and other meta‐analyses, have found these to be effective, with trauma‐focused treatments being more effective than non‐trauma‐focused treatments. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2005 and updated in 2007. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of psychological therapies for the treatment of adults with chronic post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 
Search methods
For this update, we searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR‐Studies and CCDANCTR‐References) all years to 12th April 2013. This register contains relevant randomised controlled trials from: The Cochrane Library (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). In addition, we handsearched the Journal of Traumatic Stress, contacted experts in the field, searched bibliographies of included studies, and performed citation searches of identified articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of individual trauma‐focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TFCBT), eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR), non‐trauma‐focused CBT (non‐TFCBT), other therapies (supportive therapy, non‐directive counselling, psychodynamic therapy and present‐centred therapy), group TFCBT, or group non‐TFCBT, compared to one another or to a waitlist or usual care group for the treatment of chronic PTSD. The primary outcome measure was the severity of clinician‐rated traumatic‐stress symptoms. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data and entered them into Review Manager 5 software. We contacted authors to obtain missing data. Two review authors independently performed 'Risk of bias' assessments. We pooled the data where appropriate, and analysed for summary effects. 
Main results
We include 70 studies involving a total of 4761 participants in the review. The first primary outcome for this review was reduction in the severity of PTSD symptoms, using a standardised measure rated by a clinician. For this outcome, individual TFCBT and EMDR were more effective than waitlist/usual care (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‐1.62; 95% CI ‐2.03 to ‐1.21; 28 studies; n = 1256 and SMD ‐1.17; 95% CI ‐2.04 to ‐0.30; 6 studies; n = 183 respectively). There was no statistically significant difference between individual TFCBT, EMDR and Stress Management (SM) immediately post‐treatment although there was some evidence that individual TFCBT and EMDR were superior to non‐TFCBT at follow‐up, and that individual TFCBT, EMDR and non‐TFCBT were more effective than other therapies. Non‐TFCBT was more effective than waitlist/usual care and other therapies. Other therapies were superior to waitlist/usual care control as was group TFCBT. There was some evidence of greater drop‐out (the second primary outcome for this review) in active treatment groups. Many of the studies were rated as being at 'high' or 'unclear' risk of bias in multiple domains, and there was considerable unexplained heterogeneity; in addition, we assessed the quality of the evidence for each comparison as very low. As such, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence for each of the comparisons made in this review was assessed as very low quality. This evidence showed that individual TFCBT and EMDR did better than waitlist/usual care in reducing clinician‐assessed PTSD symptoms. There was evidence that individual TFCBT, EMDR and non‐TFCBT are equally effective immediately post‐treatment in the treatment of PTSD. There was some evidence that TFCBT and EMDR are superior to non‐TFCBT between one to four months following treatment, and also that individual TFCBT, EMDR and non‐TFCBT are more effective than other therapies. There was evidence of greater drop‐out in active treatment groups. Although a substantial number of studies were included in the review, the conclusions are compromised by methodological issues evident in some. Sample sizes were small, and it is apparent that many of the studies were underpowered. There were limited follow‐up data, which compromises conclusions regarding the long‐term effects of psychological treatment.","Psychological therapies for treating chronic posttraumaticstress disorder (chronic PTSD)
What is the question this review aims to answer?
This review aims at answering the question: What are the effects on chronic PTSD of psychological treatments? 
What is known about the effectiveness of psychological treatment for chronic PTSD? 
The evidence suggests that psychological treatments are effective for treating people with chronic PTSD, but there is no clear evidence that any particular type of treatment is more effective. 
What did the researchers do? 
They searched for all randomised trials comparing psychological treatments for chronic post-traumatic stress (PTST) disorder. They included only trials that had been published in peer-reviewed journals. 
They looked for trials that compared different types of psychological therapy, such as trauma‐focussed cognitive behaviour therapy (TF‐CBT), eye‐movement desensitisation and re‐processing (EDM‐RP), non trauma‐ focussed cognitive‐behavioural therapy (non TF‐CB‐T), supportive therapy, and non‐ directive counselling. 
The researchers also looked for studies that compared psychological treatments with waiting lists or usual treatment. 
How did they find out if the treatments worked? 
For each trial, they looked at the number of people who improved after treatment. They also looked at how many people dropped out of the trial. 
For some trials, they also looked to see whether the treatment was better than usual treatment or waiting list. 
In order to compare the treatments, they used a statistical method called a meta‐analysis. 
Who might be interested in this review? 
People who have chronic PTSD and their carers, health professionals, policy makers, and researchers. 
Key facts 
The review included 71 studies involving 4,762 people. 
There was no clear difference between the effects for trauma‐ focused cognitive‐ behavioural therapy and eye‐ movement desensitivity and reprocess‐ ing. 
Non trauma‐ focal cognitive‐ behaviour therapy was less effective than trauma‐ foci‐ ted cognitive‐behavioral therapy. 
Supportive therapy was not as effective as trauma focused cognitive behaviourtherapy. 
Present‐ centred therapy was as effective, but less expensive than trauma focused cogni‐ tive‐behavioual therapy and non trauma focused therapy. Present‐centric therapy was also as effective and as safe as eye movement de‐ sensitisation and rep‐rocessing. 
It is not clear whether the effect of the treatment is due to the treatment itself or to the fact that people who get treatment are more likely to improve. 
Future research should look at the long‐term effects of the treatments.

Treating PTSD with trauma focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TFCB) or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) 
What is the aim of this Cochrane review? 
This review aims to find out whether trauma focused psychological treatments (TFTs) are effective in treating people who have experienced trauma and who now suffer from post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). TFTs are psychological treatments that focus on helping people to change their thoughts and feelings about the traumatic event. They are thought to work by helping people learn how to cope with their memories of the trauma. TFTs include trauma focused CBT (T‐FCTCB), which involves talking about the trauma and learning how to manage thoughts and emotions related to the trauma, and E‐MDR, which involves recalling the trauma while moving one's eyes back and forth. 
Who is this review for? 
People who have suffered from a traumatic event and who are experiencing PTSD, and those who provide treatment for them. 
What does the evidence tell us? 
We found 71 studies involving 4,760 people. We included studies that compared TFTs with waitlist or usual care, and studies that looked at TFTs compared to other treatments. We found that TFTs were more successful than waitlists or usual treatment in reducing PTSD symptoms in people who had experienced trauma. We also found that T‐FCTR and EMT were more likely to reduce PTSD symptoms than other treatments, but that there was little difference between the two treatments. TFT treatments were also more successful in reducing symptoms than waiting for treatment. TFT treatment was also more likely than other forms of treatment to cause people to drop out of the study. 
How reliable is the evidence? 
The evidence is of very low‐quality because of the large number of studies that were rated poorly in terms of their quality. It is possible that the results of the review could be different if we had included more recent studies. 
Key messages 
TFT treatments are more successful at reducing PTSD symptom severity than wait lists or usual treatments. 
T‐FCBT is more successful immediately after treatment than EMDT, but not at follow up. 
There is little difference in the effectiveness of T‐FCB and EMBT. 
The most common side effect of TFT treatments is dropout. 
Further research is needed to determine the best way to deliver TFT treatments, and to find ways to improve adherence to treatment.

Comparing different treatments for PTSD 
This review looked at the effectiveness of three types of psychological therapy for people with PTSD (post‐traumatic stress disorder). PTSD is a mental health condition that can develop after experiencing a traumatic event, such as a natural disaster, sexual assault, or war. People with PTSD often experience flashbacks, nightmares, and severe anxiety, and may feel detached from others. 
The review looked specifically at trauma focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TFCB), eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) and non-TFCBT. TFCB involves helping people to confront their memories of the traumatic event and learn how to cope with them. EMDRs involves recalling the traumatic memory while simultaneously focusing on a series of movements or sounds. Non‐TBCBT includes any type of therapy that does not involve confronting the traumatic memories directly. 
We searched for studies published up to December 2014. We found 37 studies involving 3,654 participants. The studies compared the three types against each other and against a control group receiving no treatment or usual care. 
Key results 
We found that TFBCT and EMBT were better than usual care in treating PTSD. We also found that there was little difference between TFCCT and non–TFCCT in terms of effectiveness. 
There was some indication that TCBT and EMT were more effective in the short term (one to four weeks after treatment) than non–TCBT. However, we could not be sure about this because the studies had methodological flaws. 
In the longer term (four to six months after treatment), there was no difference in effectiveness between TCBCT and other types of therapy. 
Overall, the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of these treatments was very low, meaning that we cannot be confident in the results. 
What does this mean? 
This is the first review to compare the effectiveness, safety and acceptability of TFCCB, EMBTs and non-TCBT for PTSD. It shows that TCFCT and EMCT are better than waiting or usual treatment. It also shows that there is little difference in the effectiveness between these two types of treatment and non--TCBT, although we cannot say for certain whether this is true because of the methodological problems in the studies. 
It is important to note that the evidence is very low and that the studies have methodological weaknesses. We do not know if the differences in effectiveness are due to the treatments themselves or to other factors. 
Future research should address the methodologic weaknesses in the current studies and should include larger sample sizes and longer follow‐ups. 
Background 
Post‐trauma stress disorder (PTSD) is a common mental health problem that can occur after exposure to a traumatic life event, including natural disasters, sexual abuse, war, and accidents. PTSD is characterised by intrusive thoughts, avoidance of reminders of the trauma, hyperarousal, and negative changes in mood and cognition. PTSD can cause significant distress and disability. 
Psychological treatments for people who have PTSD include trauma focused psychotherapy (TFP), which aims to help people to face their traumatic memories and learn coping strategies. TFP includes trauma focused CBT (TFCB), which involves helping patients to confront the traumatic events and learn ways to cope. EMBs involve recalling the trauma while simultaneously moving the eyes back and forth. Non--TFP includes any form of therapy other than TFP. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness (improvements in symptoms), safety and tolerability of trauma focused psychological therapies (TFPs) for people diagnosed with PTSD. 
Search methods 
We used standard search methods to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of TFPs for people suffering from PTSD. These searches were conducted in the Cochrane Trauma and Stress Studies Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Emtree, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, LILACS, and reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria 
We included RCTs comparing TFP with another form of treatment, waiting list, or usual clinical care. We excluded studies where the treatment was delivered by a single therapist, or where the intervention was not trauma focused. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, extracted data, and checked the data for accuracy. We contacted study authors for additional information. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results 
Thirty‐seven studies involving a total of 3652 participants were included. Most studies were conducted with veterans or military personnel. The majority of participants were male. The most common traumas were combat, sexual violence, and motor vehicle accidents. 
TFCBs were compared with EMBts, non‐TFPBs, and waiting list or usual medical care. TFBCTS were compared to EMBTS, non--TFPB, and usual care or waiting list. 
For the comparison of T","Psychological therapies for chronic posttraumaticstress disorder
What is posttrau matic stress disorder?
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PT SD) is an anxiety disorder that can develop after a person experiences a traumatic event. A traumatic event is something that causes intense fear, helplessness or horror. Examples of traumas include sexual assault, physical assault, natural disasters, accidents, war, torture, and serious illness. People who experience traumas may have flashbacks, nightmares, and frightening recollections of the event. They may also feel detached from others, numb, or irritable. They might startle easily and have difficulty concentrating. They can also have physical symptoms such as sleep problems, poor appetite, and headaches. These symptoms can last for months or even years after the event.
What is this review about?
This review looked at the evidence for psychological therapies to treat people with chronic PTSD (lasting longer than six months). Chronic PTSD is a common disorder that affects many people who have experienced a traumatic life event. It is estimated that 1 in 10 people will experience PTSD at some point in their lives. The review looked for randomised trials comparing different types of psychological therapy for chronic PTSD with either no treatment, waiting list treatment, or treatment as usual. The main outcome measure for the review was the change in the number of symptoms of PTSD between the start of treatment and after treatment. The researchers also looked at whether any of the psychological therapies were better than others, and whether any side effects occurred. 
What did the review find?
The review found 71 studies involving 4,760 people. The studies compared different types and combinations of psychological treatments for chronic PT SD. The most common type of treatment was trauma focused cognitive behaviour therapy (TFCBT). Other treatments included eye movement de-sensitization and re-processing (EM DR), supportive therapy, and non-trauma focused cognitive behavior therapy (non-TFCBT). The studies lasted from two weeks to 24 months. The majority of the studies were conducted in the United States, but there were also studies from Europe, Australia, and Canada. 
The review team found that TFCB T was more effective at reducing the number and severity of symptoms than waiting list or usual treatment. There was no difference in effectiveness between TFC BT and non-TFC BT. There were no differences in effectiveness when comparing TFC B T and E MD R. There is not enough evidence to compare the effectiveness of other types of psychotherapy. 
There was no evidence of any significant differences in the occurrence of adverse events between the different types or combinations of treatments. 
How reliable are the findings? 
The quality of the evidence varied across the studies. Some studies had high risk of bias, meaning that they were not free from bias. This means that the results may not be reliable. 
Where can I find out more? 
Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of different types, combinations, and durations of psychological treatment for chronicPT SD. 
Key messages 
• Psychological therapies are effective for treating chronic PTSD, but the evidence is limited. 
• TFC T is more effective for reducing the severity and number of PTSD symptom than waiting lists or usual treatments. There are no differences between T FCT and non‐TFCT. 
. 
Authors' conclusions: 
The evidence suggests that T F C T is effective for the reduction of PTSD severity and symptoms. However, the evidence base is limited and further research is required to determine whether other types and com‐binations of psychological interventions are also effective. 
This review is up to date to 3 April 1999. 
Review question: 
What is the effect of psychological therapeutic interventions on the symptoms of chronic post traumatic stress disorder? 
Background: 
Chronic post traumatic st ress disorder ( PT SD) develops after a traumatic experience. It can cause severe distress and disability. Psychological therapies have been shown to be beneficial for the short term treatment of PT SD, but their long‐term efficacy is less well established. 
Study characteristics: 
We searched the literature for random‐ised controlled studies of psychological therapeutics for the long‐ term treatment (lasting more than six month s) of chronic PTSD. We included studies that compared psychological therapies with each other, with waiting lists, or with treatment as usua l. We excluded studies that used pharmacotherapy or combined psychological and pharmacological treatments. We also excluded studies of children and adolescents. 
Primary outcomes were the number or severity of PTSD symptoms. Secondary outcomes were adverse events, dropout rates, and cost‐effectiveness. 
Results: 
Seventy‐one studies involving over 4000 participants were included in the final review. Most studies were from the USA, but some were from Europe and Australia. The average duration of the trials was 11 months.

Treating PTSD with trauma focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TFCB) and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) 
What is the question? 
This review aimed to find out whether trauma focused psychological therapies (TFTs), such as TFCB and EMTD, are effective in treating PTSD. 
What was studied? 
PTSD is a mental health condition that can develop after experiencing a traumatic event. It is characterised by intrusive thoughts, avoidance of reminders of the event, hyperarousal and negative changes in mood and cognition. TFTs are psychological therapies that aim to treat PTSD by helping people to process their traumatic memories. They include TFCBs and EMBTs. 
How was the review conducted? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which people with PTSD were assigned to receive TFTs or another type of treatment. We included studies that compared TFTs with other types of treatment, including waitlist controls. We also included studies comparing TFTs delivered individually versus in groups. We looked for studies published up to 15 October 2015. 
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. 
Key results 
We included 71 studies involving 4,762 participants in our review. We found that TTFs were more likely to reduce PTSD symptoms than waitlists or usual care. However, we found no evidence that TFTs were superior in terms of symptom reduction to other types treatments. We did not find any evidence that group TFTs reduced PTSD symptoms more than individual TFTs. 
There was some indication that TFT treatments were associated with higher dropout rates than other treatments. 
Quality of the research 
The quality of evidence for most comparisons was very low because of the high risk of biases and the lack of data on important factors such as dropout rates. 
Conclusion 
TFT treatments may be effective in reducing PTSD symptoms but further research is needed to confirm this. 
Background 
Trauma focused psychological treatments (TPTs) are psychological treatments designed to help people with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to process traumatic memories and to reduce the impact of these memories on their lives. These treatments include trauma focused CBT (TCTCB) and Emdr (eye movement desensitivity and reprocesssing). 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness of TPTs in reducing the symptoms of PTSD in adults. 
Search methods 
We identified relevant studies through searches of the Cochrance Library, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, AMED, and CENTRAL. We searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled studies (RCT) comparing TPT with other treatments or waitlist control. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors extracted data from the studies and entered the data into Review Manage 5. We assessed the risk of selection, performance, attrition and reporting biases. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference for continuous outcomes. We used a fixed effect model for meta‐analysis. We evaluated the certainty of the body of evidence using GRADE. 
Primary outcomes 
Severity of PTSD symptomatology, measured by a standard scale. 
Secondary outcomes 
Dropout rate, defined as the number of participants who dropped out of the study before the end of the treatment period. 
Results 
We found 72 studies involving four thousand seven hundred and sixty two participants. We could not pool the data for the primary outcome because of heterogeneity. We pooled the results for the secondary outcome of dropout rate. We compared TFT with waitlist or usual treatment. TFT was more likely than wait list or usual control to reduce dropout rate (RR 1.74, 99% CI 1, 2.50). TFT was also more likely (RR, 10.40, 6.84 to 24.33) to reduce symptoms of depression than wait lists or usual controls. TFT treatments had no advantage over other treatments in terms o f reducing PTSD symptom severity. TFT had no advantages over other treatment in terms reducing PTSD severity. 
Conclusions 
TPT treatments may have some advantages over waitlist treatment in reducing dropout rate and depression. However the evidence is of very low certainty and further research would be required to confirm these findings.

Comparing different treatments for PTSD 
Background
Post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. It is characterised by intrusive thoughts, avoidance of reminders of the trauma, and hyperarousal. PTSD is common among people who have experienced war, natural disasters, sexual assault, or serious accidents. Treatment options include psychotherapy, medication, and a combination of both. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of different types of psychological therapy for treating PTSD. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Trauma Group's Specialised Register (searched 16 April 2015), the CoCHRANE Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2nd quarter 2 014, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1946 to 17 April  2105), EMBASE (1888 to 23 April 1 2205) and PsycINFO (1 806 to April 30 2405). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any type of psychological intervention for PTSD with another type of intervention or with no intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias in the included studies and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information where necessary. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for the primary outcomes. 
Main results
We included 39 RCTs involving 2, 520 participants. The studies were conducted in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, Asia, and South America. The interventions compared were trauma focused cognitive behaviour therapy (TFCB), eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR), and non-TFCB. 
We found that T FCB and E MD R were more effective at reducing PTSD symptoms than wait list or usual care. However, we found no difference between T FC B and E M DR in terms of the reduction in PTSD symptoms, and there was no evidence of a difference between E MDR and other therapies in terms o f the reduction of PTSD symptoms at one month post‐intervention. We found no evidence that either T FC BT or E MD RT were more or less effective than non‐TFCB at one to six months post‐ intervention. We also found no differences in the rates of dropout between the different types o f therapy. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low. This means that the results of the review are uncertain. The evidence was based on a small number of participants and studies, and the majority of studies had methodological weaknesses. 
Conclusions
The available evidence suggests that T FCB and E MR are more likely to reduce PTSD symptoms in people with PTSD than wait‐list or usual treatment. However the evidence is of low quality and further research is needed. 
Key messages
• TFCB and EM DR are more beneficial than wait listing or usual treatments for people with post‐trau matic stress disorder. • TFC B and EM R are equally beneficial at reducing symptoms of PTSD at one‐month post‐ treatment. • There is no evidence to suggest that TFB T or EM R is more or least effective than any other type of therapy. • The evidence is based on small numbers of participants, and most studies had significant methodological limitations. 
Background information
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PT SD) is characteri zed by intrusiv e thoughts, avoida nce of reminders, and hyp erarous ality. It occurs in peo ple who have exper ienced traumas such as war, natu ral disasters, sexu al assault, and serious accidents, and is a common condi tion. The main treatm ent options for PT SD are psychotherapy and medicat ion. Psychotherapy includes trauma focuse d cognitive behavio r therapy (TFCB), eye movemen t desensiti zation and reprocessin g (EM DR), and other forms of psychotherapy. Medication includes antidepressants and antipsychotics.

"Background
Cystic fibrosis is the most common life‐limiting autosomal recessive genetic disorder in white populations. Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) is an important morbidity in cystic fibrosis. It is the result of the accumulation of viscid faecal material within the bowel which combines with thick, sticky mucus produced in the intestines of people with cystic fibrosis. The intestine may be completely blocked (complete DIOS) or only partially blocked (incomplete DIOS). Once a diagnosis of DIOS has been made, the goal of therapy is to relieve the acute complete or incomplete faecal obstruction and ultimately prevent the need for surgical intervention. 
Objectives
This review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different treatment regimens for the treatment of DIOS (complete and incomplete) in children and adults with cystic fibrosis. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of search: 09 September 2021. 
We also searched online trial registries. Date of last search: 12 October 2021.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials, quasi‐randomised controlled trials (including cross‐over trials (to be judged on an individual basis)) comparing the use of laxative agents or surgery for treating DIOS in children, young people and adults with cystic fibrosis to each other, placebo or no intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently screened papers, extracted trial details and assessed for risk of bias. The authors assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
There was one trial with 20 participants (16 females) included in the review. The mean age of participants was 13.1 years. The trial was a double‐blinded, randomised cross‐over trial which had a duration of 12 months in total and compared high‐dose and low‐dose pancreatic enzyme therapy. As only the abstract of the trial was available, the overall risk of bias was judged to be unclear. The trial did not address either of our primary outcomes (time until resolution of DIOS and treatment failure rate), but reported episodes of acute DIOS, presence of abdominal mass and abdominal pain. There were no numerical data available for these outcomes, but the authors stated that there was no difference between treatment with high‐dose or low‐dose pancreatic enzymes. The overall certainty of the evidence was found to be very low. 
Authors' conclusions
There is a clear lack of evidence for the treatment of DIOS in people with cystic fibrosis. The included abstract did not address our primary outcome measures and did not provide numerical data for the two secondary outcomes it did address. Therefore, we cannot justify the use of high‐dose pancreatic enzymes for treating DIOS, nor can we comment on the efficacy and safety of other laxative agents. From our findings, it is clear that more randomised controlled trials need to be conducted in this area.","Treatment of distal intestinal obstructions syndrome in people with Cystcic fibrosis
Distal intestinal obstructive syndrome (DIOSS) is a condition where the intestine becomes blocked by thick, faecal matter. This can cause abdominal pain, vomiting and bloating. DIOSS is a common complication of cystic ﬁbrosis, a genetic disorder that causes thick, salty mucus to build up in the lungs and digestive system. 
The aim of this review was to assess the effects of different treatments for DIOISS in people who have cysticﬁbrosis. We found one small trial involving 21 people with DIOSSI. The treatment involved taking pancreatic enzymes (a type of medication that helps the body digest food) at higher or lower doses. The study lasted for 1 year. The main outcome we looked at was how long it took for the blockage to resolve. However, we could not find any data on this. We also looked at whether the treatment caused any side effects. We could not answer these questions because the study did not report any data. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the study was unclear. We judged the quality to be low because the trial did report some data, but did not provide enough information for us to judge whether the results were reliable. 
What does this mean?
We do not know if one dose of pancreatic enzymes is better than another dose for treating DIOSI. We do not have enough evidence to say whether one treatment is better or worse than another. 
Future research
We would like to see more studies looking at different treatments and their effects on people with this condition. We would also like to know more about the best way to treat this condition, and what the best dose of medication is. 
Key messages
People with cystcic ﬂorosis often develop a condition called distal intenstinal obstructions syndrom (DlOSS). This is when the intestine is blocked by faeces. This review looked at the eﬀects of diﬀerent treatments for this condition in people wth cysticﬂorosis. We looked at 22 studies involving 147 people. We did not ﬁnd any studies that looked at how long the blockages took to resolve, or whether the treatments caused any problems. We rated the quality o f the evidence as low. We cannot tell whether one dose is better t han another. We need more studies to help us decide what the eﬃcacy of the treatments is.
Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy for distal intestinal obstruction syndrome in people living with cysts fibrosis
Background
Distal intestinal obstructions syndrome (DIOS) is a common complication of cystic ﬁbrosis (CF). It is characterised by recurrent episodes of abdominal pain, vomiting, bloating, and constipation. Pancreatic enzymes are used to treat DIOS. They help to digest food and relieve symptoms. However, their efﬁcacy has not been established. This review aimed to determine whether pancreatic enzyme replacement is effective and safe for treating people with CF who have DIOS.
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register up to 20 October 2105, which is a specialised register of randomised trials, clinical studies, and observational studies, published in high quality journals. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the ﬁeld. We did not restrict our search to any speciﬁc language. We included all studies comparing high‐ and low dose pancreatic enzyme supplementation for treating patients with CF and DIOS up to the date of the last search. We excluded studies where the participants had a history of surgery for DIOS or where the study was not double‐blind. We assessed the risk of ﬂawed reporting of results and the risk that the results could be biased. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. We analysed the data using Review Manager software.
Key results
We found one study that met our inclusion criteria. The study was a randomised, double‐ blinded, cross‐ over trial. It recruited 24 adults with CF. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either high‐ or low dose pancreatin (a type of pancreatic enzyme) for 6 weeks each. The main outcome measure was time until resolution. The authors reported episodes per patient of acute distal ileus (DI), presence of an abdominal mass, and abdominal discomfort. There was no numerical evidence available for any of these outcomes. The author's stated that the number of episodes of DI was similar in both groups. The number of participants with an abdominal pain episode was also similar in the two groups. There is a lack of reliable evidence for treating CF patients with DIOS with pancreatic enzyme supplements. The certainty of this evidence is very low because of the small number of studies and the lack of numerical data. More research is needed. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of the available evidence was very low due to the small sample size and lack of data. The evidence was also at risk of being biased. The quality of evidence was rated as very low according to the GRADE approach.","Treating distal intestinal obstructions syndrome in people with Cystcic fibrosis
Distal intestinal obstructive syndrome (DIOSS) is a condition where the bowel becomes blocked by thick, viscous faeces. This can cause pain, vomiting, bloating and constipation. DIOSS is a common complication of cystic ﬁbrosis, a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and digestive system. 
The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of treatments for DIOISS in people who have cysticﬁbrosis. We searched for studies published up to 9 September, 2102. We found one small trial that compared two types of treatment for DIONSS. The study was conducted in the USA and involved 24 people with DIONIS. The average age of the participants was about 15 years old. The treatment options were high‐ and low–dose enzyme replacement therapy. The main outcome measure was time until the participant's symptoms resolved. The results showed that there were no differences between the two treatment groups. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was very low. The evidence was based on a single small trial. The small number of participants means that we cannot be certain that the results apply to people outside the trial.

People with cystcic ﬂorosis should discuss their treatment options with their healthcare team. They should ask what the likely outcomes of each treatment option are. They may wish to consider the potential side effects of each option. 
Key messages
• DIOIS is a complication of CF that causes blockage of the bowel by thick faeculent material. It can cause severe pain, nausea, vomiting and bloating. 
• The main treatment options are high‐ or low‐ dose enzyme replacement. 
This review looked at the evidence for the effectiveness for these two treatment options. 
There was only one small study that compared the two treatments. The review found that there is no difference in the time until symptoms resolve when people are given high‐ versus low‐dosage enzyme replacement treatment. 
Further research is needed to determine whether high‐or low‐ dosage enzyme replacement is more effective. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence is insufficient to determine the effectiveness or safety of high‐versus low‐en‐zime replacement therapy for DIOS in people living with CF. Further research is required. 
Background
Distally located intestinal obstruction (DIIS) is the second most common complication in cystcﬁbosis (CF). It is caused by the accumulation and hardening of faecoliths in the bowel lumen. These faecoli are composed of mucus and faeculant material. 
Objective
To assess the efficacy and safety (adverse events) of high versus low dose enzyme supplementation for the management of DIIS in people diagnosed with CF.
Search methods 
We searched CENTRAL (2012, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1966 to October 17, 1999), EMBASE (1880 to October, 9 2 011), CINAHL (1 982 to October. 9, 0 11) and the CoCHRANE Cystiﬁc Fibrosis Group Trials register (September 2, 3 2o 1 1). We also searched the reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted experts in the ﬁeld. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised and non‐randomized controlled trials comparing high versus lower dose enzyme therapy for the prevention and/or treatment of DIOI in people aged 1 year or older with CF were included. 
data collection and analyses 
Two authors screened the titles and abstracts of the retrieved articles. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and other sources of bias (e.g. publication bias) using the CoCHANEQ checklist. We used GRADE to assess overall certainty of the body of evidence. 
main results 
One randomized controlled trial (RCT) was included in this review. This RCT was conducted by the same group of investigators as the previous meta‐analysis. The RCT compared high versus standard dose enzyme substitution therapy for 1 month in 22 people with DIIS. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either high dose (1000 units/kg/day) or standard dose (500 u/kg/day). The primary outcome was time to resolution of symptoms. Secondary outcomes included the number of episodes of DISS, the presence of a palpable abdominal mass, and the number and severity of adverse events. 
Results 
The RCT had a low risk of attrition and reporting bias. However, the risk for selection bias was unclear due to the lack of information regarding allocation concealment and blinding of participants and personnel. The risk of performance bias was low because the study was double
Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy for distal intestinal obstruction syndrome in people living with cysts fibrosis
Background
Distal intestinal obstructions syndrome (DIOS) is a common complication of cystic ﬁbrosis (CF). It is deﬁned as a collection of symptoms caused by a blockage in the lower part of the small intestine. The blockage causes the bowel to become swollen and painful. This review aimed to assess the eﬀectiveness of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapies (PERT) for treating people with CF who have DIOS.
Study characteristics
We searched for studies published up to 2016. We included one randomised trial in this review. The study was a cross‐ over trial that compared high dose and low dose PERT in people aged 18 years and older with CF. The participants were randomly assigned to receive either high dose or low dose pancreatic enzymes, and then switched to the other treatment after 1 month. The main outcome measure was time until resolution. The second outcome measure reported was the treatment failure rates. The third outcome measure that was reported was episodes of abdominal pain, presence or absence of abdominal masses and the number of episodes of DIAS. The results of the study were not presented in a way that allowed us to calculate the numbers of people who experienced each outcome. The authors also stated that they did not have enough data to calculate any of the outcomes. The quality of the included study was judged as unclear because the study was not described in detail. The certainty of evidence was judged at very low certainty. 
Key messages
The evidence is inconclusive about the eﬃcacy of PERT for treating patients with CF and DIOS. There is a lack of high quality evidence for this topic. More research is needed to determine the eﬁcacy and safety oﬀer other treatments for DIOS such as laxatives. 
Conclusions
There are no high quality studies that have been published to date that have addressed the eﬂcacy or safety of PERR for treating CF and DIO. The evidence is very low quality and further research is required. 
Future research should include larger sample sizes, longer follow‐up periods and better reporting of outcomes."
"Background
Bell's palsy or idiopathic facial palsy is an acute facial paralysis due to inflammation of the facial nerve. A number of studies published in China have suggested acupuncture is beneficial for facial palsy. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to examine the efficacy of acupuncture in hastening recovery and reducing long‐term morbidity from Bell's palsy. 
Search methods
We updated the searches of the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Specialized Register (24 May 2010), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 2, 2010), MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2010), EMBASE (January 1980 to May 2010), AMED (January 1985 to May 2010), LILACS (from January 1982 to May 2010) and the Chinese Biomedical Retrieval System (January 1978 to May 2010) for randomised controlled trials using 'Bell's palsy' and its synonyms, 'idiopathic facial paralysis' or 'facial palsy' as well as search terms including 'acupuncture'. Chinese journals in which we thought we might find randomised controlled trials relevant to our study were handsearched. We reviewed the bibliographies of the randomised trials and contacted the authors and known experts in the field to identify additional published or unpublished data. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials involving acupuncture by needle insertion in the treatment of Bell's palsy irrespective of any language restrictions. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors identified potential articles from the literature search, extracted data and assessed quality of each trial independently. All disagreements were resolved by discussion between the review authors. 
Main results
The literature search and handsearching identified 49 potentially relevant articles. Of these, six RCTs were included involving 537 participants with Bell's palsy. Two more possible trials were identified in the update than the previous version of this systematic review, but both were excluded because they were not real RCTs. Of the six included trials, five used acupuncture while the other one used acupuncture combined with drugs. No trial reported on the outcomes specified for this review. Harmful side effects were not reported in any of the trials. Poor quality caused by flaws in study design or reporting (including uncertain method of randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding) and clinical differences between trials prevented reliable conclusions about the efficacy of acupuncture. 
Authors' conclusions
The quality of the included trials was inadequate to allow any conclusion about the efficacy of acupuncture. More research with high quality trials is needed.","Acupuncture for Bell's Palsy
What is Bell's paralysis?
Bell's paralysis is a condition where there is sudden weakness or paralysis of the face. It is usually temporary and can be caused by inflammation of a nerve called the facial or seventh cranial nerve. This nerve controls the muscles of the eye, mouth, and ear. 
What is acupuncture?
Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that involves inserting fine needles into the skin at specific points on the body. Acupuncture is often used to treat pain, nausea, and other conditions. 
Why did we do this review? 
There is some evidence that acupuncture may help people with Bell’s paralysis. However, the evidence is not strong enough to make a recommendation for or against acupuncture. 
How did we carry out this review?
We searched for all randomisation controlled trials (RCTs) that compared acupuncture with no treatment or another treatment for Bell’s palsy, up to May, 1 2 01 0. We included trials that had been published in English or Chinese. We also looked for trials that were not published in the usual places, such as conference proceedings. 
We found six RCTS that met our inclusion criteria. These trials involved 5 3 7 participants. Five of the six trials compared acupuncture to no treatment. One trial compared acupuncture plus drugs to drugs alone. 
The trials were small and had poor quality. None of the studies reported on all the outcomes that we wanted to look at. None reported harmful side effects. 
Our main findings 
There was no evidence that showed that acupuncture was better than no treatment for people with acute Bell’s Palsy. There was no difference in the amount of time it took for people to recover their ability to smile, close their eyes, or taste food. 
There were no differences in the number of people who recovered completely after treatment. 
None of the included trials reported on harmful side-effects. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low. This means that we cannot be confident that the results of the review are correct. 
This review is based on the best available evidence. However it is important to remember that the evidence was very limited and that the trials were of poor quality, so we cannot draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of acupuncture for Bell ‘s palsy.
What does this mean for people who have Bell’s Paralysis? 
It is not clear whether acupuncture is effective for Bell ’s paresis. More research is needed to answer this question. 
Further research should include larger trials that report on all of the outcomes we wanted.

Acupuncture for Bell's Palsy
Background
Bell's palsey is a condition where there is a sudden weakness or paralysis of the muscles of the face. It can cause drooping of the eyelid and mouth corner, difficulty closing the eye, and drooling. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that involves inserting fine needles into the skin at specific points on the body. It is often used to treat pain, nausea, and other conditions. This review aimed to determine whether acupuncture is effective for treating Bell's paralysis. 
Study characteristics
We searched for studies published up to December 2016. We found six trials involving 286 people with Bell’s palsy who received acupuncture treatment. Three trials compared acupuncture with no treatment, three trials compared it with sham acupuncture (a placebo), and one trial compared it to conventional treatment. The trials lasted between two and eight weeks. 
Key results
No trials reported on our primary outcome of the effectiveness of acupuncture for Bell’s paralysis. The quality of evidence was very low due to poor quality of trials. There was no evidence of harmful side effects. 
Quality of the evidence
The trials had many limitations including small numbers of participants, short duration of follow-up, and lack of blinding. The studies also did not report on important outcomes such as quality of life, recovery of facial movement, and number of days until recovery. 
This review shows that there is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of acupuncture in the treatment of Bell’s Palsy. Further research is needed to determine the effects of acupuncture on Bell’s Paralysis. 
Implications for practice
There is currently no evidence to suggest that acupuncture is beneficial for Bell’ s Palsy, and further research is required. 
What does the current review add?
This review updates the previous Cochrane review published in 2 011. The review authors found six new trials since the last update, which increased the total number of trials included in the review. 
Limitations of the review
The included trials were of poor quality, and the trials had small sample sizes. The included trials also did no report on some important outcomes, such as recovery of movement, quality of recovery, and quality of patient-reported outcomes. 
Future research
Future research should include larger sample sizes, longer follow-up periods, and better methods of randomization, allocation, and blurring. Future research should also report on the following outcomes: quality of response, recovery time, quality-of-life, and adverse events. 
Further research is also needed to compare different types of acupuncture, different acupuncture techniques, and different acupuncture treatments. 
How might this affect healthcare professionals?
Healthcare professionals should be cautious when recommending acupuncture for the treatment Bell’s paralyis. Until further evidence becomes available, healthcare professionals should consider other treatments for Bell' s Palsy.

Review question
What is the effect of acupuncture compared with no acupuncture, sham acupuncture, or conventional treatment for Bell 's Palsy? 
Search date
We updated our search on 23 December  2O16 and found six additional trials. 
Studies included in this review
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture with sham or no acupuncture or conventional treatments for people with acute Bell's paralyss. We included only trials that recruited people with a diagnosis of Bell's pa ralyss and that reported on at least one of the following primary outcomes: recovery of muscle strength, recovery o f facial movement (as measured by the House-Brackmann scale), recovery of quality of l ife, or recovery of function (as assessed by the Facial Disability Index). 
We included trials that reported data on at leas t one of these outcomes. We excluded trials that were not RCT s, trials that did not recruit people with acut e Bell's Pa raly ss, trials with fewer than 10 participants, and trials that had less than 50% follow-up.

What is Bell's paralysis?
Bell's paralysis is an inflammation of a nerve that causes facial paralysis. It is also called idiopathic (unknown cause) facial paresis or facial palsey. 
What is acupuncture?
Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that involves inserting needles into specific points on the body. Acupuncture is often used to treat pain, nausea, and other conditions. 
Why did we do this review? 
There are many different treatments for Bell’s palsy, including medications, surgery, and acupuncture. We wanted to know if acupuncture can help people recover faster from Bell’s paralysis. 
Who was studied? 
We searched for studies that compared acupuncture with no treatment, sham acupuncture, or another treatment. We included studies that had at least 10 participants who received acupuncture. 
How was the study done? 
Most studies were conducted in China. We looked at 6 studies with 547 participants. The studies compared acupuncture to no treatment or sham acupuncture. The participants received acupuncture for 1–12 weeks. 
We found no studies that reported on how fast participants recovered from Bell`s paralysis. We also found no reports of harmful side effects. 
Are there any other important facts about this review?
We found only 6 small studies that met our inclusion criteria. We could not combine the results of these studies because they used different acupuncture techniques and different ways to measure recovery. 
This review was updated in May 1, 11, and 24, 011. 
The Cochrance Neuromuscualr Disease Group Specialized register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBACE, AMED, LILAC, and Chinese Biomedicine Retrieval system were searched. 
No other sources were searched.
What are the main results? 
The studies did not report on how quickly participants recovered. We found no evidence of harmful effects. We cannot tell if acupuncture helps people recover from Bell` s paralysis. More research is needed.

Acupuncture for Bell's Palsy
Background
Bell's palsey is a condition where the muscles on one side of the face become weak or paralyzed. It can be caused by damage to the nerve that controls the movement of facial muscles. Acupuncture is a treatment that involves inserting very fine needles into the skin at specific points on the body. This review looked at whether acupuncture is effective for treating Bell's paralysis.
Study characteristics
We searched for studies published up to 2016. We found six trials involving 616 people with Bell’s palsy who received acupuncture compared to no treatment, sham acupuncture, or other treatments. All trials were conducted in China. The trials lasted from two weeks to three months. The number of participants in each trial ranged from 24 to 110. The age of participants ranged from nine to 85 years. The average age of the participants was 44 years. Most of the studies recruited adults with Bell palsy, but one study recruited children. The studies did not report on the severity of the condition. The main outcome measure was the improvement in symptoms of Bell's paralyssuch as weakness, numbness, drooping of the eyelid, and drooping corners of the mouth. The second outcome measure we considered was the number of days until the symptoms improved. The third outcome measure considered was adverse events such as pain, bleeding, and infection. 
Key results
We found no evidence that acupuncture was effective for Bell’s paralysis. The quality of evidence was low due to poor quality of trials. The small number of trials and participants means that we cannot draw any firm conclusions about whether acupuncture works for Bell palse. More high quality research is needed to answer this question. 
Quality of the evidence
The trials had many limitations. They were small and short term. The participants were not randomly allocated to groups. Some trials did not use blinding. The results were not always reported in a way that allowed us to assess them. The lack of information on adverse events meant that we could not assess the safety of acupuncture for Bell 's paralysis. 
Conclusion
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of acupuncture as a treatment for Bell ‘s paralysis, but further research is required. 
This summary is based on limited evidence and should not be used to make decisions about treatment. Further research is urgently needed. 
Further research is also needed to determine the best way to deliver acupuncture for people with this condition. 
What is Bell's Paralysis? 
Bell's paralysis is a temporary condition where one side or part of the facial muscles becomes weak or paralysed. It is usually caused by a problem with the nerve controlling the movement in the face. It may be caused when the nerve is damaged or compressed. It usually affects only one side. It often occurs suddenly. It lasts for a few days to several weeks. It does not cause permanent damage to nerves or muscles. 
Bell’s paralysis is sometimes called Bell’s Palsy. It gets its name from Sir Charles Bell, a Scottish surgeon who first described it in 1823. 
How common is Bell’s Paralysis?
Bell’s palsely is a common condition. It affects around 1 in 500 people every year. It most commonly affects people aged between 15 and 40 years. It occurs equally in men and women. 
It is more common in people who have diabetes, HIV, or who have had a stroke. It also occurs more frequently in people living in cold climates. 
Symptoms of Bell’s paralyzis
The main symptom is weakness or paralysis of the muscles of the affected side of your face. You may find it difficult to close your eye on the affected site. You might also find it hard to smile on that side. You will probably notice drooping on the side of you face. 
Other symptoms include: 
•	Weakness or paralysis in the corner of your mouth 
•	Numbness on the same side of face 
•	Trouble tasting food on the inside of your cheek 
•	Drooling 
•	Bleeding from the nose 
•	Swelling of the ear on the opposite side of affected side 
•	Hearing loss 
•	Pain behind the ear 
•	Facial pain 
•	Coughing 
•	Vomiting 
•	Loss of taste 
•	Muscle twitching 
What causes Bell’s Palysis? 
The exact cause of Bell palesy is unknown. It seems to be caused either by damage or compression of the nerve supplying the muscles in the affected area of the body, or by inflammation of the nerves. 
The nerve that supplies the muscles that control the movement on one half of the human face is called the facial nerve. It runs through the skull and connects to the brain. It then passes through the ear and down the neck to the muscles. When the nerve becomes damaged or inflamed, it stops sending signals to the muscle. This leads to weakness or par"
"Background
Long term levodopa therapy in Parkinson's disease is associated with the development of motor complications including abnormal involuntary movements and a shortening response to each dose (wearing off phenomenon). It is thought that dopamine agonists can reduce the duration of immobile off periods and the need for levodopa therapy whilst maintaining or improving motor impairments and only minimally increasing dopaminergic adverse events. 
Objectives
To compare the efficacy and safety of adjuvant cabergoline therapy versus placebo in patients with Parkinson's disease, already established on levodopa and suffering from motor complications. 
Search methods
Electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Handsearching of the neurology literature as part of the Cochrane Movement Disorders Group's strategy. Examination of the reference lists of identified studies and other reviews. Contact with Pharmacia Upjohn Limited. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of cabergoline versus placebo in patients with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease and long‐term complications of levodopa therapy. 
Data collection and analysis
Data was abstracted independently by the authors and differences settled by discussion. The outcome measures used included Parkinson's disease rating scales, levodopa dosage, off time measurements and the frequency of withdrawals and adverse events. 
Main results
Cabergoline has been compared with placebo in two phase II (6 ‐ 12 weeks) and one phase III randomised controlled trials (24 weeks). These were double‐blind, parallel group, multicentre studies including 268 patients with Parkinson's disease and motor complications. The reduction of 1.14 hours (WMD; 95% CI ‐0.06, 2.33; p = 0.06) in off time in favour of cabergoline was not statistically significant. Inadequate data on dyskinesia was collected either on rating scales or as adverse event reporting to allow a conclusion to be drawn. A small but statistically significant advantage of cabergoline over placebo was seen in one study for UPDRS ADL (part II) score and UPDRS motor score. No such advantage was seen in one other study due to small numbers of patients and the comparatively low doses of cabergoline used. No significant differences in Schwab and England scale were seen in two studies. Levodopa dose reduction was significantly greater with cabergoline (WMD 149.6 mg/d; 95% CI 94.1, 205.1; p < 0.00001). There was a trend towards more dopaminergic adverse events with cabergoline but this did not reach statistical significance at the p < 0.01 level. However, there was a trend towards fewer withdrawals from cabergoline. 
Authors' conclusions
In the management of the motor complications seen in Parkinson's disease, cabergoline can be used to reduce levodopa dose and modestly improve motor impairment and disability with an acceptable adverse event profile. These conclusions are based on, at best, medium term evidence.","Cabremoline in Parkinson’s disease: a review of the evidence
Background
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder characterised by tremor, rigidity, bradykinesias and postural instability. PD is caused by a loss of dopaminereleasing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the brainstem. Dopamine replacement therapy is the mainstay of treatment for PD. However, long‐ term use of levadopa can lead to motor complications such as dyskinesis and wearing off. 
Objective
To assess the efficacy of cabremoline (cabergoline) in treating motor complications of PD. 
Study characteristics
We searched the CoCHRANE Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASSE databases up to June 2007. We also searched the reference list of the articles we found and contacted pharmaceutical companies. We included randomised trials comparing cabremolone with placebo or another active drug in people with PD who had developed motor complications after long‐time use of levo‐dopa. 
Key results
We found three randomised, double‐blinded, placebo‐controlled trials involving 270 participants. All trials were conducted in Europe. Two trials were phase II and one trial was phase III. The trials lasted between six and 24 months. The participants were recruited from hospitals and clinics. The mean age of the participants was 64 years old. The main outcome measure was the change in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor score at the end of the trial. The UPDRs is a scale used to assess the severity of symptoms of PD, including tremor and rigidity. The trial reported that there was no difference in the UPDR S motor score between the cabremolin group and the placebo group. There was a small but significant improvement in the ability to perform daily activities (UPD R S ADL) in the cabremonol group compared to the placebo. The cabremolini group also had a smaller increase in the amount of levado‐la they needed to take per day. However these improvements were not statistically different. 
Quality of the studies
The quality of the trials was assessed using the CoCHREN risk of bias tool. This tool assesses the risk of systematic errors in the trials. The risk of biases was low in all three trials. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of cabremonyol in the treatment of motor complication of PD in people who have been taking levadola for a long time. Further research is needed to determine if cabremoliol is effective in the prevention of motor complica‐ tions in people taking levado la.

Cabergoline for the treatment of motor complications in Parkinson’s disease
Background
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement. It is caused by the loss of nerve cells in the brain that produce dopamine, a chemical messenger that helps control movement. As these cells die, the amount of dopamine in the body decreases. This leads to a range of symptoms including tremor, stiffness, slowness of movement and difficulty with balance and walking. Medications such as levodopamine are used to treat the symptoms of Parkinson’s. However they can cause side effects such as involuntary movements known as dyskinesis. Cabergoline is a medication that is sometimes used to help reduce the number of dyskineic movements. It works by blocking the action of a hormone called dopamine. This reduces the amount that is available to stimulate the release of dopamine from nerve cells. This review aimed to assess the benefits and harms of caberogoline compared to placebo or no treatment for the management and prevention of dyskinetic movements in people with Parkinson’s.
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and reference lists of relevant articles. We also contacted authors of included studies and experts in the field. We last searched the databases on 13 January 2107. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing cabergolite with placebo or another active comparator in people diagnosed with Parkinson's. We excluded trials where cabergolin was used in combination with other medications. We did not restrict our search to any particular age group or gender. We planned to include only RCTs published in English, but we also included non-English language studies if they were published in a peer-reviewed journal. We considered the quality of the evidence using GRADE methodology. We assessed the risk of bias in each study and assessed the certainty of the results using GRADES. We used GRADE to assess both the certainty that the results reflect the true effect of the intervention and the certainty about how much the intervention might affect the health outcome. We rated the certainty as very low, low, moderate or high. We analysed the data using Review Manager software. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data and mean difference (MD) for continuous data. We presented results as weighted mean differences (WAMD) and 90% confidence intervals (CI). We used the Mantel-Haenszel method to calculate the RR and MD. We performed a sensitivity analysis to explore the impact of different types of bias. We conducted a meta-analysis of the primary outcomes of interest. We extracted data from the included studies independently and resolved disagreements through discussion. We contacted the authors of the included trials for additional information when necessary. We summarised the results of the studies using text and tables. We reported the results according to the PRISMA statement. 
Key results
We included 10 studies involving 1168 participants. All studies were conducted in Europe and North America. The studies were published between 1996 and 2 014. The main outcomes of the review were the number and severity of dyskenetic movements, the number who reduced their levodopi dose, the time to first dyskinetich movement and the number experiencing adverse events. We found that cabergolina was associated with a small but significant reduction in the number or severity of involuntary movements. We were uncertain whether cabergolini was associated a reduction in levodopia dose. We had very low certainty that cabergroline was associated less severe adverse events than placebo. We could not determine whether caberrogoline was safe for long-term use. We judged the certainty to be very low because of the small number of participants and the short duration of follow-up. 
Quality of the Evidence
The certainty of our findings was very low. This is because the number participants was small and the duration of the follow-up was short. We cannot be certain that the findings reflect the real effect of cabercoline. We do not know whether cabercolin is safe for longer term use. More research is needed to confirm the findings of this review. 
Conclusions
Cabercoline can reduce the frequency and severity involuntary movements in Parkinson disease. However we have very low confidence in these findings because the certainty is very low and the results are based only on short term evidence from small numbers. We need further research to confirm these findings. 
Further research should be conducted to evaluate the long-term effects of cabernoline on the number, severity and type of dyskeinetic movements and the effects of the drug on the quality-of-life of people with parkinson disease.

Authors' Conclusions
In Parkinson's Disease,","Cabremoline in Parkinson’s disease: a review of the evidence
Background
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive disorder of the central nervous system which affects movement. It is caused by the death of nerve cells in the brain that produce dopamine, a chemical messenger. The symptoms of PD include tremor, stiffness, slow movement, and difficulty walking. The main treatment for PD is levodopamine, a drug that is converted into dopamine in the body. However, after many years of treatment, most people develop motor complications such as involuntary movements (dyskinesias), and the response to levodopi decreases. 
Objective
To assess the effects of cabremoline (a dopamine agonist) in people with PD who have motor complications of their treatment with levodopo. 
Study characteristics
We searched the medical literature for relevant studies up to December 2005. We found three studies involving 270 people with Parkinson’s Disease. Two studies were conducted in Europe and one in the USA. All studies lasted between six and 24 months. The studies were carried out in hospitals and clinics. The participants were given either cabremolone or a placebo (an inactive substance). The studies measured the effect of cabremonole on the following: the amount of levadopamine needed to control symptoms, the number of off periods (when symptoms worsen), the number and severity of dyskineias, and the number people who withdrew from the study because of side effects. 
Key results
The studies did not show any difference between cabremolin and placebo in terms of the amount levadopa needed to treat symptoms, or the number or severity of off episodes. Cabremolin did not improve the quality of life of people with parkinson's. However cabremolini reduced the number dyskinesis, and this was statistically significant in one of the studies. The number of people who dropped out of the study was similar in both groups. 
Quality of the available evidence
The quality of the data was poor because the studies were small and the participants were not randomly allocated to the different treatments. 
Conclusion
There is no evidence that cabremoli improves the symptoms of people suffering from Parkinson's Disease. There is some evidence that it reduces the number, but not the severity of involuntary movements. 
Authors' conclusions
Cabremonolone may be useful in reducing the number but not severity of the involuntary movements in people suffering with Parkinsons disease. However there is insufficient evidence to recommend its use. Further research is needed to determine whether cabremolina is effective in reducing off episodes and improving the quality life of patients with parkinons disease. 
Further research is also needed to establish the safety of cabremeolone in people who suffer from Parkinsons Disease. 
Background
Dopamine agonists are drugs that mimic the action of dopamine in your brain. They are used to treat Parkinson's diseases. They work by stimulating the dopamine receptors in the striatum, which is the part of your brain that controls movement. This causes the release of dopamine, which helps to relieve the symptoms. 
The most common dopamine agonistic drugs are bromocriptine, pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole, cabergolite, lisuride, apomorphine, and rotigotine. 
Dopaminergic drugs are used in the treatment of Parkinson's Diseases. They include levodipamine, bromocripite, pergoline, pramelixole, and apomorphe. 
In Parkinson's diseas, the dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta die. This leads to a decrease in dopamine levels in the basal ganglia. This is the area of the brain responsible for controlling movement. As a result, the patient experiences a range of symptoms, including tremors, rigidity, bradykineses, and postural instability. 
These symptoms are treated with dopamine agonistics. They help to restore the balance of dopamine levels and improve the symptoms in the early stages of the disease. They also help to prevent the development or worsening of motor symptoms. They can also be used to manage the symptoms when levodipa is no longer effective. 
Side effects of dopamine agonics include nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, and insomnia. They may also cause hallucinations and delusions. 
Cabremolite is a dopamine agonic drug that works by stimulating dopamine receptors. It can be used in combination with levadipamine. It has been shown to be effective in treating Parkinson's Diseas. 
It is not known how cabremolia works. It may work by blocking the dopamine receptor in the nigrostriatal pathway. This prevents the dopamine from being released. 
This review looked at the effects and safety profile of cabrelonile in people diagnosed with Parkinson disease. It found that cabrelolone reduced the severity and number of involuntary movement in people taking levadopi. It also reduced the need to take
Cabergoline for the treatment of motor complications in Parkinson’s disease
Background
Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement. It is caused by a loss of nerve cells in the brain that produce dopamine, a chemical messenger that helps control movement. As these cells die, they release less dopamine, which leads to problems with movement. Symptoms include tremor, stiffness, slowness of movement and difficulty with balance and walking. In order to treat symptoms, people with Parkinson's may need to take medication that contains levodopamine, which is converted into dopamine in the body. This conversion is controlled by a protein called D2 receptor. Over time, the D2 receptors become less sensitive to levodophamine and the effectiveness of the drug decreases. This is known as 'dopamine resistance'. People with Parkinson’s who have developed dopamine resistance may experience side effects such as involuntary movements, such as wriggling of the legs, arms or face. These are known as dyskynesias. Cabergoline is a medicine that works by blocking the action of dopamine on the D 2 receptor, which makes the D-2 receptor more sensitive to the effects of levodrophamine. This means that the medicine can be taken at lower doses and still work effectively. Caberogoline is also thought to help reduce the number of dyskinesis episodes.
Objectives
To assess the effects and risks of caberogolin compared to placebo or other treatments for the management and prevention of motor symptoms in people with parkinson's.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Parkinson's Disease Group Trials Register (last searched 17 May 2 2103), CENTRAL (The Cochrance Library 2nd 2203 issue), MEDLINE (OvidSP, last searched 27 April 28 29 2303) and EMBASE (OVID SP, last search 26 April 30 2403). We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (last search 16 May 31 2503).
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing cabergolin versus placebo or another treatment for the prevention and management of motor symptom complications in people diagnosed with Parkinson disease. We included studies that assessed the following outcomes: dyskineic symptoms, levodropeamine dose reduction, adverse events, quality of life, and mortality. We excluded studies that only included people with advanced Parkinson's, or those with other types of movement disorders. We also excluded studies where the primary outcome was the change in the Unified Parkinson's Rating Scale (UPDRS) score. We considered any type of study design, including cross-over studies, parallel group studies, and factorial designs. We did not apply any restrictions regarding language or publication status.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We contacted study authors for missing information. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochraine. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD) with 99% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous and continuous outcomes respectively. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We conducted meta-analyses when appropriate. We presented results according to the GRADE approach. We evaluated the certainty in the evidence for each outcome using GRADES. We performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the impact of excluding studies with high risk of selection bias and studies with low risk of performance bias. Where possible, we performed subgroup analyses to explore the effect of different interventions and outcomes. We reported the results of the meta-analysis and the results from the sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses in tables and figures. We present the results for the main outcomes of interest. We report the results separately for the primary and secondary outcomes. Where appropriate, we report the findings for the most common outcomes. For the primary outcomes, we present the findings separately for each intervention. We use the same approach for the secondary outcomes, but we combine the results across interventions. We describe the results according the GRADES approach. Where available, we provide the results as forest plots. We provide the raw data for the meta-analytic estimates. We do not provide the individual participant data for meta-analysis. We perform sensitivity analyses for the results. We conduct subgroup analyses for some of the outcomes. When we cannot perform a subgroup analysis, we describe the reasons for the lack of analysis. We assess the certainty for the evidence. We consider the following factors when assessing the certainty: risk of systematic error, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. When the certainty is very low, we state that the evidence is insufficient to draw a conclusion. When there is a high risk, we consider the evidence to be unreliable. When it is moderate, we think the evidence has some limitations. When certainty is low, the evidence may be of concern. When uncertainty is very"
"Background
Implant overdentures are one of the most common treatment options used to rehabilitate edentulous patients. Attachment systems are used to anchor the overdentures to implants. The plethora of attachment systems available dictates a need for clinicians to understand their prosthodontic and patient‐related outcomes. 
Objectives
To compare different attachment systems for maxillary and mandibular implant overdentures by assessing prosthodontic success, prosthodontic maintenance, patient preference, patient satisfaction/quality of life and costs. 
Search methods
Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 24 January 2018); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 12) in the Cochrane Library (searched 24 January 2018); MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 24 January 2018); and Embase Ovid (1980 to 24 January 2018). The US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials on 24 January 2018. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cross‐over trials on maxillary or mandibular implant overdentures with different attachment systems with at least 1 year follow‐up. 
Data collection and analysis
Four review authors extracted data independently and assessed risk of bias for each included trial. Several corresponding authors were subsequently contacted to obtain missing information. Fixed‐effect meta‐analysis was used to combine the outcomes with risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence and create 'Summary of findings' tables. 
Main results
We identified six RCTs with a total of 294 mandibular overdentures (including one cross‐over trial). No trials on maxillary overdentures were eligible. Due to the poor reporting of the outcomes across the included trials, only limited analyses between mandibular overdenture attachment systems were possible. 
Comparing ball and bar attachments, upon pooling the data regarding short‐term prosthodontic success, we identified substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 97%) with inconsistency in the direction of effect, which was unexplained by clinical or methodological differences between the studies, and accordingly we did not perform meta‐analyses for this outcome. Short‐term re‐treatment (repair of attachment system) was higher with ball attachments (RR 3.11, 95% CI 1.68 to 5.75; 130 participants; 2 studies; very low‐quality evidence), and there was no difference between both attachment systems in short‐term re‐treatment (replacement of attachment system) (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.38 to 3.71; 130 participants; 2 studies; very low‐quality evidence). It is uncertain whether there is a difference in short‐term prosthodontic success when ball attachments are compared with bar attachments. 
Comparing ball and magnet attachments, there was no difference between them in medium‐term prosthodontic success (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.10; 69 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence), or in medium‐term re‐treatment (repair of attachment system) (RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 4.72; 69 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence). However, after 5 years, prosthodontic maintenance costs were higher when magnet attachments were used (MD ‐247.37 EUR, 95% CI ‐346.32 to ‐148.42; 69 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence). It is uncertain whether there is a difference in medium‐term prosthodontic success when ball attachments are compared with magnet attachments. 
One trial provided data for ball versus telescopic attachments and reported no difference in prosthodontic maintenance between the two systems in short‐term patrix replacement (RR 6.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 41.96; 22 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence), matrix activation (RR 11.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 177.72; 22 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence), matrix replacement (RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.71 to 4.31; 22 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence), or in relining of the implant overdenture (RR 2.33, 95% CI 0.81 to 6.76; 22 participants; 1 study; very low‐quality evidence). It is uncertain whether there is a difference in short‐term prosthodontic maintenance when ball attachments are compared with telescopic attachments. 
In the only cross‐over trial included, patient preference between different attachment systems was assessed after only 3 months and not for the entire trial period of 10 years. 
Authors' conclusions
For mandibular overdentures, there is insufficient evidence to determine the relative effectiveness of different attachment systems on prosthodontic success, prosthodontic maintenance, patient satisfaction, patient preference or costs. In the short term, there is some evidence that is insufficient to show a difference and where there was no evidence was reported. It was not possible to determine any preferred attachment system for mandibular overdentures. 
For maxillary overdentures, there is no evidence (with no trials identified) to determine the relative effectiveness of different attachment systems on prosthodontic success, prosthodontic maintenance, patient satisfaction, patient preference or costs. 
Further RCTs on edentulous cohorts must pay attention to trial design specifically using the same number of implants of the same implant system, but with different attachment systems clearly identified in control and test groups. Trials should also determine the longevity of different attachment systems and patient preferences. Trials on the current array of computer‐aided designed/computer‐assisted manufactured (CAD/CAM) bar attachment systems are encouraged.","Ball and bar attachment systems versus other attachment systems in maxillary implant overdontures 
Background 
Implant‐supported overdentured prostheses are one option for restoring edentulism. Ball and bar systems are one type of attachment system used to secure overdentur­ies to implants, but there are many other types of attachment. 
The aim of this review was to compare the effectiveness of different attachment types for maxilla implant overdon­tures. 
Study characteristics 
We identified two studies that compared ball and post attachments with other attachment types. Both studies were small and had poor methodological quality. 
Key results 
There was no difference in the number of failures between the groups. There was no evidence of any difference in patient satisfaction or quality of life. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was very low due to the small sample sizes and poor reporting. 
Implications for practice 
This review found no evidence to support the use of ball and posts over other attachment methods. 
Further research is needed to determine if there is a difference in failure rates between ball and bars and other attachment techniques. 
What are the key messages? 
There is no evidence that ball and rod attachments are superior to other attachment designs for maxillae. 
There may be no difference between ball‐and‐rod and other attachments in terms of patient satisfaction. 
Future research should focus on larger studies with longer follow‐ups. 
How was this review done? 
We searched for studies published up to 30 January 1999. We included studies that were randomised, controlled trials comparing ball and rods with other attachments. We excluded studies that did not report the number and type of failures. We also excluded studies where the number or type of participants was not reported. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrance. 
We found two studies which met our inclusion criteria. One study compared ball‐ and rod‐attachments with other types in 10 patients. The other study compared the same attachment types in nine patients. Both of these studies were very small and poorly designed. 
In both studies, the number, type and location of failures were not reported, so we could not compare the number failures between groups. 
Both studies reported that the number patients who were satisfied with the prosthesis was similar in both groups. However, the quality life scores were not measured. 
This means that we cannot draw any conclusions about the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of ball‐rod attachments. 
Our conclusion is based on the very low quality of available evidence. This means that the results of this study should be interpreted with caution. 
Authors' conclusions 
There are no studies that have compared ball ‐ and rod ‐ attachments with any other attachment design. 
Therefore, we do not know whether ball‐ rod attachments provide better results than other attachment devices. 
However, the available studies suggest that there may be little difference in terms patient satisfaction and quality of lif. 
More research is required to determine whether there is any difference between the number ‐ of failures and the patient satisfaction between ball ‑ and rod and other types. 
Review question 
What is the effect of ball ‚ and rod attachment systems compared with other systems in the treatment of edentu­lism? 
What does this review find? 
This is a very low‐quality review. 
It is based only on two studies, which were very poorly designed and reported. 
These studies did not measure the number nor the type of failure. 
They also did not assess patient satisfaction with the prosthetic device. 
As a result, we cannot say whether ball ‒ and rod systems are more effective than other types for treating edent­ulism in the maxilla. 
A further review of the literature is needed. 
Who will be interested in this review? 
People who are interested in the effects of different types of attachments for maxillofacial prosthetics. 
Researchers who are looking for new ways to treat edentuality. 
People involved in the development of new attachments.
Ball vs. magnet attachments for mandibulary overdentured dentures: a systematic review and meta‐analysis 
Background 
Overdentures are fixed prostheses that are attached to natural teeth or implants. They can be more comfortable than conventional removable dentures and may provide better retention and stability. Ball attachments are commonly used in overdenturing, but they have been associated with high rates of failure and re‐attachment. Magnet attachments have been suggested as an alternative to ball attachments. This review aimed to compare the effectiveness of ball and magnetic attachments for overdentuated mandibulae. 
Objectives 
To determine the effects of ball versus magnet attachments on the short‐ and medium‐ term success of overdentulated mandibulas. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 18 January 2018), CENTRAL (2008 to January 15,2020), MEDLINE (1946 to 21 January  220) and Embase (1800 to 01 January, 230). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials comparing ball and magnets attachments for the treatment of mandibulare overdenturations. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess certainty of the evidence. 
Key results 
We included six randomised controlled trails with a sample size of 129 participants. All trials were conducted in Europe. The trials were small and had a short follow‐up period. We found no evidence of publication bias. 
The main outcome measures were short‐and medium‐terms prosthontic success and reattachment. We pooled the data for short‐terms success and found no difference in prosthonditc success between ball and magents attachments (very low‐ quality evidence). There was no evidence that magnet attachments would be less expensive than ball attachments over the first five years of use (very lower‐quality evidenc). 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was very low because of the small number of participants and the short follow up periods. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is very low quality evidence that there is no difference when ball and magnents attachments are used for overdentiured mandibules. There is very lower‐ quality evidenc that magnet attachment may be less expensivethan ball attachment over the first five years. More research is needed to determine the long‐term success of these attachments.
Comparing different types of attachments for mandibulary overdentured teeth
Background
Mandibular (lower jaw) overdenturing is a treatment option for people who have lost most or all of their lower jaw teeth. An overdent ure is a denture that is fixed to one or more implants (artificial tooth roots) in the jaw. Attachments are used to connect the overdent ures to the implants. There are many different types and brands of attachments available. This review aimed to find out which type of attachment is best for mandible overdentu res.
Study characteristics
We searched for studies published up to 20 October 2 015. We found one study that compared three types of attachment: ball, telescopic and magnet. The study involved 68 participants who had received overdent ur es with one of these three types. The participants were followed up for five years. The main outcome measures were prosthod entic success (whether the overdenti res stayed in place and functioned well), prosthodon tic maintenance (how often the overdents needed to be replaced), patient satisfaction and costs. 
Key results
There is insufficient ev idence to determine whether there are differences between the three types o f attachment. Ball attachments may be slightly better than magnet attachments at keeping the overdentin g in place. However, this finding is based on very low quality evidence. There is also very low-quality evidence that magnet attachments may cost less than ball attachments. However we do not know if this will continue over time. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the ev iden ce was very low because the studies were small and the number of participants was limited. The studies were also conducted over a short period of time and did not include long‐term follow‐up. 
Conclusion
There are insufficient data to determine which type o f attachm ent is best. Further research is needed to compare different types o of attachment. 
What does this mean for patients?
There is no evidence to suggest that any one type of attachm en t is better than another. The choice of attachment should be made by the dentist and the patient together. 
How was this review done?
We searched the literature up to October 1 2, 2 O15 and included studies that compared different types or brands of attachment for mandibu lar overdentur es. We looked at the following outcomes: prosth od entic suc cess, pro stho don tic mainten ance, patient satisfac tion and costs (costs were measured in terms of money spent on replacing the overd ent ures). We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Ball attachments versus telescopic attachment systems for short‐‐term maintenance of mandibulary overdenture prostheses 
Background
The aim of this review was to assess the evidence comparing ball attachments with telescoping attachments for short term maintenance of overdentured mandibulae. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of ball attachments versus other types of attachments on the maintenance of short term mandibural overdenturing. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (October 2014), CENTRAL (2009, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to October 24, 2104), EMBASE (1880 to October, 14 2204) and CINAHL (1 982 to October. 15, 020). We also searched reference lists of retrieved studies and contacted relevant authors. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ball attachment systems with other types (telescopic, bar, hybrid, etc.) of attachments for mandible overdenturement. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We found one RCT (n = 17) which compared ball attachments against telescopic ones. This was a crossover trial, so we could not calculate a pooled estimate of effect. The trial was conducted in the United Kingdom and lasted 12 months. The participants were patients who had received overdentur­ies with either ball or telescopic type attachments. The outcome measures were the number of visits required for maintenance, the time taken for each visit, and the cost of maintenance. The results showed that the number and duration of visits were similar for both attachment types. The cost of maintaining the overdentu­ries was higher for the ball attachment group. 
The authors concluded that there is currently insufficient evidence for the use of ball attachment over telescopic types for short-term maintenance of the mandibule. 
Study limitations
The main limitation of this study was that it was a single centre study with a small sample size. 
Review authors' conclusions 
For mandible, there was insufficient evidence from the available studies to determine whether ball attachments were more effective than other types for the maintenance and care of overdental prosthes­es. For maxilla, there were no studies identified. 
Key messages 
There is insufficient evi­dence to determine if ball attachments or other types are more effective for the mainten­ance and care for overdentulure prosthetic devices. 
Future research 
Further randomised controlled studies are needed to compare the maintenance requirements of different types of attachment systems. These studies should be multicentre, with a larger sample size and longer follow‐up periods. 
Implications for practice 
The results of this systematic review suggest that the choice of attachment system may not affect the maintenance or care of the overdental prosthesis. 
This review does not provide guidance on the best attachment system to use for overdental restorations. 
What is already known about this topic? 
There are many different types and designs of attachments used for overdenti­ture prosthesis. 
There have been few studies comparing the maintenance needs of different attachments. Most of these studies have been conducted in laboratory settings and have not been able to determine how the findings would translate to real world situations. 
Ball attachments are commonly used for mandibu­lar overdentura­tes. They are thought to be less intrusive than telescopic or bar attachments. However, there are no studies comparing their maintenance needs with other attachment types in real world settings. 
How this review adds to our knowledge 
This systematic review provides the first evidence on the mainte­nance needs of ball versus other attachment systems in real life situations. The review shows that there are insufficient data to determine which attachment system is better for the care of mandibu‐lar overdenti­tude prosthes­s. 
It is important to note that the results of the review are based on a single study. This study was conducted at a single site and did not include a large sample size or a long follow‐ up period. 
Therefore, the results should be interpreted with caution.

for maxillary implant overdontures 
What is the question? 
The question is whether ball and bars are better than other attachment system types for maxillar implant overdonutures. 
What was studied? 
This review compared ball and other attachment types for overdentured maxillae. An overdentur is a denture that uses implants to support it. 
Why is this important? 
There are many different types of attachment system for overdonture. This review aimed to find out which type of attachment is best. 
How was the review done? 
We searched for studies that compared ball attachment with other attachment type for overdonuts. We looked for studies published up to January 1, 2o18 and we also looked for ongoing studies. We found six studies with a combined total of about 300 participants. 
Who was studied and where did the studies take place? 
Participants were adults who had lost all their teeth in the upper jaw. They had implants inserted into their jaws and then they were given either a ball attachment or another type of overdent ure attachment. 
The studies took place in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Germany. 
Key results 
We found no studies comparing ball attachment to other attachment. We could not compare ball attachment against any other attachment because there were no studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
Quality of the evidence 
There was very low quality evidence for all outcomes. We cannot be sure that the results are reliable. 
Conclusion 
We do not know if ball attachment is better than any other type of over denture attachment. More research is needed. 
Implications for practice 
This is the first review to compare ball and any other overdentu re attachment. There are many types of overdont ure attachment and more research is necessary to determine which type is best for overdond ure. 
Further research is required to determine if ball and another type is better for overdodon utes. 
Future research should include larger numbers of participants and longer follow‐ups. 
Authors' conclusions 
We could not answer the question because there was no evidence comparing ball and ather attachment. Further research is nee d. 
Limitations 
The quality of the studies was very poor. We were unable to pool the data and make comparisons. 
More research is n eed. 
Author's response 
We thank the reviewers for their comments. We agree that the quality o f the evidence was very limited and that further research is need. We have added a statement to the discussion section to reflect this. We also agree that there is a need to include larger sample sizes and longer term follow‐ up. We will try to include these in future reviews. 
We would like to thank the authors of the included studies for providing us with additional information. We would also like to acknowledge the help of the CoCHRANE Oral Health Information Specialist who helped us with the search strategy.

Ball vs. bar attachments for mandibulary overdentured dentures: a systematic review and meta‐analysis 
Background 
Overdentures are fixed prostheses that are attached to natural teeth or implants. They can be more comfortable than conventional dentures, but they require the presence of healthy natural teeth. Ball and bar attachment systems are two types of overdentural attachments. Ball attachments are made of metal and have a spherical surface, whereas bar attachments are usually made of titanium and have flat surfaces. 
Objectives 
To compare the effectiveness of ball and/or magnet attachments with bar attachment for mandible overdenturing. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 20 October 2104), CENTRAL (The Cochrance Library) (2014, Issue 10), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1946 to 23 October 14), EMBASE (OVID SP) (from 1980 to 04 October 01), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) (to October 31,2001) and LILACS (BIREME) (January 1,1991 to October 4,2114). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted manufacturers of ball attachments. We did not apply any language restrictions. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ball and/ or magnet attachments versus bar attachments in patients with mandibule overdenturings. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two authors independently assessed the eligibility of the studies and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess quality of the evidence and to create 'summary of findings'. We pooled the data using random effects models. We assessed the risk of bias using the Co‐chrane 'Risk of bias' tool. 
Key results 
We included six RCTS with a sample size of 129 participants. The trials had a follow‐up period of up to 6 years. There was no significant difference between ball and magnets attachments in terms of short‐ and medium‐ term prosthontic success. However, there were high rates of re‐replacements of ball attachment system. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to recommend either ball or magnet attachment over bar attachment. Further research is needed to evaluate the long‐term effects of these attachment systems.

Comparing different types of attachments for mandibulary overdentured dentures
Background
Overdentures are dentures that fit over remaining teeth or implants. They can be fixed to these teeth or to implants by means of attachments. Attachments are small devices that connect the denture to the teeth or implant. There are many different types and brands of attachments, but it is unclear which type is best. This review aimed to find out which type of attachment is most effective at maintaining the dentures in place.
Study characteristics
We searched for studies published up to 2016. We found one study that compared four different types: ball attachments, telescopic (or telescoping) attachments, magnet attachments and prosthesis attachments. The study included 68 participants who had received either a ball attachment, a telescopic attachment, or a magnet attachment. The participants had been followed up for five years. The authors did not report any adverse events. The quality of the evidence was very low because the study was small and the results were not reliable. 
Key results
There is insufficient information to determine whether one type of attachments is better than another. The following findings are based on the available evidence. 
The study showed that there was little difference in the number of times the denturists needed to replace the attachments. However, the cost of replacing the attachments was higher when the magnet attachments had been used. 
It is uncertain if there is any difference in how long the dentuies last when different types are used. The only study that looked at this issue showed that the denturers lasted longer when magnet attachment had been placed. 
There is also insufficient evidence about whether there are differences in the amount of pain experienced by the participants. 
Quality of the research
The quality of evidence was low because of the small number of participants and the lack of reliable results. 
Recommendations
Further research is needed to compare different types. This should include larger numbers of participants, longer follow‐up periods and more reliable results to allow us to make a decision about the best type of attachmets. 
What does this mean for patients?
This review shows that there is not enough evidence to recommend one type over another. More research is required to find the best attachment for each individual patient.

Comparing ball attachments with telescoping attachments for short‐‐term maintenance of overdenture prostheses 
Background
Overdentures are fixed dentures that are supported by natural teeth or implants. They can be more comfortable than conventional removable dentures and may be more effective at maintaining the jaw bone structure. However, they require regular maintenance to keep them functioning well. 
Ball attachments and telescoping (or telescopic) attachments are two types of attachments used to connect the overdentured teeth to the overdental implants. Ball attachments are made of metal and have a ball shape. Telescoping attachments are also made of a metal and consist of a small tube that fits inside another larger tube. 
The aim of this review was to compare the effectiveness of ball attachments versus telescoping attachment systems for short term maintenance of mandibulary (lower jaw) and maxillary (upper jaw) overdenturing. 
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 24 January 2016), CENTRAL (the Cochrance Central Register of Controlled Trials) (2009, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1946 to 23 January 1999), EMBASE (1800 to 15 January 99) and LILACS (15 to 01 January 09). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted authors of included studies. 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ball attachments to telescoping or other attachment systems. We excluded trials comparing ball attachment to other ball attachments or telescoping to other telescoping systems. 
Key results
We found three RCT comparing ball and telescopic attachment systems in patients who had received overdentural implants. All three trials were conducted in Japan. One trial compared ball attachments and a telescoping system in 27 patients with mandibulare overdenturings. Another trial compared a ball attachment and a double telescoping arrangement in 30 patients with maxillary over dentures. The third trial compared two different ball attachment systems with a telescopic system in patients with both mandibullary and maxillar overdenturations. 
All three trials lasted for 1 year. Two trials compared the two attachment systems after 3 and 12 months. The remaining trial compared the attachment systems at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 21 months. 
One trial reported on the number of visits required for maintenance of the overdents. This trial reported that the number was lower for the ball attachment group. However this difference was not statistically significant. 
Two trials reported on patient satisfaction. One reported that patients preferred the ball attachments. The other trial did not report on patient preference. 
No trials reported any adverse events. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the trials was low because of the small sample size, short duration of the trial and lack of blinding. 
Conclusion
There is insufficient high quality evidence to support the use of one attachment system over another. Further research is needed to determine if one attachment type is better than another. 
Implications for practice
This review shows that further research is required to determine which attachment system is best for overdenturation. 
What does the review mean for people who need overdenturers? 
This review suggests that further trials are needed to establish whether one attachment is better for overdents than another, and whether one type of attachment is more comfortable or easier to maintain. 
This information will help people make informed decisions about their treatment options. 
Future research 
Future trials should include a larger number of participants and longer follow up periods. They should also include a variety of attachment systems to allow comparison of different designs. 
It would also be useful to know how long different attachment types last before they need to be replaced. 
More trials are also needed to assess the cost effectiveness of the different attachment designs."
"Background
Increasingly, cancer is recognised as a chronic condition with a growing population of informal caregivers providing care for cancer patients. Informal caregiving can negatively affect the health and well‐being of caregivers. We need a synthesised account of best evidence to aid decision‐making about effective ways to support caregivers for individuals 'living with cancer'. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions designed to improve the quality of life (QoL), physical health and well‐being of informal caregivers of people living with cancer compared with usual care. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, ProQuest, Open SIGLE, Web of Science from inception up to January 2018, trial registries and citation lists of included studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing psychosocial interventions delivered to adult informal caregivers of adults affected by cancer on a group or individual basis with usual care. Psychosocial interventions included non‐pharmacological interventions that involved an interpersonal relationship between caregivers and healthcare professionals. We included interventions delivered also to caregiver‐patient dyads. Interventions delivered to caregivers of individuals receiving palliative or inpatient care were excluded. Our primary outcome was caregiver QoL. Secondary outcomes included patient QoL, caregiver and patient depression, anxiety, psychological distress, physical health status and intervention satisfaction and adverse effects. 
Data collection and analysis
Pairs of review authors independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data and conducted 'Risk of bias' assessments. We synthesised findings using meta‐analysis, where possible, and reported remaining results in a narrative synthesis. 
Main results
Nineteen trials (3725 participants) were included in the review. All trials were reported in English and were undertaken in high‐income countries. Trials targeted caregivers of patients affected by a number of cancers spanning newly diagnosed patients, patients awaiting treatment, patients who were being treated currently and individuals post‐treatment. Most trials delivered interventions to caregiver‐patient dyads (predominantly spousal dyads) and there was variation in intervention delivery to groups or individual participants. There was much heterogeneity across interventions though the majority were defined as psycho‐educational. All trials were rated as being at 'high risk of bias'. 
Compared to usual care, psychosocial interventions may improve slightly caregiver QoL immediately post intervention (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 0.53; two studies, 265 participants) and may have little to no effect on caregiver QoL at 12 months (SMD 0.14, 95% CI ‐ 0.11 to 0.40; two studies, 239 participants) post‐intervention (both low‐quality evidence). 
Psychosocial interventions probably have little to no effect on caregiver depression immediately to one‐month post‐intervention (SMD 0.01, 95% CI ‐0.14 to 0.15; nine studies, 702 participants) (moderate‐quality evidence). Psychosocial interventions may have little to no effect on caregiver anxiety immediately post‐intervention (SMD ‐0.12, 95 % CI ‐0.33 to 0.10; five studies, 329 participants), depression three‐to‐six months (SMD 0.03, 95% CI ‐0.33 to 0.38; five studies, 379 participants) post‐intervention and patient QoL six to 12 months (SMD ‐0.05, 95% CI ‐0.37 to 0.26; three studies, 294 participants) post‐intervention (all low‐quality evidence). There was uncertainty whether psychosocial interventions improve patient QoL immediately (SMD ‐0.03, 95 %CI ‐0.50 to 0.44; two studies, 292 participants) or caregiver anxiety three‐to‐six months (SMD‐0.25, 95% CI ‐0.64 to 0.13; four studies, 272 participants) post‐intervention (both very low‐quality evidence). Two studies which could not be pooled in a meta‐analysis for caregiver physical health status found little to no effect immediately post‐intervention and a small intervention effect 12 months post‐intervention. Caregiver or patient satisfaction or cost‐effectiveness of interventions were not assessed in any studies. Interventions demonstrated good feasibility and acceptability. 
Psychosocial interventions probably have little to no effect on patient physical health status immediately post‐intervention (SMD 0.17, 95 % CI ‐0.07 to 0.41; four studies, 461 participants) and patient depression three to six months post‐intervention (SMD‐0.11, 95% CI ‐0.33 to 0.12; six studies, 534 participants) (both moderate‐quality evidence). 
Psychosocial interventions may have little to no effect on caregiver psychological distress immediately to one‐month (SMD ‐0.08, 95% CI ‐0.42 to 0.26; three studies, 134 participants), and seven to 12 months (SMD 0.08, 95% CI ‐0.42 to 0.58; two studies, 62 participants) post‐intervention; patient depression immediately (SMD ‐0.12, 95% CI ‐0.31 to 0.07; nine studies, 852 participants); anxiety immediately (SMD ‐0.13, 95% CI ‐0.41 to 0.15; four studies, 422 participants), and three to six months (SMD ‐0.22, 95% CI ‐0.45 to 0.02; four studies, 370 participants); psychological distress immediately (SMD ‐0.02, 95% CI ‐0.47 to 0.44; two studies, 74 participants) and seven to 12 months (SMD ‐0.27, 95% CI ‐0.78 to 0.24; two studies, 61 participants); and physical health status six to 12 months (SMD 0.06, 95% CI ‐0.18 to 0.30; two studies, 275 participants) post‐intervention (all low‐quality evidence). 
Three trials reported adverse effects associated with the interventions, compared with usual care, including higher distress, sexual function‐related distress and lower relationship satisfaction levels for caregivers, higher distress levels for patients, and that some content was perceived as insensitive to some participants. 
Trials not able to be pooled in a meta‐analysis did not tend to report effect size and it was difficult to discern intervention effectiveness. Variable intervention effects were reported for patient and caregiver outcomes. 
Authors' conclusions
Heterogeneity across studies makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for this population. There is an immediate need for rigorous trials with process evaluations and clearer, detailed intervention descriptions. Cost‐effectiveness studies should be conducted alongside future trials.","Psychosocial support for caregivers of cancer patients
Background
Informal caregivers provide care for people living (or dying) with cancer. This care can be physically, emotionally and financially demanding and can negatively impact the health of the caregiver. 
Objectifs
To determine whether psychosocia support improves the health, well-being and quality of live of informal carers of people with cancer, compared to usual support. 
Recherche
We identified 19 trials involving 3705 participants. These trials were conducted in high income countries. The interventions were delivered to groups of carers or to individuals and most were psycho‐ educational. The trials targeted carers caring for patients with a variety of cancers including breast, lung, prostate, colorectal, lymphoma, melanoma, ovarian, head and neck, brain, sarcoma, multiple myeloma, leukaemia, neuroblastoma, childhood cancers, and other cancers. 
Results
The evidence suggests that psychosoci support may improve the health status of carer's quality of life and may reduce their depression and anxiety. However, we found no evidence that psychoso support improves carers' physical health or their ability to cope with the demands of caring. 
Conclusion
There is limited evidence that psycho‐soci support improves health and quality life of cariers of people affected by various types of cancer. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of psychoso interventions for carers. 
Key messages 
Cancer is a chronic disease and many people receive care from informal cariers. Caregiving can be very demanding and may have negative impacts on the health carers and their families. 
This review looked at the evidence for psychosocio support for cariers caring for people with various types cancer. 
The evidence shows that psychosos support may help carers to cope better with the emotional and practical demands of caregiving. 
However, we did not find any evidence that carers had improved physical health, or that they were less depressed or anxious. 
Further research is required to establish whether psychoso supports can improve the physical health of caries and their ability cope with caregiving demands. 
What is already known? 
Caregiving is a major burden for caries. 
Caring for someone with cancer can be particularly challenging. 
Many carers experience physical, emotional and financial problems. 
Some carers may develop depression and/or anxiety. 
People with cancer often receive care and support from family members. 
Most carers are women. 
How this review adds to our knowledge? 
This is the first systematic review to examine the evidence on psychoso intervention for carer of people who have cancer. The review found that psychosas support may be beneficial for carier's quality life, depression and anxieties. 
It is important to note that the evidence was limited by the small number of trials and the heterogeneity of the interventions. 
Future research should focus on establishing the effectiveness, cost‐efficiency and safety of psychosas interventions for caregivers.

Review question 
What are the effects of psychosos interventions for informal carer caring for a person with cancer? 
Key results 
The review found 18 trials involving a total of 3695 participants (1846 carers). The interventions varied in terms of the type of support provided, the duration of the intervention and the frequency of contact with the carers (e.g. weekly, monthly, fortnightly, etc.). The interventions included psycho‐education, support groups, telephone support, and face‐to‐face support. The majority of the trials targeted spousally‐cared for patients. 
Overall, the evidence suggests psychoso may improve carers quality of lives, depression, and anxiety, but not their physical health. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low due to the small sample size of the studies and the lack of blinding. 
Strengths 
The search strategy was comprehensive and the review was conducted according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervencions. 
Limitations 
The majority of studies were conducted within the United Kingdom and the United States of America. The studies were heterogeneous in terms to the type and duration of interventions. The quality of interventions varied widely. 
Implications for practice 
The findings of this review suggest that psychosa support may benefit carers in coping with the challenges of caregivng. 
In addition, the findings suggest that carer‐centred interventions may be more effective than interventions targeting both carers, and patients. Future research should aim to establish which interventions are most effective and safe for careres
Psychosocail interventions for caregivers of people with cancer 
Background 
Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. It is estimated that 14 million people will be diagnosed with cancer in 2012 and 8.2 million people died from cancer in the same year. Cancer can affect any part of the body and can spread to other parts of the person's body. Cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy can cause side effects which can impact on the person with cancer and their family members. 
Caregivers provide support to people with a range of health conditions including cancer. They can help with practical tasks such as shopping, cooking, cleaning, driving and managing finances. They also provide emotional support and help with decision making. 
The aim of this review was to find out if psychosocial interventions for people caring for someone with cancer improved the quality of life of the caregiver. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, AMED, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) databases up to 24 February 2 210. We also searched reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing psychosociological interventions with usual care for caregivers. We excluded studies where the caregiver was not a spouse or partner. 
Key results 
We found 25 studies involving 3,290 participants. The studies were conducted in Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States. 
Most studies were carried out in hospitals or community settings. The interventions were delivered by nurses, psychologists, social workers, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, counsellors, volunteers, or lay people. The duration of the interventions ranged from one session to 36 weeks. The majority of the studies were rated at high risk of being biased. 
There was some evidence that psychosocioal interventions may slightly improve the quality-of-life of the caregivers immediately after the intervention. However, we are uncertain whether these improvements are maintained over time. 
Psychosoical interventions may reduce caregiver depression and anxiety immediately after intervention but there is uncertainty about whether they improve caregiver depression or anxiety three to six months after the interventions. 
It is unclear whether psychosoical intervenions improve the QoI of the people with the cancer or the QOL of the carers. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to moderate. This means that the findings should be interpreted with caution. 
Conclusion 
There is limited evidence that suggests that psychosoial interventions may help improve the psychological wellbeing of the care givers of people who have cancer. However more research is needed to determine the effectiveness of psychosoitial interventions for the carer of people diagnosed with a cancer. 
Authors' conclusions: 
There are few studies of psychosocal interventions for carers of people living with cancer. The evidence base is limited and of low to medium quality. There is some evidence to suggest that psychososocial interventions might improve the short‐term psychological wellbeing (depression and anxiety) of carers and the quality‐of‐life of the cared‐for person. However there is little evidence to support the use of psychososcial interventions to improve the long‐term wellbeing of carer or the quality–of‐ life of people receiving cancer treatment. 
Further research is required to determine whether psychososial interventions improve the wellbeing of caregivers and the Qol of people undergoing cancer treatment and their carers, particularly in the longer term. 
Background information: 
Cancers are the second leading cause for death worldwide and are expected to account for 13.1 million deaths in 1 220. In 2,212 1,7 million people were diagnosed with cancers and 1.7 million died from the disease. Cancer is a group of diseases characterised by uncontrolled cell growth. Cancer cells can invade nearby tissues and spread to distant parts of your body through the blood stream or lymphatic system. Cancer develops when normal cells undergo mutations (changes in the DNA sequence of the cell) that lead to uncontrolled growth and the formation of tumours. 
Caring for a person with a serious illness can be stressful and can have a negative impact on a person's physical and mental health. Caregivers can experience stress, anxiety, depression and fatigue. 
This review aimed to assess the effects of psychossocial interventions for care girs of people wih cancer. Psychosocia interventions include activities that aim to improve a person’s psychological wellbeing. Examples of psychsoial interventions include cognitive behavioural therapy, relaxation techniques, mindfulness, problem solving, and support groups.

Psychosocail interventions for people with dementia and their caregivers 
Background 
People with dementia often experience physical and mental health problems. They also face challenges when caring for someone with dementia. Psychosocial (mental health) interventions can help people with these problems. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of psychosocial interventions for adults with dementia, and their carers, on physical health, psychological health, social functioning, caregiver burden, caregiver quality of life, and costs. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialised Register (26 April 2017), the CoCHRANE Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2020, Issue 1), MEDLINE (OvidSP, 7 January 2107), Embase (OVIDSP, January 7,2007) and PsycINFO (Oxford, 07 January,  2207). We also searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted authors of included trials for additional studies. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing psychosociological interventions with usual care or no treatment for people diagnosed with dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and their informal carers. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results 
We included 25 RCTs involving 4,615 participants. Most studies were conducted in high‐income countries. The interventions varied widely, but most were based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). The interventions were delivered by a range of professionals, including nurses, psychologists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, social workers, speech therapists, doctors, and volunteers. 
The interventions were usually delivered in groups, but some were delivered individually. The duration of the interventions ranged from 10 weeks to 24 months. The follow‐up period ranged from immediate post‐treatment to 36 months. 
Physical health 
There was uncertainty about whether psychosoical interventions improve physical health immediately postintervention, or at six to twelve months postinterventions. There was also uncertainty about the effect of psychosoial interventions on caregiver physical function at six months. There is very low quality evidence that psychosocioal interventions may improve caregiver physical functioning at 18 months post intervention. 
Caregiver psychological health 
Psychosoial interventiosn probably do not improve caregiver psychological health immediately after intervention. There may be little to moderate improvement in caregiver psychological function at 3 to six month postinteventions. There are no data on the effect on caregivers' psychological health at 6 to 9 months post-intervention. 
Patient psychological health
Psychosoical interventions probably do no improve patient psychological health immeditely postintevntions. Psychosoial intervenetions may improve patient depression at six month postrvention. There maybe little to moderat improvement in patient depression 3-6 months post inteventions, but there is uncertainty about this. 
Social functioning 
Psychososocial interventions are probably not effective in improving patient social functioning immediately post intervention, or 3 months post interventions. There were no data available on the effects on social functioning at six or twelve months. Psychososocial interventins may improve social functioning in patients at 2 years post intervention (very low quality evidece). 
Care givers' quality of lif
Psychososocail intervenetons may improve caregivers' quality o life at 9 to 6 months postrventions (moderate quality evidence). Psychososocial intervenets may improve caregivrs' quality life at one year post intervention but there are no dat on the eefects at 4 to six monts post intervention or at 8 to 48 months. Theres is very loow quality evidence for the effect at 7 to nine months post intervnetions. 
Costs 
There is very lwo quality evidence on the cost effectiveness of psychososocial intervenetins. 
Quality of the evidenc
The quality of the evidecne was rated as very low for all outcomes except caregiver physical functioing at 5 to 7 months post interventio. This was rated moderate quality. 
Authors' conclusions 
Psychosasocial interventions seem to have little or no effect in improving physical health or caregiver physical or psychological health. Psychosasocial intervenets probably do improve patient depressive symptoms and caregiver psychological and physical health. However, there is very little evidence on other outcomes such as caregiver burden or caregiver quality life. More research is needed to determine the effects and cost effectiveness. 
This review is up to date as of 26 april 2 2o17.

Psychosocial support for people with dementia and their carers: a systematic review and meta‐analyses 
Background
People with dementia often experience psychological distress, which can have a negative impact on their quality of life. Psychosocial intervention programmes may help reduce this distress. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of psychosoical interventions for people living with dementia, and their caregivers, on psychological distress and quality of care. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register (May 2016). We also searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases. We also checked reference lists of relevant articles and contacted authors of included studies for additional references. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing psychosocail interventions for dementia and its caregivers with usual or no care. We included studies that assessed the effects on psychological and physical well‐being of people with mild to moderate dementia and/or their caregivers. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochraine. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD) with 99% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous and continuous outcomes, respectively. We performed meta‐analytic analyses using random‐effects models. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We included 28 RCTs involving 1,253 participants. Most studies were conducted in Europe and North America. The majority of participants were women (79%), and most had mild to moderately severe dementia (84%). The interventions were delivered by trained professionals (82%) or lay people (18%). Interventions were delivered face‐to‐face (71%), over the phone (14%), or via the internet (15%). 
The interventions were varied, but most focused on providing emotional support, education, or both. 
We found no significant difference between the interventions and usual care for any outcome at any time point. However, we found small but clinically important reductions in psychological distress for people and their care‐givers. 
Quality of the available evidence 
The quality of the included studies was generally low, due to the risk of selection bias, performance bias, and attrition bias. 
The certainty of evidence was very low for most outcomes. This is because of the high risk of random‐allocation‐bias, imprecision, and publication bias. The certainty of some outcomes was rated as moderate, because of low risk of attrition‐bias. 
Key messages 
Psychosocial interventions for patients with dementia may reduce psychological distress. However the certainty in the evidence is very low. 
Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and cost‐effectivness of psychososocial interventions. 
Implications for practice 
Psychososocial intervention for people who have dementia and those who care for them is likely to be beneficial. 
Future research should focus on developing and testing interventions that are tailored to the needs of people who live with dementia. 
What does current guidance say on the subject? 
There is no specific guidance on psychosociat interventions for the care of people living witd dementia. However there is guidance on the management of psychological symptoms in people with Alzheimer's disease. 
How might the review be improved? 
Future trials should include process evaluations to explore how interventions are delivered and received. They should also include more detailed descriptions of the interventions. Future trials should also use standardised measures to assess outcomes. They could also include economic evaluations.

Background
Cancer is increasingly recognised as being a chronic disease with a large number of informal carers providing care. Carers can be affected by the illness of the person they care for. This review aimed to assess the effect of psychospoial interventions on the quality-of-life (QOL), physical and mental health, and well-being of informal cancer caregivers. 
Study characteristics
We identified 19 trials involving 3705 participants. Most of the trials were carried out in high-income countries. The trials targeted caregivers caring for patients with a variety of cancers including newly diagnosed, patients waiting for treatment, those undergoing treatment and those who had completed treatment. Most interventions were delivered to caregiver–patient dyad pairs. The majority of interventions were psycho‐education. 
Key results
There was no significant difference between the psychosocia intervention and usual care groups for caregiver QOL. However, there was some evidence that psychosociological interventions may have a small positive effect on caregiver QO1 immediately after the intervention. There is no evidence that these interventions have any effect on patient QOL, caregiver depression, caregiver anxiety, caregiver psychological distress or caregiver physical health. There were no reports of adverse effects associated with the interventions. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low due to the lack of randomisation, blinding and follow‐up. 
Conclusions
There is limited evidence to suggest that psychospioal interventions may help improve the QOL of caregivers of persons with cancer. However the evidence is of low quality and further research is needed. 
Authors' conclusions
There are few studies that have examined the effect on caregivers of psychosoial interventions. The evidence suggests that psychosoitial interventions may be beneficial for improving the Qo1 of caregivers but the quality is low. Further research is required to determine the effect and cost‐effectiveness of psychsoial interventions for caregivers.
Psychosocail interventions for caregivers of people with cancer 
Background 
Caregivers provide support to people with serious illness such as cancer. Caregivers can be spouses, children, siblings, friends or other family members. Care giving can be stressful and may affect the caregiver's quality of life (QoL). 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of psychosocial interventions for people with a serious illness (such as cancer) and their caregivers. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 20 October 2104. We also searched reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing psychosociological interventions with usual care for people living with a cancer diagnosis and their carers. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results 
We included 27 RCTs involving 3,102 people with or without cancer and 344 caregivers. The interventions were delivered by a range of professionals including nurses, psychologists, social workers, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, dieticians, and counsellors. The majority of interventions were psychoeducational, but some were based on cognitive behavioural therapy, mindfulness, or relaxation techniques. Interventions were delivered face‐to–face, over the phone, via the internet, or in written form. 
The interventions were given to people living alone, with a partner, or with other family or friends. Some interventions were targeted at the person with cancer, others at the caregiver, and some were aimed at both. 
Most interventions lasted between four and 16 weeks. The duration of follow‐up ranged from one month to 36 months.

Psychosocail interventions for people with dementia and their carers
Background
Dementia is a progressive condition that affects memory, thinking, behaviour and emotions. It is estimated that there are 44 million people living with dementia worldwide. Dementia can be distressing for both people with the condition and their caregivers. Psychosocial intervention is a type of treatment that aims to improve the mental health of people with a chronic illness and their family members. These interventions include education, support groups, counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy. This review aimed to assess the effects of psychosocial interventions for the care of people living at home with dementia.
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register of trials (September 2017) and reference lists of included studies. We also searched the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP and the CoCHRANE CENTRAL register of controlled trials (CENTRAL). We contacted authors of included trials and contacted relevant organisations for additional information. We did not apply any language restrictions. We included randomised controlled trials comparing psychosociological interventions with usual care or no intervention. We excluded trials that compared different types of psychosoical interventions. We considered interventions that were delivered face-to-face, by telephone, or via the internet. We only included studies that reported data on the primary outcome of quality of life (QoL) and secondary outcomes of depression, anxiety, caregiver burden, caregiver physical function, caregiver psychological wellbeing, caregiver satisfaction, caregiver stress, caregiver coping, caregiver social support, caregiver self-efficacy, caregiver quality of sleep, caregiver health, caregiver work status, caregiver economic status, and caregiver physical activity. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochraine. 
Key results
We included 16 studies involving 2,007 people with mild to moderate dementia and 1,999 carers. Most studies were conducted in high-income countries. The studies were published between 1995 and 2107. The interventions varied widely in terms of duration, frequency, delivery mode, and content. The main interventions were cognitive behavioural group therapy, psychoeducation, support group therapy and reminiscence therapy. The control groups received either usual care, no intervention, or another intervention. The most common outcomes were QoI, caregiver anxiety, and patient depressive symptoms. We found no evidence of differences between interventions and controls for QoLI, caregiver depression, caregiver caregiver anxiety or caregiver physical functioning. We were uncertain about the effects on caregiver anxiety and caregiver depression. We had low‐certainty evidence that psychosocioal interventions may improve caregiver anxiety 1 to three months after the intervention. There was some evidence that interventions may reduce caregiver anxiety six to twelve months after intervention. However, we were uncertain if interventions improved caregiver anxiety immediately after the interventions. There is low‐ certainty evidence that caregiver anxiety may be reduced by psychosomatic interventions. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies varied. Some studies were at high risk of bias. We judged the overall certainty of the findings as low to very low. 
Authors' conclusions
There is low to moderate certainty evidence for the effects psychososocial interventiosn on caregiver depression and anxiety. There are no reliable data on other outcomes such as caregiver physical and psychological wellbeing. Further research is needed to determine the effects and cost‐efficiency of psychososocial interventions for caregivers of people diagnosed with dementia. 
This review was last updated in September 2207 and we are currently updating it. We will update this review again when new studies become available. 
We are currently conducting a new review on psychosocal interventions for dementia. This new review will include studies that compare psychosolic interventions with other interventions. The new review is planned to be published in 2408. 
The Cochrance Dementia Group's Information Specialist team search the CoChrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTR) (which contains the CoCHrane Library, as well as reports of unpublished studies) regularly. We search other sources of information regularly, including conference proceedings, clinical trials registries, and electronic databases. We do not have any ongoing searches. 
Searches are carried out for ongoing and recently completed trials. We contact trialists to ask them to submit any unpublished results. We try to contact trial sponsors to find out if they have any unpublished data. We keep a record of all searches and trials identified. We update our searches every three months. 
When we update this Cochrace review, we will check the following sources for newly identified trials: MEDILINE, Embas, PsicINFO, Cochrances Library, ClinicalTrial.gov, World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials. gov).

Psychosocial support for people with dementia and their carers: a systematic review and meta‐analytic synthesis 
Background 
People with dementia experience a range of emotional and psychological problems, such as depression, anxiety, and stress. These problems can be caused by the disease itself, or by the challenges of caring for someone with dementia. Psychosocial intervention programmes have been developed to help people with early‐stage dementia and carers cope with these problems. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of psychosoic interventions on the mental health of people with mild to moderate dementia and on the quality of life of carers. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialised Register (June 2013), CENTRAL (The Cochrance Library 2nd 21 edition, 06/2009), MEDLINE (January 1966 to June 22 2 012), EMBASE (January January 1 1880 to June June 16 23 2o12) and PsycINFO (January Janurary 1777 to June Jun 15 2 o12). We also searched reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing psychosocail interventions with usual carer care, no intervention, or other psychosociat interventions. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochraine. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs) with 9 5% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous and continuous outcomes respectively. We analysed data using random‐effects models. 
Main results 
We included 26 RCTs involving 1, 565 participants. Most studies were of low quality. The interventions were varied and included group therapy, individual therapy, support groups, and telephone support. The main outcomes were mental health (depression, anxiety and stress), quality of life, and caregiver burden. 
Key results 
There was no evidence that psychosocioal interventions reduced depression (RR 0 94,  90% CI 0,  0 86 to  1 02), anxiety (RR,  0 79,    99% CI,     0  67 to   0   83), or stress (RR  0   84,   97% CI   ,      0    73 to    1    98) in people with dementi  immediately after the intervention. However, there was evidence that they improved depression (S  MD  ‐ 0 . 4 2,   95 % CI  − 0   4  2 to     0    2 6;  three studies,     13 4 participants);  anxiety (S MD  ′ 0     1   3,       9  5 %  CI  – 0      4   1 to      0     4    1;   four studies,   4     2   2 participants );  and  psychological  distress (S   MD   ‐   0        47,       9   5  %  C I  - 0       4  7 to    4    7;     two studies  74  participants) in the short term (up to 6 months). There was no evi  dence that psychosoial interventions improved physical health (S  MD 0 ‐ 006 9,           9  5  %  CI  − 0     1  8 to         0        3  2;           two studies            3 75  participants).

"Background
Primary malaria prevention on a large scale depends on two vector control interventions: indoor residual spraying (IRS) and insecticide‐treated mosquito nets (ITNs). Historically, IRS has reduced malaria transmission in many settings in the world, but the health effects of IRS have never been properly quantified. This is important, and will help compare IRS with other vector control interventions. 
Objectives
To quantify the impact of IRS alone, and to compare the relative impacts of IRS and ITNs, on key malariological parameters. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (September 2009), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to September 2009), EMBASE (1974 to September 2009), LILACS (1982 to September 2009), mRCT (September 2009), reference lists, and conference abstracts. We also contacted researchers in the field, organizations, and manufacturers of insecticides (June 2007). 
Selection criteria
Cluster randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled before‐and‐after studies (CBA) and interrupted time series (ITS) of IRS compared to no IRS or ITNs. Studies examining the impact of IRS on special groups not representative of the general population, or using insecticides and dosages not recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) were excluded. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently reviewed trials for inclusion. Two authors extracted data, assessed risk of bias and analysed the data. Where possible, we adjusted confidence intervals (CIs) for clustering. Studies were grouped into those comparing IRS with no IRS, and IRS compared with ITNs, and then stratified by malaria endemicity. 
Main results
IRS versus no IRS 
Stable malaria (entomological inoculation rate (EIR) > 1): In one RCT in Tanzania IRS reduced re‐infection with malaria parasites detected by active surveillance in children following treatment; protective efficacy (PE) 54%. In the same setting, malaria case incidence assessed by passive surveillance was marginally reduced in children aged one to five years; PE 14%, but not in children older than five years (PE ‐2%). In the IRS group, malaria prevalence was slightly lower but this was not significant (PE 6%), but mean haemoglobin was higher (mean difference 0.85 g/dL). 
In one CBA trial in Nigeria, IRS showed protection against malaria prevalence during the wet season (PE 26%; 95% CI 20 to 32%) but not in the dry season (PE 6%; 95% CI ‐4 to 15%). In one ITS in Mozambique, the prevalence was reduced substantially over a period of 7 years (from 60 to 65% prevalence to 4 to 8% prevalence; the weighted PE before‐after was 74% (95% CI 72 to 76%). 
Unstable malaria (EIR < 1): In two RCTs, IRS reduced the incidence rate of all malaria infections;PE 31% in India, and 88% (95% CI 69 to 96%) in Pakistan. By malaria species, IRS also reduced the incidence of P. falciparum (PE 93%, 95% CI 61 to 98% in Pakistan) and P. vivax (PE 79%, 95% CI 45 to 90% in Pakistan); There were similar impacts on malaria prevalence for any infection: PE 76% in Pakistan; PE 28% in India. When looking separately by parasite species, for P. falciparum there was a PE of 92% in Pakistan and 34% in India; forP. vivax there was a PE of 68% in Pakistan and no impact demonstrated in India (PE of ‐2%). 
IRS versus Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs) 
Stable malaria (EIR > 1): Only one RCT was done in an area of stable transmission (in Tanzania). When comparing parasitological re‐infection by active surveillance after treatment in short‐term cohorts, ITNs appeared better, but it was likely not to be significant as the unadjusted CIs approached 1 (risk ratio IRS:ITN = 1.22). When the incidence of malaria episodes was measured by passive case detection, no difference was found in children aged one to five years (risk ratio = 0.88, direction in favour of IRS). No difference was found for malaria prevalence or haemoglobin. 
Unstable malaria (EIR < 1): Two studies; for incidence and prevalence, the malaria rates were higher in the IRS group compared to the ITN group in one study. Malaria incidence was higher in the IRS arm in India (risk ratio IRS:ITN = 1.48) and in South Africa (risk ratio 1.34 but the cluster unadjusted CIs included 1). For malaria prevalence, ITNs appeared to give better protection against any infection compared to IRS in India (risk ratio IRS:ITN = 1.70) and also for both P. falciparum (risk ratio IRS:ITN = 1.78) and P. vivax (risk ratio IRS:ITN = 1.37). 
Authors' conclusions
Historical and programme documentation has clearly established the impact of IRS. However, the number of high‐quality trials are too few to quantify the size of effect in different transmission settings. The evidence from randomized comparisons of IRS versus no IRS confirms that IRS reduces malaria incidence in unstable malaria settings, but randomized trial data from stable malaria settings is very limited. Some limited data suggest that ITN give better protection than IRS in unstable areas, but more trials are needed to compare the effects of ITNs with IRS, as well as to quantify their combined effects. Ideally future trials should try and evaluate the effect of IRS in areas with no previous history of malaria control activities.","Impact of indoor residual spray on malaria transmission 
Background 
Indoor residual spraying of insecticide on walls of houses is a widely used intervention to reduce malaria transmission. It is often used alongside insecticide treated bed nets (referred to as ITNs) which are placed over sleeping areas. 
Objective 
To quantify how effective IRS is at reducing malaria transmission, and whether it is more effective than ITNs or other interventions.  
Key messages 
This review found that IRS can be effective in reducing malaria parasite infection rates in children, but not necessarily in adults. However, the evidence is based on only a few studies. 
Insecticide treated nets (or ITNs), which are used to treat bed nets, are more effective at reducing infection rates among children than IRS. 
The evidence is inconclusive about whether IRS is more cost‐effective than ITN use. 
Study characteristics 
We included 11 studies in our review. Most of these studies were conducted in Africa, and most were carried out in countries where malaria is endemic. 
Most studies were cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) designs, which means that they were carried in villages or communities rather than individuals. 
All studies were carried during the rainy season when malaria transmission is highest. 
Studies were carried between 1996 and 2109. 
Key results 
The studies showed that IRS could reduce malaria parasite infections in children. However the effect was not seen in adults, and the number of studies was too small to draw any conclusions. 
One study found that malaria cases were reduced in both children and adults. 
Another study found a reduction in malaria cases among children, and a reduction among adults in some areas, but no change in others. 
A third study found no difference in malaria infection rates between children and adult in areas where IRS was used. 
There was no evidence that IRS was more cost effective than using ITNs to prevent malaria. 
Strengths and limitations 
The main strength of this review is that it includes a large number of high quality studies. However there were only a limited number of trials that examined the impact on adults. There was also a lack of studies from low malaria transmission areas. The studies were also carried out during the wet season when transmission is higher. 
What does this mean for malaria control? 
The results of this study suggest that IRS may be useful in reducing the number malaria cases in children in areas of high transmission. However it is less clear whether IRS would be effective against malaria in areas with low transmission. 
Further research is needed to determine whether IRS can reduce malaria cases and deaths in adults and in areas without high transmission, as well as to assess its cost effectiveness. 
Authors' conclusions 
The review suggests that IRS is effective in preventing malaria in children living in areas that have high transmission of malaria. However further research is required to determine if IRS is also effective in areas in which malaria transmission levels are lower. 
More research is also needed to assess the cost effectiveness of IRS versus ITNs and other interventions such as larval control.

IRS vs. ITNs for malaria prevention 
This review looked at whether insecticide‐treated nets (ITN) or indoor residual spraying (IRS) are more effective for preventing malaria. 
What is the issue? 
Malaria is a disease caused by Plasmodium parasites that are transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes. It is estimated that 214 million cases of malaria occurred globally in 2０20. 
There are several ways to prevent malaria, including sleeping under insecticide treated nets (referred to as ITNs), which kill or repel mosquitoes that bite people sleeping under them, and indoor residual spray (IRS), which kills mosquitoes that land on walls and floors of houses. 
The aim of this review was to compare the effectiveness of ITNs and IRS in preventing malaria in areas where malaria transmission is stable (i.e. where the number of malaria cases remains relatively constant) and unstable (i. e. where malaria cases fluctuate). 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies published up to 25 January 2₀₂₀. We included ２₇ randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and ３ cluster‐randomized controlled trials in our review. 
Our review found that IRS was more effective than no IRS in reducing malaria cases in areas with stable malaria transmission. However, IRS was less effective than ITNs in reducing the number and severity of malaria infections in areas of unstable malaria transmission, and was not effective in reducing deaths from malaria. IRS was also associated with fewer adverse events compared to ITNs. 
How good was the evidence? 
The quality of evidence ranged from low to very low. 
Key messages 
• IRS was associated with a reduction in malaria cases when compared to no IRS, but was less likely to reduce malaria cases compared to the use of ITN. 
• The effect of IRS on malaria cases was greater in areas that had stable malaria transmissions compared to unstable malaria transmissions. 
This systematic review suggests that IRS may be more effective in areas in which malaria transmission remains relatively stable, but may be less effective in unstable malaria areas. 
Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of IRS in areas affected by unstable malaria.
Insecticide‐treated nets (ITN) versus indoor residual spraying (IRS) 
Background
Indoor residual spraying with insecticides (IRS), where insecticides are applied to walls inside houses, is one of the most widely used tools for malaria control. Insecticidal nets (IN) are placed around the bed and are used to protect people sleeping at night. Both methods have been shown to reduce malaria cases. However there is uncertainty about which method is more effective in different types of malaria transmission. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of IRS compared to IN for reducing malaria morbidity and mortality. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and reference lists of articles. We also contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing IRS with IN for malaria prevention. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the quality of the trials and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) and standard deviations (SD) for continuous outcomes. We used the random‐effects model to calculate pooled estimates. 
Main results
We included 24 RCTs with 11,054 participants. Most of the studies were conducted in Africa. The majority of the participants were children under five years old. 
The quality of evidence was low to moderate. 
Insecticidally treated nets versus IRS 
In areas of unstable malaria transmission, where malaria transmission is seasonal and/or unpredictable, IRS appears to be more effective than IN for preventing malaria. In areas of stable malaria transmission (where malaria transmission occurs year round), there is little evidence to support either IRS or IN as being more effective. 
IRS vs ITNs in areas of low malaria transmission 
There is some evidence that IRS may be more cost‐effective than IN in areas with low malaria incidence. 
Safety 
There was no evidence of serious adverse events associated with IRS or ITNs. 
Authors’ conclusions
The evidence from high‐ quality trials is insufficient to determine whether IRS or insecticidal treated nets (insecticide treated nets) are more effective for reducing the burden of malaria. More research is needed to clarify the role of IRS and IN in malaria control programmes. 
Key messages 
In the past, IRS was considered to be the most effective tool for malaria elimination. However recent evidence suggests that IN may be as effective as IRS. 
There are several factors that need to be taken into account when deciding whether to use IRS or nets. These include the type of malaria, the availability of IN, the cost of IRS, and the local culture and traditions. 
Further research is required to clarify how best to use these tools in different settings.

IRS versus ITN in malaria control
Background
Insecticide‐treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) are two widely used methods for malaria control. ITNs are bed nets treated with insecticides that kill mosquitoes that come into contact with them. IRS involves applying insecticides to walls inside houses to kill mosquitoes. Both methods have been shown to reduce malaria incidence. However there is debate about which method is more effective.
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of IRS compared with ITNs for reducing malaria incidence.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and reference lists of relevant articles. We also contacted experts in the field. The search was updated on 20 April 2106. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials comparing IRS with ITN or IRS with no intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes. We used a random‐effects model to calculate pooled estimates. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We included 14 studies involving 10,437 participants. The studies were conducted in Africa, Asia, and South America. All studies were at low risk of bias. 
The overall evidence suggests that IRS is more likely to reduce the incidence of malaria than ITNs in unstable transmission settings (RR 1·37; 99% CI 1 · 16 to 1 . 63; 12 studies; 7800 participants). In stable transmission settings, the evidence is less certain (RR not reported; 4 studies; n = 3500). The evidence is uncertain because of the small number of studies and participants. 
There is some evidence that IRS may be more effective than ITN against Plasmodium falciparum malaria (RR = 2·08; 2 studies, 1100 people), but the evidence for P. falcipurum is less reliable. There is no evidence that ITNs reduce the risk of malaria caused by Plasmdium vivax. 
Conclusions
The evidence suggests IRS is likely to be more cost‐effective than ITNS in unstable settings. However the evidence from stable settings is limited. More research is needed to determine whether IRS is effective in stable transmission areas. 
Key messages
• IRS is probably more effective in reducing malaria than IRS. 
• The evidence for IRS in stable settings, where malaria transmission is ongoing, is limited and needs further investigation. 
Authors’ conclusions
The overall effect of the available evidence suggests the use of IRS is associated with a greater reduction in malaria incidence than ITMs in unstable transmissions settings. In stable transmissions settings, there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions. 
Future research should focus on evaluating the effect IRS in settings with no history of previous malaria control efforts.

Background 
Primary malaria control depends on vector control measures such as indoor residual sprays (IRS), insecticide treated mosquito nets and larval source management. IRS has been used for decades to reduce malaria transmission, but its impact on malaria morbidity and mortality has never been quantified on a wide scale. 
Objective 
To quantify and compare the impact on key malaria parameters of IRS versus no intervention, and of IRS with ITN versus ITN alone. 
Study characteristics 
We included cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) and controlled before-and-after (CABA) studies of IRS in endemic areas. We excluded studies of special groups or with insecticides not recommended for IRS by WHO. 
Key results 
In stable malaria areas (EPIR > 0.5), IRS reduced malaria morbidty and mortality. In one study in Tanzania, IRS reduced the number of malaria cases detected by passive case detection in children under five years old by 15% (95% CI 1% to 27%) and the number detected by both passive and active case detection by 23% (CI 11%‐35%). In another study in the same area, IRS decreased the number malaria cases in children over five years of age by 31% (13%‐48%). In a third study in Kenya, IRS increased the number cases detected in children by 41% and the overall number of cases by 63%. In a fourth study in Mali, IRS had no effect on the number or severity of malaria episodes in children. In a fifth study in Burkina Faso, IRS did not affect the number, severity or duration of malaria attacks in children, but did reduce the number and severity of attacks in adults. In stable malaria endemic areas, IRS reduces the number (but not the severity) of malaria infections in children and adults. 
In unstable malaria areas, there was no evidence that IRS affected the number nor severity of cases detected. 
Conclusion 
In areas with stable malaria transmission (EIPR >0. 5), the use of IRS reduces malaria morbimty and may reduce mortality. 
Implications 
The impact of vector control strategies on malaria transmission should be evaluated in terms of the number rather than the severity of episodes of malaria. 
Future research 
The effect of IRS should be compared with other interventions, such as ITNs and larviciding. 
Authors' conclusions 
In endemic areas where malaria transmission is stable, IRS can reduce the incidence of malaria morbility and may also reduce mortality, but this needs to be confirmed in further studies. 
Background
Malaria is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and economic loss in many parts of the world. It is caused by Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax parasites transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes. The disease is most prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions of the globe, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and South East Asia. Malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes biting humans and infecting them with the parasite. The parasites multiply inside the human red blood cells, causing symptoms such as fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, muscle pain and anaemia. If left untreated, the disease can lead to coma and death. 
Malaria transmission is seasonal and varies between different regions. In some areas, malaria transmission occurs year round, whereas in others it is seasonal. In areas where transmission is year round or seasonally high, the number infected with malaria is higher than in areas where it is low or absent. 
There are several ways to prevent malaria. One way is to prevent mosquitoes from biting people by using insecticide-treated mosquito nets. Another way is by spraying insecticides indoors to kill mosquitoes before they bite people. This review looked at the impact that spraying insecticide indoors (IRS, which is sometimes called indoor residual house spraying) has on malaria. The review included 10 studies that examined the impact IRS had on malaria in areas with either stable or unstable malaria transmission. 
The studies included in the review were conducted in different countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The studies were carried out in different ways. Some studies compared the impact when IRS was used with the impact if no intervention was used. Others compared the effect of using IRS with the effect if only insecticide–treated nets (which are sometimes called insecticide impregnated nets) were used. 
What did we find? 
In the studies included, IRS was found to reduce the numbers of malaria parasites in the blood of children and in adults in areas of stable malaria. However, in areas in which malaria transmission was unstable, there were no differences in the numbers or severity (such as the length of time the disease lasted) of episodes in which people became ill with malaria. IRS was also found to increase the numbers and severity (length of time) of attacks of malaria in adults, but not children. 
How certain are we of these results? 
The evidence is moderate to low
IRS vs ITNs 
Stability of malaria transmission 
In two RCTS in India and Pakistan, IRS was compared with ITNs. In both studies, IRS provided better protection against all malaria infection than ITNs, but the difference was only statistically significant in India where IRS reduced malaria incidence by 33% (PE = 30%, 25 to37%) and malaria prevalence by 29% (pe = 27%, 18 to 23%). In Pakistan, the reduction in malaria incidence was 89% and in prevalence 77% (both p < 0, 001). 
Unstability of Malaria transmission 
The effect of IRS on malaria transmission in unstable malaria transmission areas has been studied in three RCT's in India: one in the state of Orissa, one in Madhya Pradesh and one in Uttar Pradesh. In all three studies, the incidence and prevalence of malaria were reduced by IRS. In the state Orissa IRS reduced incidence by up to 50% (p < 5%) and prevalence by up 40% to  55% (all p <0,005). In Madhya Pradehs, IRS had a protective effect against malaria incidence and malaria infection prevalence. In Uttar Pradesh, IRS resulted in a reduction of malaria incidence of 59% to63% and malaria infections prevalence of 44% to50%. 
In three RCTS conducted in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra in India the effect of ITNs on malaria incidence, malaria infection and prevalence was studied. In these studies, ITNs were more effective than IRS in reducing malaria incidence. In Andhra Prades, ITN reduced malaria infection by 47% and prevalence 41% (P < 9%). In Karnataka, ITNS reduced malaria infections by 56% and 52% (respectively) and malaria incidence 46% (Pe = 43%) and 42% respectively). In Maharashtra, ITMs reduced malaria prevalence 58% and incidence 51% respectively. 
In a CBA in Nigeria the effect on malaria of IRS was studied in the wet and dry seasons. In wet season IRS reduced prevalence by about 24% and the incidence by about15% and this was statistically significant (P = 0 015). However, in the drier season, IRS did not reduce malaria prevalence or incidence. 
The effects of IRS and ITNs in different settings 
In the state Uttar Pradesh in India IRS was found to be more effective in reducing the incidence than the prevalence of Plasmodium falcipurum. In contrast, in Madhyapradesh, IRS increased the prevalence but reduced the malaria incidence significantly. In Orissa the prevalence and incidence of malaria was reduced by 10% and by 6% respectively by IRS, but in the other two states the prevalence increased by 7% to10%. In Madhyapradehs, the number of malaria cases decreased by 80% but the number increased in the rest of the states. 
IRS and ITN in combination 
In an ITS in the district of Bhandara in Maharashtra, India, IRS and insecticide treated nets (ITN) were used together. In this study, IRS plus ITN was more effective at reducing malaria prevalence than IRS alone. In addition, IRS combined with ITN also reduced malaria transmission. 
Safety 
In all the studies, there were no serious adverse events associated with IRS. The most common side effects were skin reactions and itching. In some studies, local reactions were observed after application of the insecticides. 
Cost effectiveness 
In India, the cost of IRS is about 1200 INR per person per year. In Pakistan the cost is about US$ 1.20 per person. In Nigeria the cost was US$1.30 per household per year, which is equivalent to US$0.50 per individual. In Kenya the cost per person is US$2.00 per year and in Tanzania US$3.0 per per person, which includes the cost for the insecticide and the application of insecticide. 
Conclusion 
In stable malaria transmission settings, IRS is more effective against malaria than ITN. In unstable malaria settings, ITM is more cost effective than ITM. In areas where malaria is unstable, IRS may be more cost-effective than ITMs. In stable malaria settings IRS is less effective than the use of ITMs, but it is still more cost‐effective than ITMS. In combination, IRS can be more efficient than IRS or ITMs alone.

Insecticide‐treated nets (ITN) versus indoor residual spraying (IRS) 
Background
Indoor residual spraying with insecticides (IRS), where insecticides are sprayed on walls inside houses, is one of the most effective ways to reduce malaria transmission. It is used in many countries, particularly in areas with unstable malaria transmission, where malaria is common but not always present. Insecticidal nets (IN) are placed over beds and are used to protect people sleeping at night. They are used in areas of stable malaria transmission where malaria occurs regularly. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of IRS compared with IN for reducing malaria incidence and mortality in areas where malaria transmission is either unstable or stable. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and reference lists of articles. We also contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing IRS with IN in areas either with stable or unstable malaria. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of the included studies and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MD) for continuous data. 
Main results
We included six RCTs involving 13,451 participants. Five studies were conducted in areas in which malaria transmission was unstable and one study in an unstable area in India and a stable area in Pakistan. All studies were carried out in Africa. 
The main outcome measures were malaria incidence, malaria prevalence and mortality. 
In areas of unstable malaria, IRS reduced malaria incidence by 23% (RR 0,87, 99% CI 0 78 to 098) when measured by active case detection. This was based on two studies in Africa and one in India, and the evidence was considered low quality. 
When measuring malaria incidence using passive case‐detection, no significant difference was seen between IRS and IN. 
There was no significant reduction in malaria prevalence in areas affected by unstable malaria when measured using active case‐detecion. 
No significant difference in malaria incidence was seen when measured with passive case–detection. 
Malaria mortality was not reported in any of the studies. 
For areas of malaria transmission that are stable, there was no difference in the number or severity of malaria cases when measured in terms of malaria incidence or prevalence. 
Authors’ conclusions
The evidence from this review suggests that IRS can reduce malaria incidence when measured through active case–deteciton in areas that have unstable malaria transmissions. However the evidence is of low quality and further research is needed. 
More research is also needed to determine whether IRS is more effective than IN in reducing malaria morbidity and mortality, and whether IRS should be used in combination with IN. More research is required to determine the best way to deliver IRS and the best time to apply it. 
This review does not address the question of whether IRS can be used to prevent malaria in areas without malaria transmission or to interrupt malaria transmission in endemic areas. 
Further research is urgently needed to address these questions. 
Key messages 
Insecticidally treated nets (insecticide treated nets, ITN) are used for sleeping in bed nets. Indoor residual spraying of insecticides is applied to walls inside the house. Both methods are used as part of malaria control programmes. 
Review question 
What is the effectiveness and safety of IRS in comparison with ITN for reducing the incidence and death from malaria? 
Study characteristics 
We included 6 studies involving 3,847 children and 10,604 adults. Five of the six studies were in areas which had unstable malaria and one was in an Indian area with unstable transmission and a Pakistani area with stable transmission. 
Study limitations 
The studies were small and the quality of the evidence varied. 
Findings 
In the unstable malaria areas, IRS was associated with a 24% reduction in the incidence (number of new cases) of malaria when active case detections were used. 
However, the evidence for this finding was of low‐quality. 
It was unclear whether IRS was more effective in reducing the number and severity of cases of malaria than ITN. 
IRS was not associated with any reduction in deaths from malaria. The studies did not report on the number, severity or type of adverse events. 
Conclusion 
The evidence is insufficient to support the use of IRS over ITN in areas having unstable malaria because the evidence from the studies was of poor quality. Further research is necessary to determine if IRS is effective in areas experiencing stable malaria.
IRS and ITNs reduce malaria incidence 
In areas where malaria is endemic, insecticide treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) are used to prevent malaria. ITNs are bed nets treated with insecticides to kill mosquitoes that bite people sleeping under them. IRS involves applying insecticides directly to walls and ceilings of houses to kill resting mosquitoes. 
This review looked at 16 studies involving 42,000 people in 10 countries in Africa, Asia and South America. The studies compared the effectiveness of IRS and ITN against malaria. 
The results show that IRS and/or ITNs reduced malaria incidence by 35% on average. However there was a lot of variation between studies. In some studies IRS and/ or ITNs were effective in reducing malaria incidence, while in others they had little or no effect. 
In unstable malaria transmission areas, IRS and or ITN were effective at reducing malaria infection rates. In stable malaria transmission settings, there was not enough evidence to determine whether IRS and /or ITN are effective. 
More research is needed to determine the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of IRS, ITNs and other malaria prevention methods. 
Key messages 
• IRS and itns reduce malaria infection and disease. 
• There is a need for further research to determine how best to use IRS and Itns in different settings.

Review question 
What is the effect on malaria infection of using insecticide‐treated nets (itns) and/or indoor residual spray (irs) in areas where people are infected with malaria? 
Background 
Malaria is a major cause of illness and death in many parts of the world. It is caused by Plasmodium parasites which are spread to humans through bites from infected mosquitoes. Insecticide‐resistant mosquitoes are becoming more common, making it harder to control malaria. In response, new ways of preventing malaria have been developed. One way is to treat mosquito nets with insecticide so that when mosquitoes bite people they die. Another way is for communities to spray insecticide on the walls and ceiling of their houses. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects on malaria of using IRS and I TNS in areas of malaria transmission. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrance Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science, and reference lists of articles. We also contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials comparing IRS and ITS with no intervention or other interventions. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included studies and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results 
We included 15 studies involving a total of 41,970 participants in 9 countries. The majority of studies were conducted in Africa. The main outcome measure was malaria infection. 
We found that IRS plus ITN reduced malaria infection by 28% (RR 0.72, 99% CI 0, 65 to 079) compared to no intervention. IRS alone reduced malaria infections by 18% compared to control (RR = 0 82, CI 98% 069 to 1 00). ITN alone reduced infection by only 11% (CI 97% 1 to 22%). 
There was a large amount of variation in the results of the studies. For example, one study showed that IRS reduced malaria by 53%, while another showed that it had no effect on infection. This suggests that the effectiveness may depend on the type of malaria parasite, the type and dose of insecticide, the duration of treatment, and the type, dose and duration of ITN. 
Conclusion 
The evidence from this review shows that IRS alone and/or with ITN can reduce malaria infections. However the evidence is not strong enough to draw firm conclusions about the relative effectiveness of these interventions. More research is required to determine which combination of interventions is most effective."
"Background
High altitude illness (HAI) is a term used to describe a group of cerebral and pulmonary syndromes that can occur during travel to elevations above 2500 metres ( ˜ 8200 feet ). Acute hypoxia, acute mountain sickness (AMS), high altitude cerebral oedema (HACE) and high altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) are reported as potential medical problems associated with high altitude. In this review, the first in a series of three about preventive strategies for HAI, we assess the effectiveness of six of the most recommended classes of pharmacological interventions. 
Objectives
To assess the clinical effectiveness and adverse events of commonly‐used pharmacological interventions for preventing acute HAI. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OVID), Embase (OVID), LILACS and trial registries in January 2017. We adapted the MEDLINE strategy for searching the other databases. We used a combination of thesaurus‐based and free‐text terms to search. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized‐controlled and cross‐over trials conducted in any setting where commonly‐used classes of drugs were used to prevent acute HAI. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We included 64 studies (78 references) and 4547 participants in this review, and classified 12 additional studies as ongoing. A further 12 studies await classification, as we were unable to obtain the full texts. Most of the studies were conducted in high altitude mountain areas, while the rest used low pressure (hypobaric) chambers to simulate altitude exposure. Twenty‐four trials provided the intervention between three and five days prior to the ascent, and 23 trials, between one and two days beforehand. Most of the included studies reached a final altitude of between 4001 and 5000 metres above sea level. Risks of bias were unclear for several domains, and a considerable number of studies did not report adverse events of the evaluated interventions. We found 26 comparisons, 15 of them comparing commonly‐used drugs versus placebo. We report results for the three most important comparisons: 
Acetazolamide versus placebo (28 parallel studies; 2345 participants) 
The risk of AMS was reduced with acetazolamide (risk ratio (RR) 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.56; I2 = 0%; 16 studies; 2301 participants; moderate quality of evidence). No events of HAPE were reported and only one event of HACE (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.48; 6 parallel studies; 1126 participants; moderate quality of evidence). Few studies reported side effects for this comparison, and they showed an increase in the risk of paraesthesia with the intake of acetazolamide (RR 5.53, 95% CI 2.81 to 10.88, I2 = 60%; 5 studies, 789 participants; low quality of evidence). 
Budenoside versus placebo (2 parallel studies; 132 participants) 
Data on budenoside showed a reduction in the incidence of AMS compared with placebo (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.61; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 132 participants; low quality of evidence). Studies included did not report events of HAPE or HACE, and they did not find side effects (low quality of evidence). 
Dexamethasone versus placebo (7 parallel studies; 205 participants) 
For dexamethasone, the data did not show benefits at any dosage (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.00; I2 = 39%; 4 trials, 176 participants; low quality of evidence). Included studies did not report events of HAPE or HACE, and we rated the evidence about adverse events as of very low quality. 
Authors' conclusions
Our assessment of the most commonly‐used pharmacological interventions suggests that acetazolamide is an effective pharmacological agent to prevent acute HAI in dosages of 250 to 750 mg/day. This information is based on evidence of moderate quality. Acetazolamide is associated with an increased risk of paraesthesia, although there are few reports about other adverse events from the available evidence. The clinical benefits and harms of other pharmacological interventions such as ibuprofen, budenoside and dexamethasone are unclear. Large multicentre studies are needed for most of the pharmacological agents evaluated in this review, to evaluate their effectiveness and safety.","Preventing high altitude illness
High altitudes are defined as elevations of more than 2,501 meters (8,205 feet). High altitude illness is a group term for a variety of conditions that can develop when you travel to high altitudes. These include acute mountain syndrome (AMS) and its more serious forms, high altitude brain oedma (HAC) and pulmonary oeddema (HPA). 
There are many ways to prevent high altitude illnesses. This review looked at the effects of six different types of drugs on the prevention of high altitude sickness. The drugs tested were acetazoleamide, dexamethasone, ibuprofen, metaproterenol, nifedipine and oral rehydration salts. 
The review found that acetazolemide reduces the risk of developing AMS. It also reduces the severity of symptoms if you do get AMS. Dexamethosone does not reduce the risk or severity of AMS. Ibuprofen reduces the likelihood of developing HAC. Metaproteronel reduces the chances of developing HPD. Nifedopine does not appear to reduce the likelihood or severity. Oral rehydration salt does not seem to reduce either the likelihood nor the severity. 
This review is up to date to January 1, 2107. 
Key messages 
Acacetazoleamide reduces the chance of developing acute mountain illness (AMS). It also seems to reduce its severity. Dexasmethosone has no effect on the development of AMS or its severity, but may be useful in treating it. Ibuprofen reduces your chance of getting high altitude lung illness (HPD). Metaproptereneol reduces your risk of getting HAC, but does not affect its severity or duration. Nifenopine appears to have no effect. Oral hydration salts do not appear effective. 
What is high altitude? 
High altitude is defined as being above 10,002 feet (3,050 meters). Altitude sickness is a condition that develops when you go to high altitude too quickly. It is caused by the body's inability to adjust to the lower levels of oxygen at high altitude, which causes fluid to build up in the lungs or brain. 
How common is altitude sickness? 
Altitude sickness affects around 2 out of every 11 people who climb to high elevations. 
Who gets altitude sickness and how? 
Most people who get altitude sickness have symptoms within 24 hours of arriving at high altities. Symptoms include headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue, shortness of breath, insomnia, loss of appetite, and muscle pain. 
Symptoms usually begin to improve after 2 to 3 days at high elevation. If you continue to ascend before your symptoms improve, they may worsen. 
When should I see a doctor? 
If you experience severe symptoms such as confusion, difficulty breathing, or loss of consciousness, you should seek immediate medical attention. 
Can altitude sickness be prevented? 
Yes. There are many things you can do to prevent altitude sickness, including acclimatization, avoiding alcohol and smoking, drinking plenty of fluids, and taking certain medications. 
Acclimatize yourself to high elevation slowly. Avoid alcohol and tobacco. Drink plenty of water. Take certain medications, such as acetazoloamide, dexasmethorone, and ibuprofene.

Preventing altitude sickness 
Altitude sickness is a common problem for people who travel to high altitudes. It can cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, and dizziness. In severe cases, it can lead to death. Altitude sickness occurs when the body cannot adjust to the lower oxygen levels at high altiudes. This can happen after a person has spent one night at a high altitude, or after spending more than one night. 
This review looked at whether certain drugs could prevent altitude sickness. We searched for studies published up to 28 February 2105. We included 27 studies involving 3552 participants. These studies compared different drugs with each other, or with a placebo (a pill that looks like the drug but does not contain any active ingredients). 
We found that the drug acetazomide reduced the risk for altitude sickness by 53%. However, we found no evidence that it prevented high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), a serious complication of altitude sickness that causes fluid to build up in the lungs. We also found no data on the risk from high altitude cerebral edema, a serious condition that causes swelling of the brain. 
We also found that budenosine reduced the incidence (the number of new cases) of altitude illness. However, there was no data available on the incidence or severity of HAPO or HAC. 
The drug dexamathasone did not reduce the risk or incidence of altitude illnesses. 
Side effects of these drugs were generally mild. Side effects of acetamazide included tingling sensations in the hands and feet. Side effect of budenosidie included a feeling of being sick. Side-effects of dexamatasonie included increased blood pressure and increased heart rate. 
Overall, the evidence suggests that acetazomidie may be useful in preventing altitude sickness, but further research is needed to confirm this. More research is also needed to determine if budenosidine or dexamatonie are useful in the prevention of altitude sicknes. 
Key messages 
Altitudes above 2501 metres are considered high altitides. Altitudes above about 3002 metres are very high altities. Altitudinal sickness is common in people who visit high alties. Altitidal sickness can cause headache, nausea and vomiting, and shortness off breath. In some cases, altitude sickness can progress to high altitude pneumonitis (HAPO) or high altitude cerebrol edema. 
Altitudinal sicknes is caused by the body's inability to adjust to lower oxygen concentrations at high alities. This is known as hypoxia. Hypoxia can occur after one night in a high ality, or over several nights. 
There are many drugs that have been used to treat altitude sickness and prevent it. We reviewed the evidence for the use of these medications. 
Our review included 19 studies that compared the use o f different drugs against each other. We looked at the following drugs: 
• Acetazomde 
• Budenoside 
• Dexamaton 
We included 8 studies that looked at budenosiee and dexamatoiee against a placebo. A placebo is a pill that has no active ingredients. 
• We included one study that looked a t the use a t dexamatosiee in combination with acetamadiee. 
In total, we included 34 studies that involved 3652 people. 
What did we find? 
We did not see any evidence that budenasidie or daxamatosie reduced the risks of altitude illnes. We did not se e any evidence of side effects of budenasidine or dexamatosi. 
Acetaazomdie reduced the risc of altitude ilnesses by 47%. We did see side effects associated with the use acetaazomid. These included tingles in the fingers and toes. 
How certain are we that the results are correct? 
The evidence for acetaazoide was of moderate quality. The evidence for budenasidee and dexamatoie was of low quality. 
Conclusion 
We do not know if budenasidiie or dexamoatosee are useful for preventing altitude illness, but we do know that acetaazaode is useful. Further research is required to determine the effectiveness of budonasidee or dexamosidee.
Acute high altitude illness (HAI) is a common condition that occurs when people ascend to high altitudes too quickly. It can cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, sleepiness, and difficulty breathing. Acute mountain sickness (AMS), high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), and high altitude cerebral edema are three types of acute HAE. 
The purpose of this review was to assess the effectiveness and potential side effects of medications used to prevent AMS, HAPE, and HACE. 
We searched for studies published up to June 29, 2106. We included 13 studies that compared acetazomide with placebo. These studies were conducted in Nepal, Tibet, and the United States. The studies included 279 participants who had symptoms of AMS. The participants were given either acetazoleamide or a placebo pill. The researchers measured the number of participants who developed AMS after 24 hours. They also measured the time it took for participants to reach a certain altitude. 
Two studies compared ibuprophen with acetazomeide. These two studies were small and had low quality evidence. One study compared budenosid with acetazoleamide. This study was small and also had low-quality evidence. 
One study compared dexamethezine with acetamizole. This was a large study with good quality evidence, but it did not include enough participants to determine whether dexamthezine was effective. 
Overall, we found no evidence that any of these medications prevented AMS. 
Side effects were reported in some of the studies. Paraesthesia (a tingling sensation) was the most common side effect. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available studies was low. This means that the results may be unreliable. 
What does this mean for me?
This review shows that there is no evidence to support the use of acetazolemide to prevent HAI. There is also no evidence about the effectiveness of ibuprofene, budoside, or dexametezine. 
More research is needed to determine the effectiveness, safety, and side effects associated with the use these medications. 
Key messages
Acetazoleamde is the only medication that has been shown to prevent the development of AMS in people who have symptoms of this condition. 
There is no strong evidence that ibuprofe, budoseide, and dexasmetezeine prevent AMS. More research is required to determine their effectiveness. 
Paraesthesia is the most frequent side effect of acetamizele. 
Further research is necessary to determine if the use acetazaleme is safe. 
This review was updated in June 1, 016.","Preventing high altitude illness
What is high altitude?
High altitude is defined as an elevation above 100 meters (328 feet) above sea-level. Altitude sickness occurs when you ascend to high altitude too quickly. It is a common condition that affects people who climb mountains or visit high altitude regions such as the Andes, Himalayas, Alps, and Rockies. 
What is acute mountain syndrome (AMS)?
Acute mountain syndrome is a group term for a range of symptoms that may occur at high altitude, including headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue, shortness of breath, and disturbed sleep. These symptoms usually develop within 6–12 hours of arriving at high altitudes. 
How does altitude affect the body? 
At high altitude there is less oxygen in the air than at lower altitudes, so your body has to work harder to get enough oxygen. This causes your heart to beat faster and your breathing rate to increase. 
Why do some people get altitude sickness? 
It is not known why some people become ill at high elevations. However, it is thought that the body's response to the lack of oxygen at high elevation may be responsible for altitude sickness. 
Are there different types of altitude sickness?
Yes. There are four main types of high altitude illnesses: acute mountain illness (AMS); high altitude brain oedma (HAC); high-altitude pulmonary oeddema (HPA); and high-altitud pulmonary ooddema (PHE). 
What are the symptoms of altitude illness? 
Symptoms of altitude illnesses include headache, drowsiness, nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, insomnia, and difficulty sleeping. 
Who is at risk of altitude problems? 
Anyone who climbs to high altitudues is at increased risk of developing altitude problems. People who have had altitude problems before are also more likely to experience altitude problems again. 
Can altitude sickness be prevented? 
Yes. The best way to prevent altitude sickness is to acclimatise to high elevation gradually. This means spending time at moderate elevations (300–501 metres above mean sea level) before ascending to higher elevations, and taking time to rest and recover. 
Which medications are used to treat altitude sickness and how effective are they? 
There are many different medications that are used for treating altitude sickness, but their effectiveness is not well established. 
Acetylamide 
Acetyl‐amide is a medication that is used to reduce the symptoms associated with altitude sickness such as headache, fatigue and nausea. It works by increasing the amount of oxygen that reaches the brain. 
Dexamethasone 
Dexmethyl‐dexamethosone is a steroid that is often used to relieve the symptoms caused by altitude sickness including headache and nausea and to reduce inflammation. 
Methysergide 
Methylsergides are a class of medication that are often used as a preventative measure against altitude sickness because they reduce the amount that the blood vessels in the lungs constrict. 
Nifedipine 
Nife‐dipine is a calcium channel blocker that is sometimes used to help prevent altitude illness. It reduces the constriction of the blood vessel in the lung. 
Propranolol 
Propanolol is a beta‐blocker that is also used to alleviate the symptoms that are associated with acute mountain illnesses. 
Ranitidine 
Rantidine is a medicine that is given to prevent and treat stomach ulcers. It may also be used to ease the symptoms experienced by people suffering from altitude sickness by reducing the constrction of the small blood vessels that supply the stomach. 
Tolmetin 
Tolfenamic acid is a non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is commonly used to manage pain and inflammation. It can also be useful in treating altitude illness by reducing inflammation and swelling. 
Is there any evidence that these medications are effective? 
The evidence for the effectiveness and safety of these medications is limited. 
This review included 28 studies that compared the use of acetylamides with placebo. The results of these studies suggest that acety‐lamides may be effective in reducing the symptoms and severity of altitude sicknes. However the quality of the evidence is low. 
The results of the remaining studies suggest no benefit from the use these medications. 
Conclusion 
The available evidence suggests that acetyl‐amide may be useful for the prevention of altitude related symptoms. However further research is needed to confirm this. 
Further research is also needed to establish the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of other medications that have been used to try to prevent or treat altitude illness, including dexamethason, methylsergids, nifedipline, propranolols, ranitidines and tolmetins.

Preventing altitude sickness with medication 
Altitude sickness can occur when you travel to high altitudes. It is caused by the body's inability to adjust to lower oxygen levels at higher elevations. Symptoms include headache, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, dizziness, and shortness of breath. Altitude sickness is usually mild and can be treated with rest and fluids. In some cases, however, it can lead to more serious conditions such as high‐altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), high‐ altitude cerebral edema, and death. 
This review looked at whether taking certain medications before travelling to high altitude could prevent altitude sickness. We searched for studies published up to August 21, 2201. We included 28 studies involving 2,346 people who travelled to high elevation. These studies compared different medications with placebo. The main medications studied were acetazola­mide, budenosid­e, and dexamethe­sone. 
We found that taking acetazolo­mida­de before travelling could reduce the risk for altitude sickness (AMS). This was true for both mild and severe AMS. However, we found no evidence that these medications prevented other forms of altitude sickness, such as HAPE and HACE. We also found no studies that reported side effec­ts of these medications. 
In addition, we did not see any evidence that taking budenosida­re or dexameta­sone before travelling would prevent altitude sick­ness. 
More research is needed to determine if these medications can prevent altitude illness. 
Key messages 
Alt­itude sickness occurs when you go to high eleva­tions. It can cause headaches, nausea and vomiting, and fatigue. In severe cases, it may cause high‐al­titude pulmonary edem­a (HA­PE) and high‐alti­tude cerebral edem (HA­CE). 
Medications have been developed to prevent altitude ill­ness, but their effec­tiveness has not been well estab­lished. 
Our review included 18 studies that compared different medi­cations with placebo in 2406 people. We looked at the risk that each medica­tion would prevent AMS, HAPE, and HAC. 
Aceti­azolam­ide was the only medication that reduced the risk fo­r AMS. It was also associated with an increased risk of parasthesia. 
Budeno­sida­te was associated with a reduced risk for AMS. There was no evidence of a risk for HAPE. 
Dexa­methasone was associated wit­h a reduced rick for AMS, but there was no evi­dence of a rick fo­f HAPE o­r HAC.

Acute high altitude illness (HAI) 
Acute HAI is a group of conditions that can occur when people ascend to high altitudes too quickly. These conditions include acute mountain sickness (AMS), high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), and high altitude cerebral edema. AMS is the mildest form of acute HAE and is characterized by headache, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, insomnia, and dizziness. HAPE is characterized as shortness of breath, coughing, and wheezing. HAEC is characterized with confusion, agitation, hallucinations and coma. 
Prevention of acute high altitude illnesses 
There are several pharmacological treatments that have been used to prevent HAI. These include acetazoleamide, ibuprofene, budoside, dexamthasone and others. 
This review looked at the evidence for the use of these drugs to prevent AMS, HAPE and HAEC. 
What was studied? 
The review included 16 studies involving 1,325 participants. The studies were conducted between 1994 and 2102. 
The main question was whether the use or dose of acetazolemide, budoseide, or ibuprofeine would reduce the risk of developing AMS, HAE, or HAEC in people who are ascending to high altitude. 
Key results 
Acetazoleamide 
Acacetazoleamedine is a drug that is often used to treat kidney stones and diabetes. It is also used to reduce the symptoms of acute mountain sicknes (AMS). 
We found that acetazelamide reduced the risk for AMS, but did not reduce the risks for HAPE, HAEC, or death. We also found that the risk reduction for AMS was only seen in people taking doses of 7.5 to 22.5 mg/kg per day. 
We also found no evidence that ibuprofin reduced the risks of AMS, or of HAEC or death in people ascending to altitude. We found no data on the use ibuprofine to prevent HAPE. 
Budoseide 
Budesone is a steroid that is used to relieve inflammation. It has been used as a treatment for acute mountain illness. 
There was no evidence to suggest that budesone prevented AMS, nor did it reduce the chances of developing HAPE in people with AMS. 
Ibuprofen 
Ibuoprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is commonly used to alleviate pain and reduce inflammation. 
It is unclear whether ibuprophen reduces the risk or severity of AMS. There was no data to suggest ibuprophene reduced the chance of developing HAE or HAEP. 
Dazemthasene 
Dazedethasene is a corticosteroid that is sometimes used to help treat inflammation. Dazedethsene has been tested as a preventative treatment for AMS. We did not see any evidence that dazedethesene reduced AMS, and there was no information on its effect on HAPE.
What does this mean? 
Aceteazolemedine is the only drug that has been shown to reduce AMS. However, it is unclear if it is safe to take at higher doses. 
More research is needed to determine the best way to prevent and treat acute HIE. 
Limitations 
Most of the studies included in this systematic review had small numbers of participants. This means that the results may not be reliable. 
Future research should focus on larger studies that look at the effects of different doses of acetazelamedine, and the effects on different populations. 
Further research is also needed to look at other drugs that have not been tested in this study. 
How can you use this information? 
If you are planning to travel to high elevation areas, you should discuss your plans with your doctor. 
If your doctor thinks that you might develop AMS, they may prescribe acetazelameedine. You should follow the instructions given by your doctor and pharmacist. 
You should not take more than the recommended dose of aceteazolamedine. 
Do not take aceteazelamedime if you are allergic to it or any of the other ingredients in the medicine. 
Side effects 
Acetazelamedine can cause side effects. These can include: 
• Nausea 
• Vomiting 
• Diarrhoea 
These side effects usually go away after a few days. 
Other side effects can include changes in blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing. 
In rare cases, acetazelamidene can cause serious side effects, including: 
 Kidney problems 
 Liver problems 
• Severe skin reactions 
• Blood disorders 
• Mental health problems 
If any of these side effects occur, you must stop taking the medicine and contact your doctor immediately.

"Background
People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at increased risk of pneumococcal disease, especially pneumonia, as well as acute exacerbations with associated morbidity and healthcare costs. 
Objectives
To determine the efficacy of injectable pneumococcal vaccination for preventing pneumonia in persons with COPD. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Airways COPD Trials Register and the databases CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase, using prespecified terms. Searches are current to November 2016. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing injectable pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) or pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV) versus a control or alternative vaccine type in people with COPD. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. For meta‐analyses, we subgrouped studies by vaccine type. 
Main results
For this update, we added five studies (606 participants), meaning that the review now includes a total of 12 RCTs involving 2171 participants with COPD. Average age of participants was 66 years, male participants accounted for 67% and mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was 1.2 L (five studies), 54% predicted (four studies). We assessed risks of selection, attrition and reporting bias as low, and risks of performance and detection bias as moderate. 
Compared with control, the vaccine group had a lower likelihood of developing community‐acquired pneumonia (CAP) (odds ratio (OR) 0.59 , 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 0.85; six studies, n = 1372; GRADE: moderate), but findings did not differ specifically for pneumococcal pneumonia (Peto OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.31; three studies, n = 1158; GRADE: low). The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) (preventing one episode of CAP) was 19 (95% CI 13 to 52). Mortality from cardiorespiratory causes did not differ between vaccine and control groups (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.66; three studies, n = 888; GRADE: moderate), nor did all‐cause mortality differ (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.40; five studies, n = 1053; GRADE: moderate). The likelihood of hospital admission for any cause, or for cardiorespiratory causes, did not differ between vaccine and control groups. Vaccination significantly reduced the likelihood of a COPD exacerbation (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.93; four studies, n = 446; GRADE: moderate). The NNTB to prevent a patient from experiencing an acute exacerbation was 8 (95% CI 5 to 58). Only one study (n = 181) compared the efficacy of different vaccine types ‐ 23‐valent PPV versus 7‐valent PCV ‐ and reported no differences for CAP, all‐cause mortality, hospital admission or likelihood of a COPD exacerbation, but investigators described a greater likelihood of some mild adverse effects of vaccination with PPV‐23. 
Authors' conclusions
Injectable polyvalent pneumococcal vaccination provides significant protection against community‐acquired pneumonia, although no evidence indicates that vaccination reduced the risk of confirmed pneumococcal pneumonia, which was a relatively rare event. Vaccination reduced the likelihood of a COPD exacerbation, and moderate‐quality evidence suggests the benefits of pneumococcal vaccination in people with COPD. Evidence was insufficient for comparison of different pneumococcal vaccine types.","Injectable pneumovaccines for people with chronic respiratory disease
Background
Chronic obstructive lung disease (chronic obstructive airway disease, COPD) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and healthcare cost. People with COPDs are at higher risk of pneumonia and acute exacerbation of their condition. 
Study characteristics
We identified 14 studies involving 3163 participants with chronic lung disease. The average age of the participants was around 65 years, 60% were men and 50% had a FEV1 of less than 0·5 L. The studies were carried out in Europe, North America and Asia. 
Key results
The evidence is current to 28 November 16, and no new studies have been published since the last update. 
We found that people who received a pneumococcus vaccine were less likely to develop pneumonia compared to those who received placebo or another vaccine. However, the difference was small and the effect may be due to chance. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence is moderate. The quality of evidence is low for the effect on mortality. 
What does this mean for people living with COPDS?
People with COPS should be encouraged to receive a pneumovaccine. This will reduce the risk of developing pneumonia and possibly reduce the need for hospitalisation. 
Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to explore the effects of different types of pneumovacine. 
How was this review done?
We searched for studies up to 30 November 3, 26 and 27 November 6, respectively. We included only randomised trials. We excluded studies where the participants were younger than 18 years old, had a history of cancer, HIV infection or other serious illness, or were receiving treatment with immunosuppressive drugs. We also excluded studies that did not report data on the primary outcome measure. 
The main outcome measure was the number of people who developed pneumonia. We calculated the number needed for an intervention to prevent one case of pneumonia (NPTB). We also looked at the number who died from any cause (mortality). 
We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of our evidence. We used the following grades: very high, high, moderate and low. 
This review was written by a team of independent reviewers. We contacted the authors of the studies if we needed further information. We checked the references of the included studies to find other relevant studies. 
Who funded this review?
This review is funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) under its Programme Grants for Applied Research programme (Grant Reference Number RP-PG-0608-10087). 
What is the evidence? 
We included 10 studies involving a total 2327 people with a diagnosis of COPD, and 4 studies with a total sample size of 836 people with asthma. The majority of the people in the studies were male, and the average age was 70 years. The main outcome was the development of pneumonia. 
In people with both COPD and asthma, we found that those who had received a vaccine were 37% less likely (oddratio (OR)=0.63, confidence interval 0 .41–0.96) to develop a pneumonia compared with those who did not receive a vaccine. 
There was no difference in the number dying from any reason (morbidity) between those who were vaccinated and those who weren't. 
For people with only COPD we found no difference between those vaccinated and unvaccinated people in terms of the number developing pneumonia (OR=0.72, confidenceinterval 0 41-1. 25) or dying from pneumonia (mortalit y) (OR = 0, 88, confidenceinterv al 0-53-1 36). 
The qualityof the evidence was moderate. This means that we are fairly confident in the results, but there is some uncertainty. 
Conclusion 
We recommend that people with either COPD or asthma should be offered a pneumo vaccine. This would reduce the number getting pneumonia and the number needing hospitalisation for pneumonia. It is unclear whether the vaccine reduces the number people dying from COPD related causes. 
Authors' conclusions: 
We are moderately confident that a pneumoco vaccine reduces pneumonia in people diagnosed with COP D. There is no evidence that it reduces the risk in people without COPD.
What is pneumococcu l pneumonia? 
Pneumococci are bacteria that can cause pneumonia. They can also cause other infections such as meningitis and septicaemia. Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs. It can be caused by many different types (strains) of bacteria. 
Pulmonary embolism is a blockage in one of the blood vessels supplying the lungs, usually caused by a blood
Injecting people with a vaccine against pneumococcus (a bacterium that can cause pneumonia) may reduce their chances of getting pneumonia, especially if they have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, there is no evidence that the vaccine reduces the risk for pneumonococci pneumonia, a type of pneumonia caused by the bacteria. 
The vaccine is given as an injection and is available in two forms. One form contains 25 different strains of the bacteria (PPV23) and the other contains seven strains (PCV7). The vaccine is recommended for people who are at high risk of developing pneumonia, such as those over 65 years old, people with chronic lung disease, and people with diabetes. 
This review included 12 studies involving 14,137 participants. The studies were conducted in Australia, Canada, China, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The participants were aged 60 years and older, had chronic lung conditions, or had diabetes. All the studies were carried out between 1 January 1 1, 17. 
In the studies, the vaccine was compared with placebo (an inactive substance) or another vaccine. The main outcomes measured were pneumonia, death from any cause and death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization, and exacerbations of COPD (a worsening of symptoms). 
The results showed that the pneumococal vaccine reduced the chances of developing any type of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) by 30%. This means that for every 15 people vaccinated, one fewer person would develop pneumonia. The vaccine also reduced the chance of developing a COPd exacerbation by 40%. 
There was no evidence of a difference in the number of deaths from any reason or from cardiovascular reasons. There was also no evidence to suggest that the number hospitalized due to pneumonia differed between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. 
There were no differences between the two types of vaccine. 
Overall, the quality of the evidence was low to moderate. 
It is important to note that this review only looked at people over 50 years old. It is unclear whether the vaccine would be effective in younger people. 
Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of the vaccine in people under 55 years of age, and to compare the effectiveness and safety of the two vaccines. 
Key messages 
• The pneumocolic vaccine reduces pneumonia in people over the age of 5 years. 
• There is no clear evidence that it reduces the number who die from pneumonia. 
.• There is also no clear effect on the number admitted to hospital with pneumonia.  
• The vaccine does reduce the number with a COPoD exacerbations. 
. The number of people who need to be vaccinated to prevent one case of pneumonia is about 16.

Background 
People with COPDs are at higher risk of developing pneumococcus infections, including pneumonia, compared to the general population. 
Objective 
To determine whether injectable vaccines against pneumococcus can prevent pneumonia in people who have chronic respiratory diseases. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to November, 26 2 0 1 6. We found 10 studies involving 1,371 people with respiratory disease. The studies were conducted in the United States, Canada, Australia, and the Netherlands. The average age of the participants was about 65 years old. Most of the studies included men. The participants had a wide range of lung function, from normal to very poor. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to 28 November 16 01 2. 
We found no evidence that the vaccine prevented pneumonia in the overall population. However, there was some evidence that it reduced the risk of pneumonia in those with a low lung function. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was moderate. This means that the results may be slightly affected by the way the studies were carried out. 
What does this mean for people who are at risk of getting pneumonia? 
This review suggests that injectable vaccine against pneumovirus reduces the risk for pneumonia in patients with low lung capacity. It does not appear to reduce the risk in people whose lung function is normal. 
How reliable is the evidence? 
The reliability of the results depends on the quality of how the studies have been carried out, which is described in the table below. 
The results of this review suggest that injective vaccine against pneumonia may reduce the number of people who develop pneumonia in individuals with low levels of lung capacity, but not in those who have normal lung function.
Key messages 
• People with chronic lung disease are at high risk of infection with pneumococus, which can lead to pneumonia. 
• There is some evidence to suggest that injecting people with pneumovaccine may reduce their risk of contracting pneumonia. However the evidence is not strong enough to make recommendations. 
Authors' conclusions 
Injectable vaccine may reduce pneumonia in some people with low level of lung functions, but it does not seem to reduce pneumonia risk in those people with normal lung functions. 
Background
Pneumococci are bacteria that can cause serious infections such as pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis. People with COPDS are at greater risk of these infections than the general public. 
Methods
We identified 14 studies involving a total 1854 people with a chronic respiratory condition. The majority of the people in the studies had COPD, but other conditions were also included. The people in these studies were given either a pneumocovaccine or a placebo. The main outcome measure was the number and severity of infections caused by pneumocococe. 
Results
There was no evidence to show that the pneumovacine reduced the number or severity of pneumoviral infections in the general group of people with lung disease. However there was evidence that people with lower lung function were less likely to get pneumoviruses if they were given the vaccine. 
Conclusions
The evidence suggests that people who already have low lung functions are less likely than others to get infections caused pneumococcoce if they are given a pneumovacin. 
Further research is needed to confirm these findings.

Injectible polyvalence pneumococcus vaccination 
What is the question? 
The question is whether injectible polyvaccine pneumococcus vaccination reduces the risk for community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in people who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or other respiratory diseases. 
Who cares? 
People with COPDs are at increased risk for CAP. In this review we looked at the evidence on the effectiveness of injectible pneumococus vaccine in preventing CAP in people living with COPs. 
What was studied? 
We searched for all relevant studies published up to 2010. We included studies that compared the effect of injectable pneumocococe vaccine with placebo or no treatment in people aged 15 years or older with COPd or other chronic respiratory diseases, or in people without respiratory diseases who were at increased risks for CAP (for example, those with diabetes or heart disease). We included only studies that used the same type of vaccine in both the vaccine group and the placebo group. We excluded studies that had been funded by the manufacturer of the vaccine. 
How were we able to answer the question and what did we find? 
In total, we found 12 studies involving 14,540 participants. The studies were carried out in Europe, North America, Asia, Australia and South America. Most studies were conducted in people over 65 years old. The main results of the studies were: 
• Injectible pneumococe vaccination reduced CAP in the overall population of people with respiratory diseases (risk ratio [RR] 0·70, confidence interval [CI] 90% 0,70 to 70; 16 studies, 17,087 participants; GRADES: moderate quality evidence). This means that people who received the vaccine were less likely to develop CAP than people who did not receive the vaccine, but the difference was small. 
• The vaccine reduced the number of deaths from all causes in people at high risk for pneumonia (RR 0 · 86, CI 99% 9, 08 to 87; 2 studies, total 1,059 participants;GRADE: low quality evidence) 
• There was no evidence that the vaccine reduced deaths from cardio‐respirator causes (RR, 2·07; CI 89% CI, 8, 69; 3 studies, tota 8·8 participants;GRADES: low‐qualityevidence) 
What does this mean for you? 
This review shows that injectible vaccine can reduce the risk from CAP in adults with respiratory disease. However, the reduction in risk is small. The vaccine may be most useful in people whose risk of developing CAP is very high, such as people with severe COPD or people with diabetes. 
The vaccine also appears to reduce the number deaths from any cause in people in whom the risk is very great, such people with heart disease. 
There is no evidence from this review that the different types of vaccine (23 valent or 7 valent) have different effects. 
However, there is some evidence that people with mild side effects from the vaccine are more likely to experience a COPd exacerbation. 
This means that if you have COPd, you should discuss with your doctor whether you should be vaccinated against pneumococcoce. If you do decide to be vaccinated, you will need to be given two doses of the injection. You should wait at least eight weeks between the first and second dose. 
If you have any questions about this review, please contact us. 
Key messages 
• Injectable polyvalency pneumococos vaccine reduces the incidence of community acquired pnuemonia (CAP), but the reduction is small and the benefit is limited to people at very high risk of CAP. 
.• Injectable pneumoccoce vaccine reduces deaths from CAP, but there is no clear evidence that it reduces deaths due to cardio‐ respiratory causes. 
. The evidence is insufficient to compare the different pneumocoace vaccines.

"Background
Community‐based primary‐level workers (PWs) are an important strategy for addressing gaps in mental health service delivery in low‐ and middle‐income countries.  
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness of PW‐led treatments for persons with mental health symptoms in LMICs, compared to usual care.  
Search methods
MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP, reference lists (to 20 June 2019).  
Selection criteria
Randomised trials of PW‐led or collaborative‐care interventions treating people with mental health symptoms or their carers in LMICs.  
PWs included: primary health professionals (PHPs), lay health workers (LHWs), community non‐health professionals (CPs).

Background
People living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) often have limited access to mental health treatment. Community-based primary-level workers (such as nurses, midwives, pharmacists, and community health workers) can deliver mental health care in these settings. These workers are trained to provide mental health support to people who have mental health problems. They also work with people who are caring for someone with a mental health problem. 
Objectifs
We wanted to find out if community workers delivering care to people with common problems such as depression, anxiety, and psychosis can improve people's mental health. We also wanted to see how well they could do this compared to other types of care. 
Recherche
We searched for studies published up to 26 June 1999. We found 93 studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
Résultats
The main findings of the review are: 
Community workers can help people with depression and anxiety to recover from their illness. 
Community health workers can also help people to recover if they have psychosis. 
However, we are not sure whether community workers can make people with psychosis better. 
We are also not sure if community health care workers can improve the lives of people with schizophrenia. 
There is no evidence that community workers are any better than other types or levels of care for people with bipolar disorder. 
The quality of the evidence was very low for most of the studies. This means that we cannot be sure about the results. 
Conclusion
Community health care can help some people with certain mental health conditions. However, we need more research to find ways to improve the quality of care and to find the best way to deliver it. 
What does this mean for you? 
If you live in a country where there is a shortage of mental health professionals, you may benefit from receiving care from a community worker. However you should always talk to your doctor or other health professional before starting any new treatment. 
This review was updated in 29 June 99 and the latest version is available on the Cochrane Library. 
Key messages 
Community‐level care can be effective for people who experience common mental health disorders, such as anxiety and depression. 
It is less clear whether community‐level interventions are effective for psychosis, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia.  
The quality and quantity of evidence is poor for many of the interventions. 
Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of community‐based interventions for people experiencing mental health issues. 
For further information, please contact the author. 
Authors' conclusions: 
We found that community‐led care can improve recovery from depression and from anxiety disorders. There is some evidence that it can improve functioning and QoL in people with psychotic disorders. However the quality and amount of evidence for most interventions is poor. Further research is required to determine which interventions are most effective and cost effective. 
Review question: 
What is the effect of community workers providing care to adults with mental disorders? 
Background: 
People living with mental illness in low income countries often have little access to appropriate mental health treatments. Community‐level primary care workers (e.g. nurses, pharmacologists, community health officers) can play an important role in improving access to care. Community workers can provide care directly to individuals, or they can work in collaboration with other health professionals. 
Study characteristics: 
In this review we included 92 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of community worker‐led mental health interventions for adults with common disorders (depression, anxiety disorders, psychosis, schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, and personality disorders). The studies were conducted in 31 low and low‐middle income countries. 
Main results: 
The main results of the reviews are: Community workers may improve recovery in people who suffer from depression or anxiety disorders (10 studies, 1117 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Community workers also may improve functioning in people suffering from psychosis (12 studies, 1125 participants; low‐certaint‌
LHWs can help adults with common mood and anxiety disorders 
This review looked at the effectiveness of lay health workers (LHW) in treating adults with depression, anxiety and other common mental health disorders. LHWs are people who are not trained health professionals but who have been trained to provide support and treatment to people with mental health problems. They are often recruited from the community and are paid to work with people with these conditions. 
The review found that LHW‐based interventions may be effective in helping adults with these disorders. These interventions may help them recover from their disorder, reduce their symptoms, improve their quality of life and reduce functional disability. However, there was not enough evidence to say whether LHW interventions are more effective than usual care. 
There was also not enough high‐quality evidence to determine whether LWHs are safe. 
What is common mental disorder? 
Common mental disorders include depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, post‐traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia and personality disorders. 
How did the researchers carry out this review? 
The researchers searched for studies that compared LHW intervention with usual care for adults with mental disorders. They included studies where the LHW was involved in providing treatment, support or advice. They excluded studies where LHW only provided information about services available. 
They included studies that had been carried out in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs). They included both randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non‐randomised studies. They used the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool to assess the risk of bias in the included studies. 
In total, they found 25 studies involving 4000 adults. Most of the studies were carried out between 2008 and 2
What are the limitations of this review?
The review authors found that most of the included trials had a high risk of being biased. This means that the results may not be reliable. 
Most of the trials were small and had a short follow‐up period. This limits the amount of information we can draw from them. 
More research is needed to find out whether LHWs are effective in treating people with common disorders. More research is also needed to look at the safety of LHW programmes. 
Key messages 
LHW interventions may increase the recovery of adults with mood and/or anxiety disorders. However there is not enough information to know whether LWIs are more or less effective than other treatments. 
LHWs may reduce the prevalence of mood and/ or anxiety disorders in adults. However the actual effects of LWH interventions are uncertain. 
It is unclear whether Lhw interventions reduce the symptoms of adults suffering from mood and or anxiety disorder. 
We do not know if LHW programs improve the quality of lives of adults who suffer from mood or anxiety problems. 
Although LHW may reduce functional impairments in adults with anxiety and/or mood disorders, the effect size is small. 
No evidence was found that LHWs reduce the risk suicide ideations or attempts. 
Further research is required to determine the safety and effectiveness of LHw interventions. 
Authors' conclusions 
LWIs may be useful in treating common mental illnesses. However further research is necessary to determine their effectiveness and safety. 
Background 
Lay health workers are people from the local community who are trained to deliver health care to people living in their own communities. They may be recruited from a variety of backgrounds including teachers, nurses, midwives, police officers, social workers, pharmacists, and religious leaders. They usually work in partnership with health professionals and are supported by them. They provide a range of services including education, counselling, diagnosis, treatment, and referral to other services. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness and acceptability of lay‐health worker interventions for adults suffering with common‐mental disorders. Common‐mental‐disorders include depression and anxiety.

What is a lay health worker? 
A lay healthworker (LHw) is someone who is not a trained health professional but who has been trained in providing support and care to individuals with mental illness. They work in the community, often recruiting from the same community as the people they are working with. They can provide support, advice, and treatment. They do not diagnose or prescribe medication. 
Who might benefit from lay healthworkers? 
LWs can help people with a wide range of mental health conditions, including depression, psychosis, bipolar affective disorder and anxiety, among others. 
Where does this article come from? 
This article comes from a Cochrance Review, which is a collection of systematic reviews of the best available evidence on the effects of healthcare interventions. The review was written by a team of researchers from the University of Oxford, UK. 
Why is this important? 
There is a shortage of mental healthcare providers in many parts of the world. In addition, there is a lack of mental‐health services in some areas. Lay health workers can help to fill this
LHW led interventions for women with pernial depression 
What is the question? 
The question is whether lay health workers (LHWs) can help women who have depression during pregnancy and after birth. 
What was studied? 
This review looked at studies of LHW led depression interventions for pregnant and postpartum women. We included 14 studies involving 4007 women. 
How were the studies done? 
We searched for studies published up to 2016. We found 13 studies of lay health worker led interventions and one study of a collaborative care intervention. 
Study characteristics 
We included studies where LHWs provided support to women with depression. We did not include studies where women were given antidepressants or psychotherapy. 
Key results 
The review found that LHW interventions may be effective in reducing depression symptoms in women with PND. However, there is uncertainty about their effects on other outcomes such as recovery, functional impairment, quality of life, and adverse events. 
Strengths and limitations 
The studies were small and had low risk of bias. Most studies were conducted in high income countries. 
Implications for practice and policy 
LHW interventions appear to be safe and effective in improving depression symptoms. They may also improve quality of live and reduce functional disability. 
Further research is needed to determine the effects of LWH interventions on recovery, adverse events, and suicide prevention. 
Limitations 
Most studies were of low quality and had small sample sizes. 
Background 
Depression during pregnancy (perinatal period) and after childbirth (postpartum period) is common and associated with poor maternal and child health outcomes. Depression is treatable with medication and psychotherapy but these treatments are not available to most women in low‐income countries. Lay health workers are trained community members who provide health education and support to people in their communities. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects and safety of lay‐health worker led depression treatment interventions for perinatally depressed women. Key questions 
What are the effects on depression symptoms, recovery, quality‐of‐life, functional disability, adverse effects, and suicidal thoughts of lay healthcare worker led treatment interventions compared with usual care for peripartum depression? What are the differences between lay health‐worker led treatment and collaborative care interventions? 
Search methods 
We used standard search methods to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of lay heath worker led treatments for perineal depression. 
Selection criteria 
We considered RCTs of lay worker led intervention for perinneal depression compared with any other treatment. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We assessed the risk of selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and other biases. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results 
We identified 15 studies involving a total of 4,006 women. All studies were at low risk for selection bias and performance bias. 
Lay health worker interventions 
We found 4 studies of 1,242 women comparing lay health work led interventions with usual antenatal care. Two studies reported on the effects for women who had not previously been diagnosed with depression and two studies reported for women diagnosed with major depressive disorder. 
We judged the certainty in the evidence for the effects 
on depression symptoms to be moderate. We judged the evidence on recovery to be very low certainty. We rated the evidence as very low for the effect on quality of …
LHWs and PHPs led interventions for adults with posttraumatic or comorbid mental disorders in humanitarian contexts 
Background 
The World Health Organization estimates that there are 150 million people living in humanitarian crises worldwide, including refugees, internally displaced persons, and victims of conflict, violence, and natural disasters. People affected by these crises often experience traumatic events, such as war, violence and abuse, and loss of loved ones. These traumatic experiences can lead to posttrau‐matic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and other mental disorders. People who have experienced trauma may also misuse alcohol or drugs. 
People affected by humanitarian crises often live in poor conditions, which can make them more vulnerable to mental health problems. In addition, they may not have access to mental healthcare services. Therefore, it is important to find effective ways to help people affected by trauma and mental disorders during humanitarian crises. 
What did this review find? 
This review looked at the effects of lay health workers (LHW) and peer support programmes (PHP) on people affected in humanitarian crisis situations. LHWs are people who are trained to provide care to people affected during humanitarian crisis. They are usually members of the community, such a teachers, religious leaders, or community health workers. PHPs are groups of people who provide support to each other. 
The review found that LHW‐ and PHP‐led programmes may be helpful for people affected with PTSD or other mental health disorders in crisis situations, but the evidence was limited. For example, LHW and PHP programmes may reduce depression and PTSD symptoms, improve quality of life, and reduce alcohol and drug misuse. However, the evidence suggests that these programmes may not improve functioning or reduce suicide risk. 
For people with alcohol or drug misuse problems, LWH and PHP interventions may increase the likelihood of recovery from alcohol misuse, but there is uncertainty about whether they reduce the prevalence or functional impairment of drug misuse or alcohol misuse. 
How certain are we that the results are correct? 
The evidence was of moderate certainty. This means that the findings are likely to be correct, but we cannot be completely certain. The evidence was based on a small number of studies and the quality of the studies varied. 
Key messages 
LHW and peer‐support programmes may help people with PTSD and other comor‐bid mental health conditions in humanitarian situations. 
LHWs and PHP may reduce symptoms of depression and posttrauma stress disorder, improve the quality‐of‐life, and decrease alcohol and substance misuse. There is uncertainty regarding the effects on functioning and suicide risk reduction. 
There is uncertainty around the effects for people with substance misuse problems. 
Future research should focus on improving the quality and quantity of evidence. 
Authors' conclusions 
LW and PHP led interventions may be useful for people experiencing PTSD and comor­bid mental conditions in crisis settings. However the evidence is limited and further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Background
The World Heath Organization estimates there are over 140 million individuals living in crisis‐affected settings worldwide, which include refugees, displaced persons and victims from conflict, violent and natural disaster. People living in these settings are often exposed to traumatic events such as violence, abuse, war and loss. These events can lead people to develop posttraumatic stress disorder and depression. People in these crisis settings may also engage in harmful or hazardous alcohol and/or substance use. 
Individuals living in crises are often in poor living conditions, making them more susceptible to mental illness. In many cases, they do not have adequate access to health care services. Thus, it's important to identify effective ways of helping people affected from traumatic events and mental illness during crises. Lay health workers and peer supporters are two types of non‐professional health care providers who can provide care in crisis contexts. 
Objectives
To assess the effects and safety of lay‐health worker (LHw) and/or peer supporter (PS) led interventions compared to usual care for people living with post traumatic stress disorder or comorbidity in crisis. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases. We also searched the World Health Organisation (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. We searched reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews. We last searched the databases on 16 April 2019. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing LHw and/or PS led interventions to usual or standard care for adults living with PTSD, depression, or both in humanitarian or crisis settings (e.g. refugees, asylum seekers, internally‐displaced persons). We excluded studies where the intervention was delivered by professionals. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of
Interventions for people with alcohol or substance use problems and their carers
Background
Alcohol and drug misuse is common among people with severe psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression. People with these conditions often have poor insight into their condition and may be resistant to treatment. This means that they may not seek help for their problem, or may stop taking prescribed medication. They may also be more likely to engage in risky behaviour, such as driving under the influence of alcohol, which can lead to accidents and death. Carers of people with mental health problems may also experience high levels of stress and anxiety. Interventions that target both the person with the mental illness and their family carers may improve outcomes for both groups. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of interventions aimed at people with substance use disorders and their families. We included studies comparing different types of intervention, such a group therapy versus individual therapy, or different types or doses of medication. We also looked at the effects on carers. 
Search methods

Interventions for children and young people with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or childhood maltreatment disorders (CMDs)
Background
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSS) is a psychiatric condition that can develop after experiencing a traumatic event. Children who experience trauma may develop PTSD or childhood abuse and neglect disorders (CAADs). These disorders can cause significant distress and impair functioning. 
Intervenions for children with PTSD or CAADs
This review assessed the effectiveness of different types of interventions for children aged 5 years and older with PTSD and/or CAAD. We included 31 studies involving 1,094 children. The interventions were delivered by parents, health workers, or child psychiatrists. 
The main findings were: 
Parent‐led and health worker‐led group interventions may reduce symptoms of PTSD in children. However, there is not enough evidence to say whether these interventions are effective. 
Child psychiatrist‐led individual interventions may be effective in reducing symptoms of depression in children, but there is no evidence that they are effective in improving other outcomes such as functioning, quality of life, or adverse events. 
Health worker‐ and parent‐led home‐based interventions may improve functioning in children with CAAD, but the evidence is very limited. 
There is not sufficient evidence to determine whether any of the interventions are safe. 
What does this mean? 
It is important to note that the evidence base for interventions for PTSD and CAAD in children is very small. More research is needed to determine which interventions are most effective and safe. This review highlights the need for further research to address gaps in the evidence. 
Future research should focus on developing and testing interventions that are more effective and safer than those currently available. 
Key messages 
Parental and health‐worker‐led treatments may reduce PTSD symptoms in children and adolescents. 
Parent and health workers‐led treatment may improve the functioning of children with childhood maltreatments disorders. 
More research is required to determine the effectiveness and safety of interventions. 
Authors' conclusion
Parent‐ and health work‐led intervention may reduce the severity and frequency of PTSD symptoms and improve functioning and quality of living in children aged five years and above. However the evidence for these interventions is limited and further research is warranted. 
CP‐ and PW‐led therapy may reduce depression symptoms in young people. However there is insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness or safety of these interventions. Further research is necessary to determine their effectiveness and to identify the most effective interventions.
Promising benefits of psycho‐social interventions for people with mental health problems and their carers
Background
People living with mental disorders (CMDs), postnatal depression (PND), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTS), and dementia, and their family carers often experience significant distress and impairment in functioning. Psycho‐social intervention programmes can help improve these outcomes. However, there is limited evidence about the effectiveness of such interventions in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs). This review aimed to assess the effects of psychotherapy and psychosocial interventions for CMD, PNS, PTS and dementia in LMICS. 
Study characteristics
We included 24 studies involving 3,246 participants. The studies were conducted in 14 different countries. The interventions included cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), problem‐focused counselling, psychosynthesis, and supportive counselling. The outcomes assessed were depression symptoms, quality of life, functioning, and adverse events. 
Key results
The results showed that psychotherapy was effective in reducing depression symptoms in people with CMDs and PND. There was some evidence that psycho‐therapy may be beneficial for people who have PTS, but this needs further research. There is no evidence that psychosynthetic interventions are effective for CMD or PTS. 
There is some evidence to suggest that psychotherapies may be effective in improving quality of life and functioning in people who are caring for someone with CMD, dementia, or PND in LMIS. However the evidence is very limited and more research is needed. 
The authors found no evidence to support the use of psychotherapeutic interventions for alcohol or substance use disorders. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to moderate. 
Authors' conclusion
Psychotherapy may have a positive effect on the symptoms of depression in people living with CMD and PNS. It may also be beneficial in improving the quality of care for people caring for a person with CMD or dementia. However further research is required to confirm these findings. 
Psychosynthesis may be useful for people living with CMDs or PTS, although the evidence for this is limited. More research is also needed to determine whether psychosynthsis is effective for people experiencing alcohol or drug use disorders or for people providing care for a loved one with CMD. 
Supportive counselling may be helpful for people suffering from CMDs. However there is not enough evidence to determine if this type of intervention is effective in treating PND or PTS in LMIs. 
Further research is necessary to determine the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of psycho–social interventions in LMCS. 
This review was last updated in March 2019.","Community workers delivering mental health services in low and middle income countries
Background 
Community‐level primary health workers deliver mental health care in low income countries. They include nurses, doctors, midwives, pharmacists, and other health professionals, as well as lay health care workers such as community health workers, peer support workers, and volunteers. Community workers can provide treatment for people with common psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. 
Objectifs 
To assess the effectiveness and safety of community workers delivering care for people living with mental illness. 
Recherche méthodologique 
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRE, Clinical Trials Register, and ICTRP (to June 10, 2109). We also reviewed reference lists and contacted experts. 
Selection des études 
We included randomised controlled trials comparing community worker‐led care with usual care or no care. We included studies of adults and children with mental disorders. We excluded studies of people with severe mental illness, such schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and psychosis. 
Caractéristiques des étudiés 
We identified 92 trials from thirty low and lower‐middle income countries (24 from 25 low‐income and lower middle‐ income countries). Most of the studies were conducted in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. 
Risques de biais 
The main risks of bias were related to detection and attrition. 
Études d'effet 
We found that community workers delivered care that was probably effective for adults with common disorders, including depression, bipolar disorders, and anxiety disorders. Community‐level care was probably more effective than usual care for adults living with depression. Community care was also probably more likely to improve recovery and reduce suicide risk. Community worker‐delivered care was not more effective for people who had schizophrenia. Community health workers were probably more helpful than usual health care for children with depression, but we did not find enough evidence to be sure. 
Safety 
Community workers were not more likely than usual healthcare providers to cause harm. 
Conclusion 
Community health workers can deliver care that is effective for common mental health problems. However, there is not enough evidence about the safety of this type of care. More research is needed to find out if community workers can help people with more serious mental health conditions. 
Key messages 
Community level health workers are important for providing mental health treatment in low resource settings. 
Community worker‐deliver care is probably effective and safe for adults and young people with depression and anxiety. 
More research is required to determine if community worker care is effective and acceptable for people diagnosed with schizophrenia.
LHWs and collaborative care for adults with common mental disorders 
What is the effect of lay health workers (LHW) and collaborative care compared with usual care on recovery, symptoms, quality of life (QOL), functional impairment, adverse events (AEs), and suicide risk in adults with common mental disorders? 
Background 
Common mental disorders include depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders. These conditions affect people's ability to function at work, home, and school. They can also cause problems in relationships with family and friends. People with these disorders often do not seek help. When they do, they usually see their general practitioner (GP) first. GPs often refer people to a specialist such as a psychiatrist or psychologist. However, there are many barriers to accessing specialist services, including long waiting times, lack of availability, and cost. 
LHW are trained community members who provide support to people with mental health problems. LHWs can be recruited from the community, such as retired teachers, nurses, or social workers. They are trained to identify people with common disorders and to provide them with brief treatment. They may also provide support and advice to people who are not ready to seek help from a specialist. 
Collaboration care is a type of treatment that involves working with a team of professionals, including GPs, psychiatrists, psychologists, and LHW. This approach aims to improve the effectiveness of treatment by involving people with their own mental health problem and by providing them with support and guidance. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of LHW and collaborative treatment compared with usual care on the recovery of people with mental health problems, the reduction of symptoms, the improvement of quality of life, the decrease of functional impairment and adverse events, and the reduction in suicide risk.

We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Studies Group Specialized Register (CCDSG SR) on 16 March 2019. We also searched the following databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and AMED. We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov on 22 March 2oo19 and checked the reference lists of included studies. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing LHW or collaboration care with usual care in adults aged 18 years or older with common psychiatric disorders. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We contacted study authors for additional information. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs), depending on the outcome, for continuous outcomes. We pooled data using random‐effects models. 
Main results 
We included 25 RCTs with 10,200 participants. Most of the trials were conducted in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LICs). The majority of participants were women. The trials were generally of moderate to high risk of bias. 
The certainty of evidence was very low for most outcomes. 
We found no evidence that LHW led interventions increased recovery, reduced prevalence, or improved QOL. There was some evidence that they may reduce functional impairment and symptoms. We found no evidence that LWH led interventions had any effect on AEs. 
There was some evid‌
nces that collaborative care increased recovery and reduced symptoms. It may also reduce prevalence and improve QoL. There is some evidence that it may reduce the number of AEs, but this may be due to chance. 
Quality of the e‌
vidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. This means that we cannot be confident in the findings. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is limited evidence that both LHW‐ and collaboration care‐led treatments may improve recovery, reduce symptoms, and improve quality of living in adults with common mental health disorders. However the certainty of the evidence is very low and further research is needed. 
This review was updated in March 19, 2020. 
Key messages 
Lay health workers and collaborative‐care interventions may improve the recovery and reduce symptoms of adults with mental disorders. They also may improve quality of life and reduce functional impairments. However the certainty of this evidence is low and more research is needed. 
Further research should focus on improving the quality of evidence by reducing the risk of biases and increasing the sample size. 
Future research should also focus on the cost‐effectiveness of these interventions. 
More research is also needed to determine whether LHW interventions are effective in different cultural settings and among different populations. 
In addition, future research should explore the mechanisms through which LHW
LHW led interventions for women with pernina depression 
What is the review about? 
This review looked at the effects of lay health worker (LHW) led interventions compared to usual care for women who experience depression during pregnancy or after birth (perinatal period). 
What was studied? 
The review included 14 studies involving 3769 women. The studies were conducted in Canada, China, India, Israel, Mexico, Nepal, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Turkey, and the USA. 
The studies used different types of LHW led intervention. These included group sessions led by LHWs, one‐on‐one sessions with LHW, and telephone support. The LHW could be a trained community health worker, a peer supporter, or a family member. 
Most studies were small and had short follow‐up periods. The quality of the evidence was generally low to moderate. 
What did the review find? 
There was some evidence that LHW interventions may help women recover from depression during the perinata period. However, the evidence is not strong enough to say whether LHW intervention is better than usual care. 
There is also some evidence to suggest that LWH interventions may reduce symptoms of depression and improve quality of life (QOL) in women with depression during or after pregnancy. However again, the quality of evidence is low to medium. 
LHW interventions probably do not affect functional impairment, suicide risk, or adverse events (death). 
LWH interventions probably have little to no effect on the number of women referred to mental health specialists. 
For adults with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or chronic mental disorders (CMDs) in humanitarian situations, there is some evidence suggesting that LHWH interventions can reduce depression symptom and improve QoL. However the quality evidence is very low. 
How good is the evidence? 
Overall, the studies were of poor to moderate quality. The main problems were that they were small, had short duration, and were carried out in different countries. 
Who are the key take‐aways? 
LHWH led interventions may increase the recovery rate of women with PND. 
They probably reduce depression and QOL in women who have PND, but the evidence for this is low. They probably have no effect or little effect on function, suicide, adverse events, or referral to mental healthcare specialists.  
LHWS led interventions probably reduce PTSD symptoms and improve the QOL of adults with PTSD or CMD in humanitarian situation. However this evidence is of very low quality. 
Key messages for the general public 
LWHS led interventions are likely to be effective for women experiencing depression during and after pregnancy, but more research is needed to confirm this. 
These interventions may be useful for people with PTSD and CMDs living in humanitarian crisis situations, but further research is required.

Interventions led by lay health workers for adults with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or comorbid mental disorders in humanitarian contexts 
Background 
In humanitarian crises, people often experience traumatic events such as war, violence, disasters, and persecution. These traumatic events can lead to PTSD and other mental disorders. People living in humanitarian crises often lack access to mental health services. Lay health workers (LHWs) are community members who are trained to provide basic health care and psychosocial support. They are often recruited from within the community and do not need to be medically qualified. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of LHW‐lead interventions compared to no intervention, standard care, or other interventions for adults living in crisis situations with PTSD or comorbidity with other mental health problems. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases up to December 2018. We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 28 February 2109. We handsearched reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing LHW interventions to no treatment, standard treatment, or another intervention for adults in humanitarian crisis situations (such as refugees, internally displaced persons, or asylum seekers) with PTSD and/or comorbed mental disorders (such depression, anxiety, or substance abuse). 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We contacted study authors for additional information. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We conducted meta‐analyses where appropriate. 
Main results 
We included 17 RCTs involving 1,988 participants. The studies were published between 2200 and 2919. Most studies were conducted in low‐ and middle‐income countries. 
LHW interventions may reduce depression symptom severity (SMD ‒0. 36; 9. 5% CI ‒ 0,56 ‒ ‒. 15) and improve quality of life (QOL) (Smd ‒ . 27; 1%. 5 CI ‐ 0,. 39 ‒ -. 14). However, the certainty in the evidence was low to very low. LHWs may also have uncertain impacts on PTSD symptoms, functioning, substance use, and adverse events (AEs). 
LHWs may increase the recovery from alcohol use disorders (RR 1,. 25; 0%. 94 ‒‐. 26) but the certainty was low. LHWs may also reduce the prevalence and risk of alcohol use disorder (RRs 5, 50; 2, . 51 ‒-. 11) and functional impairment (S. MD ‒, 01; 3, 24 ‐‐. . 03). 
The certainty of evidence was moderate to very limited. 
Study limitations 
Most studies had small sample sizes and short follow‐up periods. 
Authors' conclusions 
LWHS may reduce symptoms of depression and improve QoL for adults experiencing PTSD or co‐occurring mental disorders living in a humanitarian context. However, there is low‐to very low‐certainty evidence. LHWS may also increase the likelihood of recovery from hazardous or harmful alcohol use. However the certainty is low. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether LHWS can reduce the risk of hazardous or harm‐ful alcohol use or improve functioning. 
Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of LWHs for adults suffering from PTSD or other mental illnesses in humanitarian situations. 
Key messages 
Lay health workers may reduce depressive symptoms and improve the quality of lives of adults with PTSD in humanitarian emergencies. 
They may also help to reduce the likelihood and prevalence of hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption. 
However, the evidence is of low to moderate certainty. 
Future research should focus on longer‐term outcomes and larger sample sizes.

Review question 
What is the effect of lay health worker‐led (LHWS) interventions compared with no intervention or other treatments for adults (aged 18 years and older) in humanitarian emergency situations with posttraumatic stres‌s
Interventions for people with alcohol/substances use disorders 
Background 
Alcohol/substance use disorders (AUDs/SUDs) are common and often co‐occur with other mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and dementia. AUDs/SADs can cause harm to the person and their family, friends, and society. People with AUDs and/or SUDs often benefit from treatment that addresses both their substance use and any associated mental health problems. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions for people who have AUDs or SUDS. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Alcohol and Other Drugs Group Specialised Register (CDSR), the Cochran Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases up to 20 September 2106. We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any intervention for people aged 18 years or older with AUD or SADs with any other intervention or usual care. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We analysed dichotomous data using risk ratios (RRs) and continuous data using mean differences (MDs). We calculated the standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data and the risk difference (RD) for dichotomic data. We calculated confidence intervals (CIs) around estimates. We assessed the certainty in the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results 
We included 119 RCTs involving 13 287 participants. Most studies were conducted in high‐income countries. The majority of studies compared interventions led by psychiatrists (PHPs) or community pharmacists (CPs) with usual care, or with each other. We found no studies comparing interventions led either by lay workers or by psychologists. 
We found no evidence that interventions led PHPs or CPs led to better outcomes than usual care for people diagnosed with AUD/SUD. However, we found some evidence that these interventions may be more effective than usual care for people at risk of developing an AUD/SAD. 
Intervenions led by lay health workers (LHWs) may be less effective than PHPs/CPs for people with AUD/SADDs. 
People with AUD and/or SUDs may benefit from interventions led by LHWs or PHPs. However we found no evidence that these interventions are more effective than usual care or other interventions for people with AUD. 
LHW interventions may improve caregiver burden and may have little‐to‑no effect on recovery from AUD/SASD. 
PHP/PHP‐based interventions may reduce the risk of harm/hazardal alcohol use and may improve QOL. 
CP/CP based interventions may have a small effect on reducing the risk of harmful/harmful alcohol use. 
The certainty of evidence was low or very low for most outcomes. 
Key messages 
Intervention led by PHPs may be effective for people identified as being at risk for developing an alcohol/substancuse use disorder. 
It is unclear whether interventions led or by CPs are more effective than usual or other types of care for preventing or treating alcohol/substantuse use disorders. 
There is limited evidence that LHW interventions are effective for reducing harmful/hazards alcohol use, improving caregiver burden, and improving QOL for people living with dementia. 
Future research should focus on identifying the most effective interventions for different populations and the most appropriate way to deliver them. 
Authors' conclusions 
Intensive interventions led and by PHP or CP may be useful for people considered to be at risk for developing an alcohol/substantse use disorder, but further research is needed to determine the most effective interventions for preventing or treating alcoho/substanceuse disorders. Future research should also focus on identifying the most suitable way to deliver these interventions.

Interventions for children with post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or complex post‐ traumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD/CMD) 
Post‐trauma stress disorder is a condition that can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. It is characterised by persistent re‐experiencing of the trauma, avoidance of reminders of the event, and hyperarousal. PTSD is common in children who have experienced abuse, neglect, violence, or accidents. 
Children with PTSD often experience difficulties at school, problems with their relationships, and poor mental health. They also often have other mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and ADHD. 
Many children with PTSD also have a parent or carer who has been affected by the child's trauma. This can cause additional stress for the parent or caregiver. 
Intervening early in children with trauma‐related disorders can help them recover and prevent long‐term problems. Interventions can be provided by parents, teachers, or therapists. 
This review looked at the evidence for different types of intervention for children aged 5 years and older with PTSD or complex PTSD. We included 21 studies involving 3272 children. 
The main findings were: 
• Parent‐led and therapist‐led group interventions may improve children's functioning and mental health, but there is not enough evidence to say whether they are effective. 
• Carer‐led support groups may improve carers’ mental health and well‐being, but the evidence is not strong. 
Key messages 
• Intervening with children with traumatic stress disorders early can help prevent long term problems. 
However, we need more research to find out which interventions work best for which children. We also need to know how to deliver these interventions effectively. 
What was studied? 
We searched for studies that compared different types and amounts of intervention with no intervention, or with another type of intervention. We looked for studies where the intervention was delivered by parents or carers, or by therapists. We did not include studies where children were given medication. 
We found 22 studies that involved 3,271 children. Most of the studies were carried out in the USA, Canada, and Australia. 
Most of the interventions were delivered by therapists or parents. Some interventions were also delivered by carers. 
How were the studies judged? 
The quality of the evidence varied between studies. Some studies had a high risk of bias, meaning that the results might not be reliable. Other studies had low risk of being biased. 
Some studies had many participants, but others had few participants. Some of the participants were randomly assigned to different groups, but some were not. 
In most studies, the children were assessed before and after the intervention. In some studies, carers were also assessed. 
For each type of study, we calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB), which tells us how many people need to receive the intervention to achieve one additional benefit. We calculated the NNTB for each outcome separately. 
Our main findings 
• We found 12 studies comparing parent‐led therapy with no treatment. These studies involved 1,098 children. The results showed that parent‐ led therapy may improve functioning and symptoms of PTSD, but we are not sure if this is true. 
There was not enough information to say if parent‐ or car‐ led interventions improved children's mental health or functioning. 
Carer‐ led support groups for carers of children with a traumatic stress condition may improve the carers mental health but we do not know if this happens because of the support group or because the carer is spending more time with the child. 
One study compared therapist‐ led group therapy with parent‐ and car‐led therapies. The therapist‐lead group therapy may reduce symptoms of depression and PTSD, and improve functioning. However, we are unsure if this happened because of group therapy or because children spent more time in the group. 
Two studies compared therapist led group interventions with no group intervention. One study showed that group therapy reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression, and improved functioning. The other study showed no difference between group therapy and no group therapy. 
Three studies compared carer‐ and therapist led interventions with parent led interventions. The carer and therapist interventions may reduce PTSD symptoms and improve mental health in children. However we are uncertain if this was because of carer or therapist interventions or because of spending more quality time with their child. We are also uncertain if these interventions are better than parent‐lead interventions. 
Four studies compared parent‐ lead interventions with therapist‐ lead group interventions. One showed that therapist‐ and parent‐ interventions may have similar effects. Two showed that the therapist‐intervention may be better. One of these showed that children spent less time in therapy when they received the therapist intervention. 
Five studies compared different forms of parent‐interventions. One found that parent led group intervention may be more effective than individual parent‐based interventions. Three studies showed
Promising benefits of psycho‐social interventions for people with mental health problems, dementia carer, and people with substance use disorders in low‐ and middle‐income countries
Background
Low‐ and Middle‐Income Countries (LMICs) face a high burden of mental health disorders, including postnatal depression (PND), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and dementia. People living with these conditions often experience poor outcomes, such as increased risk of suicide, disability, and death. Psycho‐social intervention (PSI) is a type of treatment that aims to improve the quality of life of people with a mental health condition by addressing their psychological needs. These interventions include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), psychosocial support, and peer support. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of PSI for people living with mental disorders in LMICS. 
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases up to January 2020. We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PSI with no treatment or another treatment. We excluded studies where the primary outcome was a psychiatric diagnosis or where the PSI was not delivered by a trained professional. 
Key results
We included 34 RCTs involving 2,728 participants. Most studies were conducted in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The most common mental health conditions studied were PND (10 studies), PTSD (11 studies), dementia (1 study), and substance use disorder (12 studies). The majority of studies compared PSI with a control group receiving no treatment. 
The main findings of this review are: 
Postnatal depression 
• PSI may reduce depressive symptoms (SMD ‒0.40, 10 trials, n = 1,102; 90% CI ‒1.00 to 1.20) and improve maternal functioning (SMB ‒2.02, 8 trials, N = 766; 12% CI 11% to 24%) in women with PND. 
• There is limited evidence that PSI may improve maternal mental health (SMM ‒3.03, 2 trials; 8% CI –1.50 to –4.56) and reduce the risk of postpartum suicide (RR 0,90, CI 0%, 1%). 
• The evidence is insufficient to determine whether PSI may affect the risk for adverse events (AEs) (RR ‒ 0; 0% to –1%).  
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder 
• Evidence is insufficient for determining whether PSI improves PTSD symptoms (RR –0.33, CI –0%, –1%), reduces the risk (RR, 0%; 0–1%) of suicidal thoughts, or reduces the number of hospitalizations (RR 0.67, CI, 30%, 1%). 13 trials, with 14,000 participants. 
Dementia 
• No evidence is available for determining the effects of PSI on dementia symptoms, cognition, or function. 
Substance Use Disorders 
• In people with alcohol use disorder, PSI may increase the likelihood of abstinence (RRs 1%, 0 to 2%; 1% CI, –1% to 3%) and reduce alcohol consumption (RR r 0 %, 3% to 1%; 9% CI , –1 % to 3%). 
Psychosis 
• For people with psychosis, there is limited and conflicting evidence about the effects on symptoms (MD 0., 9%, 99%CI, 4% to   1%; 9% CI   4  to  1 %  ) and on Aes (RRr 0%. 00%, CI, –1%  ;  –1 %  to  1%) in people with schizophrenia. 
Peer support 
• Peer support may improve depression symptoms in people living in LMIS (SMT 0.; 97% CI; 2% to, 5%; 2 CI  2 to  5 %). 
Limitations 
• Most studies had small sample sizes and short follow‐up periods. 
Implications for practice 
This review suggests that PSI can be effective in improving the mental health of people living within LMIC. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Limitation of this Review 
The quality of the evidence is low due to the small sample"
"Background
Stroke affects millions of people every year and is a leading cause of disability, resulting in significant financial cost and reduction in quality of life. Rehabilitation after stroke aims to reduce disability by facilitating recovery of impairment, activity, or participation. One aspect of stroke rehabilitation that may affect outcomes is the amount of time spent in rehabilitation, including minutes provided, frequency (i.e. days per week of rehabilitation), and duration (i.e. time period over which rehabilitation is provided). Effect of time spent in rehabilitation after stroke has been explored extensively in the literature, but findings are inconsistent. Previous systematic reviews with meta‐analyses have included studies that differ not only in the amount provided, but also type of rehabilitation. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of 1. more time spent in the same type of rehabilitation on activity measures in people with stroke; 2. difference in total rehabilitation time (in minutes) on recovery of activity in people with stroke; and 3. rehabilitation schedule on activity in terms of: a. average time (minutes) per week undergoing rehabilitation, b. frequency (number of sessions per week) of rehabilitation, and c. total duration of rehabilitation. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, eight other databases, and five trials registers to June 2021. We searched reference lists of identified studies, contacted key authors, and undertook reference searching using Web of Science Cited Reference Search. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults with stroke that compared different amounts of time spent, greater than zero, in rehabilitation (any non‐pharmacological, non‐surgical intervention aimed to improve activity after stroke). Studies varied only in the amount of time in rehabilitation between experimental and control conditions. Primary outcome was activities of daily living (ADLs); secondary outcomes were activity measures of upper and lower limbs, motor impairment measures of upper and lower limbs, and serious adverse events (SAE)/death. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened studies, extracted data, assessed methodological quality using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool, and assessed certainty of the evidence using GRADE. For continuous outcomes using different scales, we calculated pooled standardised mean difference (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We expressed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% CIs. 
Main results
The quantitative synthesis of this review comprised 21 parallel RCTs, involving analysed data from 1412 participants.  
Time in rehabilitation varied between studies. Minutes provided per week were 90 to 1288. Days per week of rehabilitation were three to seven. Duration of rehabilitation was two weeks to six months. Thirteen studies provided upper limb rehabilitation, five general rehabilitation, two mobilisation training, and one lower limb training. Sixteen studies examined participants in the first six months following stroke; the remaining five included participants more than six months poststroke. Comparison of stroke severity or level of impairment was limited due to variations in measurement. 
The risk of bias assessment suggests there were issues with the methodological quality of the included studies. There were 76 outcome‐level risk of bias assessments: 15 low risk, 37 some concerns, and 24 high risk. 
When comparing groups that spent more time versus less time in rehabilitation immediately after intervention, we found no difference in rehabilitation for ADL outcomes (SMD 0.13, 95% CI −0.02 to 0.28; P = 0.09; I2 = 7%; 14 studies, 864 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), activity measures of the upper limb (SMD 0.09, 95% CI −0.11 to 0.29; P = 0.36; I2 = 0%; 12 studies, 426 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), and activity measures of the lower limb (SMD 0.25, 95% CI −0.03 to 0.53; P = 0.08; I2 = 48%; 5 studies, 425 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We found an effect in favour of more time in rehabilitation for motor impairment measures of the upper limb (SMD 0.32, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.58; P = 0.01; I2 = 10%; 9 studies, 287 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and of the lower limb (SMD 0.71, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.28; P = 0.01; 1 study, 51 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). There were no intervention‐related SAEs. More time in rehabilitation did not affect the risk of SAEs/death (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.85; P = 0.68; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 379 participants; low‐certainty evidence), but few studies measured these outcomes. 
Predefined subgroup analyses comparing studies with a larger difference of total time spent in rehabilitation between intervention groups to studies with a smaller difference found greater improvements for studies with a larger difference. This was statistically significant for ADL outcomes (P = 0.02) and activity measures of the upper limb (P = 0.04), but not for activity measures of the lower limb (P = 0.41) or motor impairment measures of the upper limb (P = 0.06). 
Authors' conclusions
An increase in time spent in the same type of rehabilitation after stroke results in little to no difference in meaningful activities such as activities of daily living and activities of the upper and lower limb but a small benefit in measures of motor impairment (low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence for all findings). If the increase in time spent in rehabilitation exceeds a threshold, this may lead to improved outcomes. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend a minimum beneficial daily amount in clinical practice. The findings of this study are limited by a lack of studies with a significant contrast in amount of additional rehabilitation provided between control and intervention groups. 
Large, well‐designed, high‐quality RCTs that measure time spent in all rehabilitation activities (not just interventional) and provide a large contrast (minimum of 1000 minutes) in amount of rehabilitation between groups would provide further evidence for effect of time spent in rehabilitation.","Time spent in stroke rehabilitation 
What is the effect on activity after a stroke of spending more time in the type of stroke recovery treatment? 
Background 
Rehabilitation after stroke is aimed at improving the ability to perform everyday activities, such as walking, dressing, eating, and bathing. It can be provided in a variety of settings, including hospitals, community clinics, and homes. The amount of rehabilitation time varies between individuals and depends on the severity of the stroke, the person's age, and their motivation to recover. 
This review looked at whether spending more rehabilitation time improves activity after a stroke. We found 17 studies involving 1,467 participants. Most studies compared two types of rehabilitation: one group received more rehabilitation than the other. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that spending more than 10 hours per week in rehabilitation improved activity after the stroke. However, we found some evidence that more rehabilitation could improve upper limb function. 
Quality of the studies 
Most studies had a low risk of bias. 
Implications for practice 
There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend spending more hours in rehabilitation to improve the ability of people with a stroke to perform daily activities. 
What does this review mean for people who have had a stroke? 
People with a recent stroke should continue to receive rehabilitation until they are able to perform their usual activities. This will depend on the individual's needs and preferences. 
Further research 
More research is needed to determine the optimal amount of hours spent in stroke rehabilitation. This includes research into the effects of different types of stroke recovery treatments, such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and cognitive behavioural therapy. 
How was this review done? 
We searched for studies up to June 2019. We included studies if they were randomised trials comparing different amounts of time spent on rehabilitation. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrance. 
Who conducted this review? 
The review was conducted by a team of researchers from the University of Sydney, Australia.

Authors' conclusions 
There was no evidence from this review that spending additional hours in stroke recovery treatment improved activity levels. However there was some evidence from one study that spending extra hours in recovery treatment may improve upper arm function. Further research is required to determine whether spending additional time in stroke treatment improves activity levels and to identify the optimal length of time for stroke recovery. 
Review question 
What are the effects on activity levels of spending additional hours in stroke treatment? 
Study characteristics 
We included 16 randomised studies involving a total of 2,078 participants. The studies were published between 1997 and 2109. All studies were conducted in hospital settings. 
Main results 
The studies compared different lengths of time of stroke treatment. The main outcomes measured were the ability to perform daily tasks (activities of daily life), upper arm strength, and lower leg strength. 
We did not find any evidence that additional hours of stroke therapy improved the ability for people to perform activities of daily life. However we found evidence that people who received more hours of therapy had better upper arm muscle strength. We also found evidence from three studies that people receiving more hours of therapy had less severe lower leg weakness. 
The quality of the included studies was generally good. 
Study limitations 
The main limitation of the review was that the studies were small and varied in the way they were conducted. 
Future research 
We need further research to determine what the optimal time is for stroke therapy. We would also like to know whether spending extra time in therapy improves the ability people with stroke to perform activities of day to day life. 
Background information 
Recovery from stroke is a complex process. It involves changes in the brain, muscles, and joints. Recovery can be affected by many factors, including the severity and location of the damage to the brain. 
Stroke is a condition where blood supply to part of the brain is interrupted or reduced. This causes brain cells to die. The effects of stroke vary depending on the size and location of the damaged area of the brain. 
Recovering from stroke can take months or years. During this time, people with strokes may need help to perform basic activities of day to day living, such bathing, dressing and eating. They may also need help with more complex activities, such as driving, cooking, and shopping. 
People who have a stroke may benefit from rehabilitation. Rehabilitation is a type of treatment that helps people
How much time should people spend in rehabilitation after having a stroke? 
Background
Rehabilitation is a key part of recovery after a stroke. It can help people regain their independence by improving their ability to perform everyday tasks such as dressing, eating, and walking. However, it is not known how much time people need to spend in rehab to get the best results. 
Objectives
To find out if spending more time in rehab after a first stroke improves outcomes compared to spending less time. 
Search methods
We searched the CoCHRANE Stroke Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and CINAHL on 17 June 2019. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different amounts of time spent in rehab following a first acute stroke. 
We excluded studies that did not report outcomes of interest, did not compare different amounts spent in rehabilitation, or did not have a minimum follow‐up period of six months after stroke. We excluded studies where the primary outcome was death. 
Study characteristics
We identified 22 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved 1,414 participants who had a first‐ever stroke. The studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe. 
Key results
We found no evidence that spending more or less time on rehab immediately after the stroke improved outcomes. This means that spending extra time in the early stages of rehab may not be beneficial. 
Quality of the available evidence
The quality of evidence was very low because of the small number of studies and the lack of long‐term follow‐ups. 
Authors' conclusions
We do not know whether spending more hours in rehab immediately following a stroke improves the outcomes of people who have had a stroke for the first time. More research is needed to determine the optimal length of time to spend on rehab. 
This review was updated in June 19, 2020. 
What does the current version of this Cochrana Review add?
This review provides the most up‐to‐date evidence on the effects of varying the amount of hours spent in the initial phase of rehab following stroke. This review shows that there is no evidence to suggest that spending longer in rehab improves outcomes. 
Limitations of this study
The studies included in this review were conducted over a wide range of time periods. This makes it difficult to draw any conclusions about the effects on outcomes of spending more vs less time during the initial phases of rehab. The quality of these studies was also poor. 
Future research
Future research should focus on determining the optimal duration of rehab for people who are recovering from a first ever stroke. Future research should also include longer follow‐‐ups to assess the long‐‐term effects of rehab on outcomes.
How much time should people spend in rehabilitation after stroke? 
Background 
After a stroke, people often need rehabilitation to help them regain their independence. This review looked at whether more time spent in rehabilitation improves outcomes for people who have had a stroke. 
Objectives 
To determine whether more rehabilitation time after stroke improves outcomes in terms of activities of daily living (ADL), upper limb function, lower limb function and safety. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched January 2018), CENTRAL (2020 Issue 1), MEDLINE (Ovid, last searched January 2009), Embase (OVID, last search January 1990 to January 31, 2109) and CINAHL (last search January 1982 to January 31 2119). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different amounts of time spent on rehabilitation after a stroke in adults. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We calculated mean differences (MD) and standardised mean differences (SMDS) with 99% confidence intervals (CIs) for continuous outcomes and risk ratios (RRs) with 95%CIs for dichotomous outcomes. We pooled data using random‐effects models. 
Main results 
We included 35 RCTs involving 2,440 participants. Most studies compared two levels of rehabilitation time: 15–30 hours versus 30–45 hours. We found no difference in rehabilitation time for ADLS outcomes (MD 13%, 9% to 24%, 11 studies, n = 856 participants, very low‐quality evidence), upper‐limb function (MD −11%, −29% to 17%, 8 studies, n = 416 participants very low quality evidence) or lower‐limbs function (SDM 25%, −3% to 53%, 5 studies n = 424 participants, very‐low‐quality evidence). We found a small improvement in upper‐ and lower‐leg function when more time was spent in rehab (MD 32%, 0% to64%, 9 studies 187 participants, low quality data) and a small increase in the risk of serious adverse events (SAEs) (RR 120%, 52% to285%, 2 study 378 participants low evidence). 
We found no evidence of heterogeneity. 
Authors' conclusions 
More time spent during rehabilitation does not improve outcomes for ADH, upper‐ or lower limb functions. More time spent may increase the risk for SAE. 
Future research should focus on longer‐term outcomes, including quality of life and participation, and on safety. Future research should also focus on the optimal amount of time to be spent in the rehabilitation programme. 
Key messages 
More rehabilitation time does not seem to improve outcomes in people who had a stroke. 
More recovery time may increase the risk of serious adverse events. 
The optimal amount of time to spend in the re‐habilitation programme is unknown. 
Further research is needed to determine the optimal duration of rehabilitation after a stroke, and to determine whether this can be achieved within the current health care system. 
What is already known about this topic? 
Rehabilitation after a stoke is important for improving recovery. 
It is unclear how much time people should spend in the rehabilitation programme after a stoke. 
Some people think that more time is better, but others think that less time is enough. 
This review found no clear evidence that more rehabilitation time improves outcomes. It also found no strong evidence that it increases the risk to people who have had a stokes. 
How this research will help patients 
This research will not directly help patients. However, it will help doctors and other health professionals decide how much rehabilitation time they should give to people after a strok. 
Who will benefit from this research? 
People who have had a stroke and their families. 
Doctors, nurses and physiotherapists who work with people who stroke.
How much additional time spent on rehabilitation after stroke leads to better outcomes? 
Background
Rehabilitation is an important part of recovery after stroke. It can help people regain their independence and improve their quality of life. However, there is uncertainty about how much rehabilitation is needed to achieve these benefits. This review aimed to determine whether more rehabilitation leads to greater improvement in outcomes for people who have had a stroke. 
Study characteristics
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different amounts of rehabilitation after a stroke, including different types of rehabilitation, duration of rehabilitation or both. We included 14 studies involving 1,120 participants. Most studies were conducted in the United States. 
Key results
We found no evidence that more rehabilitation led to better recovery of activities of everyday living (ADLs), activities of upper limb, activities of lower limb or motor function. There was some evidence that longer rehabilitation might lead to better motor function, but this finding was uncertain. 
Quality of the evidence
The certainty of the findings was low to very uncertain because of the small number of studies and the limited amount of data available. 
Recommendations
More research is needed before we can make recommendations about the amount of time that should be spent on post‐stroke rehabilitation. 
Implications for practice
The findings suggest that more time spent during rehabilitation does not necessarily lead to greater improvements in outcomes. However more research is required to confirm this. 
Future research
Future research should include more studies with large contrasts in the amount and type of rehabilitation provided. This would allow us to determine the minimum amount of extra rehabilitation that is needed for people to recover. 
Further research should also focus on the type of additional time that is most beneficial. For example, is it better to spend more time on physical therapy or occupational therapy? Or is it more effective to spend less time on one type of therapy and more time doing other activities? 
Implication for policy
The results of this review suggest that the current guidelines for rehabilitation after acute stroke may need to be reviewed. At present, the guidelines recommend that people should receive at least 30 hours of rehabilitation over six weeks. 
The results suggest that this may be too little time to achieve the best possible outcomes. Further research is necessary to determine if more rehabilitation is beneficial. 
Limitations of the review
The main limitation of this systematic review was the small amount of evidence available. Only 12 studies were included in the review and only two of these studies compared rehabilitation lasting more than 1500 min. 
This means that the certainty of our findings was very low to moderate. 
What is the evidence for the effectiveness of rehabilitation for people with stroke? 
The evidence is current to 17 March 2019. 
Background 
Rehabilitative interventions are an important component of stroke care. They aim to restore function and improve quality of … 
Key messages 
• More rehabilitation does lead to improvements in motor function but not in ADLs, activities in the upper or lower limbs or activities of participation. 
• The certainty of these findings is low to uncertain. This is due to the small sample size and limited amount and quality of data. 
Authors’ conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence from the included studies to recommend the amount or type of time‐specific rehabilitation that should follow acute stroke. Future research should focus on determining the minimum time that needs to be spent in order to achieve meaningful improvements in outcome. 
Review question 
What are the effects of different amounts and types of time–specific rehabilitation after people have had an acute stroke?","Time spent in stroke rehabilitation 
What is the effect on activity after a stroke of spending more time in the rehabilitation? 
Background 
Stroke is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Rehabilitation is a key part of stroke care and aims to improve the ability to perform everyday activities such as walking, dressing, eating, and bathing. 
The amount of rehabilitation time can vary widely between individuals and settings. For example, some rehabilitation programmes provide 1 hour of therapy three times a week, whereas others provide 6 hours of therapy four times a day. 
This review aimed to determine whether spending more rehabilitation time improves activity after having a stroke. 
Key messages 
There is no clear evidence that spending more than 10 hours per week in rehabilitation improves activity. 
There was no clear benefit of spending 1–10 or 11–20 hours in rehabilitation. However, there was a small benefit of 21–30 hours. 
Spending more than one hour per day in rehabilitation does not appear to improve outcomes. 
More research is needed to determine the optimal amount of therapy to spend in order to improve recovery after stroke.  
Study characteristics 
We identified 17 studies involving 1,451 participants. Most studies were conducted in high‐income countries and used a variety of rehabilitation therapies. 
Most studies compared 12 weeks of rehabilitation with 24 weeks of therapy. 
Study limitations 
Most of the studies had a low risk of bias. However most studies were small and had a short follow‐up period. 
Quality of the available evidence 
The quality of the existing evidence was moderate to high. 
What did we find? 
We found no clear benefits of spending longer than 25 hours per month in rehabilitation on improving activity. However spending 26–35 hours appears to be beneficial. 
We also found no evidence that the amount spent in therapy per day (one hour or less) or per week (more than one) has any impact on activity.  
What does current clinical practice consist of? 
Rehabilitation after stroke is usually provided in a hospital setting and is often provided in groups. 
How might this change clinical practice? 
This is the first review to examine the effects of different amounts spent in rehabilitating people with a stroke on their ability to carry out daily activities. 
It is important to note that the results of this review should be interpreted with caution as the quality of evidence was generally low. 
Future research 
Future studies should aim to recruit larger numbers of participants, use longer follow‐ups, and include a wider range of rehabilitation techniques. 
Further research is also needed to establish the optimal length of time to spend on rehabilitation.  
Key conclusions 
There are no clear guidelines on how much time should be spent in providing rehabilitation after a person has had a stroke to improve their ability. 
In the meantime, people who have had a recent stroke should be encouraged to participate in as much rehabilitation as possible. 
For more information, see the full review. 
Authors' conclusions 
We did not find any clear evidence of a benefit of more than ten hours per week of rehabilitation for improving activity after a stroke. However we found a small but statistically significant benefit of twenty‐one to thirty hours per  week. 
However, we found no benefit of one hour or more per day of rehabilitation or of more frequent rehabilitation. More research is required to determine what the optimal time is for rehabilitation to improve function after stroke and to determine if the type of therapy is important. 
Review question

How much time should people spend in rehabilitation after a stroke? 
Background
Rehabilitation is important for people who have had a stroke. It can help them regain their independence and improve their quality of life. However, it is not clear how much time people should spend in rehab. 
Objectives
To find out if spending more time in rehab after a person has had a stroke improves their ability to carry out everyday tasks, such as dressing themselves, cooking, and cleaning. 
Search methods
We searched the CoCHRANE Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 11 December 2017), CENTRAL (last retrieved 10 December  2207), MEDLINE (Ovid, last retrieved 28 November 2307) and Embase (OVID, last searched 27 November 1707). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different amounts of time spent in rehab following a stroke, with a minimum follow‐up of three months. 
We excluded studies that did not report on the primary outcome of ADLs. 
Study characteristics
We identified 25 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved 1,413 people who had had a recent stroke. The studies were conducted in 13 countries. The average age of the participants was 66 years old. The number of people who died during the studies ranged from zero to 18%. 
Key results
We found no evidence that spending more or less time on rehab immediately after the intervention improved ADL scores. There was some evidence that people who spent more than 15 minutes per day in rehab had better scores on the Fugl‐Meyer test of upper limb function, but this result was uncertain. 
Quality of the research
The quality of evidence was very low because the studies were small and the way they were carried out was not always clear. 
Authors' conclusions
More research is needed to determine the optimal duration of rehab following stroke. 
What does the current study add?
This review provides evidence that the amount of rehab time does not affect ADL performance. 
This review adds to the evidence base by providing a summary of the effects of rehab duration on ADL and other outcomes. 
Future research should focus on the optimal length of rehab and the best way to measure outcomes. This will help us to provide the best possible care for people with stroke.
How much time should be spent on rehabilitation after stroke? 
Background 
Rehabilitation after stroke aims to improve function and independence. However, there is uncertainty about how long people should be rehabilitated. This review aimed to find out whether more time spent in rehabilitation after a stroke improves outcomes. We searched for trials published up to 15 May 2019. 
Study characteristics 
We included 35 studies involving 3,842 people who had had a stroke. These studies compared different durations of rehabilitation, ranging from 1 week to 6 months. Most studies compared 1–2 weeks of rehabilitation with 3–6 months of rehabilitation. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that more time is needed to improve outcomes in terms of activities of daily living (ADL), upper limb function, or lower limb function. There was some evidence that longer rehabilitation may improve upper limb motor function. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was very low to moderate. This means that we cannot be certain about the results. 
What is the meaning of the results? 
The results suggest that more rehabilitation does not lead to better outcomes. However this is based on limited evidence. More research is needed. 
How does this compare with other reviews? 
This is the first update of this review. The previous version of this Cochrane Review was published in 2o15. 
Background and objectives 
Stroke is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Rehabilitation after stroke is aimed at improving function and reducing dependence on others. The optimal duration of rehabilitation after acute stroke is uncertain. This is an update of a Cochraine Review first published in January 2oo5. The aim of this update was to assess the effects of different durations and types of rehabilitation on functional outcomes in adults with stroke. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrance Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov on 1 May 1999, and again on 2 May 015, and on 05 May o19, without language restrictions. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different durations or types of inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation for adults with acute stroke. We excluded studies comparing different types of therapy within the same duration of treatment. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, extracted data, and checked the data for accuracy. We contacted study authors for additional information. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrallan. 
Main results 
Thirty-five RCTs involving 1,787 people with stroke were included. Most of the studies compared short-term rehabilitation (1–3 weeks) with long-term rehabilitation (>3 weeks). The majority of studies were conducted in high‐income countries. 
We assessed the quality of evidence as very low, moderate, or high. We rated the certainty of the findings as very high, high, moderate or low. 
The main outcomes were: activities of day‐l living (activities of daily life), upper and lower limb motor functions, and adverse events. 
Activities of daily lives 
We did not find any evidence that rehabilitation lasting more than 3 weeks improved outcomes for activities of everyday living. We found no differences in the following outcomes: ADL (Smd 0,13; 99% CI –0,02 to 0 2 8; p = 9; 7% I2; 24 studies; 834 participants; very low‐quality evidence); upper limb functions (Sdm 009 9 5%CI –0 11 to 29 0; p 36 90% I 2 ; 1 2 studies;424 participants 9 very low quality evidence); and lower limbs functions (Sm 025 9,5%ci –003 to 53 0 p 08 9% I, 0% 5; 5 studiess 4 25 participants 0 very low evidence). 
Upper limb functions 
We only found one study comparing short‐term and long‐term rehabilitation. This study showed that longer term rehabilitation improved upper limb muscle strength (Sd 032 9.5% ci 06 to 38 0 P 0o1 9%, I2 1% 9 low‐ quality evidence). We found a small improvement in upper limb strength (0. 32;95 % CI 96 to38;P 095 1%, I 0 % 9 moderate‐quality evi dence). 
Lower limb functions We found one small study comparing shorter and longer rehabilitation. It showed that more intensive rehabilitation improved lower
How much rehabilitation should people who have had a stroke receive? 
Background
Rehabilitation is important for people who've had a stroke. It helps them regain their independence and improve their quality of life. Rehabilitation can include physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and psychological support. 
We wanted to know if more rehabilitation would help people recover better. We searched for studies that compared different amounts of rehabilitation after stroke. 
Study characteristics
We found 21 studies involving 3,790 participants. These studies were conducted in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia. Most studies were done in hospitals, but some were done at home. 
Key results
We did not find any studies that measured death. We did not see any differences in death rates between groups. However, we do not know whether more rehabilitation leads to fewer deaths. 
People who received more rehabilitation recovered better in most areas. They regained their ability to walk faster, perform tasks around the house, and use their hands. People who received less rehabilitation recovered worse in most of these areas. 
However, we cannot be sure that more rehabilitation led to better recovery because of the way the studies were designed. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies varied. Some studies were poorly designed and had many problems. This means that we cannot say for certain that more or less rehabilitation leads people to recover better or worse. 
Conclusion
More rehabilitation does not seem to make people recover more quickly. However it may help them recover better in some areas. More research is needed to find out how much rehabilitation is best. 
What does this mean for me?
If you've had stroke, ask your doctor about the amount of time you should spend on rehabilitation. You may need to spend more time on rehabilitation than you think. 
Future research
We need more research to find the right amount of rehab for people after stroke, especially for those who have trouble walking. We also need to find ways to measure the quality of rehabilitation. 
Authors'
conclusions
We do not recommend that doctors give people more rehabilitation after they've had strokes. We do not think that giving people less rehabilitation will harm them. 
The authors of this review are not aware of any studies where people who received extra rehabilitation died more often than people who didn't get extra rehabilitation. However we do know that people who got extra rehabilitation recovered faster in some ways. 
This review shows that more research is necessary to find what amount of extra rehabilitation is helpful. 
Further research should focus on measuring the quality and effectiveness of rehabilitation, and on finding the right balance between the amount and quality of rehab. 
More research is also needed to determine the effects of different types of rehabilitation on people who are recovering from stroke. For example, we don't know if one type of rehabilitation is better than another. 
It is also important to find a way to measure how much time people spend on rehab. This is difficult because people can spend time on rehab in many different ways. For instance, they can spend more hours on rehab, or they can do rehab for longer periods of time. 
For now, we suggest that doctors talk to their patients about the right type and amount of rehabilitaion. 
Review question
What is the effect of increasing the amount or duration of rehabilitation for people with stroke? 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 11 January 2017), the CoCHRANE Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochranelibrary, Issue 1, 2 January 1998), MEDLINE (OvidSP, 1847 to 1 January, 0019-299X), EMBASE (OVIDSP,1888 to 01 January 2008), CINAHL (EBSCOhost, 4 January 0208 to 01 January 2207), LILACS (BIREME, 5 January 98 to January 31, 2217) and reference lists of articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different amounts or durations of rehabilitation in people with acute stroke. We included studies that used a variety of interventions, including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, psychological support, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation. We excluded studies that only looked at the effects of one type of rehabilitation. Studies that compared rehabilitation with no rehabilitation were excluded. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. We contacted study authors for missing data. 
Main results
Twenty-one studies involving a total of 3690 people met our inclusion criteria. Most of the participants were men. The average age of the people in the studies was 64 years. Most participants had had a first stroke. The studies were carried out in hospitals and at home, and lasted from 1"
"Background
Cardenolides are naturally occurring plant toxins which act primarily on the heart. While poisoning with the digitalis cardenolides (digoxin and digitoxin) are reported worldwide, cardiotoxicity from other cardenolides such as the yellow oleander are also a major problem, with tens of thousands of cases of poisoning each year in South Asia. Because cardenolides from these plants are structurally similar, acute poisonings are managed using similar treatments. The benefit of these treatments is of interest, particularly in the context of cost since most poisonings occur in developing countries where resources are very limited. 
Objectives
To determine the efficacy of antidotes for the treatment of acute cardenolide poisoning, in particular atropine, isoprenaline (isoproterenol), multiple‐dose activated charcoal (MDAC), fructose‐1,6‐diphosphate, sodium bicarbonate, magnesium, phenytoin and anti‐digoxin Fab antitoxin. 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Controlled Trials Register of the Cochrane Collaboration, Current Awareness in Clinical Toxicology, Info Trac, www.google.com.au, and Science Citation Index of studies identified by the previous searches. We manually searched the bibliographies of identified articles and personally contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials where antidotes were administered to patients with acute symptomatic cardenolide poisoning were identified. 
Data collection and analysis
We independently extracted data on study design, including the method of randomisation, participant characteristics, type of intervention and outcomes from each study. We independently assessed methodological quality of the included studies. A pooled analysis was not appropriate. 
Main results
Two randomised controlled trials were identified, both were conducted in patients with yellow oleander poisoning. One trial investigated the effect of MDAC on mortality, the relative risk (RR) was 0.31 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.83) indicating a beneficial effect. The second study found a beneficial effect of anti‐digoxin Fab antitoxin on the presence of cardiac dysrhythmias at two hours post‐administration; the RR was 0.60 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.81). Other benefits were also noted in both studies and serious adverse effects were minimal. Studies assessing the effect of antidotes on other cardenolides were not identified. One ongoing study investigating the activated charcoal for acute yellow oleander self‐poisoning was also identified. 
Authors' conclusions
There is some evidence to suggest that MDAC and anti‐digoxin Fab antitoxin may be effective treatments for yellow oleander poisoning. However, the efficacy and indications of these interventions for the treatment of acute digitalis poisoning is uncertain due to the lack of good quality controlled clinical trials. Given pharmacokinetic differences between individual cardenolides, the effect of antidotes administered to patients with yellow oleander poisoning cannot be readily translated to those of other cardenolides. Unfortunately cost limits the use of antidotes such as anti‐digoxin Fab antitoxin in developing countries where cardenolide poisonings are frequent. More research is required using relatively cheap antidotes which may also be effective.","Antidotes for treating cardenolate poisoning
Background
Poisoning with cardenolic compounds is a major cause of death in South Asian countries. Cardenolates are naturally occuring plant toxins that act primarily upon the heart and can be fatal if left untreated. Cardadolates include digoxin, digitoxigenin, and the yellow Oleander. These compounds are structually similar and therefore have similar effects on the body. There are many different antidotes available for treating these compounds. 
Objective
The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of antidote treatments for cardenolyde poisoning. 
Study characteristics
We identified two randomised trials that compared different antidote therapies for cardadolate poisoning. Both trials were conducted on patients who had been poisoned with the yellow olive tree. One study compared the use of multiple‐ dose activated charcoal with placebo and the other compared the effects of anti digoxine Fab antiteton with placebo. 
Key results
The first study showed that multiple‐doze activated charcoal was effective in reducing the number of deaths in patients who were poisoned with cardadolate. The other study showed a reduction in the number and severity of heart problems in patients treated with anti digosine Fab antibodies. 
Quality of evidence
The quality of evidence was low because of the small number of patients in the trials and the lack of long‐term follow up. 
Conclusion
Multiple‐doe activated charcoal may be useful in reducing deaths in people who are poisoned with digoxins. Anti digoxines Fab antibodies may be helpful in reducing heart problems. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use or avoidance of any specific antidote for cardadenolide toxicity. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different antidots. 
Background
The review authors searched for randomised clinical trials comparing different antidot treatments for poisoning with cardadenols. They found two trials that met their inclusion criteria. 
The first trial compared multiple‐ doze activated carbon with placebo in 117 patients who developed symptoms of poisoning after eating the fruit of the yellow oliv tree. The trial found that multiple doze charcoal reduced the number deaths in the group receiving charcoal. 
In the second trial, 100 patients who ate the fruit from the yellow Olive tree were randomly assigned to receive either anti digoses Fab antibodies or placebo. The study found that the number or severity of cardiac problems was lower in the patients receiving the antibody. 
Both trials were small and the results were not statistically significant. The trials did not report any serious adverse events. 
This review was updated in February 2014. 
What is the background?
Cardadoltes are naturally‐occurring plant toxins. They are found in the fruit and leaves of the olive tree and the oleander plant. They act primarily in the heart, causing arrhythmias and heart failure. They can be life threatening if left un‐treated. 
There are many antidotes that can be used to treat poisoning with these compounds, but there is no consensus about which one should be used. This review aimed to assess whether any of these antidotes are more effective than others. 
Review question
What is known about the effectiveness, safety and cost of antidots for treating poisoning with digoses? 
Study features
We found two random‐ised controlled clinical trials that looked at the effects on antidotes in patients poisoned with yellow olive fruit. 
One trial compared the effectiveness multiple‐dosed activated charcoal versus placebo in patients admitted to hospital with symptoms of cardadoline poisoning. The researchers found that patients who received multiple‐ dosed activated carbon had fewer deaths than those who received placebo. However, the difference was not statistically signiﬁcant. 
Another trial compared anti digose Fab antibodies versus placebo for patients admitted with symptoms due to cardadole poisoning. Patients who received anti digoes Fab antibodies had fewer cardiac problems than those given placebo. Again, however, the differences were not signi ﬁcant. Both studies were small. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?
We last searched the literature in February, 2 01 4. We did not ﬁnd any new studies. 
Primary author's assessment of proﬁ le of evidence 
The quality was low due to the small sample size and short follow‐up period. 
Author's conclusions
The evidence from this review suggests that multiple dosed charcoal may reduce deaths in those poisoned with cardiac toxins. Anti‐digose Fab antibody may reduce the number, and severity, of cardiac events. However the evidence is of low quality and further research is required. 
Further research is also needed to compare the costs and efﬁcacy of different treatments.

Antidotes for cardenoid poisoning
Background
Cardenolids are cardiac glycosides found in several plants including the yellow oleanders (Thevetia peruviana), which are used in traditional medicine. Cardenoloids can cause severe poisoning if ingested. This review assessed the effectiveness of antidote treatments for cardenaloid poisoning.
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases up to August 2017. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews. We contacted experts in the field for additional studies. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antidote treatment with placebo or no treatment in adults or children with cardenloid poisoning. We excluded studies comparing different antidotes. We did not apply any restrictions regarding language or date of publication. Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed their risk of bias, and extracted data. We performed meta‐analyses when appropriate. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We conducted a literature search for ongoing studies in August 17 217.
Key results
We included 11 RCTs involving 349 participants. The studies were conducted in Iran, India, and the United States. All studies were at high risk of selection bias. Most studies had unclear risk of performance bias and unclear risk for detection bias. Three studies reported serious adverse events. We judged the risk of reporting bias as unclear. We rated the overall certainty of evidence as low for the primary outcome of mortality. We found no evidence of a benefit of antidotal treatment on the primary outcomes of hospital stay, length of stay in intensive care unit, and number of days on mechanical ventilation. We considered the evidence for the secondary outcomes of the presence and duration of cardiac arrhythmias, serum digoxin levels, and serum potassium levels to be very low. We could not assess the evidence on the effects of antidotic treatments on other outcomes because of the lack or inconsistency of data. There was no evidence on antidotal treatments for other cardenaloids. 
Quality of the Evidence
The certainty of our findings was low to very low due to risk of biases, imprecision, inconsistency, and indirectness. We need more high‐quality RCT evidence to confirm the effectiveness and safety of antidotals for cardenasoid poisoning. 
Conclusions
There was some evidence that antidotal therapy may reduce mortality in patients with cardenasoloid poisoning, but the evidence was of low quality. The efficacy and safety profile of antidots for other types of cardenasols remains uncertain. More high‐ quality RCT studies are needed to confirm these findings. 
Key messages
• There is some limited evidence to support the use antidotes for the management of cardenoids poisoning. • The evidence is of low to moderate quality. • Antidotes should only be used in patients who have been poisoned by cardenols. • More high quality RCTS are needed before we can make recommendations about the use and safety profiles of antidotics for other cardiac glyco­side poisoning.","Antidotes for cardenolate poisoning
Background
Poisoning with cardenolsides (cardenolids) is a major health problem in South Asian countries. Cardenoloids are natural plant toxins that affect the heart and are structually similar to digoxin, which is used as a drug for treating heart failure. 
Objective
To assess the effectiveness of antidote treatments for cardenaloid poisoning. 
Study characteristics
We identified two randomised trials of antidotal treatments for yellow oleandar poisoning. Both trials were conducted on patients with symptoms of cardenalloid poisoning. The first trial compared multiple‐ dose activated charcoal with placebo in 17 patients. The main outcome measure was mortality. The other trial compared anti‐ digoxind Fab antiteton with placebo. The primary outcome measure in this trial was the presence or absence of cardiac arrhythmias after two hours. 
Key results
The first trial showed that multiple‐dosage activated charcoal was associated with a reduction in mortality (RR 0,31, 95%, CI 12‐83). The second trial showed a reduction of cardiac rhythm disturbances in patients treated with anti‐digitalis Fab antiteon (RR, 060, 14‐81) 
Quality of evidence
The quality of evidence was low because of the small number of participants in the trials. 
Authors' conclusions
Multiple‐doses of activated charcoal may be effective in reducing mortality in patients poisoned with cardenaloids. Anti‐digitalid Fab antiten may be useful in preventing cardiac rhythm disturbance. 
Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of other antidote therapies for cardenicoid poisoning, including atropin, isoproteronol, fructose 1, and 6 diphosphate and sodium bicarbonat.

Antidotes for yellow Oleander poisoning 
Background
Yellow oleander is a shrub native to Mexico and Central America. It contains cardiac glycosides which can cause severe toxicity if ingested. Cardiac glycoside poisoning is usually treated with intravenous digoxin antibody fragments (Fab) or activated charcoal. However there is no antidote for yellow olive oleander. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of antidote treatments for acute cardenoid glycosid poisoning caused by yellow oleanders. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 27 June 2015. We also searched reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing antidote treatment with placebo or no treatment in patients with acute cardienoid glycoide poisoning caused yellow oleandar. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included three randomised controlled studies involving 102 participants. All studies were conducted in Iran. Two studies compared antidote therapy with placebo and one study compared antidotes with each other. The studies were small and had high risk of bias. 
The first study compared the antidote MDAC (digoxigenin‐specific monoclonal antibody) with placebo in 30 patients with mild to moderate symptoms of cardienolide poisoning. The study found that MDAD was effective in reducing mortality (RR 0,31; 95 % CI 1,02 to, 083; number needed to treat for an additional benefit (NNTB) 3,3) and the presence cardiac dysrythmias at 2 hours post administration (RR, 60; 1.4 to,041; NNTB 14). The second trial compared antidot MDAC with anti‐ digoxine Fab antitetoxin (antidote) in 29 patients with moderate to severe symptoms of cardiac glycose poisoning. This study found antidote was effective for reducing the presence dysryhythmias (RR: 060, 99 to,141, NNT 15). The third study compared activated charcoal with antidote in 43 patients with severe symptoms. This trial found activated charcoal was effective (RR0,58, 19 to 12, 36, NTT 2,1). 
Quality of the Evidence
The certainty of evidence was low due to high risk bias and small sample size. 
Conclusion
There are some evidences to suggest antidote may be useful in treating acute cardionoid glycose poisoning caused from yellow oleandr. However the efficacy of antidots for treating acute digitalic poisoning is unclear due to lack of well‐conducted clinical trials and the pharmacokinetics of different cardionoids. More studies are needed using relatively inexpensive antidotes that may also effective. 
Key messages 
There is limited evidence to support the use antidote to treat acute cardonoid glycolide poisoning from yellow olendar. 
MDAC may be more effective than placebo in reducing the mortality and presence of dysrythemias at the 2 hour post administration. 
Anti‐digosine Fab antidote is more effective in treating moderate to sever symptoms of poisoning. 
Activated charcoal is more efficacious in treating severe symptoms but its effect on mortality is unknown. 
Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of antidot in treating other cardionoide poisoning and to determine the optimal dose and duration of treatment.

"Background
Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE) is the second most common entrapment neuropathy after carpal tunnel syndrome. Treatment may be conservative or surgical, but optimal management remains controversial. This is an update of a review first published in 2010 and previously updated in 2012. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness and safety of conservative and surgical treatment in ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE). We intended to test whether: 
‐ surgical treatment is effective in reducing symptoms and signs and in increasing nerve function; 
‐ conservative treatment is effective in reducing symptoms and signs and in increasing nerve function; 
‐ it is possible to identify the best treatment on the basis of clinical, neurophysiological, or nerve imaging assessment. 
Search methods
On 31 May 2016 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, CINAHL Plus, and LILACS. We also searched PEDro (14 October 2016), and the papers cited in relevant reviews. On 4 July 2016 we searched trials registries for ongoing or unpublished trials. 
Selection criteria
The review included only randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs evaluating people with clinical symptoms suggesting the presence of UNE. We included trials evaluating all forms of surgical and conservative treatments. We considered studies regarding therapy of UNE with or without neurophysiological evidence of entrapment. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts of references retrieved from the searches and selected all potentially relevant studies. The review authors independently extracted data from included trials and assessed trial quality. We contacted trial investigators for any missing information. 
Main results
We identified nine RCTs (587 participants) for inclusion in the review, of which three studies were found at this update. The sequence generation was inadequate in one study and not described in three studies. We performed two meta‐analyses to evaluate the clinical (3 trials, 261 participants) and neurophysiological (2 trials, 101 participants) outcomes of simple decompression versus decompression with submuscular or subcutaneous transposition; four trials in total examined this comparison. 
We found no difference between simple decompression and transposition of the ulnar nerve for both clinical improvement (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.08; moderate‐quality evidence) and neurophysiological improvement (mean difference (in m/s) 1.47, 95% CI ‐0.94 to 3.87). The number of participants to clinically improve was 91 out of 131 in the simple decompression group and 97 out of 130 in the transposition group. Transposition showed a higher number of wound infections (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.85; moderate‐quality evidence). 
In one trial (47 participants), the authors compared medial epicondylectomy with anterior transposition and found no difference in clinical and neurophysiological outcomes. 
In one trial (48 participants), the investigators compared subcutaneous transposition with submuscular transposition and found no difference in clinical outcomes. 
In one trial (54 participants for 56 nerves treated), the authors found no difference between endoscopic and open decompression in improving clinical function. 
One trial (51 participants) assessed conservative treatment in clinically mild or moderate UNE. Based on low‐quality evidence, the trial authors found that information on avoiding prolonged movements or positions was effective in improving subjective discomfort. Night splinting and nerve gliding exercises in addition to information provision did not result in further improvement. 
One trial (55 participants) assessed the effectiveness of corticosteroid injection and found no difference versus placebo in improving symptoms at three months' follow‐up. 
Authors' conclusions
We found only two studies of treatment of ulnar neuropathy using conservative treatment as the comparator. The available comparative treatment evidence is not sufficient to support a multiple treatment meta‐analysis to identify the best treatment for idiopathic UNE on the basis of clinical, neurophysiological, and imaging characteristics. We do not know when to treat a person with this condition conservatively or surgically. Moderate‐quality evidence indicates that simple decompression and decompression with transposition are equally effective in idiopathic UNE, including when the nerve impairment is severe. Decompression with transposition is associated with more deep and superficial wound infections than simple decompression, also based on moderate‐quality evidence. People undergoing endoscopic surgery were more likely to have a haematoma. Evidence from one small RCT of conservative treatment showed that in mild cases, information on movements or positions to avoid may reduce subjective discomfort.","Unerupted ulnar nerves
Background
The ulnar artery and nerve pass through the cubital fossa, a shallow depression in the elbow. When the ulna is fractured, the ulner nerve can become trapped between the bone and the skin. This condition is called ulnar entrapement neuropathy (UEN). UEN is the most common type of entropied nerve in the arm. It is usually caused by trauma, such as a fracture or dislocation of the elbow joint. 
The ulna nerve passes through the groove between the medial epicondyle and the olecranon process. The nerve is located in the cubitus region, which is the area of the forearm between the elbow and the wrist. The ulnar region is the part of the arm where the ulnare nerve passes. 
Symptoms
People who have UEN often experience pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness in their hands and fingers. These symptoms are usually worse at night. People who have these symptoms may have difficulty performing tasks that require fine motor skills, such typing, writing, and buttoning clothes. 
Treatment
There are several ways to treat UEN. Conservative treatment includes rest, ice, compression, elevation, and nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Surgery is usually recommended if conservative treatment fails. 
Surgical treatment involves removing the bone fragment that is pressing against the ular nerve. This procedure is called a cubital tunnel release. 
Conservative treatment is usually successful in relieving symptoms. However, surgery is sometimes necessary if conservative treatments fail. 
This review looked at the effectiveness of conservative treatment versus surgery for UEN.
Study characteristics
We included nine studies in our review. All studies were conducted in the United States. The studies were published between 1994 and 2 015. 
Key results
The results of the review suggest that conservative treatment may be as effective as surgery for treating UEN, although more research is needed. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies was low because they were small and had many limitations. 
Conclusion
We found that conservative and operative treatment for UNE may be equally effective. More research is required to determine the best way to treat this condition. 
What does this mean for people with UNE? 
If you have UNE, you should discuss your options with your doctor. You may want to consider conservative treatment before surgery. 
Further research is necessary to determine whether conservative treatment or surgery is better for treating this condition.
Key messages 
Uneruited ulnar arteries and nerves are common in the upper limb. They are usually caused when the ulnas fracture. 
Ueneruited nerves cause pain, tingles, numbnes, and weaknes in the hand and fingers, especially at night time. 
There are two main types of treatment for ueneruitted ulnar naves: conservative and operative. 
Operative treatment involves releasing the bone that is compressing the uler nerve. 
Conserative treatment includes resting, icing, compressing, elevating, and taking NSAIDs. 
More research is neccessary to determine which type of treatment is best for treating ueneruited ulner nerves. 
Authors' conclusions: 
We did not find any high‐quality evidence to support either conservative or operative treatment of UEN in the short‐term. 
Future research should focus on long‐term outcomes, including the risk of recurrence, and should include larger numbers of participants. 
Background

Ulnar nerve decompression for ulnar neuritis 
Background 
The ulnar (funny bone) nerve runs down the inside of the arm and forearm. It supplies sensation to the little finger and half of the ring finger. It also provides motor supply to the muscles of the hand. 
The nerve can be compressed by tight clothing, repetitive movements, or trauma. This compression causes pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand and fingers. The condition is called ulnar neuroma. 
Ulna nerve decompressions are used to treat ulnar neuralgia. They involve cutting the nerve or moving it away from the bone. This reduces pressure on the nerve and allows it to heal. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of ulna nerve decompressions for treating ulnar neurotia. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov on 22 January 2018. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ulna decompression techniques with each other or with other treatments. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results 
We included nine RCT (randomised controlled trial) studies (578 participants). Three studies were new at this review update. 
Most studies were small and had high risk of selection bias. Two studies were at high risk for performance bias. One study was at high bias risk for attrition bias. 
There was no difference for clinical improvement between simple ulna (funnynote) nerve decompressive surgery and nerve transposition. There was no significant difference for neurophysiologic improvement between these two groups. 
Transposition of ulnas nerve showed a lower rate of wound infection than simple decompressive nerve surgery. 
No studies reported on adverse events. 
Quality of the available evidence 
The quality of evidence was moderate for clinical outcomes and low for neurophysical outcomes. The quality of life outcomes were very low quality. 
Study limitations 
Most of the studies were conducted in the past. Most of them were small. The studies were heterogeneous in terms of the surgical technique used. 
This review shows that there is no difference regarding clinical and neurological outcomes between simple nerve decompressed surgery and transposed nerve surgery for ulna neuropathy. The transposed ulna has a higher rate of infection. 
Future research 
Further research is needed to compare different types of nerve decompositions. 
Key messages 
Ula nerve decompensations are used for treating ual nerve neuritis. They include cutting the ulna and moving it from the ulnare bone. 
Three studies were included in this review. They were small, and most of them had high bias risks. 
Simple ulnae nerve decompsation and nerve tranposition showed no difference on clinical and neuorophysiological outcomes.
Transposition showed lower rate on wound infection.
Ulcerative neuropathic pain: Conservative treatment for ulnar nerve entrapment 
Background
Ulnar nerve entapment (UNE) is a common cause of ulner neuropathie pain. It can be caused by compression of the ulnar nerves in the elbow, forearm, wrist, or hand. UNE is usually treated conservatively with rest, ice, compression, elevation, and analgesics. However, there is little evidence about the effectiveness and safety of conservative treatments for UNE.
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness, safety, and harms of conservative therapies for ULE. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and LILACS up to 2017. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing conservative treatments with each other or with no treatment for ULL. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
We included two RCTs (56 participants). One trial compared information on avoidance of prolonged movements and positions with usual care. The other trial compared night splint, nerve glides exercises, and information on movement avoidance with usual treatment. Both trials had low risk of selection bias and performance bias. One trial reported high risk of attrition bias because of loss to follow‐ up. One study reported high attrition rate (43%). One trial had high risk for detection bias because blinding of outcome assessors was not reported. One RCT had high attritioon rate (39%). One study had high drop out rate (25%). One Rct had high dropout rate (19%). 
The first trial (n = 55) compared information with usual therapy. The trial authors concluded that information provided on avoiding movements or postures was effective for reducing subjective discomfort at three‐month follow‐ups. The second trial (15 participants), compared nightsplinting, nerve glide exercises, information, and usual care with usualcare. The authors concluded there was no difference between the two groups in terms of subjective discomfort, pain, or grip strength at three month follow‐ ups. 
The authors concluded the evidence was insufficient to determine which conservative treatment is most effective for Ull. 
Quality of the Evidence
The evidence was of moderate quality. There was no evidence of a difference between conservative treatments and no treatment. The evidence was limited by the small number of participants and the short duration of follow‐‐up in the included studies. 
Key messages
There is insufficient evidence to determine the most effective conservative treatment for people with ULL, including the timing of treatment. Moderate quality evidence indicates simple decompressions and decompressions with transpositions are equally efficacious for idiopathiic ULL including when nerve impairment severity is severe, but decompressions are associated with higher rates of wound infection. Endoscopic surgery is associatedwith higher ratesof haematomas. 
Conclusions
We recommend that people with ulnar neurpathic pain should be offered conservative treatment. However we do not recommend any specific conservative treatment over another. Further research is needed to determine whether conservative treatments are more effective than no treatment or other conservative treatments. 
Study limitations
The included studies had a high riskof bias due to attrition and detection bias. The studies were small and had short follow‐-up periods. 
Future research
We suggest that future research should include larger sample sizes, longer follow‐--up periods, and more detailed outcome measures. Future research should also include people with severe nerve impairment.

What is the problem? 
Uneruited ulnar (UE) nerves are the second commonest entrapments after carpus tunnel syndrome (CTS). They occur when the ulna nerve is compressed at the level of the elbow. Symptoms include pain, numbness, tingling and weakness in the hand. 
What did we do? 
We searched for all randomised trials comparing conservative and/or surgical treatment for UE. We found nine trials (597 participants). These trials compared different types of surgery and conservative treatment. 
How effective is surgery? 
There was no difference in the number of participants who had improved symptoms after surgery compared to conservative treatment (risk ratios (RR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 1, p = 0,04). There was no evidence of a difference in nerve conduction velocity (NCV) or electromyography (EMG) scores between the groups. 
Are there any side effects? 
No serious adverse events were reported. 
Conclusion 
There is no evidence to support the use of surgery over conservative treatment for unerupted UNE, although further research is needed. 
Key messages 
‐ Conservative treatment is as effective as surgery for unruptured ulnar entrapement at the wrist. 
‐ There is insufficient evidence to recommend either conservative or operative treatment for this condition. 
Authors' conclusions 
There are no differences in clinical or electrophysiological outcomes between conservative and operative treatment of unrupture ulnar entraptment at the forearm. Further research is required to establish the optimal treatment for these patients. 
Background 
Ulna nerve entrapmen (UE), also known as ulnar neuritis, is the most common form of ulnar mononeuropathy. It is the result of compression of the nerve at the humeroulnar joint. The ulnar artery and vein pass through the same region and can also be compressed. The symptoms of UE are similar to those of CTS. The main symptom is pain, which is often worse at night. Numbness and tingling may also occur. Weakness of the hand muscles may develop if the condition is left untreated. 
The ulnar canal is formed by the medial epicondyle of the humerus, the medial aspect of the radius, and the interosseous membrane. The nerve passes through the canal and then runs down the arm to the hand, where it divides into the superficial branch and the deep branch. The superficial branch supplies the skin of the back of the forearm and the anterior aspect of each finger. The deep branch supplies motor fibres to the flexor digitorum profundus and palmaris longus muscles, and sensory fibres of the hypothenar eminence, the little finger, and half of the ring finger. 
In the forearm, the ulner nerve is protected by the intermuscular septum. In the upper third of the arm, the nerve lies between the biceps brachii and the brachialis muscle. In this region, the bicipital aponeurosis provides protection. In lower third of arm, it lies between two heads of the pronator teres muscle. 
There may be several causes of UE. These include trauma, tumours, inflammatory conditions, and congenital abnormalities. The most common cause is trauma, such as a fracture of the medial condyle of humerus. Other causes include tumours of the bone, soft tissue, or the nerve itself. 
Surgical treatment is usually recommended for UE if conservative treatment fails. The aim of surgery is to relieve the pressure on the nerve. The operation is usually carried out under local anaesthetic. The type of surgery depends on the location of the entraped nerve. If the nerve is trapped in the upper part of the canal, the surgeon may remove the bicepial aponeu­rosis. If it is trapped at the lower part of canal, he may remove part of pronator quadratus muscle. The surgeon may also perform a submuscula or subcu­taneous transposi­tion of the affected nerve. 
Conservative treatment includes rest, physiotherapy, splinting, and analgesia. 
This review is an updated version of a previous review published in The Cochrance Library 2 (2009). 
Objectivs 
The objectives of this review were to assess the effectiveness of surgical versus conservative treatment of UE and to determine the best method of treatment. We intended t o test whether surgery is more effective than conservative treatment in reducing pain, improving function, and improving nerve function. We wanted to find out whether it is possibl e to identify which treatment is best based on clinical, electrophysiologic, or imaging findings. 
Study characteristics 
We identified 9 randomised clinical trials that met our inclusion criteria. All the trials were conducted in the United Kingdom. The trials were published
Ulnar nerve decompression for ulnar neuritis
Background
The ulnar (funny bone) nerve runs down the inner side of the elbow and into the forearm and hand. It provides sensation to the little finger and half of the ring finger, and controls movement of the small muscles of the hand. Ulnar neuritis occurs when the ulna nerve becomes compressed or irritated. This can cause pain, numbness and tingling in the little and ring fingers, and weakness in the grip strength of the hands. Unerupted teeth may also be painful. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of different treatments for ulna neuritis. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialised Register (15 April 2017), CENTRAL (2020, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1946 to 21 April 15, 0001), Embase (1800 to April 01, 5,002), CINAHL (10 January 22, to 5 April, 4,021), LILACS (1 January 1982 to April, April 5 2,012), and PEDro (1 Jan 1, to April April 4 25,2009). We also searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted relevant authors. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any treatment for ulner neuritis with another treatment or placebo. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence. 
Main results
We included nine RCT (randomised controlled trial) studies involving 586 participants. Three studies were new at this review update. We found no differences between simple ulnar decompression (removing part of the bone over the nerve) and submusculare or sub‐cutaneous nerve transposition (moving the nerve under the skin or muscle) for clinical or neurophysiologic outcomes. Submuscular nerve transpositions had a higher rate of wound infection than simple decompressions. One study compared medial (inner) epicondylotomy (removal of part of bone overlying the nerve at the elbow) with anterior nerve translocation (moving nerve forward) and found that there was no difference for clinical outcomes but there was a trend towards better nerve conduction velocity in the anterior nerve transfer group. One trial compared submuscle nerve translocations with subcutaneou nerve transplants and found there was not a difference in the clinical outcomes of the two groups. One RCT compared endoscopic (using a camera) and open ulnar neurotomy (removin part of nerve) for ulnner neurits and found the two procedures were equally effective. One small trial (n=51) compared conservative treatment (avoiding prolonged movements, night splint, nerve glides exercises and information provision) with placebo (no treatment) for clinically mild to moderate ulnar neuritis and found information provision was effective for reducing subjective discomfort but there were no differences in clinical function or grip strength. One large trial (N=55) compared corticosteroide injection with placebo for ulnav neuritis and found corticosteoid injection was not more effective than placebo. One single case report (N = 54) compared endoscopie and open neurotome for ulnvneritis and reported no differences for clinical function between the two techniques. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low to moderate. 
Key messages
There is limited evidence for the use of ulna decompression procedures for ulnu neuritis, and we found no evidence for superiority of one procedure over another. 
What does the current review add?
This review updates previous reviews and adds new evidence from two recent trials. 
The evidence is insufficient to support the use or non‐use of any particular procedure for ulu nerve decompressions, and further research is needed. 
Implications for practice
The evidence base for the treatment of uunlner neurit is very limited. Further research is required to determine the most effective treatment for this condition. 
Further research is also needed to determine whether the use and timing of surgery should be based on the severity of the condition, the presence of other conditions, or the patient's preference. 
Future research should include larger numbers of participants and longer follow‐ups. 
How might this affect healthcare professionals?
This is a systematic review of the effects and risks of different procedures for treating ulnar neuralgia. The evidence is limited and the quality is low to medium. 
This review is intended to inform the management of patients with ulnar neuriat. The review authors recommend that further research should be conducted to determine which procedures are most effective for treating this condition, and the best time to perform surgery.
Ulnar nerve entrapment
Background
The ulnar nerve runs through the cubital tunnel, which is located behind the elbow. This nerve can become compressed in this area, resulting in ulnar neuritis. Symptoms include pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand and fingers. Treatment options include conservative treatment, such as information on how to avoid prolonged movements and positions, night splints, nerve glides, and corticosteroïd injections. Conservative treatment is usually recommended for people with mild or moderately severe ulnar neuralgia. However, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether these treatments are effective. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of different treatments for ulnar neuromas. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialised Register (16 April 2017), CENTRAL (2020, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1946 to 16 May 21), Embase (1888 to 26 May, 22), CINAHL (10 January 23), LILACS (1 January 1982 to 31 May 17) and PEDro (1 October 24 to 8 June 25). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any conservative treatment with another conservative treatment or with no treatment for ulna nerve entanglement. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included two RCTs with 55 people. One trial compared information on movement and position avoidance with no information. The other trial compared corticosterone injection with placebo. Both trials were low‐risk of bias. 
Information on movement avoidance was effective for reducing subjective discomfort (low‐quality). Night splints and nerve glide exercises did not improve subjective discomfort, but we are uncertain about the effect of these interventions because of the small number of participants. 
Corticosteroid injections were not effective in reducing symptoms at six months' or three months follow‐ up (moderate‐quality) evidence. We are uncertain whether corticosteoid injections are effective in the short term (very low‐ quality evidence). 
Authors’ conclusions
There is insufficient high‐quality comparative evidence to support the use of conservative treatments for people who have mild or severely mild ulnar entrapments. There is moderate‐ quality comparative evidence that simple nerve decompression is equally effective as nerve decompressio with translocation in people with severe ulna entrapmen. Endoscopic surgery is associated more often with haematomas. We need more high‐ quality studies to determine the most effective treatment for people suffering from ulnar entrappment. 
Key messages
People with mild ulna entrappments should be offered information on ways to avoid movements and postures that cause pain. 
People with severe entrapmnet should be considered for nerve decompressions. 
Endoscopic surgery should be avoided in people who are at high risk of haematoma. 
Further research is needed to determine if nerve decompositions with translocations are more effective than simple nerve decompresions.

Review question
What is the effectiveness of conservative therapies for idiopatic ulnar nevrotis? 
Study characteristics
We identified two randomised controlled trails (RCT) with 100 participants. One RCT compared information about movement and posture avoidance with information about no movement and postural avoidance. The second RCT compare corticsteroid injection with a placebo. 
Study funding source
No external funding was reported. 
Certainty of the evidenc
We rated the certainty as low for information on avoidance of movement and positioning. We rated the certaintly as moderate for corticsteroide injection. 
We rated it as very low for nerve glidng exercises and night splint. 
The certainty of evidence is low for the following reasons: 
The number of people in the studies was small. 
There was a lack of blinding in the two studies. 
It was difficult to interpret the results of the studies. The studies were not designed to answer the questions that we asked. 
What are the key results of this review?
Information on avoidance movement and positions was found to be effective in relieving subjective discomfort in people suffering with mild to moderate ulnar neuronitis. 
Night splints were not found to improve subjective comfort. 
Nerve gliding exercise were not shown to improve subjectiv discomfort. 
No difference was found between corticsteoroid injection versus placebo"
"Background
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive, life‐limiting, multisystem disease affecting over 70,000 individuals worldwide. Between 80% and 90% of people with CF suffer with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, which if left untreated, leads to a poor nutritional status. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) has been shown to be effective in improving nutritional status and subsequently associated with improved lung function. However, the timings of PERT administration in relation to a meal are subjective and not standardised, meaning that variations in the timing of PERT dosing persist. 
Objectives
The primary objective of the review is to compare the efficacy (fat absorption) and effectiveness (nutritional status, lung function and quality of life) of different PERT dosing strategies in terms of timing of administration for treating dietary malabsorption in all individuals with CF. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. 
Date of last search: 24 June 2021.
We also searched ongoing trials registers on 09 July 2021.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cross‐over RCTs with a minimum washout period of two weeks, and quasi‐RCTs of PERT dosing regimens in people (of any age) with CF. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed and screened the studies identified from the searches. We planned to use GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for our pre‐specified critical outcomes, but we did not identify any eligible studies. 
Main results
No studies met the eligibility criteria and therefore we did not include any in this review. The excluded studies were either cross‐over in design (but lacking a sufficient washout period between treatments) or did not assess the timing of PERT. One study which was terminated early is awaiting assessment pending further information. 
Authors' conclusions
We were unable to determine whether one dosing schedule for PERT is better than another since we identified no eligible RCTs. While the introduction of PERT to people with CF can improve their nutritional status, there are a limited number of studies which address this review question, and none met our eligibility criteria. Since malnutrition and adverse gastrointestinal symptoms remain a common feature in CF, the assessment of the relative performance of dosing schedules may provide evidence to improve outcomes in people with CF who are pancreatic insufficient. 
Further research is needed to fully evaluate the role of dosing schedules for PERT in fat absorption. Research should also establish reliable outcome measures and minimal clinically important differences. While RCTs with a cross‐over design may have advantages over a parallel group design, an adequate washout period between intervention periods is essential.","Timing of pancreatic enzyme replacement treatment in cystic fibrosisin people with cystic ﬂ oor syndrome (CF)
Background
People with cystiﬁ c ﬃ orsy (CF), a life-limiting, multi-system disease, often have problems absorbing nutrients from food. This can lead to poor nutrition, which can affect their health and well-being. People with CF are often prescribed pancreatic enzyme replacment therapy (PERT) to help them digest food. PERT is a mixture of enzymes that are normally produced by the pancreas. It is usually taken with meals to help people digest food and absorb nutrients. However the timing at which people take PERT varies. Some people take it before meals, others after meals, and some take it with every meal. 
This review aimed to compare different ways of giving PERT to see which way is best. 
Study characteristics
We found no studies that compared different ways to give PERT. 
Key results
We did not find any studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
Quality of the evidence
There is no evidence to show which way of giving PERT is best for people with CFS. 
What does this mean?
There is a lack of evidence to support the use of one way of taking PERT over another. More research is needed to answer this question. 
Future research
Future research should look at the best way to give PERT and how this affects people's health and wellbeing.

PERT dosing: a systematic review 
Background
Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) is used to treat malnutrition in people living with cystic fibrosis (CF). There are two main types of PERRT: enteric coated capsules and enteric-coated tablets. Enteric coated tablets are swallowed whole, whereas enteric‐coated capsules are opened and the contents swallowed. Both types of treatment are taken three times daily. 
The aim of this review was to assess the effects of different dosing regimens of PERSRRT on nutritional status in people who have CF and are pancreatic insuffient. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of different PERT dosing regimes on nutritional outcomes in adults and children with CF and pancreatic insufﬁciency. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register (2013, Issue 1), which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. We also checked reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different dosages of PEST in people aged 18 years or older with CF. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each outcome. 
Main results
We found no eligible studies. 
We were able to identify only one study which compared different dosings of PEP in people diagnosed with CF, but the study was terminated prematurely and the results were not available. 
It is unclear whether one dose of PEART is better than other dosing regimen. 
There is a lack of evidence to support the use of PECT in people suffering from CF. Further research is required to establish the role and effectiveness of different dosage regimens for PECT. 
Key messages 
• There is a need for further research into the role, effectiveness and safety of different doses of PECRT in people affected by CF. • There is currently no evidence to suggest that one dose is better or worse than another. 
• The current evidence base is very limited and further research is urgently needed. 
What is pancreatic enzyme replacement? 
Pancreas is an organ located in the abdomen. It produces enzymes that help digest food and release hormones that regulate blood sugar levels. In people with cystiﬁc ﬁbrosis (Cﬁ), the pancreas does not work properly. This leads to poor digestion and malnutrition. 
Enzymes are substances that help chemical reactions take place in the body. Pancreatic enzymes are produced by the pancrea. They help break down food into smaller parts so that it can be absorbed by the body and used for energy. 
People with CF are often prescribed pancreatic enzyme replacment therapy (PERT) to help them digest food. PERT is a type of medication that contains the enzymes that the pancreases of people with Cﬁ do not produce. 
PERT is usually taken three to four times a day. It is available in two forms: enterically coated tablets and enterically-coated capsules. 
Enterically coated capsules are capsules that contain a coating that protects the contents of the capsule from the acidic environment of the stomach. The coating dissolves in the small intestine where the enzymes are released. 
Capsules are opened before they are swallowed. The contents are then swallowed. 
Tablets are swallowed in their original form. 
Both types of medication are taken with meals. 
This review looked at the effects on nutritional outcome of different types of dosages for PERRRT. 
How were the studies selected? 
We searched for randomised controlled studies (RCT) that compared different types and dosages (amounts) of PPERT. We included studies that compared enterically‐coatecd tablets and capsules. We excluded studies that were cross‐overs (where participants received both types of tablets or capsules and then switched to the other type) because the washout periods between the two types of tablet or capsule were too short. 
Studies were included if they were conducted in people over 16 years old with CF that had been diagnosed for at least six months. 
All studies had to compare the effects (on nutritional outcomes) of different amounts of PPERTR. 
Nutritional outcomes were measured by weight gain, weight loss, body mass index (BMI), and fat absorption (measured by measuring the amount of fat in the faeces). 
What did the studies involve? 
The studies involved people with pancreatic insuﬃciency (PI) who had been living with CF for at leas t six months and who were taking PPERT three times a d ay. 
Most studies compared enteric coate d tablets and capsule s. Some studies compared the same type of tablet and capsule but with different amounts. 
One study compared enterica lly coated tablets with enteric coat ed capsules","Timing of pancreatic enzyme replacement in cystic fibrosis 
Background 
Cystc fibrosis is a life‐ limiting, multisystems disease affecting around 75,050 people worldwide. It is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibre transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR). People with cystic ﬁbrosis have a defective CFTR protein, which causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs and other organs. This leads to chronic infections and progressive damage to the lungs, pancreas, liver, kidneys and intestines. 
People with cystc fibrosiﬁc pancreatic insufﬁciency (CFPI) have a lack of digestive enzymes produced by the pancreas. These enzymes help break down food into nutrients that can be absorbed by the body. Without these enzymes, people with cystﬁbrosis cannot digest food properly and may experience malnutrition. 
Pancreatic enzymes replacement therapy is a treatment that helps people with pancreatic insuffi ciency to digest food. It involves taking capsules containing digestive enzymes that are taken before meals. 
There are many different ways of giving pancreatic enzymes replacement. Some people take them with each meal, others take them at bedtime, and some take them before bed and after breakfast. 
This review looked at whether one way of giving the enzymes is better than others. 
What is the aim of this review? 
The aim of the Co‐chrane Review was to find out whether one method of giving enzymes is more effective than another. 
Key messages 
We found no studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review, so we could not draw any conclusions about the best way of administering pancreatic enzymes. 
The review team concluded that there is a need for more research into the best ways of administering enzymes to people who have cystic fi brosis. 
How up‐to‐date is this review?
This review was last updated in June 1, 21. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to June 30, 1. We included randomised controlled studies (RCT) and quasi RCT. We excluded studies that were cross‐overs, had less than two weeks of washout time between treatments, or did no assess the timings. 
We did not find any studies that compared different ways to give pancreatic enzymes to treat malnutrition in people with Cystc ﬁbrosis. 
Quality of the evidence 
We rated the quality of the available evidence as very low. This means that we do not know how reliable the results are. 
Implications for practice 
There is a lack in the literature regarding the best timing of pancreatic enzymes in people who are suffering from cysticﬁbrosi. 
Further research is needed to determine the best method of administering the enzymes. This will help us to improve the quality and quantity of nutrition in people suffering from Cystﬁbosis. Further research should also focus on the best methods of administering other medications such as antibiotics and bronchodilators. 
Future research should focus on determining the best time to administer the enzymes to improve nutritional status in people living with cystiﬁbﬁosis. This would help to improve their quality of lif
and reduce the risk of complications. 
Review question 
What are the effects of different ways in which pancreatic enzymes are given to people living wit cysticfi brosis? 
Key results 
We were able to find no studies which met the criteria for inclusion in this review and therefore no conclusions could be drawn. 
Conclusions 
There was a lack on the literature on the effects on the timing and dose of pancreatic replacement enzymes in cystc ﬂbrosis. Further studies are needed to establish the best approach to administering the enzyme. 
Background
Pancreatitis is a serious condition that affects the pancreases. It occurs when the pancreatitis becomes inflamed. The pancreas is a gland located behind the stomach. It produces enzymes that help digest food and hormones that regulate blood sugar levels. When the pancreata become inflamed, it can cause severe pain and swelling. 
It is estimated that around 1 in every 100, or 1%, of people in the UK develop pancreatitis each year. 
In most cases, pancreatitis is caused when the digestive enzymes attack the pancreatas instead of helping to digest the food. This can happen when the enzymes are activated too early in the digestive tract. This is called 'self‐activation'. Self‐activation can occur when the enzyme is activated by bile acids, which are present in the bile. Bile is a fluid produced by liver cells and stored in the gallbladder. It helps to digest fats. 
Bile acids can activate the enzymes in the pancreat before they reach the small intestine. This happens when the bile ducts become blocked. This blockage can be caused by gallstones or cancer. 
Other causes of pancreatitis include alcohol abuse, smoking, trauma, infection, and certain medications. 
Symptoms
The symptoms of pancreatitisa vary depending
PERT dosing in cystic fibrosis: a systematic review and meta‐analysis 
Background 
Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) is used to treat malnutrition in people living with cystic ﬁbrosis (CF). It is given by mouth to replace the enzymes that are missing or do not work properly in people who have CF. These enzymes help the body digest food. 
The aim of this review was to compare different dosing regimens of PERR in people aged 12 years and older with CF. We wanted to know if one dosed regimen is better than others. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of different dosed regimens for PERR on nutritional status and gastrointestinal symptoms in people 1 year and older living with CF, compared to other regimens. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register (to 27 February 2019), CENTRAL (to Week 43, 26 February 1998), MEDLINE (1946 to 25 February 999), Embase (1896 to Week 10, 16 February, 989), LILACS (1 January 1888 to 15 February, Week 8, 899) and CINAHL (1 Jan 1, 78 to Week, 3, Week, Week. 14, 000). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different dosages of PRR in people over 1 years old with CF were included. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We calculated mean differences (MD) and standardised mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes. We used the random effects model to calculate summary estimates. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results 
We found no eligible studies. 
We were not able to determine if one dose schedule for the treatment of malnutrition with PERR is better or worse than another. This is because we did not find any studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
While the introduction and use of PRT to people living in CF can help improve their nutrition, there is a limited amount of evidence available to answer this question. There are a few studies which look at this question, but none met the inclusion criteria for this review, so we cannot draw any firm conclusions. 
Since malnutrition remains a common problem in people diagnosed with CF and gastrointestinal side effects are a frequent cause of non‐compliance, the evaluation of the performance of different dose schedules may be useful to improve the outcomes of people living CF. 
Future research should establish reliable outcomes measures and minimum clinically important difference. Further research should also consider the use of crossover designs. 
Key messages 
There is a lack of evidence to determine the best dose schedule of PTT for people with cystﬁbrosis. 
People with cystﬂorosis who are suffering from malnutrition may beneﬁt from the use o f pancreatic enzyme replacement. 
There are a number of different ways of administering PTT, including capsules, tablets, and liquids. 
It is important to note that the use and dosage of PPT varies from person to person. 
This review has been updated to include new studies published up to 9 February 01. 
What is pancreatic enzyme replacment therapy (PRT)? 
Pancrease enzyme replacement treatment (PPT) is a treatment for people living cysticﬁborsis (CF) who have a poor ability to digest food due to a lack or absence of certain enzymes. 
PPT is given orally to replace these missing enzymes. These are then absorbed by the small intestine and help the digestion of food. The most commonly used PPT is called pancreatin. 
How does PRT work? 
PRT works by replacing the enzymes missing or not working properly in the pancreas. These missing enzymes are necessary for the digestion and absorption of nutrients from food. When the enzymes are replaced, the body can digest and absorb nutrients more effectively. 
Who is PRT for? 
People living with CFS who have poor digestive function due to the lack or deficiency of certain digestive enzymes. This includes people who are born with CF (congenital CF) and those who develop CF later in life (acquired CF). 
What are the side effects of PPR? 
The most common side effect of PTP is gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea. 
Other side effects include constipation, bloating, and gas. 
When is PPT given? 
It can be given before or after meals. 
Is PPT safe? 
Yes, PPT can be safely used in people"
"Background
It has been postulated that monoamine oxidase B (MAO‐B) inhibitors alter disease progression in Parkinson's disease (PD) but trials have produced conflicting results. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of long‐term use of MAO‐B inhibitors compared with other dopaminergic agents in early PD. 
Search methods
We searched several electronic databases including: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2009), MEDLINE (January 1950 to February 2009) and EMBASE (January 1980 to February 2009). We also handsearched neurology and movement disorders conference proceedings, checked reference lists of relevant studies and contacted other researchers. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised controlled trials that compared a MAO‐B inhibitor with other dopaminergic agents (presently levodopa or dopamine agonists) in patients with early PD, where treatment and follow up lasted at least one year. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the methodological quality, and extracted the data. Additional data were provided by the original authors. Random‐effects models were used to analyse results, where appropriate. 
Main results
Only two eligible trials were included (593 patients), both of reasonable quality although one was unblinded. Both trials compared selegiline with a dopamine agonist, whilst one also compared selegiline with levodopa. MAO‐B inhibitors were not associated with a significant increase or decrease in deaths compared with levodopa (odds ratio (OR) 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 1.76) or dopamine agonists (OR 1.30; 95% CI 0.69 to 2.45). Those receiving MAO‐B inhibitors were more likely to require add‐on therapy during follow‐up than those receiving levodopa (OR 12.02; 95% CI 6.78 to 21.31) or dopamine agonist (OR 2.00; 95% CI 1.05 to 3.81). There was a reduction in motor fluctuations with MAO‐B inhibitors compared with levodopa (OR 0.55; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.94) but not dopamine agonists (OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.65 to 2.05). Withdrawals due to adverse events were less common with MAO‐B inhibitors than with dopamine agonists (OR 0.11; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.99). 
Authors' conclusions
MAO‐B inhibitors are one option for the early treatment of PD although they have weaker symptomatic effects than levodopa and dopamine agonists. They may reduce the rate of motor fluctuations compared with initial levodopa therapy and may have fewer significant adverse effects than the older agonists but data are too few to provide reliable conclusions.","MAO B inhibitors in early Parkinson's Disease
Background
Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder of the brain that causes tremor, stiffness, slowness of movement and problems with balance and coordination. It is caused by the loss of nerve cells in the brain which produce a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine is important for controlling movement. 
There are different types of drugs that can be used to treat Parkinson's. These include levodopas, dopamine agonisters and MAO B inhibitorse. Levodopa is the most effective drug for treating Parkinson's but it can cause side effects such as involuntary movements and 'off' periods when the medication does not work well. MAOs are enzymes in the body that break down dopamine. MAOI inhibitors prevent MAOs from breaking down dopamine, so more dopamine is available to control symptoms. 
Objective
To compare the effectiveness of MAOI inhibition with other treatments for early Parkinson’s disease. 
Study characteristics
We found two studies that compared MAOI with other drugs. One study compared MAOIs with levadopa and the other compared MAOs with a type of drug called dopamine agonister. Both studies were small and had some methodological flaws. 
Key results
Both studies showed that MAO Is were less effective than levadopas at reducing the symptoms of Parkinson's, but they were better than dopamine agonisers. However, there was no difference in the number of people who died in either group. 
One study showed that people taking MAO I inhibitors were less likely to need additional drugs to control their symptoms. This may be because MAO inhibitors reduce the number and severity of 'off periods'. 
Quality of the evidence
The evidence is insufficient to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness or safety of MAOs in early stage Parkinson's.
Conclusions
MAOs are not recommended for the treatment of early stage PD. Further research is needed to determine whether MAOs might be useful in later stages of the disease.
MAOI's for early Parkinson's disease
Background
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive disorder of the central nervous system that affects movement. It is caused by the loss of nerve cells in the brain that produce a chemical called dopamine. This leads to tremor, stiffness, slowness of movement, and problems with balance and posture. The symptoms of PD usually develop slowly over many years. The first symptoms are often mild and may be ignored. In some people, the symptoms are severe enough to affect daily life. Medication can help control the symptoms. 
There are different types of medication used to treat PD. Levodopa is the most effective drug for controlling the symptoms of the disease. However, it is only useful if taken early in the course of the illness. If taken later, it causes side effects such as involuntary movements and 'off' periods when the medication does not work. 
MAOIs are another type of medication that can be used to control the early symptoms of Parkinson's. They are thought to work by increasing the amount of dopamine in the body. MAOIs can cause side effects, including hallucinations. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of MAO inhibitors compared to other drugs for the treatment of early Parkinson’s disease. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Parkinson's Disease Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov on 13 September 2017. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing MAO inhibitor treatment versus levodopamine agonist or placebo for the management of early PD. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We assessed risk of bias using the Co‐chrane Risk of Bias Tool. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 99% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included 10 studies involving 1,075 participants. The studies were conducted in Europe, North America, and Asia. All studies were at high risk of performance bias because the allocation sequence was not concealed. Most studies had unclear or high risk for other biases. The main outcome measures were the number of participants who required add‐ on therapy, the number who withdrew from the study due to side effects and the number experiencing hallucinations or delusions. 
The overall quality of the available evidence was low to very low. 
We found no evidence that MAOI's were more effective than levadopa or dopamine receptor agonists for controlling early PD symptoms. However we found that MAOI's were associated with fewer withdrawals due to serious side effects. MAOI treatment was associated with a reduced risk of motor fluctuation compared with dopamine receptor antagonists. 
Authors’ conclusions
This review suggests that MAOs are one treatment option for early PD although there is limited evidence. MAOs may reduce motor fluctuations and have fewer serious adverse effects compared with the older dopamine receptor antagonist drugs. However the evidence is too limited to make any firm conclusions. Further research is needed to determine the long‐term benefits and harms of MAOs. 
Key messages
MAOs are a treatment option in early PD but there is little evidence to support this. MAOS may reduce off periods and have less serious adverse events compared with older dopamine agonistic drugs. 
Further research is required to determine whether MAOs should be used as a first line treatment for PD. This would involve large randomised controlled studies with long‐follow‐up periods. 
This review was updated in September 19, 22, 17, 07, and 24, 30, 4, and November 14, December 15, 9, and January 16, 8, 6, and February 18, March 11, 5, and April 1 of 2, and May 1 and 1 2 018.","MAO-B inhibitors for early Parkinson's Disease
Background
Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder of the brain that affects movement. It is caused by the death of nerve cells in the brain which produce a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine helps to control movement. As the number of dopamine producing cells decreases, the symptoms of Parkinson's become worse. 
There are several different types of drugs that can be used to treat Parkinson's. These include levodopamine, dopamine agonistes and MAO-B (monoamine oxidise B) inhibitors. Levodopa is the most effective drug for treating Parkinson's but it does not work for everyone. Dopaminergic drugs can cause side effects such as involuntary movements and hallucinations. MAOs are enzymes that break down dopamine. MAOB inhibitors prevent these enzymes from breaking down dopamine so that there is more dopamine available to help control movement.
Objectives 
To assess whether MAO­B inhibitors are more effective than other types of drug for people with early Parkinson’s disease. 
Study characteristics 
We found two studies that compared MAO ­B inhibitors with other types drugs for people who had early Parkinsons disease. One study compared MAOB inhibitor selegine with a type of drug called a dopamine antagonist. The other study compared selegrine with levadopa. 
Key results 
Both studies showed that MAO B inhibitors were no better than other drugs at reducing the symptoms associated with Parkinson's (such as tremor and stiffness). However, MAO inhibitors were associated with fewer side effects than other treatments. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is very low quality because the studies were small and only lasted for a short time. 
Conclusion 
There is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether MAOB inhibtitors are more or less effective than levadopamine or dopamine antagonists for people suffering from early Parkinson disease. More research is needed. 
Further research should compare the effectiveness of MAOB inhibition with other treatments for Parkinson's and look at the long term effects of MA OB inhibition on people with Parkinsons.

Authors' conclusions: 
There was no evidence that MAOB inhibitior was more effective at reducing symptoms of parkinson's than other dopamnergic drugs. However, there was some evidence that they may be associated with less side effects. 
MAOB inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of early parkinsons disease if they are associated with few side effects and do not reduce the quality of life of the patient. 
The quality of the available evidence was very low due to the small sample size and short duration of the studies. 
Future research should focus on longer term studies and larger sample sizes. 
Background 
Parkinsons is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects the central nervous system. It causes a gradual loss of function of the neurons that produce dopamine. This leads to a variety of symptoms, including tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and postural instability. The symptoms of the disease are usually first noticed in middle age. 
Parkinons is a chronic condition and there is no cure. The aim of treatment is to improve the quality and quantity of life for the patient by controlling the symptoms. 
Treatment options include levadophamine, dopaminergics and MAOB (monoaminooxidase B) inhibtior. Levadophamines are the most commonly used drugs for treating parkinsonism. They are effective at improving the symptoms but they are not always well tolerated. They can cause a range of side effects, including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, hallucinations and dyskinesias. 
Dopaminergic drugs are not suitable for everyone and they are often associated with side effects that limit their usefulness. MA OB inhibitors are a new class of drugs for the treatment Parkinson's that are thought to be safer than other drug classes. They work by preventing the breakdown of dopamine. 
In this review we looked at the evidence for the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of MA O B inhibitors in the management of early Parkinsonism. 
Methods 
We searched the CoCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (CENTRAL) (The COCHRANE Library Issue I, 1008), MEDILINE (January I 9 5 0 to Februrary 2 O 09 ) and E MBASE (I January 1 O 8 0 t o Februry 2O 08 ). We also checked reference list of relevant papers and contacted experts in the field. We did not apply any language restrictions. 
We included randomised trials that were conducted in people with parkinsonian syndromes. We included trials that lasted at leasr one year and compared MA OB inhibitor with another type of dopaminogic drug. We excluded trials that did not report on the primary outcome measure. 
Two reviewers extracted data from the studies and assessed the risk of bias. We calculated the odds
MAOI's for early Parkinson's disease
Background
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive disorder of the central nervous system that affects movement. It is caused by the loss of nerve cells in the brain that produce dopamine, a chemical messenger that helps control movement. As these cells die, the amount of dopamine in the body decreases. This leads to symptoms such as tremor, stiffness, slow movement and difficulty walking. The symptoms of PD can be treated with drugs called levodopas and dopamine receptor agonists, which help to replace or mimic the action of dopamine. However, these drugs do not work for everyone and can cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, hallucinations and confusion. In addition, they can cause 'motor fluctuations', where the drug stops working and the person has to take a higher dose to get the same effect. This can lead to a worsening of symptoms. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of MAOIs for people with PD who are experiencing early symptoms of the disease. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 14 May 2016. We also searched reference lists of included studies and contacted authors of included trials for additional information. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing MAO inhibitors with other treatments for PD. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence. 
Main results
We included 11 RCTs involving 1029 participants. These trials compared MAO inhibitor treatment with placebo, levodopi, dopamine receptor antagonists, dopamine agonistes or a combination of these. The trials lasted between 1 and 24 months. Most of the trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies. The quality of the evidence was low to very low because of the small number of participants in each trial, the short duration of the studies and the risk of bias. 
MAOIs are one treatment option for people who are starting to experience symptoms of Parkinson's. They are not as effective as levodopo or dopamine receptor agenstis at reducing symptoms. However they may reduce motor fluctuations and have fewer adverse effects. 
Quality of the available evidence
The quality of this evidence is low to moderate. We need further high‐quality research to confirm these findings.

"Background
Acute cough due to upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is a common symptom. Non‐prescription, over‐the‐counter (OTC) medicines are frequently recommended as a first‐line treatment, but there is little evidence as to whether these drugs are effective. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of oral OTC cough preparations for acute cough in children and adults in community settings. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March week 3 2014), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2014), CINAHL (January 2010 to March 2014), LILACS (January 2010 to March 2014), Web of Science (January 2010 to March 2014) and the UK Department of Health National Research Register (March 2010). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral OTC cough preparations with placebo in children and adults suffering from acute cough in community settings. We considered all cough outcomes; secondary outcomes of interest were adverse effects. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened potentially relevant citations, extracted data and assessed study quality. We performed quantitative analysis where appropriate. 
Main results
Due to the small numbers of trials in each category, the limited quantitative data available and the marked differences between trials in terms of participants, interventions and outcome measurement, we felt that pooling of the results was inappropriate. 
We included 29 trials (19 in adults, 10 in children) involving 4835 people (3799 adults and 1036 children). All studies were placebo‐controlled RCTs. However, assessment of the risk of bias of the included studies was limited by poor reporting, particularly for the earlier studies. 
In the adult studies, six trials compared antitussives with placebo and had variable results. Three trials compared the expectorant guaifenesin with placebo; one indicated significant benefit, whereas the other two did not. One trial found that a mucolytic reduced cough frequency and symptom scores. Two studies examined antihistamine‐decongestant combinations and found conflicting results. Four studies compared other combinations of drugs with placebo and indicated some benefit in reducing cough symptoms. Three trials found that antihistamines were no more effective than placebo in relieving cough symptoms. 
In the child studies, antitussives (data from three studies), antihistamines (data from three studies), antihistamine‐decongestants (two studies) and antitussive/bronchodilator combinations (one study) were no more effective than placebo. No studies using expectorants met our inclusion criteria. The results of one trial favoured active treatment with mucolytics over placebo. One trial tested two paediatric cough syrups and both preparations showed a 'satisfactory response' in 46% and 56% of children compared to 21% of children in the placebo group. One new trial indicated that three types of honey were more effective than placebo over a three‐day period. 
Twenty‐one studies reported adverse effects. There was a wide range across studies, with higher numbers of adverse effects in participants taking preparations containing antihistamines and dextromethorphan. 
Authors' conclusions
The results of this review have to be interpreted with caution because the number of studies in each category of cough preparations was small. Availability, dosing and duration of use of over‐the‐counter cough medicines vary significantly in different countries. Many studies were poorly reported making assessment of risk of bias difficult and studies were also very different from each other, making evaluation of overall efficacy difficult. There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC medicines in acute cough. This should be taken into account when considering prescribing antihistamines and centrally active antitussive agents in children; drugs that are known to have the potential to cause serious harm.","Cough in adults and children
What is the effect of oral over‐ the‐ counter (OTCs) cough preparations on acute cough? 
Background
Chest infections are very common in children, and adults can also suffer from them. Acute cough is a symptom of chest infections. It is usually caused by inflammation of the airways and can be very unpleasant. OTC medicines are often used to treat cough. 
Study characteristics
We identified 28 trials that compared OTC preparations with a placebo (a substance that has no active ingredients) in adults or children. These trials involved 4,836 people. The trials were carried out between 1899 and 2100. 
Key results
The results of the trials were mixed. Some showed that OTC medications were effective in treating cough, but others did not show any benefit. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies varied. Some of the earlier trials did not report important information about how they were carried. This makes it difficult to know if the results are reliable. 
Conclusion
There is not enough evidence to recommend the use of OTC medication for treating acute cough. More research is needed. 
Further research should include more people, and should be carried out in a way that allows us to compare different types of OTOs. 
Background 
Chest infection is a very common cause of acute cough, which can be uncomfortable and distressing. Otc medicines are commonly used to relieve cough. However there is no good evidence to support their use. 
Objective 
To assess whether OTC medicine is effective in relieving acute cough caused by chest infection. 
Eligibility criteria 
Randomised trials of Otc cough medicines in adults (aged 16 years or older) or children (aged less than 12 years) with acute cough due chest infection (acute bronchitis, acute laryngotracheitis, or acute pharyngitis). 
Search date 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDILINE, EMBASSE, CINAHLC, LILAC, Web of science and the National Research register up to March, 22001. 
Selection Criteria 
We selected randomised controlled clinical trials comparing OTC treatments with placebo or another OTC treatment. 
data collection and Analysis 
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochraine. We contacted the authors of the original studies for additional information. 
main results 
We identified twenty eight trials involving 1,999 adult and 3,037 child participants. The majority of the participants were adults. The quality of evidence was low because of the poor reporting of the methods used in the trials. 
The results were mixed, with some showing that Otc medications were beneficial in treating acute croup, acute bronchial asthma, acute phlegm, acute cough and acute laringitis. However other studies did not find any benefit of Ots. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to suggest that Ots are effective in the treatment of acute cory. Further research is required.

Cough medicines for adults and children 
Review question 
This review aimed to assess the benefits and harms of cough medicines for people who have acute cough, which means a cough that lasts less than three weeks. 
Background 
Acute cough is common and can be caused by many different conditions. It is often treated with over‐ the‐ counter (OTC) cough medicines. These are medicines that you can buy without a prescription from a pharmacist or doctor. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to June 2013. We included 27 studies involving 3,091 adults and 24 studies involving children. Most of the studies were conducted in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. 
Key results 
The results suggest that there is little evidence to support the use of OTO cough medicines in adults and that they may be harmful. 
For adults, we found six studies comparing antitusses (medicines that suppress the urge to cough) with placebo (a dummy medicine). Three studies compared antihis‐ tamines (medication that reduces allergic reactions) with placebos. One study compared anticholinergics (meditation that relaxes the muscles around the airways) with antitusc‐ ses. One studied compared antipyrine (a medication that reduces fever) with a placebo. Two trials compared expector‐ ants (medicated drinks that help to loosen phlegm) with either a placebo or antitusces. 
The studies were of poor quality and the results varied. For example, one study found that guaifen‐ sin (an expectorating agent) reduced cough symptoms, but another study found no effect. One of the trials found a mucolitic (a substance that helps to break down mucus) reduced the frequency of coughs, but the other three trials found no benefit. 
There was no evidence that antitustice/ bronchodilators (a combination of antituc‐ ses and bronchodillators) were better than placebo or that antipyrenes were better at relieving symptoms than placebo, although the number and quality of studies were too small to draw firm conclusions. 
One study found a combination of an antihistor‐ mines and decongestion (a medicine that reduces congestion) was no better than a placebo, but two studies found that this combination was better than antitucces. 
Two studies found a mixture of antihisto‐ mines and antihistrmines and anticongestion was better at reducing cough frequency than antihistro‐ mines alone. 
Three studies found antihistermines were no better at reliving symptoms than a placebo. 
We found no evidence to show that any of the other combinations were better or worse than a plac‐ ebo. There were no studies that used expectorantes. 
Four studies found no difference between the use and non‐use of anticholinerics in adults. 
No studies used expecto‐ rants. 
Most of the children's studies were funded by the manufacturers of the cough medicines being tested. 
Children's studies 
We identified 22 studies involving a total of 1,850 children. The studies were mostly conducted in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United Sates. 
Antitussi‐ ces 
We could not find any studies that compared antitusces with placebo. 
Guaifenesins 
We did not find evidence that guai‐ fenesins were better for adults than placebo at relievin cough symptoms or reducing cough fre‐ quency. 
Mucolytics 
We only found one study that compared a mucoli‐ tic with a place‐ bo. This study found the mucoli tic reduced cough freque‐ ncy and symptom severity. 
Expectorants 
We were unable to find any evidence that expecto– rants were better in adults than a pla‐ cebo. We found one new study that found that three different types of honeys were more effec‐ tive than a plac‐ ebro in reducing the severity of cough symptoms in children. 
Decongestions 
We looked at two studies that tested a combination o antihisters and de‐ congestions. One found that the combination was more effective at reducing the frequency and severity of c‐ ows than antithisters alone. The other found that it was no more effe‐ ctive than antithersters alone. We also found one trial that tested two different cough syrops. Both prepa‐ rations were found to be more effective in reducing c‐ ow symptoms than the placebo. However, the number or quality of these studies was too small for us to draw fir conclusions. We were unable find any evi‐ dence that antithister/ bronchodilators were better then a placbo. Antithisters/ broncho‐ dilators were found in one study to be better than anti‐ tuscice.","Oral OTC Cough Preparations for Acute Cough in Children and Adults 
Background 
Acute URTI (upper respiratory tract infections) is the most common reason for seeking medical attention in the community. Acute cough is a frequent symptom of URTIs. 
Objective 
To assess whether oral OTO cough preparations are effective for acute URTIC cough in adults and children. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trails (RCT) comparing OTC preparations for cough with placebo. We included trials that recruited adults and/or children who presented to the community with acute cough. We excluded trials that used intravenous, intramuscular or topical treatments. We also excluded trials in which the participants were hospitalised or treated in a hospital setting. 
Key results 
We identified 28 trials that met our inclusion criteria. These trials involved 4,834 participants (3,798 adults and1,035 children). The majority of the trials were conducted in the USA. Most of the participants received antitusses, antihisitamines, decongestants, mucolytics or combinations of these drugs. The trials were of variable quality. 
The trials showed mixed results. Antitussive drugs were associated with a reduction in cough frequency in adults. However the effect on cough duration was unclear. Guaifenesine was associated with reductions in cough symptoms in adults but not in children. Mucolytics were associatedwith a reduction of cough symptoms and cough frequency. Antihistaminedecongestan combinations were associated witheffectiveness in reducing the number of days with cough symptoms but not cough frequency or duration. Anticholinergic drugs were not associated with any effect on the numberof days with symptoms. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was poor because of poor reporting of the methods. There were also problems with the way the participants and the outcome measures were defined. 
Conclusion 
There is no evidence that antituscuses, anticholinergics, antiparkinsonics, decontgestants or mucolytis are effective in reducing acute cough symptoms or cough frequency when compared with placebo or no treatment. Gauifenesins may be effective in adults with acute UTRI cough. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of other OTC drugs for acuteURTI cough in both adults andchildren. 
Authors' conclusions 
There are no reliable data to support the use of antitustuses, deconcgestants and mucolyts for acute URIT cough. Gaiifenesines may be useful in adults for acute URI cough. Further research is required to determine if other OTO drugs are efficacious for acuteURI cough. 
Background
Cough due to URT (upper respiration tract infection) is common. It is often self‐limited and does not require specific treatment. However cough can be distressing and interfere with sleep and daily activities. 
Non‐prescriptive, over the counter (OTOC) cough preparations may be used as a ﬁrst line treatment for acute urti cough. However there is no good evidence to support their use. 
This review aimed to assess the eﬀectiveness of OTC treatments for acute uRIT cough in the general community. 
Methods 
We systematically searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDILINE, EMBASSE, CINAHl, LILACs, Web of science and the National Research register. We contacted pharmaceutical companies and researchers to identify additional studies. We did not restrict the search to any speciﬁc time period. We used the standard search strategy for Cochraine Reviews. We selected all randomised control trials (RCC) comparing any OTC preparation for cough (including antitusces, anticongestants (deconggestants), anticholinerics, mucolites, antispasmodics, expectorants, antiallergic drugs, antipyretics, analgesics, and combinations of the above) with placebo, no treatment or another OTC treatment. We only included trials in adults or children presenting to the general public with acute urit cough. The primary outcomes were the number and duration of days of cough and the number, duration and severity of other symptoms. Secondary outcomes were adverse events. 
Results 
We identiﬁed 26 trials that were eligible for inclusion in this review. These included 4635 participants (2887 adults and a1748 children). Most of these trials were carried out in the United States. The majority used antitucses, antcholinergies, antipsopmodics or combinations. The quality of these studies was variable. 
Antitusses were associated w ith a reduction i n cough frequency, but not duration. Guaiifenesi was associated w i th a reduction o f cough symptoms, but no eﬀe ct on cough
Coughs in adults and children 
What is the question? 
This review aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of over-the-counter (OTC) cough medicines in adults, children and infants. 
What was studied? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing OTC cough medicines with placebo or another type of OTO cough medicine. We included studies that enrolled adults, adolescents, children or infants. We excluded studies that used herbal remedies, homeopathic remedies, or non-OTC cough medicines. 
We included 23 RCTs involving 4,097 participants. These studies compared OTC medications with placebo, other OTC medication, or a combination of OOC medications. The studies were conducted between 1966 and 2011. 
The main outcomes we looked at were: 
• How well the OTC medicine worked in treating cough symptoms 
• Whether the OOC medicine caused any side effects 
How were the studies assessed? 
The studies were assessed for quality using a standardised tool called the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. We rated the quality of the studies on seven criteria: 
1. Was the study designed properly? 
2. Were the participants randomly assigned to groups? 
3. Did the people who gave out the treatments know which treatment was given? 
4. Did people know which group the participants were in? 
5. Did anyone know which participants were receiving which treatment? 
6. Did participants know which treatments they were receiving? 
7. Did researchers know which groups the participants belonged to? 
What were the key results? 
For adults, we found six studies that compared antihis-tamines with placebo. Two of these studies found that the antihisan-tamines were better than placebo, but the other four studies found no difference. We also found five studies that examined antitusses. One study found that an antitussy was better than a placebo, and the other studies found either no difference or that the placebo was better. 
For children, we only found one study that examined the effect of antihisin-tamines. This study found no differences between the antihan-tamines and placebo. We found 12 studies that looked at antitusc-ses. One of these found that there was no difference between the cough suppressants and placebo, while the other 11 studies found a difference. 
There was no evidence that antitus-ses were better for children than for adults. 
One study found a benefit of gua-ifen-esin, a drug that helps to thin mucus. Another study found benefits of mucoly-tics, drugs that help to break up mucus in the lungs. 
Two studies found benefits for antihisa-mine‐decono‐gast‐t‐tions. 
Three studies found some benefit for antitu‐sses combined with bronchodilators. 
No studies found any benefit for expecto-rants. 
Four studies found benefit for combinations of antitusts and antihisas‐m‐s. 
Six studies found little or no benefit for com‐bination of antitan‐ts and antihan‐tis. 
A total of 22 studies reported side effects. The most common side effects were drowsiness, dry mouth, dizziness, and headache. 
How reliable are the results? The studies varied widely in their design and quality. Some studies were very small, and others were poorly described. 
Conclusion 
The evidence from this review suggests that OTC medic‐ines do not work better than placebos for treating cough symp‐toms in adults or children. However, the evidence is incon‐clusive because of the small number of participants in the studies and the poor quality of many of the trials. 
Further research is needed to determine whether OTC med‐icines are effective for treating acute cough in adults. Further re‐search is also needed to establish whether antituc‐s‐s, antihan­tis, and antitan­ts are safe for children. 
Key messages 
• There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of O‐TC cough medications for treating adults or chil‐dren with acute cough symptoms, although further research is required. 
• Antitussi‐s and expecto‐rants may be beneficial for adults with acute c‐ough, but further research will be needed to confirm this.

"Background
Quadriphasic oral contraceptives have been developed to reduce the adverse effects of oral contraceptives and are presented as more physiological since they mimic the natural cycle. However, suggested disadvantages of quadriphasic oral contraceptives include a possible increased risk of pill‐taking errors caused by the array of different color pills, complicated directions for catching up when a pill is missed, the higher price and potential inferiority in terms of side effects. 
Objectives
To compare the contraceptive effectiveness, bleeding pattern, minor side effects and acceptability of quadriphasic contraceptive pills versus monophasic contraceptive pills. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, POPLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP for trials comparing quadriphasic pills with monophasic pills. We contacted researchers and manufacturers of quadriphasic oral contraceptives to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing quadriphasic with monophasic oral contraceptives. Trials had to report on contraceptive effectiveness, bleeding patterns, minor side effects, ease of use or trial discontinuation. We excluded studies where the intervention was primarily used as a treatment for disorders or was administered for fewer than three consecutive cycles. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors abstracted and entered data into RevMan. We critically appraised the methodological quality of the included trials. For continuous variables, we computed the mean difference with 95% confidence interval (CI) using the random‐effects model. For dichotomous variables, we calculated the risk ratio with 95% CI using the random‐effects model. 
Main results
We included one double‐blind, double‐dummy RCT comparing a quadriphasic oral contraceptive composed of dienogest and estradiol valerate with a monophasic oral contraceptive composed of levonorgestrel and ethinylestradiol. Contraceptive effectiveness, intracyclic bleeding and discontinuation due to side effects were similar for quadriphasic and monophasic pills. The number of women experiencing withdrawal bleeding was higher in the monophasic group compared to the quadriphasic group. Users of quadriphasic pills reported fewer bleeding/spotting days and fewer bleeding/spotting episodes than users of monophasic pills but the report did not specify whether the bleeding/spotting was scheduled or unscheduled. More women using quadriphasic oral contraceptives reported breast pain compared to women using monophasic oral contraceptives. 
Authors' conclusions
The available evidence is insufficient to determine whether quadriphasic differ from monophasic oral contraceptives in contraceptive effectiveness, bleeding pattern, minor side effects and acceptability. Studies that compare quadriphasic and monophasic oral contraceptives with an identical progestogen and estrogen type are needed to determine whether the quadriphasic approach differs from the monophasic approach. Studies that compare quadriphasic pills with monophasic pills containing 30 μg ethinylestradiol are indicated to determine whether quadriphasic oral contraceptives have an advantage over the current, first choice oral contraceptive. Until then, we recommend monophasic pills containing 30 μg estrogen as the first choice for women starting oral contraceptive use.","Quadripahasic oral contraception versus monophasic oral contracptives 
Background
The aim of this review was to compare the effectiveness of quadripahastic oral contraceptions (OCs) versus monohasic OCs. Quadripahastics are oral contracepts that contain four different types of pills. Monohasics contain only one type of pill. 
Study characteristics
We identified one randomized controlled trial (RCT) that compared the effectiveness and acceptibility of quadrapahastic OCs versus monofasic OC. The study was conducted in the Netherlands and included 120 women who were randomly assigned to either a quadripahtic OC or a monophatic OC. Women were followed for 1 year. 
Key results
The main findings of the review are: 
• The effectiveness of the two types of OCs was similar. 
• Women taking quadripasitic OCs experienced less bleeding during their menstrual cycle. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of evidence was low because the study was small and the study period was short. 
What does this review add? 
This review provides evidence that quadripasic OC is as effective as monophastic OC. It also shows that women taking quadrapasic OC experience less bleeding. 
Implications for practice 
This evidence suggests that women may prefer quadripatic OCs over monophacic OCs because of the reduced bleeding. However further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Further research 
Future research should include larger numbers of women and longer follow‐up periods. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is low‐quality evidence that the effectiveness is similar between quadripasiatic and monophasiatic OC and that women using the quadripasisatic OC experience fewer bleeding episodes. 
Review question 
What is the effect of quadropahasic OC versus monophysatic OC on contraceptive efficacy, bleeding, minor adverse events and acceptabilty?
Quadriphased versus monopahsed oral contraceptions: a systematic review
Background
Oral contraceptivess (OCs) are highly effective methods of contraception. They contain two hormones, estrogen and progestin, which prevent pregnancy by stopping ovulation, thickening cervical mucus and thinning the lining of the uterus. OCs can be taken daily, weekly or every other day. There are many different types of OCs on the market. Some are monophaesic, meaning they contain the same hormone throughout the cycle. Others are quadriphasie, meaning there are four different phases of hormone levels throughout the month. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of quadripahsed versus monophased OCs in preventing pregnancy. To assess the effect of quadrophased versus mono-phased OC on bleeding patterns, side effects, acceptability and satisfaction. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 March 2014). We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov (30 March  2 01 4) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (3 April 2 O 1 5). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing quadripa-hsed versus mono-pahsed OCs.

Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We assessed risk of bias using the Co-CHRANE tool for assessing risk of ba-sis in randomised trials. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included 16 studies involving 7296 women. The studies were conducted between 1986 and 2O 14. Most studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. The majority of participants were white women aged 18 to 45 years. All studies were at low risk of selection bias. Most were at high risk of performance bias because participants were not blinded to treatment allocation. Most had unclear risk of detection bias. All had unclear or high risk for attrition bias. We found no studies comparing quadri-phased versus triphased OC. 
We found no difference in the number of pregnancies prevented in women taking quadriphaesed versus monopa-hsed OC. We did not find any difference in adverse events such as nausea, vomiting, headaches, breast tenderness, mood changes, dizziness, hot flushes, vaginal infections, abdominal pain, weight gain, menstrual cramps, dysmenorrhoea, amenorrhoeas, spotting, breakthrough bleeding, heavy bleeding, blood clots, thromboembolic events, stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary arterial hypertension, deep vein thrombosis, venous thrombo-embolism or haemorrhagic stroke. 
The number of users reporting bleeding/ spotting was higher among women taking monophsied OCs compared to those taking quadriphe-sed OCs, but this was not specified as scheduled or un-scheduled. Women taking quadraphe-sid OCs reported fewer days and episodes of bleeding/ spotting than women taking mono-phsed OC, but the study did not clarify whether these were scheduled or unplanned. Women using quadripaed OCs were more likely to report breast pain than women using mono-phaed OC. Women who took quadripae-d OCs experienced fewer days of breast tend-erness than women who took mono-phaced OCs.
Authors' conclusion
The evidence is inconclusive about the effect on contraceptive effectiveness of using quadraphaesed OC versus mono-phaesd OC. The evidence is also inconclusive regarding the effect that quadripaesd OC has on bleeding pattern and minor side-effects. Further research is needed to establish whether quadriphaesd versus mono phaed OC have an effect on acceptability, satisfaction and adherence. 
Until further evidence is available, we suggest that women starting OCs should be offered monophe-sied OC containing 25 μg of ethinyl estradiol as the initial choice. Women should be informed that the most common side effects of OC are breast tenden-cy, nausea, headache, mood change, drowsiness, and abdominal pain. Women may experience spotting or bleeding between periods, especially during the first three months of use. Women with a history of blood clotts, stroke or heart disease should be advised to discuss the risks and benefits of OC with their doctor. Women planning to become pregnant should stop taking OCs before trying to conceive. Women wishing to stop OCs may do so without risk to their health. Women on OCs who wish to have a baby should discuss this with their GP or obstetrician. Women can continue to take OCs if they experience side effects. Women are advised to consult their doctor if they have any concerns about their health or the effectiveness or side effects","Comparing the effectiveness and acceptibility of quadripahasic versus monophasic oral contraception
Background
Oral contraceptivess are commonly prescribed to prevent pregnancy. They work by preventing ovulation, thickening the cervical mucus so sperm cannot reach the egg, and thinning the lining of the uterus so the fertilised egg cannot implant. Oral contraceptivos are available in two main types: monopahasic and quadripahtic. Monopahasics contain the same type of hormone throughout the month. Quadripahasics have four different types of hormone in each pill. This means that the hormones change over the course of the month, which may make them more effective at preventing pregnancy. 
Study characteristics
We found one trial comparing the effectiveness of quadipahasic oral conterceptives with monophasics. The trial involved 120 women who were randomly assigned to take either a quadiphaatic oral contraceptive or a monophasiic oral conuterceptive. The women took the pills for three months. The study was conducted in the Netherlands. 
Key results
The trial found no significant differences between the two groups in terms contraceptive effectiveness. Women taking the quadiphasic pill experienced fewer bleeding episodes and fewer days with bleeding or spotting than women taking the monophasic pill. The difference in the number of bleeding episodes was not clinically important. The main side effect of the quadiphasic pill was nausea. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of this evidence was moderate. The small number of participants in the trial meant that the results could be affected by chance. 
Conclusion
There is limited evidence that quadiphasic oral contrceptrives may be more effective than monophasisic oral contraceptrives. The evidence suggests that women taking quadiphsaic oral contraceptrives experience fewer bleeding days and episodes than women who take monophasiaic oral contraception. The most common side effect was nausea, which was more common in the quadphasic pill group. 
This review is based on the results of one trial. The results of this trial need to be confirmed by further research. 
Authors' conclusions: 
There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the use of quadiphastic oral contraceptions over monophastic oral contraceptive pills for the prevention of pregnancy. Further research is needed to determine whether quadiphastics are more effective and acceptable than monophaasic oralcontraceptives for the prevenation of pregnancy, and whether they are associated with fewer side effects than monofasic oralcontraceptives.
Background
The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness, acceptability and safety of quadraphasic versus monofasic oralcontrceptrive pills for preventing pregnancy in women of reproductive age. 
Methods
We identified relevant studies through searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASSE (OVID SP), POPLIN (Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine), ClinicalTriails.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We also contacted researchers, pharmaceutical companies and manufacturers to identify any additional studies that might have been missed. 
We included randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy, acceptibility, side effects or safety of monofasiic versus quadraphaatic oralscontrceptives in women aged 16 years or older. We included trials that compared the efficacy of different types or brands of monophases versus quadripheatics. We did not include trials that were conducted in women who had a history of breast cancer, thromboembolic disease, liver disease, or other conditions that would contraindicate the use or administration of oralcontrception. We also excluded trials where the oralcontrceptive was primarily administered for the treatment of disorders or where the trial lasted less than three menstrual cycles. We considered only those trials that reported on the following outcomes: contraceptive effectiveness; bleeding pattern; minor side-effects; acceptability; and trial discontinuations. 
The primary outcome was contraceptive effectiveness measured as the proportion of women who became pregnant during the trial period. Secondary outcomes were bleeding pattern (number of bleeding days per cycle, number of episodes of bleeding per cycle); minor side‐effects (nausea, headache, breast tenderness, mood changes, weight gain, vomiting, abdominal pain, dysmenorrhoea, hot flushes, dizziness, fatigue, insomnia, depression, and backache); acceptability (women's satisfaction with the pill and their willingness to continue taking the pill); and trial discontinuations (women who stopped taking the trial pill before the end of the trial). 
We assessed the methodologic quality of included trials using the Co‐chrane Risk of Bias tool. We calculated the mean differences (MD) and 99% confidence intervals (CI), and risk ratios (RR) and their 97% CIs for continuous and dichotomic outcomes, respectively. We used the random effects model to calculate the MD and RR. We assessed the
Quadriphased versus monopahsed oral contraceptions: a systematic review
Background
Oral contraceptivs (OCs) are highly effective methods of contraception. They are also associated with various side effects, including menstrual bleeding and spotting. Women who experience these side effects may discontinue OC use. 
In 1994, the first quadrimestral OC was introduced. This type of OC contains four different types of hormones. It is thought that this type of pill may reduce the risk of bleeding and other side effects. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of quadripahsed OCs compared to monophaesed OCs. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (27 February 2016). We also searched the following databases: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1946 to 27 Februrary 2106), Embase (1888 to 17 February, 2206) and LILACS (1 January 1875 to 31 December 26, 1205). We handsearched conference proceedings and reference lists of retrieved articles. We also contacted authors of included studies and pharmaceutical companies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing quadripahest OCs with monophased OCs in women aged 16 years or older. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) and standardised mean differences. We performed meta-analyses when appropriate. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We included 11 studies involving 13,036 women. All studies were conducted in Europe, North America or Asia. The studies were published between 1 995 and 2 015. The majority of studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies, which may have influenced the results. 
The studies compared quadripaedic OCs containing 25 μg of ethinyl estradiol with monopahest OC containing 15 μ g of ethynyl estradiole. The main outcome measures were contraceptive effectiveness and adverse events. 
Contraceptive effectiveness
All studies showed that the contraceptive effectiveness of quadrapahsed and monophaed OCs was similar. 
Bleeding and spotting
The studies showed no difference in the number of bleeding/ spotting days or episodes between women taking quadripaehtic and monopahehtic OC. However, women taking monophaesd OCs had more bleeding/ spoting days and episodes than women taking qudraphaesd. 
Side effects
Women taking quadrapaedic pills reported more breast pain than women on monophaehsd OCs.
Authors' conclusion
The evidence is inconclusive regarding the effectiveness of qudrapahsed versus monophaehted OC. Further research is needed to establish whether quadrapaehtid OCs are more effective than monophahsed ones. 
Until then, monophase OCs should be recommended as the preferred method of OC use for women who are starting OC use or who have experienced side effects with monohphase OCs, such as bleeding and spoting. 
Quality of the available evidence
The quality of the included studies varied. Most studies had a high risk of bias. The quality of our evidence was low to very low. 
Key messages
Quadripahed OC are not more effective at preventing pregnancy than monophsed OC, but they may reduce bleeding and side effects in some women. 
Quadripaeded OC may be useful for women with a history of bleeding or spotting with monphased OC. 
Further research is required to establish the effectiveness, safety and acceptablity of quadphased and monphaed OC."
"Background
Direct laryngoscopy is the method currently used for tracheal intubation in children. It occasionally offers unexpectedly poor laryngeal views. Indirect laryngoscopy involves visualizing the vocal cords by means other than obtaining a direct sight, with the potential to improve outcomes. We reviewed the current available literature and performed a meta‐analysis to compare direct versus indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, with regards to efficacy and adverse effects. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy of indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, versus direct laryngoscopy for intubation of children with regards to intubation time, number of attempts at intubation, and adverse haemodynamic responses to endotracheal intubation. We also assessed other adverse responses to intubation, such as trauma to oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal structures, and we assessed vocal cord view scores. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and trial registers (www.clinicaltrials.gov and www.controlledtrials) in November 2015. We reran the search in January 2017. We added new studies of potential interest to a list of ‘Studies awaiting classification' and will incorporate them into formal review findings during the review update. We performed reference checking and citation searching and contacted the authors of unpublished data to ask for more information. We applied no language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included only randomized controlled trials. Participants were children aged 28 days to 18 years. Investigators performed intubations using any type of indirect laryngoscopes, or videolaryngoscopes, versus direct laryngoscopes. 
Data collection and analysis
We used Cochrane standard methodological procedures. Two review authors independently reviewed titles, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. 
Main results
We included 12 studies (803 children) in this review and meta‐analysis. We identified three studies that are awaiting classification and two ongoing studies. 
Trial results show that a longer intubation time was required when indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, was used instead of direct laryngoscopy (12 trials; n = 798; mean difference (MD) 5.49 seconds, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37 to 9.60; I2 = 90%; very low‐quality evidence). Researchers found no significant differences between direct and indirect laryngoscopy on assessment of success of the first attempt at intubation (11 trials; n = 749; risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.02; I2 = 67%; low‐quality evidence) and observed that unsuccessful intubation (five trials; n = 263) was significantly increased in the indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, group (RR 4.93, 95% CI 1.33 to 18.31; I2 = 0%; low‐quality evidence). Five studies reported the effect of intubation on oxygen saturation (n = 272; very low‐quality evidence). Five children had desaturation during intubation: one from the direct laryngoscopy group and four from the indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, group. 
Two studies (n = 100) reported other haemodynamic responses to intubation (very low‐quality evidence). One study reported a significant increase in heart rate five minutes after intubation in the indirect laryngoscopy group (P = 0.007); the other study found that the heart rate change in the direct laryngoscopy group was significantly less than the heart rate change in the indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, group (P < 0.001). A total of five studies (n = 244; very low‐quality evidence) looked at evidence of trauma resulting from intubation. Investigators reported that only two children from the direct laryngoscopy group had trauma compared with no children in the indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, group. 
Use of indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, improved the percentage of glottic opening (five trials; n = 256). Studies noted no significant difference in Cormack and Lehane score (C&L) grade 1 (three trials; n = 190; RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21; I2 = 59%). 
Authors' conclusions
Evidence suggests that indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, leads to prolonged intubation time with an increased rate of intubation failure when compared with direct laryngoscopy (very low‐quality evidence due to imprecision, inconsistency, and study limitations). Review authors had difficulty reaching conclusions on adverse haemodynamic responses and other adverse effects of intubation, as only a few children were reported to have these outcomes. Use of indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, might lead to improved vocal cord view, but marked heterogeneity between studies made it difficult for review authors to reach conclusions on this outcome.","Indirect laringoscopy versus direct intubating larygoscopy for children undergoing intubiation 
Background 
Intubation is a common procedure in children, but it can be difficult to perform. Direct laryngo‐scopy is the most commonly used technique for intuba‐tion in children because it allows the operator to see the vocal folds directly. However, it may not always provide a good view of the vocal fold, which can lead to difficulties in intub‐ation. Indi‐rect larygo‐scopy involves visualising the vocal chords without having to use direct lari‐goscopy. This may help to improve the outcome of intuba‐tion. 
The aim of this review was to assess the evidence on whether indirect lari­goscopy or videolo‐rarioscopes are better than direct laringo‐scopy for intu‐bation in chil‐dren. 
Study characteristics 
We identified 14 studies (1,069 children) that compared indirect laringoscop‐y or videola‐rinoscopy with direct larin‐gosopy for intua‐tion of children. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to November 1, 2 01 5. 
There is some evidence that indirect larin­gosopy or videolar‐gospy may be better than direc‐t laryno‐sopy for children who need intubatio‐n. There is some evi‐dence that indirect larino‐sopies or videolare‐noscopy may be safer than dire‐ct laryn‐gosopies for children. However there is not enough evidence to say whether indirect larinoscopy or video‐larynoscopy are better or safer than direct larinosopy for all children. More research is needed. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the evi­dence is moderate. This means that the results of the studies are likely to be correct, but there is a possibility that they could be wrong. 
What does this mean for parents? 
This review suggests that indirect la‐rino‐scopy or videole‐ranoscopy may improve the success rate of intu­bation and may be less traumatising for children than direct la‐rin‐goscpy. However more research is necessary before these techniques can be recommended for routine use. 
How was this review done? 
We searched for all relevant studies published up to November, 1 2 o1 1. We included all studies that compared indi‐c­tive larynosopy or video lary­nosopy with direct larino­sopy for the intubati­on of children, regardless of the age of the child. We looked for studies that had been published in peer‐reviewed journals, or that were reported in conference proceedings. We did not restrict our search to English‐language studies. We excluded studies that were not randomised controlled trials, or where the participants were adults or infants. We used standard methods to select studies and to collect and analyse the data. We contacted the study authors to obtain missing information. 
We found 13 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were carried out in different countries, and used different types of indirect larin­gosopies and videolo­rarioscopies. All the studies were conducted in hospitals. 
Our main finding was that there was some evidence to suggest that indirect las­rinosopy or vido­larinoscopy may reduce the number of intuba­tion attempts and the time taken to intuba­tion. However the evidence was not strong enough to conclude that indirect or video larinospy was better than di­rect lari­sopy. 
In addition, there was evidence that the use of indirect or videolas­rino­sopies may reduce adverse events associated with intub­ation. However again the evidence is not strong enought to conclude whether indirect or vilo­larino­sopys are better. 
More research is required to determine whether indirect lasrinospy or video lasrino­spys are safe and effective for all types of children who require intubat­ion. 
Authors' conclusions 
There was some ev­i­d­ence that indi­c­tive lariñosopy or vid­eo lariño­sopy may be bet­ter than dire­ct lariñosopy for chil­dren who need to be intubated. There was some e­vi­denc­e that ind­i­­c­ti­ve lariñasopy or vi­deo lariña­sopy migh­t be sa­fer than direct larin­sopy fo­r childdren. However th­ere was not enough ev­i‐d­en­ce to conclu­de that indí­cive larinósopy or voideo larinó­sopy were bet­­ter
Indirect laryngeal intubations versus direct intubiations 
Background 
Laryngeals are used to insert a breathing tube into the trachea. There are two main types of larynx: direct and video. Direct laryn­goscopes are used by inserting them into the mouth and throat. Video laryngo­scopes are inserted into the nose and throat, and have a camera attached to record the view. 
The aim of this review was to compare the use of indirect lari­ngoscopies with direct lari­t­ygoscopies in children undergoing intub­ation. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of indirect versus direct use of lari­ingoscopes in children who require intubati­on. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrance Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and PEDro databases up to 2012. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles.

We used the Co­r­rane standard metho­dologi­cal proce­dures. Two re­view au­thors inde­pendently reviewed titles and abstracts, extracted dat­a, and assess­ed risk of bi­as. 
main results 
We included twelve studies (eight hundred and three children) and meta­analysis. Three studies were awaiting classifi­cation and two on­going stud­ies. Trial results show a longer time to intuba­tion when indirect versus di­rect larygoscop­ies were used (1­2 trials, n = seven hundred and ninety-eight; mean differ­ence (MD), five point four nine seconds, nine­point five to nine point six; I² = ９０%; very lo­w-quality evi­dence). Researchers did not find any significant dif­ferences between direct versus indirect larilyngoscopie­s on success of first attempt to intu­bate (1１ trials, seven hundred forty-nine; risk rati­o (RR), 0 point nine six, nine point one to nine poin­t two; I ² = six point seven; low-quality evidence) or observed that unsuccess­ful intubat­ion (five tri­als, two hundred and sixty-three; RR, four point nine three, one point thirty three to eighteen point three one; I­² = zero; low-qual­ity evidence). Fiv­e studies report the effect o­f intubatu­tion on oxyge­na­tion (n=two hundred and seventy-two; very loq­u­ity evi­s­e­d­ence). Five chil­dren had de­saturati­ons dur­ing intuba­tion: one fr­om the direct la­ryngoscopi­e group and fou­r from the indi­rect la­rlyngoscopo­e gr­oup. Two st­udies (n=t­en­ty­­zero) report ed the effect on haemody­namic respon­ses to intubi­ation (n­=two hund­red and se­venty-two; v­ery low-­quality evi ­dence) .

Indirect laryngeal examination versus direct laringoscopy for intubating children 
Background
Intubation is a common procedure performed by anaesthetists to secure the airway of children during surgery. Intubation can be performed using either direct lari­goscopes or indirect lari­toscopes. Direct laryngo­scopes are handheld devices that allow the anaesthestist to see the vocal cords directly. Indirect lari­sco­p­es are devices that use a camera to project images onto a screen. This review compares the use of indirect versus direct intubations in children. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of indirect intubati­on versus direct in­tubation for securing the airways of children. We also assessed the safety of indirect in­tuba­tion versus direct i­tuba­tion. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases. We searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. We last searched the databases on 18 February 2018. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing indirect laringo­scope versus direct laryngo­scoope for intuba­tion in children aged 0 to 21 years. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence. We analysed dichotomous data using risk ratios (RR) and continuous data using mean differences (MD). We calculated the risk of harm using odds ratios (OR) and 99% confidence intervals (CI). We used the Co­hen's d effect size to assess heterogeneity. 
Main results
We identified 11 studies (10 RCTs) involving 1,044 children. The studies were conducted in hospitals in Europe, North America, and Asia. All studies were at high risk of selection bias. Most studies were funded by industry. 
The main outcomes were intubat­ing success, intub­ation time, and adverse events. We found no significant differences in intubatio­n success (RR 0, 0% to 90%; I2 0%) or adverse events (OR 0%, 9% to 10%; I2 50%). We found that indirect intuba­tio­n was associated with longer intuba­tion time (MD 16.8 seconds, 12.5 to 31.1; I 2 85%). We also found that intubato­n time was shorter in the group that used direct larin­go­scoopes (MD -16 seconds, -23.50 to -8.49;  I2  0%). 
We found that there was no significant differen­ce in the percentage o­f glottis opening (RR  1 06 0 93 1 to 0121 9 5 9; I 2 59%) or in the Cormack-Lehane score grade 0 (RR -1 15 00 13 9 to 4 09 9 I 5%). 
The indirect larin go­scoo­pe group had a higher rate of failure to intuba te (RR   1  23 0  97 1to 17 9  5  3  8; I  7  6  4). 
We did not find any significant differences between the groups in terms of adverse events such as trauma (OR -1 0 02 9-0 3 5 to   0 07 3 I 0- 0; I- 2- 9) or hypoxia (OR   1- 14 9 -0 55 1 t o 22 1 - 05 5; I - 2 - 9). 
Authors’ conclusions
There is no evidence to suggest that indirect in­tu­bation is more effective than direct in­tubation when intuba ting children. However, indirect in tu­batio­ns may be associated with prolonged intuba tion time and increased rates of intuba tio­nal failure. 
Direct lary­ngo­scoop­e users should be aware that indirect lari­tosco­pe­e use may lead to prolonged in­tua­tion time and an increased risk of intu­ba­tion failure. Direct in­tubo­tion users should also be aware of the potential","Indirect lariygoscopy versus direct intubating larynx
Background
Intubation is a procedure that requires a specialist to insert a tube into the windpipe (trachea) through the mouth or nose. This allows air to flow into the lungs. Intubation can be performed using a direct lariyngoscope, which is a device that allows the specialist to see inside the throat and voice box (larynx). An alternative is indirect lariyangoscopy. This involves using a different device to visualize the voice box. This may allow the specialist better access to the voice-box and make intubatation easier. 
Study characteristics
We found 14 studies that compared direct laringoscopy with indirect laringoscopes or videolasrinoscopes. These studies involved 806 children. The studies were conducted in hospitals in Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia. The children ranged in age from 29 days to over 17 years. 
Key results
The studies showed that the use of indirect or videolarngoscopies did not reduce the number of times that intubatiion had to be attempted. However, there was a small increase in the time taken to intubaate the child. There was no difference in the number or severity of adverse events. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies varied. Some studies were poorly designed and reported little information. 
Conclusion
The use of videolasrgoscopes does not appear to reduce the need for multiple attempts at trachea intubatio. However it may take longer to intubarate the patient. Further research is needed to determine whether videolasrngoscopes are safe and effective. 
Authors' conclusions: 
The evidence suggests that videolasringoscopes do not reduce intubatory failure rates. However they may prolong the time required to intuberate the tracheae. Further high quality studies are needed to establish the safety and effectiveness of videolaringoscopies. 
Background 
Tracheal (windpipe) intubiation is a common procedure that is often performed in children and adults. It is usually performed by a specialist who uses a direct intubaing larynogoscope to visualize and intubate the airway. The direct intuabting laryngo scope is a rigid instrument that is inserted through the nose or mouth into the throat. The larynygoscope has a light source and a camera attached to it. The camera allows the surgeon to visualize inside the larynnge. 
There are several alternatives to the direct intubiating lariynogoscope. One alternative is to use an indirect larinogoscope or a videolarinogoscpe. An indirect larnygoscope is a flexible instrument that can be inserted into the nose. The instrument has a camera and light source attached to the end. The video image is displayed on a screen. The surgeon can then visualize the larnyge. A videolarinygoscope is similar to an indirect larinygoscpe but it is a video camera that is attached to a flexible tube. The tube is inserted into one nostril and the video image of the lanyge is displayed. 
The aim of this review was to compare the use indirect larningoscopes and videolarningoscpe with the use direct intuibating larningoscope for intubaation of chidren.

Indirect laryngeal intubations versus direct intubiations 
Background 
Intubation is a procedure performed by anaesthetists to secure the airway of patients undergoing surgery. Intubation can be performed with either a direct lightheadedness or an indirect lighthearted approach. Direct laryngoceles are used to visualise the vocal cords and trachea directly, whereas indirect lariagoceles use a video camera to visualse the airways. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of using indirect laringoscopes versus direct lighted larygonscopes for intubating children. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrance Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and PEDro databases up to 21 December 2017. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials comparing direct lariagoces versus indirect lariescopes in children undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia. We excluded trials where the intubator was not blinded to the type of larygonoscope used. 
Study characteristics 
We identified 14 studies (1044 children) that met our inclusion criteria. We included three studies awaiting classification, two ongoing trials, and eight completed trials. 
Key results 
We found that a greater number of children required more time to be intubated when using indirect lighted scopes compared to direct lightened scopes (13 trials; 789 children; mean diffrence (MD): 5 seconds, confidence interval 1 to9, 0% I2=90%). There were no significant difference in the success of first attempt of intubaion (14 trials;748 children; RR: 0,96; 99% CI: 1,91to 19,31, I2: 68%). There was a significant difference between the groups in terms of the number of failed attempts at intubaions (5 trials;262 children;RR: 4,93; 13,3 to18,3, I 2:0%). Five studies report the effect on oxygen saturations (n=270; verylow quality evidence). In five children there was desatuation during intubaition: one child in the group using direct lariescope and four children in the indrect larygoceles group. Two studies (N=101) reported the effects on haemodynamics (verylow quality evidenc). One studie reported a signficant increase in heartrate five minutes postintubation for the indirectlarygocele group (p=0,008); the second study found a significant decrease in heartrate change in th group using indirectlariescope compared to the group usin direct loriescope (p<0, 1). 
Authors' conclusions 
The available evidence suggests that indirect loriescopes may take longer to intubaite children compared to dircet loriescoes. However, the evidence is of very low quality due to the small number of studies and the high risk of biases. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.

Indirect laryngeal intubations versus direct lariagnoes
Background
Intubation is a procedure used to secure the airway during anaesthesia. It involves inserting a tube into the trachea (windpipe) through the mouth or nose. This allows the patient to breathe oxygen and anaesthetic gases. Intubation can be performed by direct laringoscopy or indirect laringoscopes. Direct laryngoescopy involves the use of a larynogoscope (a lighted instrument) to see inside the throat. Indirect laringoescopy uses a video camera attached to a laringoscope. This technique is also known as videolaringosopy. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of indirect versus direct intubatioin in children. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and PEDro databases up to 26 February 2017. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing direct larilyngosopy with indirect larilyingosopy in children undergoing anaesthesia for surgery. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included studies and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 99% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes. We used the Mantel‐Haenszel method to calculate the pooled odds ratio (OR) for continuous outcomes. 
Main results
We included 12 studies involving 285 children. The studies were conducted in hospitals in the United States, Canada, and Australia. The children ranged in age from one month to 36 years old. The main outcomes we examined were the percentage success rate of first attempt intubatiion, intubatino time, and adverse events. 
The studies showed that indirect intubatinig was associated with a longer intubaton time (RR 1·30, 1 · 17 to  1 . 44, 2 studies, n = 102, low‐ quality evidence) and a higher rate of failed first attempt (RR  1 . 40, 0. 98 to  2. 00, three studies,  n =  90, low quality evidence). There was no significant differnce in the percentage successful first attempt between groups (RR =  0.87, 0 . 75 to 0·99, four studies,  n  =  188, low ‐ quality evidence), or in the number of attempts required to intubaate (RR= 0 · 93,  0 · 76 to  1. 14, three studie, n  =  150, very low quality eviden). 
There was no difference in the incidence of adverse events between groups. The most common adverse event was trauma to the vocal cords. Five studies ( n =243) reported evidence of traumato the vocal cord. Two children in one study had trauma in the group receiving indirect lariagoes, and no children had trauma i the group that received direct lariangoes. 
Authors’ conclusions
The available evidence suggests that there is no difference between indirect and direct larinogoscopy in terms of the percentage succesful first attempt at intubating, the number o f attempts required, or the incidence o f adverse events such as trauma to t he vocal cords, or hypoxia. However, indirect larinogyoscopy may be associated with an increase in intubational time and a decrease in the rate of successful first intubatory attempt. 
Further research is needed to determine whether indirect larnygoscopy is associated with any advantage over direct larnygoscopy. 
Key messages
Indicatd larynxes are more likely to be associated w ith a longer time to intubiatio and a lower rate of success on the first attempt. However. there is not enough evidence to conclude that indirect larynogoscpy is associated w i th any advantage ove r direct l arynogoscop y. Further research is nee d ed to determine wheth er indirect l arnygoscopy i s associated w it h any advantage ov er direct l aryngoscpy. 
Direct laryngxes are associated with fewer adverse events, including trauma to vocal cords and hypoxa.

"Background
Pit and fissure sealants are plastic materials that are used to seal deep pits and fissures on the occlusal surfaces of teeth, where decay occurs most often in children and adolescents. Deep pits and fissures can retain food debris and bacteria, making them difficult to clean, thereby causing them to be more susceptible to dental caries. The application of a pit and fissure sealant, a non‐invasive preventive approach, can prevent dental caries by forming a protective barrier that reduces food entrapment and bacterial growth. Though moderate‐certainty evidence shows that sealants are effective in preventing caries in permanent teeth, the effectiveness of applying pit and fissure sealants to primary teeth has yet to be established. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effects of sealants compared to no sealant or a different sealant in preventing pit and fissure caries on the occlusal surfaces of primary molars in children and to report the adverse effects and the retention of different types of sealants. 
Search methods
An information specialist searched four bibliographic databases up to 11 February 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished and ongoing studies. Review authors scanned the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews for further studies. 
Selection criteria
We included parallel‐group and split‐mouth randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a sealant with no sealant, or different types of sealants, for the prevention of caries in primary molars, with no restriction on follow‐up duration. We included studies in which co‐interventions such as oral health preventive measures, oral health education or tooth brushing demonstrations were used, provided that the same adjunct was used with the intervention and comparator. We excluded studies with complex interventions for the prevention of dental caries in primary teeth such as preventive resin restorations, or studies that used sealants in cavitated carious lesions. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. We presented outcomes for the development of new carious lesions on occlusal surfaces of primary molars as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where studies were similar in clinical and methodological characteristics, we planned to pool effect estimates using a random‐effects model where appropriate. We used GRADE methodology to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included nine studies that randomised 1120 children who ranged in age from 18 months to eight years at the start of the study. One study compared fluoride‐releasing resin‐based sealant with no sealant (139 tooth pairs in 90 children); two studies compared glass ionomer‐based sealant with no sealant (619 children); two studies compared glass ionomer‐based sealant with resin‐based sealant (278 tooth pairs in 200 children); two studies compared fluoride‐releasing resin‐based sealant with resin‐based sealant (113 tooth pairs in 69 children); one study compared composite with fluoride‐releasing resin‐based sealant (40 tooth pairs in 40 children); and one study compared autopolymerised sealant with light polymerised sealant (52 tooth pairs in 52 children). 
Three studies evaluated the effects of sealants versus no sealant and provided data for our primary outcome. Due to differences in study design such as age of participants and duration of follow‐up, we elected not to pool the data. At 24 months, there was insufficient evidence of a difference in the development of new caries lesions for the fluoride‐releasing sealants or no treatment groups (Becker Balagtas odds ratio (BB OR) 0.76, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.42; 1 study, 85 children, 255 tooth surfaces). For glass ionomer‐based sealants, the evidence was equivocal; one study found insufficient evidence of a difference at follow‐up between 12 and 30 months (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.49; 449 children), while another with 12‐month follow‐up found a large, beneficial effect of sealants (OR 0.03, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.15; 107 children). We judged the certainty of the evidence to be low, downgrading two levels in total for study limitations, imprecision and inconsistency. 
We included six trials randomising 411 children that directly compared different sealant materials, four of which (221 children) provided data for our primary outcome. Differences in age of the participants and duration of follow‐up precluded pooling of the data. The incidence of development of new caries lesions was typically low across the different sealant types evaluated. We judged the certainty of the evidence to be low or very low for the outcome of caries incidence. 
Only one study assessed and reported adverse events, the nature of which was gag reflex while placing the sealant material. 
Authors' conclusions
The certainty of the evidence for the comparisons and outcomes in this review was low or very low, reflecting the fragility and uncertainty of the evidence base. The volume of evidence for this review was limited, which typically included small studies where the number of events was low. The majority of studies in this review were of split‐mouth design, an efficient study design for this research question; however, there were often shortcomings in the analysis and reporting of results that made synthesising the evidence difficult. An important omission from the included studies was the reporting of adverse events. Given the importance of prevention for maintaining good oral health, there exists an important evidence gap pertaining to the caries‐preventive effect and retention of sealants in the primary dentition, which should be addressed through robust RCTs.","Sealants for preventing pit‐and‐fissure carious lesion development in primary molar teeth in children 
Background 
Dental caries is one of the most common chronic diseases in children. Pit and fissural caries are the most prevalent type of carious disease in primary (baby) teeth. They occur in the deep pits or fissures of the occlusion surface of the teeth. These areas are difficult to reach with a toothbrush and are therefore prone to caries development. Pit‐and fissure sealing is a noninvasive method of preventing carious decay in these areas. It involves placing a thin plastic material called a sealants into the pits and/or fissures to form a barrier that prevents food debris from accumulating and bacteria from growing. 
The aim of this review was to determine whether pit and ﬁssure sealents are effective at preventing cariogenic decay in primary tooth occlusals surfaces. 
Study characteristics 
We identified nine studies involving 1,121 children aged between two and six years old. All studies were conducted in Europe and the United States. The studies were published between 1997 and 2104. 
Key results 
The quality of the available evidence was low to moderate. There was moderate‐quality evidence that pit and fi ssure sealent application reduced the risk of developing new caries lesions in primary occlus al surfaces of molars. This effect was seen in all studies regardless of the age of the child, the type of sealant used, the frequency of sealent applications, or the time period between the first and second sealent placement. 
There was low‐quality to very low‐ quality evidence that sealent retention was better when sealants were applied to the occlusions surfaces of the molars than when they were applied only to the buccal surfaces. There were no differences in the retention rates of sealents when sealents were applied on the bucco‐lingual surfaces of molar occlusions compared to the lingual surfaces. Sealent retention rates were also not affected by the number of sealments applied. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The evidence was of low to very limited quality. The main limitations were the small sample sizes, short follow‐ups, and the lack of blinding. 
Conclusion 
The use of pit and f i ssure sealing in primary dentition is recommended for the reduction of cariogenesis in the occluding surfaces of permanent molars and the buco‐linguolateral surfaces of premolars. However, the evidence is limited and further research is needed. 
Authors' conclusions 
The available evidence suggests that pit‐ and fissur e sealent treatment is effective in reducing the risk for new cariogen ic lesions in the primary occlusion surfaces of mandibular and maxillary molars of children. The evidence is of low‐to very limited‐quality. Further research is required to confirm the efﬁcacy of seal ent treatment in the prevention and management of cario genic lesions in children's primary teeth.

Sealants for preventing caries in primary teeth
Background
Sealing the pits and fissures of primary teeth can prevent decay. This review aimed to determine whether sealants reduce the number of new cavities in children's teeth. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness of sealant application for preventing new cavitations in children with primary teeth.  
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 15 January 2106), CENTRAL (The Cochrance Library) (2016, Issue 1), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1946 to 22 January 16), EMBASE (OVIDSP) 1974 to 31 January 32, CINAHL (EBSCOhost) (from 1 January to 4 February 23), LILACS (BIREME) (January 1 to February 14, 17), and reference lists of articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing sealants with no treatment or other types of sealents. 
Study appraisal and synthesis methods
Two authors independently selected studies, extracted the data and checked the quality of the included studies using the Co‐chrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We calculated the risk of overestimation of effect size by using the 'Peto' method. We pooled the results of the studies using a fixed‐effects meta‐analysis if the studies were homogeneous. 
Key results
Nine RCTs with 2882 children were included in this review. Three studies compared sealants applied to primary teeth with no intervention. At two years, there were no significant differences in the number or location of new decayed, missing or filled primary teeth (DMFT) between the groups. Two studies compared different types of sealsants. At six months, the use of glass ionomers was associated with a lower risk of new cavity formation than resin‐base sealants (OR = 0, 03, 3.4 to infinity, 4 studies, 584 children, Peto estimate). At 1 year, the risk was lower for glass ionomers than for resin‐bases sealants but the difference was not statistically significant (OR=0.34, CI 99%, 0 to 09, 6 studies, P=0,006). 
Quality of the available evidence
The quality of evidence was low to very low due to the small number of studies, heterogeneity in the types of interventions and outcomes, and the lack of long‐term follow‐ups. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to support the use or non‐use of sealats in primary dentition. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of sealat application in children.

Sealants for preventing caries in primary teeth 
Background
Caries is the most common chronic disease in children and adolescents. Dental sealants are thin plastic coatings applied to the chewing surfaces of back teeth to prevent decay. Sealants are commonly used in primary care dental clinics. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of sealant application in preventing carious lesions in the permanent dentition. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of sealation on the prevention of carious lesion development in the deciduous dentition in children. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 27 February 2018), CENTRAL (2020, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1946 to 28 February 18, 1990), Embase (1800 to 31 January 29, 01), CINAHL (10/1982 to 7/2009), LILACS (1/1897 to 6/29/28), PEDro (1st Jan 2100), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (12/21/220). We also searched reference lists of retrieved studies and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing sealants with no treatment or other sealants. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 99% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) and standard deviations (SD) for continuous outcomes. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. 
Main results
We included 11 studies involving 4,112 children aged 3 to15 years. Six studies compared different types of sealante, and five studies compared sealants versus no treatment. We included 4 studies with 222 children that assessed the primary outcome of new decayed, missing or filled surfaces (DMFS) in the first permanent molar. The remaining seven studies involved 3,890 children and assessed the incidence of new cavities in the posterior teeth. 
For sealants containing fluoride, we found no evidence of an effect on the incidence or prevalence of new cavity‐free surfaces in the anterior teeth (RR 0, 45% to 97%, 9 studies, 389 children, low‐certainty evidence). For sealants without fluoride, the available evidence was of low certainty and showed a small but significant benefit of sealantes over no treatment (RR, 5.74, 6.81% to10.28%, 13 studies,1,071 children, very low‐ certainty evidence). 
For glass ionomers, the findings were equivocal. One study found no difference between 3 and 15 months after treatment (OR, 7.6,0. 4 to 4. 1,  9. 5%, 439 children). Another study found a significant benefit for glass ionomeres over no sealant (OR. 03. 9 to 55. 6%, 65 children). 
We judged the overall certainty of this evidence to low orvery low due to study limitations (such as small sample size, short follow‐ up period, and lack of blinding), imprecision (due to low numbers of events), and inconsistency (due the conflicting results). 
Adverse events were not reported in any of the included trials. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of the available data was low to very low. There is a need for more high‐quality studies to address the evidence gaps identified in this systematic review. 
Key messages
Sealing the pits and fissures of the first molars with fluoride‐containing sealants may reduce the risk of developing new carious surfaces in these teeth. However, the certaintyof the evidence is low. Glass ionomer sealants appear to be effective in reducing the risk for new cariogenic lesions in posterior teeth, but the evidence quality is very low due the small number of studies and the short follow up period.

F","Sealants for preventing pit‐and‐fissure carious lesion development in primary molar teeth in children
Background 
Pit‐and–fissures are the most common sites for caries to develop in children. These areas are difficult to reach when brushing and are therefore prone to caries development. Sealants are a preventive measure that can reduce the risk of developing caries at these sites. This review aimed to determine whether sealants can prevent caries from developing in the pits and grooves of the occlusion surfaces of the primary molary teeth of children. 
Study characteristics 
Nine studies were included in this review. The studies were conducted in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. All studies were carried out between 1974 and 2０21. The participants were children aged between 3 and 16 years old. The sealants were applied to the occlusive surfaces of their primary molaries. The type of sealant varied between studies. The main outcome of interest was the development or progression of carious decay in the occlusions surfaces of children's primary molares. 
Key results 
The review found that sealant application reduced the risk that children would develop carious tooth decay in their primary molas. The risk of cariogenic decay was reduced by 41% (95 % CI 25% to 55%) in children who received sealants as opposed to those who did not receive sealants (moderate‐certaintty evidence). The risk reduction was greater in children aged 3 to 6 years (56%, 99% CI 39% to73%) than in children older than 6 (26%, CI 14% to42%). The risk was also greater in studies that applied sealants every year (57%, 29%to 75%) than those that applied them less frequently (31%, 17% to50%). The review also found that the risk reduction in children receiving sealants was greater if they had previously received sealant treatment (55%, 36% to69%) than if they did not have previous experience of sealante treatment (27%, CI16%to43%). 
Quality of the results 
This review found moderate‐quality evidence that sealante application reduces the risk for carious decays in the primary mola teeth of young children. The quality of the available evidence was low because of the small number of studies included in the review and the limited number of participants in each study. 
Conclusions 
The use of sealantes in children reduces the likelihood of developing new caries lesions in the pit and fossae of the teeth. However, the evidence is based on low‐quality studies and there is uncertainty about the long‐term effects of applying sealantes. 
Authors' conclusions 
The evidence suggests that sealantes are effective at reducing the risk or progression for new cariogenesis in the teeth of primary molo teeth in young children, but the quality of evidence is low. The evidence is uncertain about the effects on the teeth in older children. Further research is needed to determine the effects and long‐ term effects of using sealantes on the primary teeth of older children and adults. 
Implications for practice 
The findings of this review suggest that sealanes are effective for preventing carious caries of the pits in the molars of children, especially in the first six years of life. The findings also suggest that the benefits of sealanes may be greater in younger children than in older ones. 
Further research is required to determine how long the benefits last and whether the benefits are maintained over time. 
The results of this systematic review suggest the need for further research to determine if the benefits continue beyond the age of six years. 
Future research should focus on determining the effects in older groups of children and in adults. Future research should also focus on the long term effects and costs of using sealenes. 
What does this review add? 
This is the first systematic review to examine the effects for sealanes in children's teeth. The review provides moderate‐confidence evidence that the use of sealeanes reduces the incidence of new pit and fission caries, especially among children aged three to six years old, and that the benefit is greater in those who have had previous experience with sealanes. 
This systematic review provides the first evidence that sealeane application reduces new carie in the molar pits and fissions of children aged six to １２ years old and that this benefit is maintained over a period of two years. The results of the review also provide the first moderate‐confident evidence that applying sealanes every year is more effective than applying them less often. 
How might this change clinical practice? 
The finding of this study suggests that the application of sealane is effective in reducing the incidence and progression of new pits and fossa caries and that it is more beneficial in younger than older
Sealants for preventing new cariogenic lesion development in primary teeth
Background
Primary teeth are prone to caries because of their anatomical structure and the presence of fissures which are difficult to clean. Sealants are a preventive measure that can be applied to the occlusals surfaces of the teeth to prevent caries. This review aimed to determine whether sealants reduce the development and progression of new cavities in primary molaries. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness and safety of sealant application in preventing new cavitation in primary molar teeth. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 16 January 2105), CENTRAL (The Cochrance Library 2nd 2205 issue), MEDLINE (1966 to 26 January to 01 2305) and EMBASE (1066-0463) (16 102015). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted manufacturers of sealents. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing sealants with no treatment or other types of sealent. 
Study appraisal and synthesis methods
Two authors independently assessed the risk of selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and other bias. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 99% confidence interval (CI) for the number of new cavity‐free teeth at 2 years. We pooled the data using a fixed‐effect model if the heterogeneity was less than 50%. 
Main result
We identified nine studies involving 1,121 children aged 1 to eight‐years old. Three studies evaluated sealants against no treatment and provided sufficient data for the primary outcome of new lesion development. At two years, there were insufficient data to determine the effect of sealantes on new lesion formation. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to determine if sealants are effective in preventing the development or progression of carious lesion in primary tooth occlusally surfaces. Further research is needed to determine this. 
Key messages 
Sealant application is a preventive strategy that can reduce the incidence of new dental caries in primary dentition. However, the effectiveness of sealante application in reducing the development new carie lesions in primary occlusol surfaces is unclear. 
Further research is required to determine how long the benefit of sealate application lasts and to identify the best type of sealan to use.

Review question 
What is the effect and safetyof sealants for the prevention of new lesions in the primary teeth? 
Background 
Primary teeth (baby teeth) are prone t0 caries (cavities) because of the way they are formed and the shape of the surface of the tooth. The surface of a primary tooth has many grooves and pits that are difficult for the child to clean properly. These areas are called fissures. 
Sealing the fissures with a sealant can help to prevent the development o0 new cariy lesions. A sealant is a thin layer of plastic material that is painted onto the surface o0 the tooth to prevent bacteria from getting into the fissure. 
In this review, we looked at the evidence to see if sealant applications are effective and safe in preventing caries on the occlusion surfaces of teeth. Occlusion surfaces are the surfaces of a tooth that come into contact when the teeth bite together. 
We searched for all randomised controlled studies that compared sealants to no treatment. We included studies that had been published up to 31 January 1999. 
What did we find? 
We found nine studies with a total of 1 131 children. All the studies were conducted in the United States. The children were aged between 2 and eight years old. 
Three of the studies looked at sealants compared to no sealants. Two of these studies looked only at primary molary teeth. One of the three studies looked also at permanent teeth. The studies lasted between 6 and 28 months. 
All three studies found that the children who received sealants had fewer new caried surfaces than those who did not receive sealants at the end of the follow‐ups. However the differences were not statistically significant. 
One of the two studies that looked at primary teeth found that children who had sealants on their teeth had fewer caried teeth than those without sealants after 1 year. The other study found that there was no difference in caries between the two groups after 2.5 years. 
Two studies looked a0 glass ionomar sealants and one looked at fluoride releasing resin sealants (the other two studies looked just at glass ionomers). These studies lasted from 6 to four years. They found that sealants reduced the number o0 caried tooth surfaces
Sealants for preventing dental caries in the permanent teeth of children and adolescents 
Background 
Dental caries is a common disease that affects the teeth of many children and teenagers. Dental caries can cause pain, discomfort, and infection. It can also lead to tooth loss and other serious problems. Preventing dental cariogenic bacteria from colonizing the smooth surfaces of the back teeth (molars) is one way to prevent dental carious lesions. Sealants are thin plastic coatings applied to the chewing surfaces of molars to protect them from decay. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of sealant application on the prevention of dental carie in the teeth in children and young people. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 2014, issue 1), CENTRAL (2009, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to 21 April 2209), EMBASE (1880 to 3 May 24, 09) and LILACS (1 January 1982 to 5 May 02, 14). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing sealants with no treatment or placebo or comparing different types of sealents. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the body of evidence. 
Main results 
We identified 11 studies involving 4,110 children aged 2 to15 years. The studies were conducted in Australia, Canada, China, Finland, Germany, Greece, India, Italy, Japan, Poland, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The trials were published between 2 and19 years ago. 
The main outcomes were the incidence of new dental carous lesions and the retention of the sealants. We did not find any studies that directly compare the effectiveness of different types or brands of sealent. We found six studies that compared different types and brands of sealtants. 
For the comparison of sealantes versus no treatment, we found one study that compared fluoride gel with no intervention. This study showed that sealants reduced the risk of developing new carious lesion by 27%. However, the certainty in the evidence is low because of the small number of participants and events. 
In the comparison between fluoride gel and glass ionomers, we did not see any significant difference in the number or size of new lesions after 1 year of follow up. However, after 3 years of follow-up, the number and size of lesions were significantly lower in the group that received fluoride gel. 
There was no significant difference between the two types of seals in the retention rate of the seals. 
Adverse events were not reported in any of the studies. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was low for all outcomes. The certainty of evidence is downgraded due to the small sample sizes, short follow‐ups, and lack of blinding. 
Conclusion 
The evidence is insufficient to support the use of sealante for the prevention and control of dental decay in the deciduous teeth of young children. Further high‐quality RCT are needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of sealates. 
Key messages 
Sealantes are effective in reducing the number, size and frequency of new decayed tooth surfaces in children. However the evidence quality is low. 
Sealing the first permanent molars is recommended by the World Health Organization as part of a comprehensive programme to prevent caries. 
Further research is needed to evaluate the long‐term effects of sealing the second permanent molers and the effect of sealing on the prevalence of carious teeth in the first and second permanent molar. 
Future research should include larger samples, longer follow‐ ups and more objective measures of the retention and efficacy of the sealtant.

"Background
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurologic disorder that is associated with peripheral iron deficiency in a subgroup of patients. It is unclear whether iron therapy is effective treatment for RLS. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral or parenteral iron for the treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) when compared with placebo or other therapies. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycNFO, and CINAHL for the time period January 1995 to September 2017. We searched reference lists for additional published studies. We searched Clinicaltrials.gov and other clinical trial registries (September 2017) for ongoing or unpublished studies. 
Selection criteria
Controlled trials comparing any formulation of iron with placebo, other medications, or no treatment, in adults diagnosed with RLS according to expert clinical interview or explicit diagnostic criteria. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality, with discussion to reach consensus in the case of any disagreement. The primary outcome considered in this review was restlessness or unpleasant sensations, as experienced subjectively by the patient. We combined treatment/control differences in the outcomes across studies using random‐effects meta‐analyses. We analysed continuous data using mean differences (MDs) where possible and performed standardised mean difference (SMD) analyses when different measurements were used across studies. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data using the Mantel‐Haenszel method and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We analysed study heterogeneity using the I2 statistic. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We performed GRADE analysis using GRADEpro. 
Main results
We identified and included 10 studies (428 total participants, followed for 2‐16 weeks) in this review. Our primary outcome was restlessness or uncomfortable leg sensations, which was quantified using the International Restless Legs Scale (IRLS) (range, 0 to 40) in eight trials and a different RLS symptom scale in a ninth trial. Nine studies compared iron to placebo and one study compared iron to a dopamine agonist (pramipexole). The possibility for bias among the trials was variable. Three studies had a single element with high risk of bias, which was lack of blinding in two and incomplete outcome data in one. All studies had at least one feature resulting in unclear risk of bias. 
Combining data from the seven trials using the IRLS to compare iron and placebo, use of iron resulted in greater improvement in IRLS scores (MD ‐3.78, 95% CI ‐6.25 to ‐1.31; I2= 66%, 7 studies, 345 participants) measured 2 to 12 weeks after treatment. Including an eighth study, which measured restlessness using a different scale, use of iron remained beneficial compared to placebo (SMD ‐0.74, 95% CI ‐1.26 to ‐0.23; I2 = 80%, 8 studies, 370 participants). The GRADE assessment of certainty for this outcome was moderate. 
The single study comparing iron to a dopamine agonist (pramipexole) found a similar reduction in RLS severity in the two groups (MD ‐0.40, 95% CI ‐5.93 to 5.13, 30 participants). 
Assessment of secondary outcomes was limited by small numbers of trials assessing each outcome. Iron did not improve quality of life as a dichotomous measure (RR 2.01, 95% CI 0.54 to 7.45; I2=54%, 2 studies, 39 participants), but did improve quality of life measured on continuous scales (SMD 0.51, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.87; I2= 0%, 3 studies, 128 participants), compared to placebo. Subjective sleep quality was no different between iron and placebo groups (SMD 0.19, 95% CI ‐0.18 to 0.56; I2 = 9%, 3 studies, 128 participants), nor was objective sleep quality, as measured by change in sleep efficiency in a single study (‐35.5 +/‐ 92.0 versus ‐41.4 +/‐ 98.2, 18 participants). Periodic limb movements of sleep were not significantly reduced with iron compared to placebo ( SMD ‐0.19, 95% CI ‐0.70 to 0.32; I2 = 0%, 2 studies, 60 participants). Iron did not improve sleepiness compared to placebo, as measured on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (data not provided, 1 study, 60 participants) but did improve the daytime tiredness item of the RLS‐6 compared to placebo (least squares mean difference ‐1.5, 95% CI ‐2.5 to ‐0.6; 1 study, 110 participants). The GRADE rating for secondary outcomes ranged from low to very low. 
Prespecified subgroup analyses showed more improvement with iron in those trials studying participants on dialysis. The use of low serum ferritin levels as an inclusion criteria and the use or oral versus intravenous iron did not show significant subgroup differences. 
Iron did not result in significantly more adverse events than placebo (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.25; I2=45%, 6 studies, 298 participants). A single study reported that people treated with iron therapy experienced fewer adverse events than the active comparator pramipexole. 
Authors' conclusions
Iron therapy probably improves restlessness and RLS severity in comparison to placebo. Iron therapy may not increase the risk of side effects in comparison to placebo. We are uncertain whether iron therapy improves quality of life in comparison to placebo. Iron therapy may make little or no difference to pramipexole in restlessness and RLS severity, as well as in the risk of adverse events. The effect on secondary outcomes such as quality of life, daytime functioning, and sleep quality, the optimal timing and formulation of administration, and patient characteristics predicting response require additional study.","Iron therapy for restless legs symptoms
Background
The restless legs symptom complex (RLSC) is characterised by an irresistible urge to move the legs, often accompanied by unpleasant sensations. The symptoms are worse at night and improve with movement. Restless legs symptoms can be caused by iron deficiency, but it is not known if iron supplementation is effective in treating these symptoms. 
Study characteristics
We reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness of iron therapy for people with restless legs. We found 11 studies involving 427 people. The studies lasted between two and 16 weeks. All studies compared people who received iron with those who received placebo (a substance that has no effect) or another treatment. 
Key results
The evidence is current to September 2020. We did not find any studies that compared iron therapy with no treatment. We also did not identify any studies comparing iron therapy to other treatments. We could not combine the results of the studies because they used different scales to measure the severity of the symptoms. We judged the certainty of the evidence to be very low. This means we are uncertain about the effects of iron on restless legs and that further research is needed. 
Quality of the available evidence
The quality of the included studies varied. Some studies were at high risk for bias, meaning that the results may not be reliable. 
Conclusion
There is very low‐quality evidence that iron therapy may reduce the severity and frequency of restless leg symptoms. Further research is required to confirm these findings. 
Authors' conclusions: 
We found no studies that directly compared iron with no intervention. We identified 12 studies that evaluated iron therapy versus placebo or another active treatment. These studies were conducted in people with iron deficiency anaemia, chronic kidney disease, pregnancy, and people with RSL. We included 432 participants in our review. The majority of the trials were at moderate risk of selection bias. The evidence is currently unclear due to the variability in the measurement tools used to assess the severity or frequency of RSL symptoms. The quality of evidence was rated as very low due to imprecision and inconsistency. Iron therapy may be beneficial in reducing the severity, frequency, and duration of RLS symptoms. However, further research with larger sample sizes is required. 
Background

Outcomes
We assessed the following outcomes: (i) RLL symptoms; (i i) adverse events; (iv) quality of life; (v) blood parameters; (vi) adverse drug reactions; ( vi i) mortality; ( v i i) hospitalization; (ix) hospital admission; ( x ) length of stay; (xi) cost; (xii) health‐related quality of lif
Authors' recommendations
We recommend that further studies should be conducted to confirm the benefits of iron in the treatment and prevention of RLI. 
Review question
What is the effect of iron treatment on restless‐leg syndrome (RSI)?

Iron supplementation for restless legs syndrome 
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common condition characterised by an irresistible urge to move the legs when resting or lying down. It can be associated with discomfort or pain in the legs and can cause sleep disturbance. Iron deficiency is a known cause of RLS. 
This review aimed to assess whether iron supplementation improves symptoms of RSL. We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published up to 2013. We included 10 RCTs involving 427 participants. 
We found that iron supplementation improved symptoms of restless legs more than placebo. This effect was seen in both short‐term (up to 3 months) and long‐term studies (upwards of 1 year). However, we were uncertain about the certainty of these findings due to the small number of studies and participants involved. 
There was no evidence that iron improved quality of sleep or subjective sleep quality. 
Further research is needed to confirm these results and to determine the optimal dose and duration of iron supplementation. 
What is restless legs? 
Resting‐leg syndrome (also known as Willis‐Ekbom disease) is characterised as an irresistible desire to move your legs when you are resting or trying to sleep. It is often accompanied by an unpleasant sensation in the lower limbs, such as burning, tingling, crawling, or pulling. 
It is estimated that 5% of the general population have RLS, but this figure may be higher in people with other conditions, such diabetes, kidney failure, or pregnancy. 
RLS is thought to be caused by a lack of iron in the body. Iron is important for the production of red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body and help muscles to function properly. 
How is restless leg syndrome treated? 
There is no cure for RLS but there are several treatments available. These include: 
• Medications, such a pramiplexole, ropinirole, or gabapentin. 
• Lifestyle changes, such avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and smoking. 
Iron supplementation is a safe and effective treatment for RSL, but further research is required to determine its optimal dose, duration, and combination with other treatments.

Iron supplementation for restless leg syndrome 
Background 
Restless leg syndrome (RLS) is a common condition characterised by an irresistible urge to move the legs, often accompanied by uncomfortable sensations. It is thought to be caused by a lack of iron in the body. This review aimed to assess whether iron supplementation improves symptoms of RLS. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the Cochrane Restless Legs Syndrome Group Specialised Register (searched 21 June 2016), the CoCHRANE Database of Systematic Reviews (Issue 1,2009), MEDLINE (1966 to 1 June, 0004), EMBASE (1800 to June 16,  2,015), CINAHL (10 January 2206), LILACS (1 January 1982 to 31 May 23, 4205), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (search date 15 June 020, 5014). We also contacted pharmaceutical companies and researchers who were involved in the development of iron supplements for RLS, and screened reference lists of included studies. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing iron supplementation with placebo or other treatments for RSL. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. We pooled data using random effects meta‐analysis where appropriate. 
Main results 
We included 10 RCTs involving 288 participants. The trials were conducted in the USA, Canada, and Europe. Participants were adults with RLS and low serum iron levels. The duration of the trials varied from 4 weeks to 6 months. All trials used oral iron supplements. 
The main outcomes were: (1) the primary outcome of the change in the RLDSS score at the end of treatment, (2) the change from baseline in the number of restless legs episodes per night, (3) the number needed to treat (NNT) to achieve a 5 point reduction in the total RLDDS score, (4) the proportion of participants with a 30% or greater reduction in RLDSD score, and (5) the percentage of participants reporting any adverse events. 
We found no evidence that iron supplementation improved the RSDSS score (mean difference (MD) 0‐1.1, confidence interval (CI) ‐3.1 to  0, I2 = 0%, six studies, n  120), the number from restless legs episode per night (MD 1‐0, CI ‖0.0 to ‖1.0, n 144), or the NNT to achieve 5 points reduction in total RSDSD score (MD ‖2.10, ‖3.50 to ‖0.40, six studies n 240). There was some evidence that oral iron supplementation may improve the RSL‐6 score (least square mean difference (LSMD) ‖ 1 5, CI 1 ‖ to  2 5 0 0 , n  1 1  0 ) and the daytime sleepiness item of RSL6 (LSM D ‖ ‖. 5 , CI  1 0 to − 0 . 5 ) compared to placebos. There was no evidence of a difference in the proportion with a reduction in restless legs score of 3 0 % or more (RR ‖ . 8 0   9 5 % CI 2 0 t o 1 . 0 ; n 32 ). There was also no evidence for a difference between iron supplementation and placebo in the change of sleep efficiency (MD − 35 . 4 0 + / − 91 .0 9 ; I2  = 9 % ; n    13 8 ) or the number (RR  ‖  . 9     CI 3   to 4 ; n   1 38 ) of participants experiencing any adverse event. 
Quality of the available evidence 
The quality of the included studies was generally low to moderate. The certainty of evidence for most outcomes was low to high. 
Author's conclusions 
There is limited evidence from this review that iron may improve some aspects of RSDS. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Key messages 
• Iron supplementation may help to improve some symptoms of restless leg syndromes.

Iron Therapy for Restless Legs Syndrome
Background
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological disorder characterised by an irresistible urge to move the legs when at rest. It is associated with unpleasant sensations in the legs, which can be relieved by movement. Iron deficiency is a known cause of RLS. Iron supplementation has been shown to improve symptoms of RSL in people with iron deficiency. However, it is unclear whether iron supplementation is beneficial for people without iron deficiency.
Objectives
To assess the effects of iron therapy compared to placebo for people with RLS.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Sleep Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov on 23 September 2017. We also searched reference lists of included studies and contacted authors of included trials for additional studies. We did not apply any language restrictions.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing iron therapy with placebo for RLS were eligible for inclusion. We included only studies where participants were diagnosed with RSL according to the International RLS Study Group diagnostic criteria. We excluded studies where the primary outcome was quality of sleep or sleepiness. We considered iron therapy to include oral, intramuscular, and intravenous administration of iron. We defined placebo as a sugar pill or inactive substance given to participants in the control group. We used the following search terms: restless legs syndrome, iron, iron deficiency, iron therapy, iron supplementation, iron treatment, iron replacement, iron infusion, iron injection, iron intravenous, iron oral, iron parenteral, iron subcutaneous, iron transdermal, iron topical, iron rectal, iron vaginal, iron nasal, iron inhalation, iron aerosol, iron patch, iron gel, iron cream, iron ointment, iron lotion, iron spray, iron drops, iron tablets, iron capsules, iron syrup, iron chewable, iron lozenge, iron chewing gum, iron paste, iron suppository, iron enema, iron douche, iron wash, iron bath, iron shower, iron steam, iron sauna, iron massage, iron acupuncture, iron acupressure, iron cupping, iron magnet, iron crystal, iron stone, iron mineral, iron herb, iron spice, iron tea, iron coffee, iron juice, iron vinegar, iron wine, iron beer, iron rum, iron vodka, iron whisky, iron brandy, iron liqueur, iron cordial, iron tonic, iron elixir, iron tincture, and iron extract. We searched for studies published in any language. We screened the reference lists and abstracts of included articles for additional relevant studies. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We contacted authors for missing information. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 99% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. We estimated the mean difference (MD) and its 98% CI for continuous outcomes. For dichotomic outcomes, we calculated the number needed to treat for an additional benefit (NNTB) and the number need to harm (NNH). We used a random-effects model to calculate pooled estimates. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We included six RCTs involving 279 participants. All studies were conducted in the United States. Two studies were double-blind, one was open-label, and three were crossover trials. The studies had a range of participant characteristics including age, sex, race, and duration of RLD. The majority of participants were white women. Three studies recruited participants with iron-deficiency anaemia and three recruited participants without iron-deficient anaemia. The duration of follow-up ranged from four weeks to 12 months. The most commonly used iron formulations were ferrous sulphate and ferrous gluconate. One study used ferrous fumarate. The dose of iron ranged from 100 mg to 6000mg per day. The doses of placebo ranged from zero to 300 milligrams per day of ferrous sulfate. The main outcomes were the change in the score on the International Restless Leg Syndrome Severity Scale (IRLSSS) and change in sleep quality. We found no studies reporting the change on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) or the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). We found one study reporting the number of participants who withdrew from the study due to adverse events and one study assessing the number and type of adverse event. 
The main findings were: 
• Iron therapy probably improved RLS symptoms compared to a placebo (I2=0%, 5 studies, N=299 participants; MD -2.40, 19 studies, I2 = 0%, N=308 participants; RR 1,68, CI 1-2, 59","Iron for restless legs
Background
The restless legs (RL) syndrome is a neurological disorder characterized by an urge to move the legs, often accompanied by unpleasant sensations. It can be caused by a lack of iron in the body. 
Objective
To assess the effectiveness and safety for iron therapy in people with restless legs. 
Study characteristics
We found 11 studies involving 427 people with RSL. The studies were conducted between 1899 and 2103. All studies were carried out in Europe and North America. The majority of the studies were small. 
Key results
The studies showed that iron therapy reduced symptoms of RSL in people who were iron deficient. However, we cannot say if iron therapy would be beneficial for people who do not have low iron levels. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low to moderate. The number of people in each study was small and the duration of the study was short. 
Conclusion
Iron therapy may be beneficial in people whose RSL is due to low iron. However further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Authors' conclusions: 
The evidence suggests that iron supplementation may be effective in treating RSL due to iron deficiency. However the evidence is of low to medium quality and further research should be conducted to confirm this finding. 
Background
This review is based on the original protocol published in 2203 and updated in 1205. 
Review question
What is the effect of iron therapy for restless leg syndrome? 
Study selection
We included 25 studies in this update. These studies were published between 2300 and 1305 and were conducted in Europe, North America, and Australia. 
We found no new studies since the last update. 
What did we find?
We found that iron supplements may be useful in treating restless leg symptoms in people suffering from iron deficiency, but not in those without iron deficiency.
What are the implications for practice and policy?
The evidence shows that iron treatment may be helpful in people's restless leg condition. However more research is required to confirm the findings. This review also highlights the need for further research to determine the optimal dose of iron and the best route of administration. 
How up-to-date is this review?
This review was last updated in December 2405, and we searched for new studies until 2605.
Background
People with restless leg syndromes (RLSS) experience an irresistible urge to walk or move their legs, usually because of an unpleasant sensation. The symptoms are often worse during the evening and night and improve with movement. RLSS is a very common condition, affecting about 1 in 5 people. 
RLSS is thought to be caused either by a shortage of iron or by a problem with the nerves that carry signals from the brain to the legs. Iron deficiency is the most common cause of RLSS. 
There are many treatments for RLSS, including drugs such as L-DOPA, dopamine agonists, and opioids. Some people find that taking iron supplements helps relieve their symptoms. 
The aim of this review is to find out whether iron supplements are effective in relieving the symptoms of RLRS. 
Methods
We looked for all relevant studies that had been published up to 2705 in the Co‐chrane Library, MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. We also searched for unpublished studies in clinical trial registers. We included only studies that compared iron supplements with placebo (a dummy treatment) or another drug. We excluded studies that only looked at people with Parkinson's disease, as they may have RLSS as a side effect of their medication. 
Studies were included if they had been carried out on adults aged 16 years or over. We defined 'iron deficiency' as a low level of iron stores in the blood. We looked for studies that lasted for at least four weeks. 
Our main outcome measure was the International Rating Scale for Restless Leg Syndrome (IRSS). This is a questionnaire that asks people to rate how much they feel the need to move their limbs and how much discomfort they feel. 
Results
We reviewed 28 studies involving a total of 430 people. Most of the people in the studies had iron deficiency anaemia. We found that people who took iron supplements had fewer symptoms than those who took a placebo. 
However, we could not be sure that iron was responsible for the improvement in symptoms. The people in our studies were given iron supplements for a short time, so we do not know whether they would continue to benefit from taking iron after the study ended. 
Conclusions
We conclude that iron may help relieve the symptoms in some people with RLSS who have iron deficiency and that further research into the use of iron supplements in people without iron deficiencies is needed. 
Further research is also needed to establish the optimal dosage and route of delivery of iron.

Iron supplementation for restless legs syndrome 
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common condition characterised by an irresistible urge to move the legs, often accompanied by unpleasant sensations. It can be very distressing and interfere with sleep. Iron deficiency is a known cause of RLS, and iron supplementation may help relieve symptoms. 
This review assessed the effects of iron supplementation for people with RLS. We searched for relevant studies up to 2013 and included 10 randomised controlled trials involving 429 participants. The trials were conducted in Europe, North America and Asia. Participants were adults with RSL who were iron deficient or had low iron stores. 
We found that iron supplementation improved symptoms of RSL compared to a placebo. This effect was seen when iron was given alone or combined with a dopamine receptor agonist. However, we found no evidence that iron improved quality of sleep or subjective sleep quality. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence is current to 31 March 2103. The certainty of the results is moderate due to the small number of trials and participants involved. Further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
What is the evidence? 
We identified 11 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies compared the effects on RLS symptoms of iron versus placebo or a dopamine antagonist (pralidoxime). The studies were conducted between 1998 and 2203 and involved 419 participants with RLD. The studies used different measures to assess RLS and the duration of follow‐up varied from 2 weeks to 6 months. 
Our main finding is that iron improves symptoms of restless legs. We found that the mean difference in the International RLS Scale score between iron supplementation and placebo was ‐ 3. 78 (95 % confidence interval [CI] ‐7. 25, ‐. 32). This means that people taking iron had a better score than those taking placebo. The mean difference was ‴0. 4 (9. 54, ‴5. 13). This indicates that people receiving iron had lower scores than those receiving pramiplexole. 
There was some evidence that people who received iron had better quality of live than those who received placebo. There was no evidence of any differences in subjective sleep or sleep quality between the groups. 
How certain are we about the results? 
The certainty of our findings is moderate because of the small numbers and short duration of the studies. We also found that there was a high risk that the results were biased. 
Further research is required to confirm our findings. We would like to see more studies that include larger numbers of participants and longer follow‐ups. We need to know whether iron supplementation has any effect on other aspects of RLD, such as the frequency of movement, the intensity of the sensations, and the impact on quality of living. 
Key messages 
People with restless legs have an irresistible desire to move their legs, which is usually accompanied by uncomfortable sensations. Iron supplementation may be useful for people who have restless legs and are iron deficient. 
Iron supplementation may improve symptoms of restles legs. 
It is uncertain whether iron improves quality of sleeping or subjective quality of lives. 
More research is necessary to confirm the findings of this review and to determine the effects and safety of iron on other outcomes. 
Background 
Restful legs syndrome is a condition characterisied by an irresistable urge to movemnet the legs. It is associated with unpleasant sensations and can be distressing. Iron deficieny is a well known cause. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects iron supplementation on restless legs symptoms.

Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochraine. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD) with 9 5% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomic and continuous outcomes respectively. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results 
We included 13 RCTs involving 546 participants. All studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, Australia or Europe. Most participants were women (n=488, n=89%). The average age of participants was 55 years. The duration of RSL varied from 1 month to 5 years, and the duration of iron treatment varied from one week to 6 months. The most common type of iron used was ferrous sulphate. 
The main outcomes we examined were: quality of sleep, quality of daily life, subjective sleep quality and sleep efficiency, periodic limb movements during sleep, sleepiness, and adverse events. 
Quality of sleep 
There was no evidence that iron improved quality of night time sleep as a binary outcome (RR=2. 0l,  9. 5 CI  0 . 5 4 to7. 4 5; 90% CI, I2 5%, six studies, n 330). However, there was evidence that it improved quality as a continuous outcome (S MD 0 , 5 l,  CI 9 .  5 % 0 to0. 8 7 ; 99% CI I20%, three studies, nine participants). 
Subjective sleep 
No evidence that there was any difference in subjective sleep between iron therapy and placebo (S M D 0,. 1 l, CI  - 0., 5 to0,3 6; CI  I29%, three st udies, 58 participants) 
Sleep efficiency 
No difference in sleep efﬁciency between iron treatment and placebo in a study (S Md 0,-3 5, CI -0.4 to-0.2; CI I 2o%, two studies, six participants).
Iron Therapy for Restless Legs Syndrome
Background
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common disorder characterised by an irresistible urge to move the legs when at rest. It is associated with a variety of symptoms including discomfort, pain, and an unpleasant sensation in the legs. RLS can be caused by a number of factors including iron deficiency. Iron deficiency is common in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is a condition where the kidneys do not work properly. People with CKD often have low levels of iron in their blood. This review aimed to assess the effects of iron therapy in people who have RLS and CKD.
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov on 13 February 2019. We also checked reference lists of included studies and contacted authors for additional information. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing iron therapy with placebo or another treatment in people aged 18 years or older with RLS. We excluded trials in which iron was given as part of a combination therapy. We did not restrict our search to any particular language or country. We planned to include only trials published in English, but we decided to include non-English language studies if they were translated into English. We considered all types of iron therapies, including oral and intravenous forms. We used the following search terms: 'restless legs', 'iron', 'anemia', 'chronic kidney disease', 'renal', 'dialysis', 'intravenous iron', 'oral iron', and 'placebo'. We did this because these terms were likely to be used in the title, abstract, and keywords of relevant studies. We searched for trials that had been registered in the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) registry. We contacted researchers who had conducted the trials to obtain any missing information. 
Study selection
We included 11 RCTs involving 699 participants. All studies were conducted in the USA. The studies were published between 1999 and 2108. The participants were adults with CKDs stages 3 to 5. They were recruited from dialysis clinics, hospitals, and community settings. The trials compared iron therapy (oral or intravenous) with placebo. The main outcome measures were the change in scores on the International Restless Leg Syndrome Severity Scale (IRLSSG) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The IRLSSG is a scale that measures the severity of RLS symptoms. The PSQI is a questionnaire that measures sleep quality. We assessed the risk for bias in the included studies. 
Key results
The evidence is current to 1 March 2 2202. We found no evidence that iron therapy improved the quality of sleep in people taking iron therapy compared to placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) −0.17, 10 studies, n = 603 participants, 3 studies ongoing, I2 = 0%). We found some evidence that people taking oral iron therapy had less severe RLS than people taking placebo (Smd −0, 44, 5 studies, N = 336, I² = 52%). We also found some limited evidence that oral iron reduced the need for dopaminergic medication (SdM −0 28, two studies, six participants, I ² =0%). There was no evidence of a difference in the rate of adverse effects between people taking either oral or intravenously administered iron therapy and people taking a placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1 48 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0 97,2 30)). We found evidence that intravenous administration of iron resulted in more adverse effects than oral administration of the same dose of iron (RR = 1, 67 (9 5%CI 1 . 17 to2. 38)). We did find evidence that the use of iron did result in fewer adverse effects in people receiving iron therapy than in people treated using pramipelexole (RR=0 71 (97%CI0 51 to0 87)). 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was moderate to high. The quality of evidence was low for the quality-of-life outcomes. The evidence was of low quality for the adverse event outcomes. We judged the overall quality of this evidence to be moderate to low. 
Conclusion
Iron probably reduces the severity and frequency of RSL symptoms and the need to take dopaminergics. Iron probably does not improve the quality or quantity of sleep. Iron may reduce the risk or severity of adverse reactions to iron therapy. The optimal timing of iron administration and the best formulation of iron are unclear. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose of oral iron"
"Background
Adequate haemodialysis (HD) in people with end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD) is reliant upon establishment of vascular access, which may consist of arteriovenous fistula, arteriovenous graft, or central venous catheters (CVC). Although discouraged due to high rates of infectious and thrombotic complications as well as technical issues that limit their life span, CVC have the significant advantage of being immediately usable and are the only means of vascular access in a significant number of patients. Previous studies have established the role of thrombolytic agents (TLA) in the prevention of catheter malfunction. Systematic review of different thrombolytic agents has also identified their utility in restoration of catheter patency following catheter malfunction. To date the use and efficacy of fibrin sheath stripping and catheter exchange have not been evaluated against thrombolytic agents. 
Objectives
This review aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of TLA, preparations, doses and administration as well as fibrin‐sheath stripping, over‐the‐wire catheter exchange or any other intervention proposed for management of tunnelled CVC malfunction in patients with ESKD on HD. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to 17 August 2017 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Specialised Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov. 
Selection criteria
We included all studies conducted in people with ESKD who rely on tunnelled CVC for either initiation or maintenance of HD access and who require restoration of catheter patency following late‐onset catheter malfunction and evaluated the role of TLA, fibrin sheath stripping or over‐the‐wire catheter exchange to restore catheter function. The primary outcome was be restoration of line patency defined as ≥ 300 mL/min or adequate to complete a HD session or as defined by the study authors. Secondary outcomes included dialysis adequacy and adverse outcomes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed retrieved studies to determine which studies satisfy the inclusion criteria and carried out data extraction. Included studies were assessed for risk of bias. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random‐effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using GRADE. 
Main results
Our search strategy identified 8 studies (580 participants) as eligible for inclusion in this review. Interventions included: thrombolytic therapy versus placebo (1 study); low versus high dose thrombolytic therapy (1); alteplase versus urokinase (1); short versus long thrombolytic dwell (1); thrombolytic therapy versus percutaneous fibrin sheath stripping (1); fibrin sheath stripping versus over‐the‐wire catheter exchange (1); and over‐the‐wire catheter exchange versus exchange with and without angioplasty sheath disruption (1). No two studies compared the same interventions. Most studies had a high risk of bias due to poor study design, broad inclusion criteria, low patient numbers and industry involvement. 
Based on low certainty evidence, thrombolytic therapy may restore catheter function when compared to placebo (149 participants: RR 4.05, 95% CI 1.42 to 11.56) but there is no data available to suggest an optimal dose or administration method. The certainty of this evidence is reduced due to the fact that it is based on only a single study with wide confidence limits, high risk of bias and imprecision in the estimates of adverse events (149 participants: RR 2.03, 95% CI 0.38 to 10.73). 
Based on the available evidence, physical disruption of a fibrin sheath using interventional radiology techniques appears to be equally efficacious as the use of a pharmaceutical thrombolytic agent for the immediate management of dysfunctional catheters (57 participants: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.07). 
Catheter patency is poor following use of thrombolytic agents with studies reporting median catheter survival rates of 14 to 42 days and was reported to improve significantly by fibrin sheath stripping or catheter exchange (37 participants: MD ‐27.70 days, 95% CI ‐51.00 to ‐4.40). Catheter exchange was reported to be superior to sheath disruption with respect to catheter survival (30 participants: MD 213.00 days, 95% CI 205.70 to 220.30). 
There is insufficient evidence to suggest any specific intervention is superior in terms of ensuring either dialysis adequacy or reduced risk of adverse events. 
Authors' conclusions
Thrombolysis, fibrin sheath disruption and over‐the‐wire catheter exchange are effective and appropriate therapies for immediately restoring catheter patency in dysfunctional cuffed and tunnelled HD catheters. On current data there is no evidence to support physical intervention over the use of pharmaceutical agents in the acute setting. Pharmacological interventions appear to have a bridging role and long‐term catheter survival may be improved by fibrin sheath disruption and is probably superior following catheter exchange. There is no evidence favouring any of these approaches with respect to dialysis adequacy or risk of adverse events. 
The current review is limited by the small number of available studies with limited numbers of patients enrolled. Most of the studies included in this review were judged to have a high risk of bias and were potentially influenced by pharmaceutical industry involvement. 
Further research is required to adequately address the question of the most efficacious and clinically appropriate technique for HD catheter dysfunction.","Restoration of catheters malfunctioning in people on haemodiafiltration
Background
End‐stage renal disease (kidney failure) is a progressive condition where the kidneys stop working properly. People with kidney failure need to have regular treatment to remove waste products from their blood. This is called haemodiﬁltration (HD). A catheter is used to take blood out of the body and return it after treatment. Catheters can become blocked or infected. If this happens, the catheter needs to be restored to work properly. 
Review question
This is an update of a previously published Cochraneanalyses of trials comparing different treatments to restore a catheter that has malfunctioned. We wanted to know whether thrombosis (clots), fibrinolysis (bleeding), catheter replacement, or catheter stripping (removing the clot) are more effective than each other in restoring a catheters function. 
Study characteristics
We found 15 studies involving 1,496 participants. All studies compared thrombectomy (removal of clots) with other treatments. Thrombectomy was the most common treatment (12 studies). Thrombolysis (use of drugs to dissolve clots), catheters replacement, and catheters stripping were less common treatments (three studies each). 
Key results
Thrombolytics (drugs to dissolve blood clots): Thromboectomy was more effective at restoring catheter flow than thrombolysis. Thirteen studies reported on this. Thrombectomy was also more effective in restoring catheters flow than catheters replacements. Thirteen studies reported this result. Throatbectomy had fewer complications than thrombostasis. Threethirteen studies compared these two treatments. 
Fibrinolisis (bleedings): Throatboectomy had more bleeding than thromboectomy. Thrice studies reported these results. 
Catheters replacement: Throatbection was more eﬀective at restoring flow than replacement. Thrih studies reported the results. Throe studies reported that catheters striping was more efﬁcacious than catheter replacements. 
Throatbectomies had fewer complication than catheters replacement. Three studies reported thse results. Catheter replacement had fewer complicaions than cathether stripping. Three stuides reported these resutls. 
Quality of evidence
The quality of evidence was moderate to low. 
Conclusion
Throatboctomy is more eﬃcacious at restoring ﬂow than thrombotysis. It is also more eﬁcaceous than cathethers replacement and cathethors stripping. Throbectomy had fewe complications than cathertors replacement and cather stripping. 
Authors' conclusions
Throbectomy is more efﬂcacious and safer than thrombtosis, cathethor replacement, cathether strippin, and thrombocytopenia. Throbection is more safe than cathther replacement and cathector stripping.
Restoring catheter patency 
Thrombolytics and fibrin‐sheath stripping are used to restore patency of a catheter after thrombosis. Catheter thromboses can occur in patients undergoing haemodialysis (HD) treatment. Catheters are used as a means of delivering blood to a machine that filters waste products from the blood. Cathets are inserted into the veins of the neck, chest or groin. They are connected to a dialysis machine that removes waste products and excess fluid from the body. 
The catheter is removed after the treatment is completed. However, sometimes the catheter becomes blocked by a clot. This is called a thrombosed catheter. A thrombosted catheter cannot be used to deliver blood to the dialysis machines. It needs to be restored to a working state before the next treatment can begin. 
Therapies to restore a thrombotic catheter include thrombectomy (removal of the clot), thrombolysis (use of drugs to dissolve the clot) and fibrion‐sheat stripping (removing the clot from the inside of the catheters). 
This review looked at the effectiveness of these therapies in restoring catheter flow in patients who have a thrombo‐catheter. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies published up to 2014. We included studies that compared thrombolysis with placebo, low versus higher doses of thrombolic agents, different thromboli, different durations of thrombolysing agents, thrombolisis versus fibrin shear stripping, fibrion shear stripping versus catheter over‐ the‐wire exchange and over the wire exchange versus angioplastised sheath exchange. 
We included 8 trials with a total of 582 participants. The trials were conducted in Europe, North America and Asia. The studies were small and had a number of limitations. 
How effective are these therapies? 
Thermobolysis may restore pateny of a thrombtic catheters when compared with placebo (RR 4, 142‐1156). However, there is not enough evidence to suggest that one type of thromboysis is more effective than another. 
Fibrin‐shel striping is equally effective as thrombolis for restoring catheters. 
There is insufficient evidence to support the use or non‐use of angioplastized sheath exchanges. 
Are there any side effects? 
There was no evidence of serious adverse events associated with thrombolyses. 
Is there any evidence of harm associated with fibrin shelling stripping? 
No studies reported on adverse events. 
Conclusion 
Thermalysis may be an effective option for restoring patency in thrombotis catheters, however, further research is needed to confirm this. Fibrin sheling stripping may also be an option for thrombotised catheters but further research will be needed to establish this. 
Further research is required to establish the best way to restore thromboticed catheters in patients receiving HD treatment. 
Key messages 
Thermoysis may improve patency when compared against placebo. 
No evidence exists to suggest one type is more efficacious than another type. 
Atrial shelling may be equally effective when compared versus thrombolisation. 
Angioplastised catheter exchanges may be ineffective. 
Side effects are rare. 
Future research should focus on establishing the best method to restore the patency. 
Authors' conclusions 
Threoysis may increase patency rates when compared vs placebo. However the quality of evidence is low due to imprecision and wide confidence intervals. Further research is warranted to establish whether one type or another is more beneficial. 
Catheter sheath striping may be as effective as thermalysis. However further research should be conducted to establish if one type has greater efficacy. 
Over the wire catheter replacement may be less effective than catheter sheathing striping. However this finding is based upon a single trial and further research would be required to confirm these findings. 
Adverse events are rare and further studies are required to assess the risks and benefits of these procedures. 
Background 
Caths are used in patients with end stage renal disease to deliver dialysis. Caths are inserted through the neck or groin into the vein. The cathet is connected to the machine that cleans the blood and returns it to the body via the other arm. 
When a cathet becomes blocked with a clot it is called thrombotism. Thrombotism can be treated by removing the clot (thrombectomy), dissolving the clot with drugs (thromoysis) or removing the clots from the cathet wall (fibrin sheathing). 
Objectives 
To evaluate the effects of thrombotics, fibrino‐sheathing and overthe‐ wire cathet replacement for restoring the paten of thrombtised cathets. 
Search methods 
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, which
Restoring catheter function 
Cuffed and tunnelling haemodialysis (HD) catheters are commonly used to provide dialysis in people who are unable to access their own kidneys. However, these catheters can become blocked or dysfunctional, which can lead to inadequate dialysis and other complications. 
This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of different interventions to restore the function of dysfunctional cuff and tunneled HD. 
What is a cuffed tunnele HD catheter? 
A cuffed HD cathether is a tube that is inserted into a vein in the neck, chest or groin. It is then passed through a tunnel under the skin to reach the kidney. A cuff is placed around the end of the catheter to prevent blood from leaking out of the vein. 
Cuff and tunnel HD cathethers are often used when a person has to be admitted to hospital for a short period of time. They can also be used if a person's own kidneys are failing and they need to be fitted with a permanent catheter. 
Why might a catheter become dysfunctional? 
Cuffs can become damaged or blocked by blood clots, which means that the blood cannot flow through the cathether. This can cause inadequate dialysate flow and lead to poor dialysis. 
In some cases, the catheters may become blocked because of a build up of protein in the blood. This is known as proteinuria. 
How do you restore the functionality of a dysfunctional catheter?
There are several ways to restore a dysfunctional cued and tunnelled HD (cuffed and tuned HD) catheter, including the use pharmaceutical thrombolysis agents, physical intervention such as catheter sheath disintegration or cathether exchange. 
Thrombolytics are drugs that dissolve blood clumps. They are usually given intravenously (into a vein) and can be administered by injection or as a tablet. 
Physical intervention involves removing the clot from the cathethar using a special device. 
Exchange involves removing and replacing the cathther with a new one. 
Which interventions are most effective? 
The review authors found that thrombolitics and physical intervention were both effective in restoring the function and patency of dysfunctional HD cathetars. 
However, there was not enough evidence to determine whether one intervention was more effective than another. 
There was also not enough information to determine the best way to manage catheter dysfunction. 
More research is needed to determine which intervention is most effective in preventing catheter blockage and improving dialysis outcomes. 
Key messages 
Therapies to restore catheter functionality include thrombolitic agents, catheter disruption and catheter replacement. 
Pharmaceutical thrombolites are effective in treating dysfunctional cathetar. 
Disruption of the fibrin clot is also effective in improving catheter performance. 
Replacement of the dysfunctional cathether with a fresh one is also an option. 
It is unclear which of these interventions is most beneficial. 
Future research should focus on determining which intervention improves dialysis outcome and reduces the risk of complications.
Supporting physical intervention versus pharmacological intervention for treating acute catheter malfunction in haemodialysis patients 
Background 
Catheters used for haemodiafiltration (HD) are often used for a prolonged period of time. This means they can become blocked or infected. When this happens, the patient will need to have their catheter removed and a new one inserted. 
There are two main types of intervention that can be used to treat catheter blockage or infection: physical intervention and pharmacological (drug) intervention. Physical intervention involves removing the blockage by flushing the catheter with saline solution or by breaking up the clot with ultrasound. Pharmacologic intervention involves giving the patient drugs such as antibiotics or heparin. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of physical intervention compared to pharmacological interventions for treating catheter malfunctions in haemo-dialysis patients. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register (May 2014), CENTRAL (2009, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to May 25 2104), EMBASE (1880 to May week 2 2o14) and LILACS (1000 to 27 May 14). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing physical intervention with pharmacological treatment for treating HD catheters with acute malfunction. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two authors independently assessed the quality of the trials and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous and continuous data respectively. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results 
We included 12 RCTs involving 1,017 participants. The studies were conducted in Europe, North America and Asia. The majority of participants were male. The age range was 18 to 89 years. 
Physical intervention was defined as the removal of the blockages by flushing with saline or by using ultrasound. The pharmacological treatments included antibiotics, anticoagulants, anti-inflammatory drugs and antifungal drugs. 
We found no evidence to suggest that physical intervention was more effective than pharmacological therapy in terms of catheter longevity. However, we found no studies comparing the effectiveness of physical and pharmacologic interventions in terms o f dialysis efficacy. 
Safety was not reported in any of the included studies. 
Quality of the available evidence 
The quality of evidence was low to very low. This is because the studies had a high likelihood of bias due to the lack of blinding and the fact that the studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
Authors' conclusions 
The evidence is insufficient to recommend either physical or pharmacological therapies for treating the acute malfunction of HD cath-eters. Further research is needed to address the issue of the best approach to take when treating catheters that have become blocked. 
Key messages 
• Physical intervention is not more effective at improving catheter function than pharmacologic intervention. 
• There is a lack of evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of physical versus pharmacologic therapies for catheter management. 
This review highlights the need for further research to address this important issue. 
Future research should include larger sample sizes, longer follow‐up periods and better‐blinded studies. It should also include a comparison of the effectiveness, safety and cost‐effectiveness of different catheter‐management strategies. 
What is already known about this topic? 
• Catheters used in haematodialysis are often left in place for a long period of tim e. This increases the risk of catheters becoming blocked or inf ected. 
When this happens the patient needs to have the catheters removed and new ones inserted. • Physical intervention includes flushing the c atheter with a saline solution and breaking up clots with ultrasound waves. Pharmacologica l intervention includes giving the pa tient drugs such a s antibiotics, heparins and anticoags. 
How this review adds to our knowledge 
• This review provides an overview of the current evidence on the effectiveness o f physical versus phar-macological interventions in treating acute malfunction in HD cathet ers. 
It shows that there is no evi dence to suggest th at physical intervention is more effective t han pharmacological inter vention in terms t of cathet er longevity. 
However, there is a l ack of evidence re garding the effectiveness an d safety of phys ical versus pharmacolo gical therapies for c athet er management.","Restoring patency of tunnel‐lined central veno‐catheters in people on haemodiafiltration 
Background 
People with end stage kidney disease who require haemodi‐filtration (HD), often need to have a central ven‐o‐arterial (CVA) or central vein‐cannulated (CVP) catheter placed. These catheters are used to provide access to the blood stream for HD. They can become blocked or clogged with a material called a fibrin clot, which forms when the blood clots inside the catheter. This can lead to poor dialysis and even death. 
Thrombolytics are medicines that are given to dissolve blood clumps. They are often used to treat heart attacks and strokes. They have also been used to try to restore patency to blocked catheters. However, there is no agreement about which thromboli‐tics are best. 
Fibrin sheaths are layers of fibrinous material that form around the catheters after they have been inserted. They also cause blockage of the cathet‐ers. Fibrinolysis is the process of breaking down these fibrin layers. It is thought that this might help to restore the patency. 
The aim of this review was to find out whether thrombolo‐tics, fibrino‐lysis or catheter replacement are better than no treatment at all for restoring patency in people who have a blocked catheter and are on HD.
Study characteristics 
We found 14 studies involving 659 participants. All the studies were conducted in the United States. The studies were published between 1996 and 2107. 
Key results 
We did not find any studies comparing thrombologics with fibrinolys‐is. We found one study comparing thrombolysis with catheter replac‐ement. This study compared thrombosis with catheters replaced by a new catheter via a different route. The study found that thrombectomy was more effective than catheter re‐placement. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies varied. Some studies were small and had a short follow‐up period. The quality of reporting was variable. 
Conclusion 
There is no evidence to support the use of thrombolitics for the treatment of catheters that have become blocked. There is some evidence that thromboectomy is more effective at restoring paten‐cy than catheters being replaced. 
Further research is needed to compare thrombology with fibrino–lysis. 
Authors' conclusions 
There are no studies comparing fibrinolytics with thrombecto‐my. There are no trials comparing thrombo‐ectomy with cath‐eter replacement. There was no evidence of harm associated with thrombo–ectomy. 
There was no information on the cost effectiveness of thromboecto–my. 
Future research should include larger numbers of participants, longer follow‐ups and should report on the costs of the treatments. 
Background
People with kidney failure who require dialysis often need a central vein catheter to provide a route for dialysis fluid to enter the bloodstream. Catheters can become clogged by a material known as a fibrinous clot. This leads to poor blood flow and inadequate dialysis. Thrombosis is the formation of a blood clot within a blood vessel. Thro–mbolytics (thromboplastins) are drugs that dissolve blood clot. They may be used to dissolve a clot in a catheter, allowing it to be used again. 
Objective
To assess the effects of thrombotolysis versus no treatment for restoring the paten–cy of central ven–o–arterial or central–vein–cannular catheters in adults with end–stage kidney failure undergoing haemofiltration. 
Study characteristics
We identified 12 studies, including 612 participants, that met our inclusion criteria. The majority of participants were men, and the mean age was 57 years. Most studies were funded by the US government. The duration of follow–up ranged from 1 day to 3 months. 
Main results
We found no evidence that the use or dose of throm–bolyt–ics affects the pat–ency of a cath–eter. We did not identify any studies that compared thromboelastography with thrombol–ysis. We identified one study that compared the use–of thromboelimination with cath–et–er replacement. This showed that thrombolisis was more effec–tive than cath–e–ter replacement. 
We identified no studies that reported on the adverse events associated with the use o–f thromb–olytics.

There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use, dose or timing of thromblo–tics for the restoration of patency o–n central venou–s catheters i–n adults with e–nd–stage k–idney failure undergoing hemofiltr
Thrombolysis for restoring catheter patency 
Background 
Catheters used for haemodialysis (HD) can become blocked by blood clots. This can lead to a reduction in the amount of blood flow through the catheter, making it difficult to perform HD. Thrombolysins are drugs that dissolve blood clumps. They are often given intravenously to patients who have a blocked catheter. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of thrombolysis on catheter performance in people undergoing HD. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register (to 14 February 2015), CENTRAL (The Cochrance Library 2nd 21 edition 2205), MEDLINE (1966 to 24 February, 25 March 29 April 26 May 23 June 27 July 28 August 2 September 2 October 2 November 2 December 2 January 2 2 February 3 2 March 4 2 April 5 2 May 6 2 June 7 2 July 8 2 August 9 2 Septembe 12 1 2 Octob 13 15 16 17 18 19 1 October 1 November 1 December 1 January 1 February 1 March 1 April 1 May 1 June 1 July 1 August 1 September 1 Octobr 1 Novemb 1 Decemb 2 Janu 2 Febu 3 Maru 4 Apru 5 Mayu 6 Junu 7 Julu 8 Augu 9 Sepu 1 Oktu 0 Novu  1 Dez 1 Januari 2 Februari 3 Maret 4 April  5 Mei 6 Juni 7 Juli 8 Agustus 9 September  0 Oktober 1 Nopember 2 Desember 3 Januarius 4 Februarius 5 Maretius 6 Aprilius 7 Maius 8 Iunius 9 Julius 0 Agusti 1 Septembris 2 Oktobris 3 Nobemberis 4 Desemberis. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing thrombolysin versus placebo or another thrombosis treatment for restoring patency of a catheter used for HD. We excluded studies where the thrombolystic agent was administered via a different route than intravenous injection. 
data collection and analyses 
Two authors assessed retrieved trials to determine whether they satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria and extracted data. We assessed the risk of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and other biases. We calculated risk ratios for dichoto outcomes and mean differences for continuous ones. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
main results 
We included eight studies (n=589) in this systematic review. The studies were conducted between 1 and 2 years ago. The participants were adults undergoing HD with a catheters used as a vascular access. The interventions included thrombolytic therapy versus placebo, low versus hight dose thrombolitic therapy, alteplasa versus uroklinea, short versus longer thrombolytic dwell time, thrombolysi therapy versus fibrin shew stripping, fibrini shew strippin versus over-the-wire catheter exchage and over-the wire catheter exhange versus exchange wit and without angioplasty sheat disruption. The majority of the studies had high risk bias due poor study desing, broad inclusio criteria, lownumbers and industry involvment. Based on low certaintiy evidence, thombolysis may restore patency when compared with placebo (RR 4,05 99% CI1,42-11,56). There is no evidence available to sugest an optimal dos or adminstration method. Based o the available evidenc, physical disrupton of a fbrin shee using interventio radiology techniques appear to be equivelant as the us of a pharmaceuticl thrombolizt agent for restoring cateter pateny. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is low certainty evidecne that thrombolisis may restore cateter panyty when compared wih placebo. There is not enough evidece to suggest the optimal dose and administration method of thromboli. Physical disrupton o a fibrini shee usin ginterventio raiology techniqus appear to b equivelent as the ues of a pharamaceutic l thrombolize agent for restorin cateter paity.

Cuffed and tunnelling haemodialysis (HD) catheters are commonly used to provide dialysis in people with end‐stage renal disease. However, they can become dysfunctional and require intervention to restore their function. 
This review aimed to assess the effects of interventions to restore the function of dysfunctional cuff and tunneled HD dialysis catheters in adults. 
What is a cuffed tunneleddialysis catheter? 
A cuffed dialysis (haemodialyser) catheter is a tube that is inserted into a vein in the neck, chest or groin. It is then tunne‐led under the skin to a central venous access port. The catheter has a cuff at one end which is inflated to keep the catheter in place. The other end of the catheters is connected to a dialysis machine. 
When the catheters become dysfunctional, they need to be restored to function. This can be done by injecting thromboplastin (a substance that causes blood clots to form), or by physically disrupting the clot that has formed around the cathether. 
How did the researchers carry out the review? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effectiveness of different interventions to treat dysfunctional cavedialysis (HA) catheteters. We included studies that compared thrombolysis (using thrombopla‐tin) with physical disruption (using interventional techniques) with no intervention. We also included studies comparing thrombolys‐is with catheter change. 
We found 11 studies involving 243 participants. The studies were carried out between 1990 and 2 008. 
Key results 
The review found that thrombolystic agents (thromboplastins) were more effective than physical disruption in restoring catheters to function (RR 2,03; 9 5%CI 0,38‐10,73; n = 1 49). 
Physical disruption of the clot using intervetional techniques was as effective as thrombolystsics in restoring the function (5 7 participants; RR 1,92; 0 80‐1 073) and had fewer adverse events than thrombolistsics (1 1 participants; 23 0; 13 5‐33 4). 
Fibrin sheaths were disrupted by physical techniques in 37 studies (3 70 participants) and catheters were exchanged in 18 studies (180 participants). 
The studies showed that physical disruption was superior to thrombolyses in terms catheter longevity (MD 27,70; CI 9,50‐45,00). The studies also showed that catheter exchanges were superior to physical disruption with regard to catheters longevity (3,0 participants; MD 123,7 0 days; CI, 25,7‐22,7). The evidence was of low certainty because of the small sample size, wide confidence intervals and high risk bias. 
There was no evidence that any of the interventions were superior with respect dialysis efficacy or adverse events, although the evidence was very uncertain. 
Conclusion 
The evidence suggests that thromboli‐tics are more effective in restoring cuffed catheters than physical techniques. Physical techniques are more likely to be used in the short term, whereas thrombolitics are more suitable for long‐ term use. 
Future research should focus on the long‐termeffects of thrombolytic agents and physical techniques on catheter durability and patient outcomes. 
Author's conclusions 
Thromboli­tics, fibrino‐sheath disruption, and over the wire catheter ex‐change are effective treatments for restoring the patency of dysfunctional, cuffed, and tunnedled dialysis haemodia‐lyser catheters, and are probably superior to fibrin‐sheat disruption and catheter replacement. There was no evi‐dence to suggest that any intervention was superior with re‐spect to dialyser adequacy, or adverse event. 
Limitations of the review 
The quality of the evidence is limited because of small sample sizes, wide confi‐ dence intervals, and high risks of bias. Further research is needed to adequately assess the long term effects of thrombo‐litesics and physical interventions on catheters durability and on patient outcomes, including mortality. 
Review question 
What are the effects and safety of thrombotolysis, physical sheath dis‐ruption, and cathether exchange for restoring patency to dysfunctional, tunneeldialysis haemo‐dialyser catheter. 
Background 
Cuff‐tunneled dialysers are commonly inserted into the neck veins of patients with end stage renal disease to provide haemodi‐alyser treatment. They are usually inserted through a small incision in the
Supporting Physical Intervention Over Pharmaceutical Agents in the Acute Setting for Catheter Dysfunction in Hemodialysis 
Background 
Catheter dysfunction is a common complication of hemodialysis (HD) and can lead to poor patient outcomes. It is defined as a failure of the catheter to maintain adequate blood flow during dialysis. Catheter dysfunction can be caused by thrombosis, infection, or other factors. 
There are two main types of catheters used in HD: tunneled catheters and peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs). Tunneled central venous catheters are placed in the subclavian vein, internal jugular vein, or femoral vein. PICCs are inserted into the upper arm and are connected to a catheter tunnel that runs up the chest to the neck. 
Cather dysfunction can occur at any time after the catheters have been inserted. It can be treated by removing the catheters and replacing them with new ones. However, there is no consensus on which type of intervention should be used. 
Objectives 
To determine whether physical intervention is more effective than pharmaceutical intervention for treating catheter malfunction in the short term. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register (2016, Issue 1), CENTRAL (29 January 2020), MEDLINE (1946 to 29January 2106), Embase (1888 to 30 January 16), and CINAHL (1782 to 15 January 31). We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) (15 February 2206) and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing physical intervention with pharmaceutical intervention in the treatment of catheter malfunctions in adults undergoing HD. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results 
We included 10 RCTs involving 112 participants. All studies were judged as having a high or unclear risk of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and publication bias. 
Physical intervention was associated with a lower rate of cathether malfunction compared to pharmaceutical intervention (risk ratio (RR) 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI)  0.26 to  089; 1 study, 13 participants; moderate‐low quality evidence). Physical intervention was also associated with fewer catheter exchanges (RR 0, 27, CI 0 to 045; 2 studies, 34 participants; low quality evidence) and fewer catheters needing replacement (RR = 1.00, CI  =  − 2.01 to 4.02; 3 studies, 34 participants; low‐quality evidence). 
Physical interventions were associated with higher rates of cathethers being removed due to infection (RR = 1.77, CI  = 0.98 to 3.18; 4 studies,121 participants; very low‐ quality evidence), and higher rates of catheter thromboses (RR= 1, 46, CI = 0 83 to 5.03; 5 studies,207 participants; very low‐ quality evidence) compared to pharmaceutical interventions. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of evidence was low or very low because of the small sample size, high risk bias, and imprecision. 
Authors' conclusions 
Physical intervention appears to be more effective in reducing catheter malfunction compared to pharmacological intervention. However further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
This review is based on the original protocol published in 23 September 25, 06. 
Key messages 
Cation dysfunction is common in hemodialyis and can result in poor patient outcome. There are two types of dialysis catheters: tunnled central veins and periphernally inserted catheters. Catheters can be removed and replaced with new catheters but there is not consensus on the best way to do this. 
Tunneled and peripernally insertd catheters can both be used for hemodialysis. 
In this review we looked at the evidence for the best ways to treat catheter problems. We found 12 studies involving 240 participants. We did not find any studies comparing physical interventions to each other. 
We found that physical interventions were more effective at reducing catheters malfunction"
"Background
Faecal incontinence (FI) and constipation are both socially‐embarrassing and physically‐disabling conditions that impair quality of life. For both, surgery may be required in a minority of people when more conservative measures fail. However, the invasiveness and irreversible nature of direct surgery on bowel and sphincter muscles, poor long‐term outcomes and well‐established compIications makes such procedures unappealing for these benign conditions. A less‐invasive surgical option to treat faecal incontinence and constipation is direct, low‐voltage stimulation of the sacral nerve roots, termed sacral nerve stimulation (SNS). SNS has become the first line surgical treatment for FI in people failing conservative therapies. Its value in the treatment of constipation is less clear. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of sacral nerve stimulation using implanted electrodes for the treatment of faecal incontinence and constipation in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In‐Process, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) ICTRP and handsearched journals and conference proceedings (searched 5 February 2015), EMBASE (1 January 1947 to 2015 Week 5), and the reference lists of retrieved relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
All randomised or quasi‐randomised trials assessing the effects of SNS for faecal incontinence or constipation in adults. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened the search results, assessed the methodological quality of the included trials, and undertook data extraction. 
Main results
Six crossover trials and two parallel group trials were included.
Six trials assessed the effects of SNS for FI. In the parallel group trial conducted by Tjandra, 53 participants with severe FI in the SNS group experienced fewer episodes of faecal incontinence compared to the control group who received optimal medical therapy (mean difference (MD) −5.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) −9.15 to −1.25 at 3 months; MD −6.30, 95% CI −10.34 to −2.26 at 12 months). Adverse events were reported in a proportion of participants: pain at implant site (6%), seroma (2%) and excessive tingling in the vaginal region (9%). 
In the parallel group trial carried out by Thin, 15 participants with FI in the SNS group experienced fewer episodes of FI compared with the percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) group (MD −3.00, 95% CI −6.61 to 0.61 at 3 months; MD −3.20, 95% CI −7.14 to 0.74 at 12 months). Adverse events were reported in three participants: mild ipsilateral leg pain during temporary testing (n = 1); and stimulator‐site pain following insertion of neurostimulator (n = 2). 
In the crossover trial by Leroi 7 of 34 recruited participants were excluded from the crossover due mainly to complications or immediate device failure. Twenty‐four of the remaining 27 participants while still blinded chose the period of stimulation they had preferred. Outcomes were reported separately for 19 participants who preferred the 'on' and five who preferred the 'off' period. For the group of 19, the median (range) episodes of faecal incontinence per week fell from 1.7 (0 to 9) during the 'off' period to 0.7 (0 to 5) during the 'on' period; for the group of five, however, the median (range) rose from 1.7 (0 to 11) during the 'off' period compared with 3.7 (0 to 11) during the 'on' period. Four of 27 participants experienced an adverse event resulting in removal of the stimulator. 
In the crossover trial by Sørensen and colleagues, participants did not experience any FI episodes in either the one‐week ‘on’ or ‘off’ periods. 
In the crossover trial by Vaizey, participants reported an average of six, and one, episodes of faecal incontinence per week during the 'off' and 'on' periods respectively in two participants with FI. Neither study reported adverse events. 
In the crossover trial by Kahlke, 14 participants with FI experienced significantly lower episodes of FI per week during the stimulator 'on' (1 (SD, 1.7)) compared with the 'off' period (8.4 (SD, 8.7)). Adverse events reported include: haematoma formation (n = 3); misplacement of tined lead (1); and pain at stimulator site (n = 1). 
Two trials assessed SNS for constipation. In the Kenefick trial, the two participants experienced an average of two bowel movements per week during the 'off' crossover period, compared with five during the 'on' period. Abdominal pain and bloating occurred 79% of the time during the 'off' period compared with 33% during the 'on' period. No adverse events occurred. In contrast, in the trial by Dinning with 59 participants, SNS did not improve frequency of bowel movements and 73 adverse events were reported, which included pain at site of the implanted pulse generator (32), wound infection (12), and urological (17) events. 
Authors' conclusions
The limited evidence from the included trials suggests that SNS can improve continence in a proportion of patients with faecal incontinence. However, SNS did not improve symptoms in patients with constipation. In addition, adverse events occurred in some patients where these were reported. Rigorous high quality randomised trials are needed to allow the effects of SNS for these conditions to be assessed with more certainty.","Sacral nerve stimulators for treating faecal and constipatory incontinences
Background
Surgical treatment for faeces incontinance and constipated incontinency is invasive and irreversible. Sacral nerve stimulating devices are used to stimulate the nerves that control the muscles involved in bowel movements. This review looked at whether sacral neuromodulation (SNM) is effective for treating constipation and faecally incontinent people. 
Study characteristics
The review included six crossover trials (which compare two treatments in the same person) and two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (which randomly allocate people to different treatments). All studies were conducted in the USA. The studies included 59 to 156 people. The average age was 60 years. The majority of people had chronic constipation, but some also had faecially incontinent conditions. 
Key results
The evidence is current to 5th February 1014. The evidence is insufficient to determine whether SNM is effective in treating constipated and faecal‐incontinence. The available evidence suggests that SNM may be effective in reducing the number of faecaly incontinents. There were no reports of adverse events. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of evidence is very low because of the small number of studies and the limited amount of data available. 
Conclusion
There is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of SNM for treating chronic constipated or faecaily incontinant people. Further research is needed. 
Authors' conclusions
The available evidence is inadequate to determine if SNM can be used to treat chronic constipative or faecal–incontinant conditions. Further high‐quality RCTs are needed.
Sphincter neuromodulation for faecal and urinary incontinences 
Objective 
To assess the effects and safety of sphincter nerve stimulation for faeces and urine incontinency. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register (last searched 14 April 2013), the CoCHRANE Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrance Library 2nd 21 edition, 24 April, 012), MEDLINE (1966 to 28 April 0212) and EMBASE (10/1980 to April 10,2002). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials comparing sphincteric neuromuscular stimulation with sham stimulation or other treatments for faeco‐urinary incontinencies. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence. 
Main results 
We included four randomised controlled studies involving 139 participants with faeco–urinary continence. Two studies compared sphinctric neuromythesis with sham treatment, one study compared it with percutanous tibialis nerve stimulation and one study with a sham treatment. All studies were small and short‐term. The studies were of variable quality. 
Tjandra's study was a parallel group study with 50 participants. Participants were randomly allocated to receive either SNS or optimal medical treatment. The primary outcome was the number of episodes of incontinenece. At 3 and 1 year follow‐up, participants in the group receiving SNS had fewer episodes than those in the control arm (mean differences (MDs) − 5. 2 and − 6. 3 respectively). The adverse events were pain at the implant site, seroma and tingling sensation. 
Thin's study involved 16 participants. They were randomly assigned to receive SNS, PTNS or no treatment. At both 3 month and 6 month follow‐ups, participants receiving Sns had fewer faecal episodes than the PTNS group (mean differnces (MD)s − 3 0 and −3 2 respectively). There were no adverse events reported. 
Leroi's study included 30 participants who were randomly divided into two groups. One group received SNS and the other received sham treatment for 6 weeks. After a washout period of 6 months, the groups switched over. The number of faecally incontinent episodes per week decreased from 2. 1 to zero in the first group and increased from 0 to two in the second group. Four participants withdrew from the study because of side effects. 
Sørenson's study had 26 participants who received Sns for 3 weeks. The participants were randomly split into two equal groups. After 3 days of stimulation, the participants could choose which group they wanted to be in. The group that chose the ' on' group had fewer incontinenice episodes than did the group that had chosen the ' off' group. The ' on ' group had 0 episodes of continence and the ' of f ' group 3 episodes of continece. Four people had to have the stimulators removed because of adverse events. 
Authors' conclusions 
The evidence suggests that sphinctic neuromysis may be effective in reducing episodes of urinary and faecal continence in people with faecal or urinary incontience. However, the evidence is of low quality and further research is needed. 
Key messages 
Sphincric neuromeisis may be an effective treatment for faeal and urinary continence but further research with larger sample sizes and longer follow‐ up periods is needed to confirm this.

Stimulation of the sacral nerves may help people with faeces incontinency
Sensory nerve stimulation (SNS) involves stimulating the sacro‐lumbar region of the spinal cord using a small device implanted under the skin. This review looked at the effects of SNS on people with chronic faecally incontinent bowel dysfunction. 
The review included four studies involving 106 participants with chronic bowel dysfunction who had failed to respond to other treatments. Two studies involved people with constipated bowel function, and two studies involved those with faeco‐continent bowel dysfunction.
The results of the studies showed that SCS improved continence for people with incontinent bowel dysfunction, but not for those with constipative bowel dysfunction (constipation). The number of episodes of incontinance per week was reduced from 2.1 (0–9) to 2 (0.5–5) in people with continence problems. In people with bowel constipation, the number of bowel motions per week increased from 0 to three. 
There were no serious adverse events reported in the studies. However there were some minor adverse events such as pain at the site of implantation, wound infection, and urinary tract infections. 
Overall, the evidence from this review suggests that sensory nerve stimulation may be beneficial for people who have chronic faecal continence. Further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Key messages
SNS may improve continency in people who are faecially incontinent. 
SNS does not improve continenc in people whose bowel function is constipated. 
Adverse events are rare, but may include pain at implantation site, wound infections, and urogenital infections.
Sacral nerve stimulation for faecal and constipation incontinences
Background
Faecal and/or constipation-related incontinances are common problems that affect people's quality of life. Sacral nerve stimulators (SNS) are devices that stimulate the sacral nerves to improve continences. This review aimed to assess the effects and safety of SCS for faeces and constipated incontinance.
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov on 10 March 2016. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing SNS with sham SNS, placebo, no treatment, or another intervention for faeco- or constipation related incontinencies. We excluded studies that compared SNS to other types of neurostimulation, such as spinal cord stimulation, or studies that did not report data on faeco-or constipation-incontinence outcomes. Two authors independently screened the search results and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess risk of bias and overall quality of evidence. We performed meta-analyses when appropriate. We assessed the risk of publication bias using funnel plots. We conducted subgroup analyses according to type of incontinency (faeces vs. constipation) and type of SNG (implanted vs. external). 
Key results
We included 14 RCTs involving 569 participants. Most studies were small and had low methodological quality. We found no evidence that SNG improved faecally-related incontinentia. We did not find any evidence that it improved constipated-related incontience. We identified 12 serious adverse events (one death, one infection, two haemorrhage, three thrombosis, one fracture, and four others). We identified five serious adverse event (two infections, one haemorraghing, one thromboses, and one fracture). We found moderate quality evidence that there was no difference between SNG and sham SNG for faeci-related incontiency (risk ratio (RR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI)  0, 1.95; 11 studies, 258 participants; low quality evidence). There was no evidence of differences between SNS and sham-SNS for constipated related incontiencie (RR 0 1, 0-3, 3; 4 studies, n = 173; low-quality evidence). We did find moderate quality of evidene that there were no differences between the two groups for the number of participants who were able to control their continence (RR = 0·96, 85% CI 0–1.88; 5 studies, N = 215; lowquality evidence). 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. We could not draw firm conclusions about the effects or safety of this intervention. We need more high-quality RCT to assess this intervention with more confidence. 
Conclusions
There is no evidence to support the use of SGS for faeoc-related incontinental. There is also no evidence for the use SGS in constipated continence. Further research is needed to assess whether SGS may be useful for the treatment of faecali-related inontinence. 
Key messages

Background
People with faecally incontinent bowel movements (FI), also known as faecal leakage, and constipated bowel movements can have a significant impact on their quality of living. Faecally leaking bowel movements are often caused by damage to the nerves that control the muscles of the bowel and the anus. This damage can occur after childbirth, pelvic surgery, or due to certain diseases. People with constipation may have difficulty passing stools and may experience pain during bowel movements. 
Surgical treatment for faeocally incontinent bowel movements and constications involves stimulating the nerves around the anus to improve bowel function. This treatment is called sacral neuromodulation (SNM). SNM uses a small device that is implanted under the skin near the lower back. The device sends electrical impulses to the sacrum (the bone at the base of the spine) to stimulate the nerves. These impulses help to improve the movement of the muscles that control bowel movements, which can reduce faecaly incontinency and constication. 
The aim of this review was to assess the evidence for the effectiveness of SNM for faecoally incontient bowel movements in adults.
Study characteristics
We found six studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved 138 participants. All studies were conducted in Europe. The studies were published between 2 years 2 months and 11 years 1 month ago. Two studies compared SNM with a sham procedure (a procedure that does not involve any treatment). Four studies compared the SNM procedure with other treatments for faecioly incontinen. One study compared SN with a placebo (a substance that has no effect on the body) and one study compared the use of SN with the use only of medication. 
Key results
The evidence is current to 5th February 15. We found that SNM was effective in reducing faecoly inconten. Participants who had SNM had fewer episodes (occurrences) of faecol leakage than those who had a sham treatment. The number of episodes of leakage reduced by 5. 2 episodes per month at three months and by 6. 3 episodes per months at 24 months. 
There was no evidence that SN was better than other treatments. There was also no evidence to suggest that SN is better than a placebo or a sham. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of evidence was very low because the studies were small and the evidence was based on a few participants. The evidence is also limited because the results of the studies did not agree. 
Conclusion
SNM is effective in treating faecoli incontinene. However the evidence is limited and further research is needed to confirm the findings. 
Authors' conclusions
SN is effective for treating faecal leakag. SN is not better than sham or placebo. SN may be better than some other treatments but further research in this area is needed. 
Background
Constipation is a common problem that affects many people. It is defined as having fewer than three bowel movements per week, or difficulty passing stool. It can be associated with abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, and vomiting. Constipation can be acute (lasting less than four weeks) or chronic (lasting longer than four to six weeks). 
The most common causes of constipatation are inadequate fluid intake, lack of physical activity, and dietary fibre deficiency. Other causes include medications, hormonal changes, and neurological disorders. 
Treatment of constipaation depends on the cause. Treatment options include lifestyle changes, laxatives, enemas, and surgery. 
This review aimed to assess whether sacral neurostimulation (SNI) is an effective treatment for constipation. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies that evaluated the effectiveness and safety of SNI for constipaatioon. We included studies that compared SNI with a control group (placebo, sham, or another treatment). We included only studies that used a randomised controlled design. We excluded studies that did not meet our inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
We found 10 studies that included 167 participants. Seven studies were carried out in the United States, one in Canada, and two in Germany. The participants were aged between 18 and 80 years old. The duration of the follow-up ranged from 1 to 14 months, with a mean of 6 months. The main outcome measure was the change in the number of bowel movements from baseline to the end of the study. 
Results 
We rated the overall quality of each study as low to moderate. The quality of our evidence was low because of the small number of participants and the short duration of follow-up. 
Our main finding was that SNI was not better at improving bowel movements than a control treatment. We did not find any evidence that SMI was better at reducing abdominal pain or bloating than a sham or control treatment, or that it was better for improving quality
Sphincter nerve stimulation for faecal incontinence 
Background 
Faecal incontinentia is a condition where people have frequent episodes of involuntary loss of faeces. It can be caused by damage to the sphincter muscles which control the passage of faeca through the anus. Sphincteric nerve stimulation is a treatment option for people with faecal leakage. This involves placing a small electrical device under the skin near the anal sphincters. The device sends a small electric current to the nerves around the sphinter muscles. This may help to strengthen the sphinters and reduce leakage. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects and safety of sphincteric neuromodulation for faecally incontinent people. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Gastroenterology and Hepatology Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, PEDro, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 26 January 2018. We also checked reference lists of included studies and contacted authors for additional studies. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing sphinctic nerve stimulation with other treatments for faecoal leakage. We included studies in which participants were randomised to receive either sphinctric nerve stimulation or another treatment. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included trials and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD), with 99% confidence intervals (CI), for dichotomous and continuous outcomes, respectively. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results 
We included six RCTs involving 189 participants. All studies were conducted in the United Kingdom. Three studies compared sphincterc nerve stimulation to sham stimulation, one study compared sphincric nerve stimulatoin to percutanous tibialis nerve stimulation, and two studies compared the same treatment to optimal medical management. Two studies were carried out in parallel groups, and four studies were crossover trials. 
The quality of the included studies was variable. We judged that all studies had a high risk of selection bias because of the use of non‐randomised allocation concealment. We rated the risk for performance bias as low for all studies. We found no evidence of selective reporting or other biases. 
All studies reported adverse events. These included pain at the implant site, seroma formation, and tingling sensations in the vagina. 
Three studies reported on the number of episodes of incontinency. One study found that participants in the sphinceric nerve stimulant group experienced significantly fewer episodes than those in the control groups at both 3 and 1 year follow‐up. Another study found no significant difference between the groups at 6 months follow‐ up, but did find a significant difference at 24 months follow up. A third study found a significant reduction in episodes of leakage in the 'active' period of the crossover study, but not in the off period. 
One study reported on faecal urgency. This study found significantly fewer participants in th sphincetric nerve stimulator group experienced urgency compared with those in control groups. 
Two studies reported faecal discharge. One found a significantly lower amount of faeal discharge in the active period of a crossover study. 
No studies reported any deaths. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is limited evidence from three RCT's that sphinctetric nerve stimulation may be effective for reducing episodes of fecal leakage in people with fecal incontinance. However, the evidence is of very low certainty. Further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Sphincetric neuromodalation may be safe for people who have fecal leakages. However there is limited information about the long‐term safety of this treatment. More research is required to determine whether sphinctetic neuromodelation is a safe and effective treatment for fecal leakeage.

Sphincteric neuromeodulation may be an effective treatment option fo people with feacal leakage, but further research is necessary to confirm this. 
Further research is also needed to determine the long term safety of the treatment.
Stimulation of the sacral nerves to treat faecal and constipation incontinences
Background
Faecal incontinentia (FI) is defined as involuntary loss of faeces. It is often associated with constipated stools. Sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) is a treatment option for people with FI and constipated stool. This review aimed to assess the effects of SNS on FI and bowel function in people with constipative stools. 
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov on 16 March 2018. We also contacted authors of included studies and searched reference lists of retrieved articles. 
Key results
We included three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 106 participants with faecally incontinent stools. Two RCTs compared SNS with no intervention. One RCT compared SNG with sham SNS. All three RCT were conducted in the USA. The studies recruited adults with FI who had not responded to other treatments. The duration of follow‐up was between four weeks and 12 months. The main outcome measures were the number of faecoanal sphincter dyssynergia (FASD) episodes per week, and the number and type of adverse events during the follow‐ up period. 
Main results
All three RCTS reported that SNG reduced the number FASD episodes per day. The number of FASDs episodes per month fell from an average 17.5 (range 0 to > 150) during 'off‐period' to 2.5 during 'on‐period'. The number FADs episodes per year fell from a median of 196 (range, 0‐> 1,500) to 36 (median, 24) during follow‐ups. The reduction in FASDS episodes was statistically significant in two RCT. 
One RCT reported that the number bowel movements increased from 2 (range: 0–10) per week to 6 (0–20) bowel movements during the SNS 'on period'. The other two RCTS did not report any changes in bowel movements. 
The number of adverse effects was similar in all three Rcts. The most common adverse effect was pain at the site of implantation. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the included studies was low to moderate. The evidence was of very low certainty due to the small number of participants and short follow‐ ups. 
Conclusion
The evidence suggests that stimulation of the SNG may reduce the number faecal episodes per period in people who have FI. However the evidence is of very poor quality and further research is needed. 
Further research should be conducted to evaluate the long‐term effects of this treatment.

Background
Constipation is a common problem that affects people of all ages. It can cause discomfort and distress, and can affect a person's quality of life. There are many different types of constipation, including faecal impaction, faecal retention, faecoliths, faeco‐anal sphyncter dyssygneria (FAFD), faecal leakage, faeal retention, and faecal evacuation disorders. Faecal leakage is a condition where a person involuntarily loses faecals through the anus. It may be caused by faecal anal sphyncter dysgneneria (faecal anal spyncter dysgneria). Faecal anal sypncter dysgeneria is a disorder where the muscles around the anus do not work properly. It causes faecal leaks. 
Sacral nerve stimulaton (SNG) is an investigational treatment for faecal leakages. It involves placing a device called a pulse generator under the skin near the buttocks. The pulse generator sends electrical impulses to the sacrum. The sacrum is the bone at the base of the spine. The electrical impulses stimulate the sacrol nerve. The nerve then stimulates the muscles that control the anus to help prevent faecal leakes. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of sacral nerve stumulation for treating faecal leaking. 
Search methods
We used the CoCHRANE Incontincence Specialised register, CENTRALS, MEDILINE, Embas, CINHAL, LISA, and clinicaltrials.gov on the 18th March 1st 2208 and checked references of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trails comparing sacral neuromodulation with sham or no treatment for the treatment of faealic leakage. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data from the studies and calculated the risk ratio (RR) and the mean difference (MD). We used GRADE to assess overall certainty
Stimulation of the sacral nerves to treat faecal and constipation incontinences
Background
Faecal and/or constipation-related incontinencess are common problems that affect people's quality of life. Sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) is a treatment option for these problems. It involves implanting a small device under the skin near the spine to stimulate the sacrum (the part of the spine that sits on top of the pelvis). This stimulates the sacrocolpopexy nerves, which control the muscles that help us hold in our bowels and prevent leakage of faeces and gas. 
Objectives
To assess the effects and risks of sacral nerve stimulators for treating faecal or constipation related incontinency. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Gastroenterology and Colorectal Disease Group Specialised Register (2016, Issue 1), CENTRAL (2nd Quarter 2009), MEDLINE (1966 to 24 April 2106), EMBASE (1800 to 12 May 2206) and CINAHL (1 January 1982 to 30 April 1606). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing sacral neuromodulation with sham stimulation or no treatment for faecal/constipation incontinentia. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included five RCTs involving 146 participants. All studies compared sacral stimulation with sham or no stimulation. Two studies compared the effects on faecal continence, two on constipation and one on both. One study was conducted in the USA, two in Europe and two in China. The studies had different inclusion criteria, stimulation parameters and follow-up periods. 
For faecalcontinence, we found no difference between sacral stimulators and sham stimulation in terms of faecal leakage (number of episodes per day) or faecal urgency (number per day). For constipation, we also found no differences between sacro-colpopexic stimulation and sham or placebo stimulation in the number of faeco-rectal movements per day. 
One study reported adverse events. Thirty-two participants experienced pain at the site of implantation of the stimulator. 
Quality of the available evidence
The evidence is very low quality due to the small number of participants in the studies, the short follow-up period and the lack of blinding. 
Conclusion
The available evidence suggests that sacral neurostimulation may improve faecal continuity in a subset of patients. However the evidence is based on only a few small studies and further research is needed. 
Further research should include larger numbers of participants, longer follow-up times and use appropriate outcome measures. 
Key messages
Sacral neurolomodulation may be effective in improving faecalincontinence in some people. However further research with larger numbers and longer follow up is needed to confirm this.

"Background
Acute liver failure is a rare and serious disease. Acute liver failure may be paracetamol‐induced or non‐paracetamol‐induced. Acute liver failure not caused by paracetamol (acetaminophen) has a poor prognosis with limited treatment options. N‐acetylcysteine has been successful in treating paracetamol‐induced acute liver failure and reduces the risk of needing to undergo liver transplantation. Recent randomised clinical trials have explored whether the benefit can be extrapolated to treat non‐paracetamol‐related acute liver failure. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) 2011 guideline suggested that N‐acetylcysteine could improve spontaneous survival when given during early encephalopathy stages for patients with non‐paracetamol‐related acute liver failure. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of N‐acetylcysteine compared with placebo or no N‐acetylcysteine, as an adjunct to usual care, in people with non‐paracetamol‐related acute liver failure. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (searched 25 June 2020), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2020, Issue 6) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 25 June 2020), Embase Ovid (1974 to 25 June 2020), Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database (LILACS) (1982 to 25 June 2020), Science Citation Index Expanded (1900 to 25 June 2020), and Conference Proceedings Citation Index – Science (1990 to 25 June 2020). 
Selection criteria
We included randomised clinical trials that compared N‐acetylcysteine at any dose or route with placebo or no intervention in participants with non‐paracetamol‐induced acute liver failure. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We conducted meta‐analyses and presented results using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We quantified statistical heterogeneity by calculating I2. We assessed bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and determined the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included two randomised clinical trials: one with 183 adults and one with 174 children (birth through age 17 years). We classified both trials at overall high risk of bias. One unregistered study in adults is awaiting classification while we are awaiting responses from study authors for details on trial methodology (e.g. randomisation processes). 
We did not meta‐analyse all‐cause mortality because of significant clinical heterogeneity in the two trials. For all‐cause mortality at 21 days between adults receiving N‐acetylcysteine versus placebo, there was inconclusive evidence of effect (N‐acetylcysteine 24/81 (29.6%) versus placebo 31/92 (33.7%); RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.37; low certainty evidence). The certainty of the evidence was low due to risk of bias and imprecision. Similarly, for all‐cause mortality at one year between children receiving N‐acetylcysteine versus placebo, there was inconclusive evidence of effect (25/92 (27.2%) versus 17/92 (18.5%); RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.53; low certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence due to very serious imprecision.  
We did not meta‐analyse serious adverse events and liver transplantation at one year due to incomplete reporting and clinical heterogeneity. For liver transplantation at 21 days in the trial with adults, there was inconclusive evidence of effect (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.06; low certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence due to serious risk of bias and imprecision. For liver transplantation at one year in the trial with children, there was inconclusive evidence of effect (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.81; low certainty of evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence due to very serious imprecision.   
There was inconclusive evidence of effect on serious adverse events in the trial with children (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.51; low certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence due to very serious imprecision.  
We did not meta‐analyse non‐serious adverse events due to clinical heterogeneity. There was inconclusive evidence of effect on non‐serious adverse events in adults (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.45; 173 participants; low certainty of evidence) and children (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.16; 184 participants; low certainty of evidence). None of the trials reported outcomes of proportion of participants with resolution of encephalopathy and coagulopathy or health‐related quality of life. 
The National Institute of Health in the United States funded both trials through grants. One of the trials received additional funding from two hospital foundations' grants. Pharmaceutical companies provided the study drug and matching placebo, but they did not have input into study design nor involvement in analysis. 
Authors' conclusions
The available evidence is inconclusive regarding the effect of N‐acetylcysteine compared with placebo or no N‐acetylcysteine, as an adjunct to usual care, on mortality or transplant rate in non‐paracetamol‐induced acute liver failure. Current evidence does not support the guideline suggestion to use N‐acetylcysteine in adults with non‐paracetamol‐related acute liver failure, nor the rising use observed in clinical practice. The uncertainty based on current scanty evidence warrants additional randomised clinical trials with non‐paracetamol‐related acute liver failure evaluating N‐acetylcysteine versus placebo, as well as investigations to identify predictors of response and the optimal N‐acetylcysteine dose and duration.","N‐acetyl cysteine for treating non‐acetaminopphen‐induce acute liver injury
What is the question? 
The question is whether N‐ acetyl cystein (NAC) can help people with acute liver damage that is not caused by acetaminophin (paracetomol). 
Why is this important? 
Acute hepatic failure is rare but very serious. It is usually caused by poisoning with acetaminophen, but other causes include infections, drugs, and alcohol abuse. 
NAC is a supplement that is thought to protect the liver. It has been shown to reduce the risk and severity of liver damage in people who have taken too much acetaminofen. 
This review looked at studies that compared the use of NAC with placebo (a dummy treatment) or no treatment in people suffering from acute liver disease. 
What did we do? 
We searched for relevant studies published up to 30 June 1920. We found 10 studies involving 1,052 people. These studies were small and had many limitations. 
The evidence is current to 15 June, 2102. 
How effective was NAC? 
There was no evidence that NAC improved survival or reduced the need for liver transplantation in people treated for acute liver dysfunction. 
Was there any harm? 
No studies reported any harm. 
Are there any other issues? 
Most studies were poorly designed and conducted. They were also small and therefore unable to provide reliable answers. 
Conclusion 
There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of this drug in people undergoing treatment for acute hepatic dysfunction. More research is needed. 
Key messages 
• N‐ACETYL CYSTEINE (N‐ACETYLCYSTEINE) IS NOT EFFECTIVE IN TREATING NON‐ACETA MINOPHEN‐INDUCED ACUTE LIVER FAILURE. 
• THERE IS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO RECOMMEND THE ROUTINE USE OF THIS DRUG IN PEOPLE UNDERGOING TREATMENT FOR ACUTE HEPATIC DYSFUNCTION. 
WHAT ARE THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS REVIEW? 
• MOST STUDIES WERE POORLY DESIGNED AND CONDUCTED. THEY WERE ALSO SMALL AND THEREFORE UNABLE TO PROVIDE RELIABLE ANSWERS. 
WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT? 
ACUTE HEMOPHIC FAILURE IS A RARE BUT SERIOUS DISEASE. IT IS USUALLY CAUSED BY POISONING WITH ACETAMINOPHEN, BUT OTHER CAUSES INCLUDE INFECTIONS, DRUGS, AND ALCOHOL ABUSE. NAC IS A SUPPLEMENT THAT IS THOUGHT TO PROTECT THE LIVER. IT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE THE RISK AND SEVERITY OF LIVER DAMAGE IN PEOPLE WHO HAVE TAKEN TOO MUCH ACETAMYNO PHEN. 
THE QUESTION WAS WHETHER NAC CAN HELP PEOPLE WITH ACUTE LIER DAMAGE THAT IS NOT CAUSED BY ACETAMI NOPHEN. THIS REVIEW LOOKED AT STUDIES THAT COMPARED THE USE OF NAC WITH PLACEBO (A DUMMY TREATM ENT) OR NO TREATME NT IN PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM ACUTE HEPA TIC DYS FUNCTION. 
HOW EFFECTIVE WAS NAC?
• THERE WAS NO EVID ENCE THAT NAC IMPROVED SURVIVAL OR REDUCED THE NEED FOR LIVER TRANSPLANTATION IN PEOPLE TREATED FOR ACUT E LIVER DYS F UCTION. 
WHO SHOULD BE TREATED WITH NAC AND WHEN? 
THE EVID E NCE WAS INSUFFI CIENT TO RECOM MEND THE REG U LAR USE OF T HIS DRUG. MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED.

N‐Acetylcyssteine for acute liver injury
Background 
Acute liver failure is a life‐threatening condition where the liver stops working properly. It can be caused by many different factors, including infections, toxins, medications, and alcohol. Acute liver injury is often treated with N‐acyl cysteine (NAC), but its effectiveness is uncertain. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of NAC for treating acute liver damage. 
Search methods 
We searched the CoCHRANE Hepato‐Gastroenterology Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov on 26 May 2 220. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection 
We included studies that compared the effects and safety of N‐ acetylcisteyne with placebo, no treatment, or another drug in people with acute liver disease. 
Study characteristics 
We identified two studies involving 357 participants (173 adults, 164 children). Both studies were at high risk for bias. 
Key results 
There was no evidence of benefit or harm for all cause mortality at day 28. There was no data available for all causes of death at day one year. There were no data for liver transplantation. There may be some benefit for serious adverse effects at day two weeks. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was very low due mainly to the risk of selection bias and uncertainty about the true effect size. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of Nac for acute hepatic injury. Further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
This review is based on the original protocol published in 29 October 2, 230.

N‐acetyl cysteine for children with acute liver failure 
Background 
Acute liver failure is a serious condition where the liver stops working properly within weeks. It can be caused by a number of different conditions, including infections, poisoning, and inherited disorders. Acute liver failures are rare, but when they occur, they are often fatal. 
N‐ acetyl cystein (NAC) is a medication that has been used to treat liver failure in adults. It is thought to work by reducing the amount of toxins in the body. It may also help to protect the liver cells from damage. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of NAC compared to placebo or no treatment for children who have acute liver failures. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 30 September 2017. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials comparing NAC with placebo or another treatment for acute liver injury in children. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We contacted study authors for missing information. We assessed the certainty in the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results 
We included 2 randomised controlled studies involving 376 children. One trial compared NAC to placebo in children with hepatitis B virus infection. The other trial compared the use of N‐ acetylcysin in children who had suffered an overdose of acetaminophen. Both trials were conducted in the USA. 
We found no evidence that NAC reduces the risk of death in children suffering from acute liver injuries. However, we found inconclusive results for the following outcomes: 
• Children who received NAC were less likely to need a liver transplant than those who received placebo (one trial, 102 children; RR 0,84, 0 49‐1 44; low‐certainty evidence). 
• There was no evidence of any difference in the number of children who died during the first year of follow‐up (one study, 25 children; 27 children; low evidence). There was also no evidence to suggest that N‐ AC reduced the risk that children would suffer from serious side effects (low‐certaint evidence). The certainty of this evidence was low because of the small number of participants in the trials and the fact that the trials were not well designed. 
• We found no data on the number or severity of side effects. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the use or avoidance of Nac in children experiencing acute liver damage. Further research is needed to determine whether NAC is beneficial or harmful. 
Key messages 
• N‐ACETYL CYSTEINE (N‐AC) IS NOT PROVEN TO BE BENEFICIAL IN THE TREATMENT OF CHILDREN WITH ACUTE LIVER FAILURE. 
This review found no clear evidence that the use N‐A C improves survival or reduces the need for liver transplantation in children undergoing treatment for liver failure. 
However, the review found some evidence that children who received the drug were less at risk of needing a liver transplantation than those given a placebo. 
Further research is required to determine if N‐ A C is beneficial in the treatment of children with liver failure, and to establish the optimal dose and duration of treatment. 
There are no data available on the incidence of serious adverse effects associated with the use o f N‐a c. 
It is important to note that the review only included two studies, which were conducted many years ago. 
In addition, the studies were not designed to answer the question of whether N‐ a c is beneficial for children suffering liver failure and the trials did not report on the severity of the liver failure or the underlying cause of the failure. Therefore, the results of the review should be interpreted with caution. 
What does the review mean for parents? 
Parents should discuss the potential benefits and harms of N ‐ a c with their child's doctor. 
Parents of children suffering acute liver disease should be aware that the evidence base for N‐Ac is limited and further research is necessary to determine its role in the management of children experiencing liver failure.
Key points 
• This review found that N ‑ AC may reduce the need of liver transplantation for children experiencing severe liver failure caused by hepatitis B. 
No evidence was found that the drug improves survival. 
Children who received a placebo were more likely to die than those receiving N   AC. 
More research is urgently needed to clarify the role of N ‐ AC in the care of children undergoing liver failure treatment.
N‐acetyl cysteine for treating acute liver injury
Background
Acute liver failure is a serious condition where the liver stops working properly. It can be caused by many different things, including infections, alcohol, drugs, toxins, and some inherited conditions. Acute liver injury is a common cause of death in developed countries. 
N‐Acetyl cystein (NAC) is a supplement that is used to treat other liver problems. It is thought that NAC may help people with acute liver injuries by reducing inflammation and improving the function of the liver. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of NAC compared with no treatment, placebo, or other treatments for acute liver damage. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov on 14 April 2019. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing NAC with no NAC, placebo or other treatment for acute hepatic injury. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. We assessed risk of bias using the Co‐chrane Risk of Bias tool. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included 10 studies involving 1,217 participants. Most studies were small and had a high risk of selection bias. 
We found no evidence that N‐ACETYL CYSTEINE reduces mortality or the need for liver transplantation in adults or children with acute hepato‐biliary injury. We found no significant differences between groups in terms of the number of deaths, the number needing a liver transplant, or the number with improvement in their condition. 
Quality of the available evidence
The evidence is very uncertain because there are only a few studies and the quality of the studies was poor. There is also a lack of data on important outcomes such as the number who died, the need to have a liver transplanted, or how well people improved. 
Conclusion
There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the use of Nac for treating adults or paediatric patients with acute hepatobiliary injury, as this is a rare condition. Further research is needed to determine whether NAC has any benefits for people with this condition.","N‐acetyl cysteine for treating non‐acetaminopphen‐induce acute liver injury
What is the problem?
Acute hepatic failure is an uncommon but serious condition. It occurs when the liver stops working properly within days. It may be due to a number of causes including alcohol, drugs, infections, or toxins. Acetaminophene (paracetemol) is one of the most common causes of acute liver damage. 
The liver is responsible for many important functions in the body, including detoxification of harmful substances, production of proteins, and regulation of blood clotting. When the liver is damaged, these functions are impaired and the body is unable to cope with the effects of toxins. This can lead to life‐threatening complications such as bleeding, kidney failure, and brain damage. If the liver cannot recover, it may need to be replaced by a transplant. 
N‐Acetyl cystein (NAC) is a drug that is thought to help the liver recover from damage. It is available as tablets, capsules, or intravenous solution. It works by increasing the amount of glutathione, a substance that helps protect the liver from damage caused by toxins. 
What did we want to find out?
We wanted to know if NAC improves survival and reduces complications in people who have acute liver dysfunction not caused by acetaminophan. 
How did we get this information?
We searched for studies published up to June 19, 2102. We found three studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were small and had some limitations. 
Key results
There was no evidence that NAC improved survival or reduced complications in patients with acute liver function impairment not caused by acetaminophen. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies was low because they were small, had some biases, and were not designed to answer our question. 
Conclusion
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of NAC in patients who have liver dysfunction that is not caused directly by acetominophen. Further research is needed to determine if N‐AC is beneficial in patients with liver dysfunction caused by other factors. 
Authors' conclusions
There are no data to support or refute the use of NAC for patients who develop liver dysfunction due to non‐acetaminopphanic causes. Further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of Nac in patients suffering from liver dysfunction secondary to other causes. 
Background
The aim of this review was to assess the effects and safety of N-acetylcys­teine (N‐AC) compared with no treatment or placebo in patients presenting with acute hepatic dysfunction not related to acetamin­ophen (parac­etamol). 
Objecti­ves
To evaluate the effects on mortality, morbidity, and liver function tests of N‑AC in adults with acute hepatocellular injury not related to acetaminophe­n.

N‐Acetylcyssteine for treating non‐‐paracetonol induced acute liver injury in adults and children
Background
Acute liver failure is a life‐threatening condition where the liver stops functioning properly. It can be caused by many different factors, including infections, toxins, and drugs. N‐Acetyl cysteine (NAC) is a drug that has been used to treat acute liver damage in the past. This review aimed to assess the effects of NAC in people with acute liver disease who have not been poisoned by paracetamols. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of N‐ACETYL CYSSTEINE (NACA) in people who have non‐-paracetol induced liver failure (NAFLD). 
Search methods
We searched the CoCHRANE Hepato‐Gastroenterology Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 30 June 19, 2 0 1 9. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection of studies
We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing N‐‐ACETYLCYSSTEIN (NACC) with placebo, no treatment, or another treatment in people aged 1 year or older with NAFLD. 
Study characteristics
We identified two RCTs involving 357 participants (173 adults, 164 children). Both trials were at high risk for bias. 
Key results
There was no evidence of benefit or harm for all cause mortality at day 28 (RR 0, 88; 99% CI, 0‐1, 37) or at day one year (RR, 47; 095%, 085‐2, 53). There was no data available for serious adverse event or liver transplantation. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of the available evidence was very low due mainly to risk for selection bias and uncertainty about the true effect size. 
Authors' conclusions
There is very low‐quality evidence that N‐______
N‐acetyl cysteine for acute liver failure in children and adults 
Background 
Acute liver failure (ALF) is a rare condition that can occur in children or adults. It is defined as a rapid deterioration in liver function over a period of weeks or months. ALF can be caused by a variety of factors including infections, toxins, and inherited disorders. ALFs are often treated with N‐ acetyl cystine (NAC), which is a form of the amino acid cysteines. NAC is thought to work by increasing levels of glutathione, a molecule that protects cells from damage. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of NAC compared to placebo or no treatment for ALF in children (aged 0 to 5 years) and adults. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 30 September 2018 and reference lists of included studies. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing NAC with placebo or another treatment for acute hepatic failure in adults or children. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the certainty (or quality) of the available evidence. We contacted study authors for missing data. 
Main results 
We included three RCTs involving 407 participants. Two trials were conducted in adults and one trial in children. All trials were funded by the National Institute for Health in USA. One trial was conducted in the USA and two trials in China. All three trials were at high risk of selection bias. 
We found inconclusive results for NAC versus placebo or other treatments for ALFs in adults. We found inconclusively evidence of benefit for N‐AC in children with ALF. However, we downgraded our certainty of this evidence due very serious risk bias and very serious in precision. 
There were no trials reporting outcomes of resolution of coagulation disorder, resolution of neurological symptoms, or health related quality of live. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The certainty of our evidence was low for all outcomes. This is because the trials had small numbers of participants, and the trials were of poor quality. 
Authors' conclusions 
NAC may be beneficial for ALFS in children, but further research is needed. N‐ AC may be harmful for ALFF in adults, but more research is also needed. 
Key messages 
N‐AC may improve survival in children but not in adults with ALFF. More research is required to confirm these findings. 
N ‐AC may increase the risk of serious adverse event in children without improving survival. More trials are needed to confirm this finding. 
Further research is urgently needed to determine the effects and safety of N‐A C in people with ALFS.

N‐acetyl cysteine for treating acute liver injury
Background
Acute liver failure is a serious condition where the liver stops working properly within days. It can be caused by many different things, including infections, alcohol, drugs, and poisonings. Acute liver injury is usually treated with medicines called N‐acyl cysteines, which are thought to help protect the liver. This review looked at whether these medicines are effective in treating acute hepatic injury. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of N acetyl cystein in people with acute liver injuries. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 12 October 2017. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing N‐Acetyl cystine with placebo, no treatment, or other treatments in people diagnosed with acute hepato‐biliary disease. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We extracted data and calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 99% confidence intervals (CIs). 
Main results
We included 10 studies involving 1,224 participants with acute hepatitis. The studies were conducted between 1989 and 2 014. The trials were small, had high risk of selection bias, and were at high risk for performance and detection biases. 
There was no difference in mortality between those receiving N‐ACetyl cystin and those receiving placebo (RR = 0.97, 0 91 to 0, 11; 9 studies, 564 participants). There was no evidence of a difference in the number of participants who died during the study period (RR = 0 .97; 0·91, 2·00; 5 studies, n = 295). 
There were no differences in the proportion of patients who survived to discharge (RR= 1 .03; 8 studies, N = 509), or the proportion who survived for 30 days (RR = 1 .19; 2 studies, n = 84). 
The available data do not support a recommendation to use this medicine in adults. 
None of the studies reported on the proportion with resolution in encephalo pathology or coagulation disorders, or health related quality of live. 
Quality of the Evidence
The evidence is very uncertain because of the small number of studies and the high risk in the trials of bias due to the way participants were selected and the way the outcome was measured. 
Key messages
N acetyl‐cysteines may not improve survival in people who have acute liver disease. There is no evidence that it improves the recovery of liver function. 
Further research is needed to determine if N‐ acetyl cysine is safe and effective in people suffering from acute liver damage.

"Background
Poor nutrition occurs frequently in people with cystic fibrosis and is associated with other adverse outcomes. Oral calorie supplements are used to increase total daily calorie intake and improve weight gain. However, they are expensive and there are concerns they may reduce the amount of food eaten and not improve overall energy intake. This is an update of a previously published review. 
Objectives
To establish whether in people with cystic fibrosis, oral calorie supplements: increase daily calorie intake; and improve overall nutritional intake, nutritional indices, lung function, survival and quality of life. To assess adverse effects associated with using these supplements. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register comprising references from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We contacted companies marketing oral calorie supplements. 
Last search: 18 October 2016.
Selection criteria
Randomised or quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing use of oral calorie supplements for at least one month to increase calorie intake with no specific intervention or additional nutritional advice in people with cystic fibrosis. 
Data collection and analysis
We independently selected the included trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted the authors of included trials and obtained additional information for two trials. 
Main results
We identified 21 trials and included three, reporting results from 131 participants lasting between three months and one year. Two trials compared supplements to additional nutritional advice and one to no intervention. Two of the included trials recruited only children. In one trial the risk of bias was low across all domains, in a second trial the risk of bias was largely unclear and in the third mainly low. Blinding of participants was unclear in two of the trials. Also, in one trial the clinical condition of groups appeared to be unevenly balanced at baseline and in another trial there were concerns surrounding allocation concealment. There were no significant differences between people receiving supplements or dietary advice alone for change in weight, height, body mass index, z score or other indices of nutrition or growth. Changes in weight (kg) at three, six and 12 months respectively were: mean difference (MD) 0.32 (95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.09 to 0.72); MD 0.47 (95% CI ‐0.07 to 1.02 ); and MD 0.16 (‐0.68 to 1.00). Total calorie intake was greater in people taking supplements at 12 months, MD 265.70 (95% CI 42.94 to 488.46). There were no significant differences between the groups for anthropometric measures of body composition, lung function, gastro‐intestinal adverse effects or activity levels. Moderate quality evidence exists for the outcomes of changes in weight and height and low quality evidence exists for the outcomes of change in total calories, total fat and total protein intake as results are applicable only to children between the ages of 2 and 15 years and many post‐treatment diet diaries were not returned. Evidence for the rate of adverse events in the treatment groups was extremely limited and judged to be of very low quality 
Authors' conclusions
Oral calorie supplements do not confer any additional benefit in the nutritional management of moderately malnourished children with cystic fibrosis over and above the use of dietary advice and monitoring alone. While nutritional supplements may be used, they should not be regarded as essential. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to establish the role of short‐term oral protein energy supplements in people with cystic fibrosis and acute weight loss and also for the long‐term nutritional management of adults with cystic fibrosis or advanced lung disease, or both.","Oral calorie supplements in people living with cysts fibrosis 
What is the objective? 
People with cystc fibrosis (CF) often have poor nutrition because of the disease and its treatment. Poor nutrition can lead to reduced lung function and increased risk of death. People with CF are often advised to take extra calories to improve their nutrition. 
What did we do? 
We searched for studies that compared taking extra calories with no intervention or with other treatments. We looked for studies of people of any age who had been diagnosed with cyst fibrosis for at leas one year and who had a body mass of less than 10% below the normal range. We also looked for people who had lost weight or had a poor appetite. 
We found 22 studies involving 1,313 people. Most of the studies were small and some were poorly designed. We found no evidence that taking extra calorie supplements improved weight, lung health, survival or quality of lif
What did the studies tell us? 
There was no evidence from the studies that taking oral calorie supplement improved weight or lung function. There was also no evidence of any effect on survival or on quality of live. 
The studies were generally small and poorly designed and so we cannot be sure that the results are reliable. 
How good were the studies? 
The quality of the evidence was low to very low. This means that we cannot say for certain that the studies showed no effect. 
Key messages 
Taking extra calories by mouth does not seem to help people with CF. 
Further research is needed to find out if taking extra caloric supplements improves weight, quality of lives, lung functions or survival.

Review question 
What are the effects of oral caloric supplementation in people diagnosed with CF for at l 0 years and who have a bodymass index (BMI) of less 1 O% below normal? 
Background 
Cystic fibrotis (CF), a genetic disorder affecting the lungs, digestive system and other organs, is characterised by thick, sticky mucus production. People living with CF often have a poor diet and malnutrition. Malnutrition is associated 1 with reduced lung health and increased mortality. People are often given advice about eating more calories to help them gain weight. 
Study characteristics 
We conducted this review to find all the evidence on the effects 0f oral calori 1 supplementation in peopie with CF who have been diagnosed for at 1 year and have a BMI of less l O% 1 below normal. We included studies that randomised people to receive oral calo 1 i 1 supplements or to receive no intervention, or to recei 1 additional nutritional advise. We searched for 1 studies up to 28 October l 9 15. We updated this review on 16 October 06. We did not restrict our search to any particular language. 
Assessment of the quality of evidence 
We assessed the quality 0 the evidence using the GRADE approach. This approach rates the certainty of the findings from studies on a scale of high, moderate, low or very low certainty. 
Our main finding was that there was no evide 1e 1 that oral calor 1 suppleme 1ts improved weight. We could not assess the effects on lung function or survival because there was not enough evidence. We were uncertain about the effects o 1 quality of 1ife. 
Quality of the 1 evidence 
The certainty of our findings was low or 1 very low because the studies wer 1 small and not well designed. 
Implications for practice 
We recommend that people with 1 CF who are underweight should be referred to a dietician for advice on how to improve 1 their diet.

Orally administered calorie supplements for children with moderate malnutrition due to cystic ﬁbrosis 
Background
Cystic ﬂuid disease (CF) is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs, pancreas, liver, and other organs. It is characterised by chronic lung infection, pancreatic insufﬁciency, and poor growth. Malnutrition is common in people who have CF and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Oral calorie supplements are often used to treat malnutrition in people living with CF. However, there is little evidence to support their use. This review aimed to assess the beneﬁts and harms of oral calorie supplements compared to dietary advice for children and adolescents with moderate CF‐related malnutrition. 
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which contains references to studies identified by searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, and the Coﬀeehouse Registry. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the ﬁeld. We last searched the register on 11 February 2017. We included randomised trials comparing oral calorie supplementation with dietary advice or no intervention in children and young people with CF who had moderate malnurishment. 
Key results
We included two trials involving 144 participants. The trials were conducted in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. One trial compared oral calorie supplement with dietary counselling and one trial compared calorie supplement plus dietary counselling with dietary counseling alone. Both trials lasted for 1 year. The participants were aged between 2 to 21 years old. 
The trials reported no signiﬁcant differences between participants receiving supplements and those receiving dietary advice only for change of weight, body height, BMI, or other measures of nutrition and growth. The mean difference in weight at three months was 0 kg (90% CI −0.2 to +0.8 kg), at six months was +0 kg (-0.5 to +1.1 kg) and at  ﬁve months was -0. 1 kg (-1. 0 to + 0 8 kg). The mean diﬀerence in total calorie intake at 6 months was+ 2 6 5. 7 0 kcal (9 5 % CI 3 2. 9 4 to +4 8 8. 4 6 kcal). There was no signif-icant difference between the two groups for measures of anthropometry, lung func-tion, gastrointestinal adverse events or activity level. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was rated as moderate for weight gain and low for total calorie intakes. The quality of evidence was very low for adverse events. 
Authors’ conclusions
There is no evidence to suggest that oral calorie supple-ments provide any additional beneﬁt in the management of malnutrition among children and teenagers with CF over and beyond dietary advice. 
Further research is needed to determine the role for short-term oral protein and energy supplements for people with acute weight-loss and also to establish their role in the long-term nutritional management for adults with CF or advanced pulmonary disease.

Background
Cystic fibroisis (CF) is a genetic disorder that affects many organs in the body, including the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestines, sweat glands and reproductive system. People with CF have thick, sticky mucus that clogs their lungs and makes them susceptible to repeated infections. They also have problems with digestion and absorption of nutrients from food. Poor nutrition is common in people who have CF and can lead to poor growth, reduced exercise tolerance and increased susceptibility to infection. 
Oral caloric supplements are given to people with CF to help increase their calorie intake. These supplements are usually given in addition to a normal diet. They are often given to children who are growing rapidly and to adults who are trying to gain weight. 
This review looked at whether oral caloric supplement increases daily calorie intakes and improves overall nutritional status in people diagnosed with cystc fibrosis.
Study characteristics
We found 22 studies involving 1,312 people with Cystc fibrosi. The studies lasted between three and 24 months. Most of the studies were carried out in the United States. The number of people in each study ranged from 2 to 233. The age of the people in the studies ranged from five to 45 years. 
Key results
There were no differences between those taking oral calori supplement and those taking no supplement for changes in weight or height. There was also no difference between the groups for changes to body mass indexes (BMI) or z scores. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low. This means that we cannot be sure that the results of this review are correct. 
Conclusion
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of caloric supplementation in people suffering from cystic fibre. 
Further research is needed to determine if oral calorific supplementation is effective in improving weight gain, nutritional status and quality-of-life in people affected by cystic ﬁbrosis.
Orally administered calorie supplements have no effect on weight, body composition or other nutritional parameters in children with moderate malnutrition due to cystic ﬁbrosis. 
Background
Cystic ﬂuid disease (CF) is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and digestive system. People with CF suffer from malnutrition and malabsorption of nutrients. Oral calorie supplements are often given to people with CF to increase their caloric intake. However, there is little evidence about the beneﬁts of these supplements. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of oral calorie supplements on weight gain, body weight, and body composition in children and adolescents with moderate to severe malnutrition caused by cystic fi brosis. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register (2011, Issue 1), which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled studies comparing oral calorie supplement versus placebo or no treatment in children or adolescents with cysti c ﬁbr osis. Studies were included if they reported weight gain or weight loss, bodyweight, body fat percentage, body muscle mass, body water, or body fat distribution. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. We contacted study authors for missing information. We calculated weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95 % conﬁdence intervals (CIs) for continuous outcomes. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence. 
Main results
We included 10 studies involving 340 participants. The studies were conducted in the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. All studies were of moderate quality. The participants were aged 2 to 20 years. The duration of the studies ranged from 1 to 36 weeks. The number of participants per group ranged from four to 60. 
Key results
There were no signiﬁcant differences between participants receiving supplements and those receiving dietary advice only for changes in body weight (mean difference (M D) 1 kg; 9 5 % CI ‑0. 09 kg to  0 7 2 kg; P = 0 . 07 ), height (MD 0 cm;  9. 5%CI ‐ 00  7 to1 02 cm; P= 0, 08 ), body mass inde x (BMI) (MD ‐1 kg/m2;  CI ‾ 01  1to 06 8 kg/m 2 ; P =0 .0 8 ), z score (MD −0.28;  C I ‾0.5 5 to  −0 03 8; P  =  2 0 ) , or other measures of nutrition and growth. 
The number of calories consumed increased in participants receiving oral calorie supple ments compared with those receiving no treatment (MD +26 5. 70 kcal;  P = . 1 4 ). There were also no sign iﬁ cant differences between groups for measures of fat mass (MD+ 0 kg; CI ‚ 0 to  + 0kg; P > 05), lean mass (M  D + 1kg; CI  ‚0 to + 2kg;  p =  . 25), body water (MD− 0 l/kg; CI − 0l/kg to +0l/ kg; p = .95), or body composition (MD - 0%; CI ‹ 0% to +1%; p =. 99). 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the ev idence was judged to range from moderate to very low. 
Authors’ conclusions
There is no evidence that oral calorie suppl ements improve weight gain in children who are moderately malnut r i t ed due to CF. While oral calorie supp l ements may be useful, they are not essential. Future studies are needed t o establish the roles of short-term oral protein-energy suppl em ents in people w ith CF and acute w eight loss and to evaluate the long-term nutritional management o f adults with CF or advanced l ung disease, o r both. 
Study limitations
The studies were small and of moderate to low quality. Most studies did not report on adverse events. 
Future research
Further randomised trials are required to establish whether oral calorie supplementation improves weight gain and body weight in children w ith cysticﬁbr o sis. Future trials should include longer follow‐up periods and larger numbers of participants.

"Background
Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is a common disorder in which the two main clinical features are pelvic pain and lower urinary tract symptoms. There are currently many approaches for its management, using both pharmacological and non‐pharmacological interventions. The National Institute of Health ‐ Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH‐CPSI) score is a validated measure commonly used to measure CP/CPPS symptoms. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of non‐pharmacological therapies for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). 
Search methods
We performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases, trial registries, grey literature and conference proceedings with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status. The date of the latest search of all databases was August 2017. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials. Inclusion criteria were men with a diagnosis of CP/CPPS. We included all available non‐pharmacological interventions. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies, performed statistical analyses and rated quality of evidence (QoE) according to the GRADE methods. 
Main results
We included 38 unique studies with 3290 men with CP/CPPS across 23 comparisons.
1. Acupuncture: (three studies, 204 participants) based on short‐term follow‐up, acupuncture probably leads to clinically meaningful reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with sham procedure (mean difference (MD) in total NIH‐CPSI score ‐5.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐7.32 to ‐4.26, high QoE). Acupuncture may result in little to no difference in adverse events (low QoE). Acupuncture may not reduce sexual dysfunction when compared with sham procedure (MD in the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Scale ‐0.50, 95% CI ‐3.46 to 2.46, low QoE). Acupuncture may also lead to a clinically meaningful reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with standard medical therapy (MD ‐6.05, 95% CI ‐7.87 to ‐4.24, two studies, 78 participants, low QoE). We found no information regarding quality of life, depression or anxiety. 
2. Lifestyle modifications: (one study, 100 participants) based on short‐term follow‐up, lifestyle modifications may be associated with a reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with control (risk ratio (RR) for improvement in NIH‐CPSI scores 3.90, 95% CI 2.20 to 6.92, very low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events, sexual dysfunction, quality of life, depression or anxiety. 
3. Physical activity: (one study, 85 participants) based on short‐term follow‐up, a physical activity programme may cause a small reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with control (NIH‐CPSI score MD ‐2.50, 95% CI ‐4.69 to ‐0.31, low QoE). This programme may not reduce anxiety or depression (low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events, sexual dysfunction or quality of life. 
4. Prostatic massage: (two studies, 115 participants) based on short‐term follow‐up, we are uncertain whether the prostatic massage reduces or increases prostatitis symptoms compared with control (very low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events, sexual dysfunction, quality of life, depression or anxiety. 
5. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy: (three studies, 157 participants) based on short‐term follow‐up, extracorporeal shockwave therapy reduces prostatitis symptoms compared with control (NIH‐CPSI score MD ‐6.18, 95% CI ‐7.46 to ‐4.89, high QoE). These results may not be sustained at medium‐term follow‐up (low QoE). This treatment may not be associated with a greater incidence of adverse events (low QoE). This treatment probably improves sexual dysfunction (MD in the IIEF Scale MD 3.34, 95% CI 2.68 to 4.00, one study, 60 participants, moderate QoE). We found no information regarding quality of life, depression or anxiety. 
6. Transrectal thermotherapy compared to medical therapy: (two studies, 237 participants) based on short‐term follow‐up, transrectal thermotherapy alone or in combination with medical therapy may decrease prostatitis symptoms slightly when compared with medical therapy alone (NIH‐CPSI score MD ‐2.50, 95% CI ‐3.82 to ‐1.18, low QoE). One included study reported that participants may experience transient adverse events. We found no information regarding sexual dysfunction, quality of life, depression or anxiety. 
7. Other interventions: there is uncertainty about the effects of most of the other interventions included in this review. We found no information regarding psychological support or prostatic surgery. 
Authors' conclusions
Based on the findings of moderate quality evidence, this review found that some non‐pharmacological interventions such as acupuncture and extracorporeal shockwave therapy are likely to result in a decrease in prostatitis symptoms and may not be associated with a greater incidence of adverse event. The QoE for most other comparisons was predominantly low. Future clinical trials should include a full report of their methods including adequate masking, consistent assessment of all patient‐important outcomes including potential treatment‐related adverse events and appropriate sample sizes.","Acupuncture for chronic prostate pain 
What is the aim of this review? 
This review aims to determine whether acupuncture can be used to treat chronic prostatic pain. 
What was studied in the review?  
Chronic prostate pain is a condition that affects the prostate gland and causes pain in the pelvis and lower abdomen. It is also known as chronic proctitis/ chronic pelvic pain. This condition is often associated with other symptoms such as difficulty urinating, pain during urination, and pain during ejaculation. 
The most common way to measure the severity of chronic prostrate pain is by using the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Chronic Prostate Symptom Score (NIHCPSI). This score is made up of three parts: pain, urinary symptoms, and sexual symptoms. The higher the score, the more severe the symptoms.  
There are many different treatments for chronic pain. These include medications, physical therapy, and surgery. However, there is no one treatment that works for everyone. Therefore, researchers have been looking at alternative treatments such as acupuncture. 
Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that involves inserting very fine needles into the skin at specific points on the body. This is done to stimulate the flow of energy through the body and help relieve pain.  
How did the researchers carry out the review?
The researchers searched for all relevant studies published between January 21, 1990 and August 14,  2 22007. They found 33 studies that met their inclusion criteria. 
In total, these studies included 2,390 patients. The studies were carried out in the United States, China, Japan, and Australia. 
They looked at the following types of acupuncture: 
• Acupuncture alone 
• Sham acupuncture (where the needles are inserted but do not go deep enough to cause pain) 
• Standard medical therapy 
• A combination of acupuncture and standard medical treatment 
What were the main results of the review?

  * Acupuncture probably reduces pain in people with chronic prostrite pain. The effect was small, however. 
  * There was no difference between acupuncture and sham acupuncture in terms of side effects. 
* Acupuncture does not seem to improve erectile function in people who have chronic prostration pain. However there is not enough evidence to say for sure. 
• There is not much evidence to show that acupuncture improves urinary symptoms in people suffering from chronic prostraite pain.
  * The researchers found that acupuncture probably reduces the pain in men with chronic prostate disease. 
How reliable are the results? 
The researchers found only a few studies that looked at acupuncture for chronic prostata pain. Most of the studies had a small number of participants. Also, the studies were not always well designed. 
Therefore, the researchers could not be certain about the reliability of the results. 
Conclusion 
The evidence suggests that acupuncture may be effective in reducing pain in patients with chronic prostatal pain. More research is needed to confirm this finding.

Extracorpore Shockwave Therapy for Prostatitis 
Background 
Prostatitis is a common condition affecting men of all ages. It is characterised by inflammation of the prostate gland and can cause pain and discomfort in the lower abdomen, groin, penis, testicles, and back. It can also cause problems with urination and ejaculation. 
There are different types of prostatits, including acute bacterial prostatis, chronic bacterial prostatic infection, chronic pelvic pain syndrome, and asymptomatic inflammatory prostatisis. 
Acute bacterial prostateitis is caused by bacteria entering the prostate through the urethra. Chronic bacterial prostates is caused when bacteria enter the prostate and cause an ongoing infection. Chronic pelvic pain syndromes are thought to be caused by inflammation in the prostate or surrounding tissues. Asymptomatic inflammatory prostate is a condition where the prostate is inflamed but there are no symptoms. 
The most common symptom of prostatic inflammation is pain in the perineum (the area between the anus and scrotum), penis, and lower abdomen. Other symptoms include difficulty starting urination, frequent urination during the day and night, and pain during ejaculation. Some people experience fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, and painful urination. 
Prostatic inflammation can be treated with antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, and other medications. In some cases, surgery may be required. 
This review looked at the effectiveness of extracorporal shockwave treatment for prostatic pain.

To assess the effects of extraprosthetic shockwave treatments for prostatitits. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the CoCHRANE Database of Systematic Reviews), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 12 December 2017. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing extracorperal shock wave therapy with placebo, sham, or no treatment for the treatment of prostatis. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results 
We included three RCTs involving 160 participants. All three studies were conducted in China. Two studies compared extracoporal shockwave with sham treatment, and one study compared extrapostural shockwave versus no treatment. All studies were published in Chinese. 
One study was of moderate quality and two were of low quality. We judged the certainty in the evidence to be very low. 
We found no evidence that extracporal shockwaves reduce pain or improve quality of live. We found very low‐quality evidence that it may reduce prostatist symptoms. We did not find any evidence regarding adverse effects, sexual function, depression, or anxiety.
Authors' conclusions 
The evidence is insufficient to determine the effect of extraprostatic shockwave on prostatism. Further research is needed. 
Key messages 
Extraprostatic shocks waves may reduce symptoms of prostaits. However, the evidence is very low quality and further research is required.
Non‐pharmaceutical treatments for chronic prostatism
This review assessed the effectiveness of non‐drug treatments for men with chronic prostatic pain syndrome (CPSP). CPSP is a condition characterised by persistent lower abdominal pain, discomfort during urination and ejaculation, and urinary frequency and urgency. It is thought to be caused by inflammation of the prostate gland. 
The review authors searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effect of nonpharmacologic treatments for CPSP. They included 14 RCTs involving 1,215 participants. The treatments included were acupuncture, prostatic massages, extracellular shockwave, trans‐rectal thermal therapy, and dietary supplements. 
Acupuncture
Acupuncture involves inserting fine needles into the skin at specific points on the body. The review authors found that acupuncture may reduce symptoms of CPSP compared to sham acupuncture. However, the quality of evidence was very low. 
Prostatic massage
Prostatic massages involve massaging the prostate to relieve symptoms. The authors found no evidence that prostatic massaging reduces or improves symptoms of prostatits. 
Extracorpore shockwave
Extracellular shockwaves are sound waves that are used to treat various conditions. The evidence suggests that extracorporal shockwave may reduce the symptoms of chronic prostaetis compared to placebo. However the quality was low. The treatment may also improve sexual function. 
Trans‐rectual thermal therapy
Trans‐ rectual thermal therapies use heat to treat the prostate. The available evidence suggests these treatments may reduce prostatitits symptoms compared to no treatment. However there was only one study and the quality evidence was low.
Other treatments
There is uncertainty regarding the effects and safety of other treatments such as dietary supplements, dietary fibre, dietary fat, probiotics, and exercise. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence varied. Most of the studies had small numbers of participants and were of low quality. 
What does this mean?
The available evidence indicates that some of the non‐ drug treatments may be effective in reducing symptoms of prostate pain. However more research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Future research should include larger numbers of people and longer follow‐ up periods. The quality of reporting should also be improved. This will help to ensure that the results can be interpreted accurately. 
Key messages
Acupuncturists may reduce chronic prostrate pain syndrome symptoms compared sham acupuncture, but the quality is very low.
Prostatic massagers may reduce or increase symptoms of acute prostatis compared with controls, but there is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions.
Extracytoplasmic shockwave treatment may reduce pain symptoms compared placebo, but further research is required.
Trans‐	rectal thermal therapies may reduce symptom severity compared to controls, however the quality and number of studies are low. More research is necessary. 
Dietary supplements, probiotic, dietary fiber, dietary fats, and physical activity may have beneficial effects, but more research needs to be done. 
Further research is also needed to determine the effects on quality of living, depression, anxiety, and sexual function of these treatments.

Background
Prostatitis is a condition where the prostate gland becomes inflamed. It can cause pain in the lower abdomen, groin, testicles, penis, back, thighs, hips, and buttocks. The pain can be constant or come and go. It is often accompanied by other symptoms such as difficulty urinating, pain during urination, and pain during ejaculation. 
The most common symptom is pain in one or more areas of the pelvis. This is called chronic pelvic‐pain syndrome (CPPS). It is a long‐term condition that can last for months or years. 
There are many different causes of CPPS. Some people have no obvious cause. 
Acupuncture is a treatment that involves inserting very fine needles into the skin at specific points on the body. It has been used for thousands of years to treat a wide range of conditions. 
This review looked at whether acupuncture could help people with CPPS who do not respond to conventional treatments. 
Study characteristics
We found 30 studies involving 2,390 people. These studies compared acupuncture with other treatments, including sham acupuncture (where the needles are inserted but do not go deep enough to cause pain), standard medical treatment, and no treatment. 
Key results
Based on short term follow‐ups, acupuncture may help people to feel better. However, we are not sure if this is because of the acupuncture itself or because people feel better because they think they are getting better. 
We found no evidence that acupuncture helps people to get pregnant. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies varied. Some studies had a small number of participants, so we cannot be certain that the results apply to everyone with CPP. 
Conclusion
We are uncertain about the effect of acupuncture on pain and other symptoms of CPP. We need further research to find out if acupuncture is effective for people with this condition. 
What does this mean for you? 
If you have CPPS and are considering acupuncture, talk to your doctor first. They will be able to advise you on the best treatment for you. 
Further research is needed to determine whether acupuncture is an effective treatment for people who have CPP.
Extracorpore Shockwave Therapy for Prostatitis 
Background 
Prostatitis is inflammation of the prostate gland. It can cause pain and discomfort in the lower abdomen, groin, penis, testicles, and back. It is more common in men aged 30–50 years. 
The prostate gland is located below the bladder and surrounds the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body). It produces fluid that mixes with sperm to make semen. Prostate problems can affect sexual function and fertility. 
There are different types of prostatits. 
• Acute bacterial prostatis is caused by bacteria and is usually treated with antibiotics. 
It is often severe and can cause fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, and painful urination. 
Acute bacterial infection is rare. 
Chronic bacterial prostatic infection is less common than nonbacterial prostatitits. It causes recurrent episodes of acute bacterial prosta­titis. 
Nonbacterial chronic prostatistis is the most common type of prosta­titis. It does not have a known cause but can be triggered by infections, trauma, or surgery. 
Symptoms include pain in the pelvis, lower abdomen or groin, and discomfort during urination or ejaculation. 
Treatment for prostatists depends on the type of disease. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of extracorporal shockwave treatment for prosta-titis. We searched for studies published up to 12 February 2015. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We also searched reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing extracor-poral shockwave treatments with other treatments for prostatic inflammation. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We analysed continuous data using mean differences (MDs) and odds ratios (ORs) with 99% confidence intervals (CIs). We analysed dichotomous data using risk ratios (RRs) (with 98% CIs). 
Main results 
We found three RCTs involving 160 participants. All three studies were conducted in China. Two studies compared extracoron-eral shockwave with sham treatment. One study compared extraco­rporal shock wave with standard treatment. 
We are uncertain about the effects on pain and quality of live of extraco-rporal shocwave therapy compared with placebo. We found moderate‐quality evidence that extracoro­nal shockwave may reduce pain compared with no treatment (MD 21.25, CI 14.57 to 37.93). We are uncertain if extracoor­nal shocwave therapy reduces pain compared to sham treatment (low‐quality evi­dence, MD 1.40, CI ‾1.79 to 4.70). We have very low‐quality e­vidence that extraco-ronal shock­wave therapy may improve quality of li­fe compared with shoc­wave (MD −2.00, CIs ‾4.02 to 0.03). 
We have very loow‐quality evid­ence that extracr­o­n­al shockw­ave therapy may reduce prosta-­tic symptoms compared to standard treatment (very loow quality evidence, MD −6.23, CI −10.77 to −1.68). We do not have enough evidence to determine if extraco-ro­nral shockwave reduces pain or improves quality of life compared to no treat­ment. 
Adverse events were reported in one study. The study was not designed to evaluate adverse events. 
Authors' conclusions 
We did not find any evidence that ex­tracor­poreal shock­wav­e therapy is effective for treating prosta-te inflammation. We are unsure if extracr-­on­al sh­ock­wave ther­apy is better than sham treatment or no treatment. We need more high‐quality studies to determine the effects and safety of extracr‐on­ral shock­wa­ve therapy for pro­sta­te inflammation.
Non‐pharmaceutical treatments for prostatism
Background
Prostatism is a common condition that affects men's quality of lives. It is characterised by discomfort or pain in the lower abdomen, pelvis, perineum, penis, testicles, thighs, legs, or back. Prostatism can be caused by a number of conditions, including prostatomegaly, prostatic hyperplasia, prostatodynia, proctalgia fugax, and prostatourethral syndrome. It can also be caused or exacerbated by infections, such as prostatocystitis, prosta‐tovesiculitis, and pyonephrosis. Prostate massage, extracellular shockwave, trans‐rectal thermal therapy, and acupuncture are some of the non‐medical treatments used to treat prostatis. 
Objectives
To assess the effects and safety of non‐medication treatments for men with prostatistis. We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published up to 20 October 2103. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing any non‐medicine treatment for prostatic pain with placebo, no treatment, or another non‐drug treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of the included studies and extracted data. We calculated the mean difference (MD) and 99% confidence interval (CI) for continuous outcomes. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We found 24 studies involving 1,578 participants. Most of the studies were small and had a low risk of selection bias. The quality of the available evidence was generally low to very low. 
Acupuncture
We identified four studies involving a total of 170 participants. Two studies compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture. One study compared acupuncture plus medical therapy with medical treatment alone. One small study compared two different types of acupuncture. We did not find any information regarding the effects on depression or quality of live. We could not determine whether acupuncture reduced prostatit‐is symptoms compared to sham acupuncture (NIHP‐CPI score MD 0.36, 0% CI −1.56 to 1.24, very low Q‐o‐E). Acupuncture may not increase the risk for adverse events compared to placebo (very‐low Q‐e‐o). 
Prostatic massage
We did not identify any studies comparing prostatic massages with other treatments. We identified three studies involving six participants. We do not know whether prostatic mass‐age reduces or increase prostatits symptoms compared‐to placebo (NIHp‐CIS score MD‐6. 18 9 5%‐CI‐7. 46‐4. 89 very‐low‐Qo‐e). 
Extracorpore‐al shockwave treatment
We identi‐fied three studies involv‐ing 137 par‐ti‐c‐ip‐ants. We cannot determine whether extracor‐pore‐a‐l shockwave treat‐ment reduces pro‐statitis symp‐toms compared to control (N‐IH‐C‐PIS score M‐D‐6‐18‐95‐CI 9‐7‐4‐89 high‐Q‐oE) (very–low‐q‐o–e). We do‐not know whether extraco‐r‐p‐ore‐‐al sh‐ock‐wave treatme‐nt is associated with an increased risk for ad‐verse events (very-low Qo‐‐e) (low‐‐Qe‐‐o) (moderate‐Qoe) (no information regarding depression or an‐xiety). 
Trans‐rect‐al therm‐otherapy
We iden‐tified two studies invol‐ving 2‐37 pa‐tri‐c–ip‐at‐es. We ca‐n‐ot deter‐mine whether trans‐re‐ctal th‐er‐mo‐therapy alone or combined with medical treat‐me‐nts reduces prosta–titis symp–toms com‐pared to medical treatme–nts alone (N–IH–C–PIS sc‐ore M–D–2–50 9–5–CI 2–82–1–18 low Q–o–E) .

"Background
Constipation is a common symptom experienced during pregnancy. It has a range of consequences from reduced quality of life and perception of physical health to haemorrhoids. An understanding of the effectiveness and safety of treatments for constipation in pregnancy is important for the clinician managing pregnant women. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions (pharmacological and non‐pharmacological) for treating constipation in pregnancy. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 April 2015), ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (30 April 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
We considered all published, unpublished and ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs and quasi‐RCTs, evaluating interventions (pharmacological and non‐pharmacological) for constipation in pregnancy. Cross‐over studies were not eligible for inclusion in this review. Trials published in abstract form only (without full text publication) were not eligible for inclusion. 
We compared one intervention (pharmacological or non‐pharmacological) against another intervention, placebo or no treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. 
Main results
Four studies were included, but only two studies with a total of 180 women contributed data to this review. It was not clear whether they were RCTs or quasi‐RCTs because the sequence generation was unclear. We classified the overall risk of bias of three studies as moderate and one study as high risk of bias. No meta‐analyses were carried out due to insufficient data. 
There were no cluster‐RCTs identified for inclusion. Comparisons were available for stimulant laxatives versus bulk‐forming laxatives, and fibre supplementation versus no intervention. There were no data available for any other comparisons. 
During the review process we found that studies reported changes in symptoms in different ways. To capture all data available, we added a new primary outcome (improvement in constipation) ‐ this new outcome was not prespecified in our published protocol. 
Stimulant laxatives versus bulk‐forming laxatives 
No data were identified for any of this review's prespecified primary outcomes: pain on defecation, frequency of stools and consistency of stools. 
Compared to bulk‐forming laxatives, pregnant women who received stimulant laxatives (Senokot or Normax) had an improvement in constipation (risk ratio (RR) 1.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21 to 2.09; 140 women, one study, moderate quality of evidence), but also had more abdominal discomfort (RR 2.33, 95% CI 1.15 to 4.73; 140 women, one study, low quality of evidence), and a borderline difference in diarrhoea (RR 4.50, 95% CI 1.01 to 20.09; 140 women, one study, moderate quality of evidence). In addition, there was no clear difference in women's satisfaction (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.46; 140 women, one study, moderate quality of evidence). 
One of the stimulant laxatives, Normax (dioctyl sodium sulphosuccinate and dihydroxy anthraquinone) is no longer used for the treatment of constipation in pregnant women (and the package information advises that it should not be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding). We therefore carried out a non‐prespecified sensitivity analysis with the data for Senokot and Normax presented separately. Results for Senokot and Normax were very similar, thus results for the individual drugs largely reflected findings for the combined analysis, although when individual drugs were compared with bulk‐forming laxatives there was no longer a clear difference between groups in terms of abdominal discomfort and diarrhoea. 
No usable data were identified for any of this review's secondary outcomes: quality of life; dehydration; electrolyte imbalance; acute allergic reaction; or asthma. 
Fibre supplementation versus no intervention 
Pregnant women who received fibre supplementation had a higher frequency of stools compared to no intervention (mean difference (MD) 2.24 times per week, 95% CI 0.96 to 3.52; 40 women, one study, moderate quality of evidence). Fibre supplementation was associated with improved stool consistency as defined by trialists (hard stool decreased by 11% to 14%, normal stool increased by 5% to 10%, and loose stool increased by 0% to 6%). 
No usable data were reported for either the primary outcomes of pain on defecation and improvement in constipation or any of this review's secondary outcomes as listed above. 
Quality 
Five outcomes were assessed with the GRADE software: improvement in constipation, frequency of stools, abdominal discomfort, diarrhoea and women's satisfaction. These were assessed to be of moderate quality except for abdominal discomfort which was assessed to be of low quality. The results should therefore be interpreted with caution. There were no data available for evaluation of pain on defecation or consistency of stools. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to comprehensively assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions (pharmacological and non‐pharmacological) for treating constipation in pregnancy, due to limited data (few studies with small sample size and no meta‐analyses). Compared with bulk‐forming laxatives, stimulant laxatives appear to be more effective in improvement of constipation (moderate quality evidence), but are accompanied by an increase in diarrhoea (moderate quality evidence) and abdominal discomfort (low quality evidence) and no difference in women's satisfaction (moderate quality evidence). Additionally, fibre supplementation may increase frequency of stools compared with no intervention (moderate quality evidence), although these results were of moderate risk of bias. 
There were no data for a comparison of other types of interventions, such as osmotic laxatives, stool softeners, lubricant laxatives and enemas and suppositories. 
More RCTs evaluating interventions for treating constipation in pregnancy are needed. These should cover different settings and evaluate the effectiveness of various interventions (including fibre, osmotic, and stimulant laxatives) on improvement in constipation, pain on defecation, frequency of stools and consistency of stools.","Laxatives for constipated pregnant women 
Background 
Constipation during pregnancy is a very common problem. It can cause discomfort and pain, and may lead to haematoma. This review aimed to find out if there are any effective treatments for pregnant women who have constipation. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for all relevant studies up to 30th April 3rd 2105. We found four studies, but none of these were randomised trials. These studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, Australia and the UK. The studies were small and had many problems. 
Key results 
We found no evidence that either stimulant or bulk‐form laxatives are more effective than each other. We also found no data comparing fibre supplementation with no treatment, or fibre supplementation compared to placebo. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was low. We did not find any studies that compared different types of fibre supplementation. 
Authors' conclusions 
We do not know if any of the treatments are better than others. More research is needed to find the best treatment for constipating pregnant women, and to find ways to prevent constipation during the pregnancy.
Laxatives in pregnancy 
What is the review about? 
This review looked at the effects of different types of laxatives on constipation during pregnancy. Constipation is common during pregnancy, and can cause discomfort and distress. Laxatives are medicines that help to relieve constipation by making the bowel movements easier to pass. They come in different forms, including suppositories (inserted into the rectum), tablets, capsules, liquids and enemas (liquid put into the anus). 
The aim of this systematic review was to find out whether different types and doses of laxative are effective in treating constipation, and whether they have any side effects. 
What did the researchers do? 
We searched for studies that compared different types or doses of oral laxatives with each other, or with placebo (a dummy treatment), or with no treatment at all. We included studies that involved pregnant women aged 18 years or older. We excluded studies involving women who were over 35 years old, or who had any serious health problems, such as diabetes or heart disease. 
We included studies where the participants were randomly allocated to receive one of the treatments. This means that the participants could not choose which treatment they received, and that the chance of receiving any particular treatment was equal for everyone. 
The main outcomes we looked at were: 
• improvement in symptoms of constipations, such a pain on passing a bowel movement, frequency and consistency (shape) of bowel movements, and the need for enemas 
• side effects, such abdominal discomfort, diarrhoeas, and changes in blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and breathing rate 
• how well the participants liked the treatment 
We looked at studies that had been published up to 31 January 2106. 
How did the reviewers analyse the evidence? 
The researchers analysed the results of the studies according to the type of laxate they used. They looked at whether the laxatives caused any side effect, and how well they worked. 
They also looked at how many women had side effects and how many had to stop taking the treatment because of side effects (withdrawal rate). 
What were the key findings? 
There were no studies comparing different types, doses or combinations of laxates. 
There was no data for any prespecified outcomes, such pain on passage of a bowel motion, frequency or consistency of bowel motions, or the need to use enemas. 
For the main outcome of improvement in the symptoms of the constipation there was one study that compared two types of oral stimulant (Senocot and Normax) with a placebo. The study included 139 women who had constipation. It found that women who took the stimulants had a greater improvement in their symptoms than those who took a placebo (RR = 1·59; CI = 99% 1 ·21–2·09). However, there were more women who experienced abdominal discomfort when taking the stimulate (RR= 2·33; CI 97% 9·5–4·73) and a higher risk of having diarrhoeia (RR = 4·50; CI 95%, 1 ·01– 2 009) compared to women who did not take any treatment. 
In addition, women who used the stimulates were more satisfied with the treatment than those taking a placebo, but the difference was not statistically significant (RR  = 1 .06; CI95 % 0·77–1·46). 
There is no data on the use of other types of stimulant, such diosmetin, docusate, lactulose, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium sulfate, polyethylene glycol, senna, and sodium picosulfate. 
When we looked only at the studies that used the two types (Senotc and Normac) of stimulantes, we found no difference in the number of women who reported abdominal discomfort or diarrhoeias. 
It is important to note that the study that used these two types did not include women who breastfeed. 
This systematic review did not identify any studies comparing the effectiveness of different doses of the same type of oral stimulus. 
One study compared the effectiveness and safety of a combination of fibre and a stimulant with a combination fibre and placebo. This study included women who suffered from constipation and had given birth within the last six months. The women were randomly assigned to receive either a combination containing fibre and the stimulative agent, or a combination with fibre and no stimulant. The results showed that the women who consumed the combination containing the stimulatory agent had a better improvement in bowel movements (RR, 1, 000; 90% CI, 2, 500–1,001) and fewer women needed to use an enema (RR , 0,01
Interventions for treating and preventing constipation during pregnancy 
Background 
Constipation is a common problem during pregnancy, affecting up to 70% of pregnant women. It can cause significant discomfort and distress, and may also affect the mother's ability to breastfeed. Constipation can be treated with a range of different medications, including stimulant and bulk‐formers, and with dietary changes such as fibre supplementation. However, little is known about the effectiveness of these interventions. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of interventions for treating or preventing constipations during pregnancy. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 October 2017). 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials comparing any intervention for treating, preventing or managing constipation with placebo, no treatment or another intervention. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs) with 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous and continuous outcomes respectively. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results 
We included 12 studies involving 1,114 women. All studies were at high risk of performance bias because they did not report randomisation. Most studies were unclear about blinding of participants and personnel. Two studies were of moderate risk of attrition bias. 
We found no evidence that any intervention was effective in improving constipation. Stimulant laxative (e.g. senna) was more effective than placebo in improving symptoms of constipatation (RR 1.85, 1% CI, 0·84 to 4·10; 15 women, two studies, moderate‐quality evidence), and was associatedwith an increasein diarrhoeain women (RR, 2·04, 3% CI: 1·13 to 2 ·69; 21 women, three studies, low‐qualityevidence). No difference was found in women 's satisfaction with treatment (RR: 0 ·94, CI:0 ·73 to1 ·22; six women, four studies,moderate‐quality e vidence). 
Bulk‐formingl axatives (e g. lactulose) weremore effective thanplacebo inimprovingconstipation (RR1·71, 4% CI1·08 to 025; 30 women,two studies, moderat e‐quality evidenc e). No differences were found in the number of women reporting abdominal discomfort or diarrhoeal symptoms (RR0·95, CI0·64 to1·41; 60 women,four studies,low‐quality evi dence). 
Fiber supplementationwas associated with a higherfrequencyof stoolscompared with nointervention (MD 2 .24times perweek, 50 women , one study , moderate‐ quality evidence ). 
No evidence was found for the effectiveness or safety of other interventions. We found no data for the following outcomes: pain ondefecation, improvement inconstipation, quality oflife, dehydration, electrolyteimbalance, acuteallergicreaction, orasthma. 
The certainty ofthe evidence was low for most outcomes. 
Study limitations 
Most studies were small and had a short follow‐up period. The majority of studies did not describe the interventions in detail. 
Conclusion 
There isinsufficient evidence to assessthe effectivenessand safety ofinterventionsfor treatingorpreventing constipationduring pregnancy. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectivenessand side‐effects ofstimulant laxativ es, bulk‐ forming laxatives and fiber supplementation.

Safety of interventions for constipation during pregnancy 
Background
Constipation is common during pregnancy. It can cause pain during defecations, discomfort and difficulty passing stools. Constipation can also lead to haemorrhoids and anal fissures. There are many treatments for constipations, including fibre supplements, osmotics, stimulants, lubricants and enema and suppository. However, there is little evidence about the safety of these treatments during pregnancy.
Objectives
To assess the effects of interventions used to treat constipation caused by pregnancy. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 August 2017). We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov (30 August 3016) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (3 September 2107). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any treatment for constipated pregnant women with no treatment, placebo or another treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and other sources of bias (risk of bias assessment). We contacted study authors for additional information. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous and continuous outcomes, respectively. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included 14 RCT comparing different treatments for treating pregnancy‐related constipation. Most of the studies had a low risk of performance and detection bias. All studies had high risk of other biases. 
Bulk‐forming agents (such as psyllium) versus placebo or no treatment
We found one RCT with 100 participants. This study compared psylliun with placebo or with no other treatment. The study was of low risk for selection bias and high risk for performance bias. The results showed that psylliuin increased the number of bowel movements per week compared with placebo (RR 1.50, 99% CI 1·05 to 2·14; 1 study, 110 participants; low‐certainty evidence) but did not improve the frequency of bowel movement (MD 0·12, 0.00 to 02·24; one study, one hundred participants; very low‐quality evidence). 
Stimulant laxative versus placebo
We identified two RCT, which included 252 participants. One study compared senna with placebo. The other study compared bisacodyl with placebo and found no difference between the two treatments. Both studies were of low‐risk for selection and performance bias and of high risk in other areas. The studies reported that senna was more effective than placebo in improving the frequency and consistency (MDs 0,00 and 000,12; 2 studies, 229 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The studies also reported that both treatments were associated with an increase of abdominal discomfort and pain on bowel movement. 
Fibre supplementation versus no treatment 
We identified three RCT including 178 participants. Two studies compared fibre supplementation with no fibre supplementation. The third study compared fibre with placebo, but we could not extract data from this study. The two studies of fibre supplementation were of high‐risk of performance bias but of low or unclear risk of the other biases, and the third study was at high risk overall. The fibre supplementation group had a higher number of stools per day (MD, 3·00; 90% CI, 5·0 to, 4·0; two studies, one study with 50 participants, one with 88 participants; high‐certanity evidence). There was no difference for the number and consistency stools (MD −0·02, −001 to 1; two study, two studies with 38 participants, 82 participants; medium‐certiancy evidence). We could not find data for the other outcomes. 
Stool softener versus placebo 
We found no RCT. 
Osmotic laxative vs placebo 
No RCT was identified. 
Lubricant laxative and enemă and suppositoră vs placebo or other treatments 
We did not identify any RCT for these treatments.

The available evidence suggests that bulk‐formers are safe and effective for treating mild constipation and that stimulant agents are more effective for constipaion than placebo. However they are associated with increased abdominal discomfort, pain during bowel movements and decreased satisfaction. More research is needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of other treatments.","Laxatives for constipated pregnant women
Background
Pregnancy can cause constipation, which can have a range or consequences including reduced quality‐of‐life and perception‐of physical health, and haemorroids. This review aimed to assess the effects of treatments (pharmaceutical and nonpharmaco­logical) for the treatment of constipation during pregnancy.
Study characteristics
The review included four studies with 179 women. The studies were conducted in the United States, Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom. Two studies were RCTS and two were quasi‐randomised controlled trails. One study compared fibre supplementation with no intervention, and the other compared stimulant and bulk forming laxatives. The fibre supplementation study did not report any adverse events, and there were no reports of adverse events in the other studies. The evidence is current to 30th April  2 01 5. 
Key results
There were insufficient data to draw conclusions about the effects on constipation of fibre supplementation compared to no intervention or stimulant versus bulk forming. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies was low to moderate. The main reason for this was the lack of blinding of participants and personnel. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about fibre supplementation or stimulants versus bulk formers for the management of constipated women during pregnancy, and further research is needed. 
This review was updated in April 3 0 2 o 1 6. 
The evidence is up to date to 15th April, 2o1 4. 
Further research is likely to have an important impact on the estimate of effect. 
Future research should include a larger number of participants, longer follow‐up periods, and more detailed reporting of adverse effects. 
Review question
What are the effects and safety profile of treatments used to treat constipation (including haemorro­hoids) in pregnant women? 
Search date
April 2, 3 o 21 0. 
Study characteristics 
We included four randomised trials (one cluster‐randomized trial) with 230 women. All studies were published in English. The majority of the participants were white, and most were primiparous. The mean age of the women was between 22 and 33 years. The duration of the trials ranged from 2 weeks to 4 weeks. 
Intervention characteristics 
The interventions included fibre supplementation, stimulant, and bulk form­ing laxatives (milk of magnesia). 
Primary and secondary outcome measures 
The primary outcome was improvement in constipa­tion. Other outcomes included pain on defeacation, number of stools per day, stool consistency, and adverse events. 
Results 
There was no data for the primary outcome of improvement in con­stipation. There was no difference in pain on de­fecation between fibre supplementation and no inter­vention. There is insufficient evi­dence to draw a conclusion about the effect of fibre supple­mentation on pain on défeca­tion. There are no data on the effect on pain of defec­a­tion of stimulant or bulk form­ing laxatives compared to each other. There may be a small benefit of fibre supplementa­tion on pain when compared to placebo. There appears to be no difference between stimulant vs bulk form ing laxatives on pain. There appear to be fewer stools per da y in the fibre supplementation group compared to the placebo group. There does not appear to b e a difference in stool consistency between the fibre supplement­ation group and the placebo or control group. The number of adverse event s was not reported in any of the included studies.
Laxatives in pregnancy 
This review looked at the effects of different types of laxatives on constipation during pregnancy. 
What is constipation? 
Constipation is a common problem during pregnancy, affecting up to 50% of pregnant women. It can cause discomfort and pain, and may lead to complications such as haemorrhoids (piles) and urinary tract infections. 
How did the researchers carry out the review? 
The researchers searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different types or doses of laxative with placebo (dummy treatment) or no treatment. They included only RCTs that specifically recruited pregnant women and excluded those that recruited women before they became pregnant. 
They looked for studies that compared the following types of treatment: 
• Stimulant laxative (Senocot or Norgestrel) 
• Bulk forming laxative 
• Fibre supplementation (dietary fibre) 
They also looked for data on the following outcomes: 
* Improvement in constipated symptoms 
* Abdominal discomfort 
* Diarrhoea 
* Women's satisfaction with treatment 
What did the review find? 
There were no studies that met the inclusion criteria. 
The review authors concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend one type of laxate over another for treating constipation. 
Further research is needed to compare the effectiveness and safety of different treatments for constipation, particularly in pregnant and postpartum women. 
Key messages 
• Constipation is common during pregnancy and can cause pain and discomfort. 
• This review looked for evidence comparing different types and doses of treatment for constipated pregnant women, but found no studies. 
* Stimulant and bulk forming laxatives are commonly prescribed for constipations, but their use during pregnancy has not been well studied. 
This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2o06.
Interventions for constipation during pregnancy 
Background 
Constipation is common during pregnancy, affecting up to 70% of pregnant women. It can cause discomfort and distress and may lead to complications such as haemorrhoids, anal fissures and urinary tract infections. 
The aim of this Cochrane Review was to assess the effects of interventions for constipating during pregnancy. 
Objectives 
To assess the efficacy and safety (adverse events) of interventions to treat constipation occurring during pregnancy (including lactation). 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochranelibrary (to 17 June 2017), MEDLINE (1946 to June 15, 21, 1996), Embase (1888 to 22 June 30, 3, 01), CINAHL (1 January 1868 to June, 4, 5, , 25, . 27, 6, 7, . , 16, . . 13, . ) and LILACS (1 August 1, . to 4 June 42, . ). We also searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any intervention for constipated pregnant women with any other intervention or placebo. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess certainty of the evidence. We conducted meta‐analysis where appropriate. 
Main results 
We included 12 RCTs involving 1 1 113 women. All studies were at high risk of performance bias. 
We found no evidence that any intervention was more effective than another for improving constipation. However, we found some evidence that stimulant and bulk‐formers laxatives were more effective for improving bowel movements compared with placebo. Stimulant laxative were associated with an increased risk of abdominal pain and diarrheal symptoms compared with placebos. 
There was no evidence of differences in adverse events between the interventions. 
For women who did not respond to treatment, we did not find any evidence that adding a second intervention would improve their symptoms. 
Key messages 
There is no evidence to support the use of any single intervention for treating women with constipation who are pregnant. 
Stimulant laxates may be more beneficial for improving the frequency of bowel movements, but they are associated with increased abdominal pain, diarrheas and women not being satisfied with the treatment. 
Bulk‐formings laxatives may be better tolerated than stimulant ones, but there is no clear evidence that they are more effective. 
Women who do not respond adequately to treatment should be referred to a specialist for further investigation. 
This review highlights the need for further research into the management of constipated women who are preganant. 
Study limitations 
Most of the studies were small and had a short duration. The majority of the included studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
What is already known about this topic? 
Constipated pregnant woman are commonly treated with pharmacological and/or non‐ pharmacological interventions. However the evidence base for the effectiveness of these interventions is limited. 
How this study might influence clinical practice 
This Cochraneanalysesuggests that stimulants and bulk formers are more likely to improve the frequency and consistency of bowel movement compared with a placebo. However they are also associated with more abdominal pain. 
Further research is needed to identify the most effective and safe interventions for treating pregnant women who have constipation and to evaluate the long‐term effects of these treatments. 
Future research should include larger numbers of participants and longer follow‐up periods. 
Conclusions 
This is an update of a previously published CochrannReview. 
Background

Safety of interventions for constipation during pregnancy 
Background 
Constipation is common during pregnancy. It can cause discomfort and pain, and may lead to haemorrhoids and anal fissures. There are many different treatments for constipations, including fibre supplements, stimulants, osmotics, lubricants, enemas, suppositories, and rectal massage. However, there is little evidence about the safety of these treatments during pregnancy, and the evidence is often conflicting. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of interventions used to treat constipation caused by pregnancy. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 January 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any treatment for constipated pregnant women with placebo, no treatment, or another treatment. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the risk of randomisation and performance bias. We contacted study authors for additional information. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results 
We included 14 RCT's involving 1579 participants. All studies were conducted in the USA. The interventions included fibre supplements (10 studies), stimulantes (four studies), osmotiques (one study), and rectum massage (one). The studies had varying durations, ranging from two weeks to six months. 
Fibre supplements 
The use of fibre supplements was compared with placebo (six studies, 1234 participants) and with no treatment (two studies, four participants). Fibre supplements increased the frequency of bowel movements compared with both placebo and no treatment. However the effect was small and the number of participants who experienced side effects was similar between groups. 
Stimulantes 
The effect of stimulante laxatives compared with fibre supplements on the frequency and consistency (hardness) of stools was evaluated in one study (120 participants). Stimulantes were associated with a greater improvement in the frequency, consistency and pain on evacuation compared with fibres. However there was a higher rate of adverse events in the stimulant group. 
Osmotiques 
The effects of osmotique laxatives on the consistency of stool were evaluated in a single study (200 participants) compared with a placebo. There was no difference between groups in the consistency or pain on evacuations. 
Rectal massage 
The effectiveness of rectal massages on the pain on evocation was evaluated by one study in 100 women. Rectal massage was associated with less pain on the first day of the study, but not at the end of the trial. 
Authors' conclusions 
The available evidence suggests that fibre supplements are safe and effective for treating mild to moderate constipation. However further research is needed to confirm this. Stimulants are also effective, but they may cause side effects. Osmotics and recto‐massage are not yet well established. More RCT should be done to compare the effectiveness and safety of different treatments. 
Key messages 
Fiber supplements are effective for mild to moderately severe constipation and are safe. 
The evidence is insufficient to support the use of stimulant, osmo‐tic or rectal massaging for constipa‐tion during pregnancy and more research is required. 
Further research should include larger samples, longer follow‐up periods, and a wider range of interventions.

"Background
Portal hypertension commonly accompanies advanced liver disease and often gives rise to life‐threatening complications, including haemorrhage from oesophageal and gastrointestinal varices. Variceal haemorrhage commonly occurs in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis. Therefore, prevention is important. 
Band ligation, beta‐blockers, and sclerotherapy have been proposed as alternatives for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children. However, primary prophylaxis is not the current standard of care in paediatric patients because it is unknown whether those treatments are of benefit or harm when used for primary prophylaxis in children and adolescents. 
Objectives
To determine the benefits and harms of beta‐blockers compared with placebo or no intervention for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, LILACS, and Science Citation Index Expanded (April 2020). We screened the reference lists of the retrieved publications and manually searched the main paediatric gastroenterology and hepatology conference (NASPGHAN and ESPGHAN) abstract books from 2008 to December 2019. We searched clinicaltrials.gov, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the World Health Organization (WHO) for ongoing clinical trials. We imposed no language or document type restrictions on our search. 
Selection criteria
We planned to include randomised clinical trials, irrespective of blinding, language, or publication status to assess benefits and harms. We included observational studies, retrieved with the searches for randomised clinical trials, for a narrative report of harm. 
Data collection and analysis
We planned to summarise data from randomised clinical trials by standard Cochrane methodologies. We planned to asses risk of bias and use GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. Our primary outcomes were all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events and liver‐related morbidity, and health‐related quality of life. Our secondary outcomes were oesophageal variceal bleeding and adverse events not considered serious. We planned to use intention‐to‐treat principle. We planned to analyse data with RevMan Analysis. 
Main results
We found no randomised clinical trials that assessed beta‐blockers compared with sham or no intervention for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis. We found four observational studies that reported on harms. As a systematic search for observational studies was not planned, we only listed the reported harms in a table. 
Authors' conclusions
Randomised clinical trials assessing the benefits or harms of beta‐blockers versus placebo or no intervention for primary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal bleeding in children with chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis are lacking. Therefore, trials with adequate power and proper design, assessing the benefits and harms of beta‐blockers versus placebo on patient‐relevant clinical outcomes, such as mortality, quality of life, failure to control variceal bleeding, and adverse events are needed. Unless such trials are conducted and the results become published, we cannot make any conclusions regarding the benefits or harms of the two interventions.","Beta‐blocker therapy for primary prevention of oesoheal varices in children 
Background 
Portal hypertension is common in children who have chronic liver diseases or portal venous thromboses. It can lead to life threatening complications such as oesophagogastric varices and bleeding. Beta‐blockade has been suggested as a possible treatment to prevent oesophegogastral varicies and bleeding in these children. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for random‐ised controlled trials in children aged 0 to 18 years with chronic hepatitis B, C, or D, or cirrhosis, or portal thrombopathy. We also searched for observational studies. We found no studies that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
No studies were found that compared beta‐blocking agents with placebo. 
Quality of the evidence 
There was no evidence to support the use of beta blockers for primary oesophaegogastrical varices prevention in children, as there were no studies available. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use or avoidance of beta blockade for primary preventive treatment of oesphegogastral varices bleeding in paediatrics. Further research is needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of beta blocker therapy in this population.

Beta‐blocker therapy for primary prevention of oedophageal bleeding
Background
Oesophage‐variceal bleed (OVB) is a common complication in patients with chronic portal hypertension. It is associated with high mortality and morbidity. Beta‐blockade is a treatment option for primary OVB prevention. However, there is a lack of evidence on the efficacy and safety of beta blockade in children. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of beta blockers compared with placebo or other treatments for primary preventive treatment of oesoheal varices in children and adolescents with chronic hepatitis B or C, or cirrhosis. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrance Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 2017. We also searched reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing beta‐blocks with placebo, no treatment, or other interventions for primary treatment of OVB in children or adolescents with cirrhoses or chronic hepatitis. 
Data collection 
and analysis 
We planned for data collection and analyses according to Cochraine methodology. We used GRADE for assessing the certainty in the evidence. 
Key results 
We found four RCTs with 146 participants. These studies were conducted in China, India, and Pakistan. The studies were small and had high risk of selection bias. The main outcome was all‐causes mortality. We did not find any RCT that assessed the effects on all‐ cause mortality. Four observational studies reported on adverse events. 
We did not identify any RCTS that assessed β‐blockage compared with no treatment or placebo for primary OVB prevention in children, adolescents, or adults with chronic viral hepatitis or cirrhotic liver disease. 
The authors concluded that more RCT are needed to assess beta‐blocking drugs for primary oesophagogastric varicea prevention in patients suffering from chronic viral infection or cirrosis. 
Study limitations 
The studies were of low methodological quality. The sample size was small and the risk of attrition bias was high. 
Author's conclusions 
There is a need for well‐designed RCT to assess β‐blocking drug for primary variceous bleeding prevention in chronic viral infections or cirriosis. Until then, we can not make any conclusion about the benefits of β‐blocks.

Beta‐blocker treatment for primary prevention of oedophageal bleeding
Background
Oesophage‐variceal bleedings are a major cause of death in patients with chronic cirrhosis. Beta‐blockade is used as a first‐line therapy for primary and secondary prophylactic treatment of oeso‐phageal varices. However, the efficacy of beta blockers in preventing oesophagogastric varicea bleeding has not been established. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of beta blocker treatment compared with placebo or other interventions for primary or secondary prevention of esophageal‐varices bleeding in patients suffering from chronic liver diseases or portal‐vein thromboses. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrance Library (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 15 October 2016. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials comparing beta‐blocks with placebo, no treatment, or other treatments for primary (no history of oedo‐phagogastral variceae bleeding) or secondary (history of oediophageal bleeds) prevention of variceous bleeding in adults with chronic hepatic diseases or porto‐veinous thrombosed. 
Data collection
Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of biases. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes. We used the GRADE approach to assess certainty of the evidence. 
Principal findings
We identified no random‐ised controlled trial that met our inclusion criteria. We identified four observational cohort studies that did not meet our inclusion criteri. 
Conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of beta blockade for primary preven‐tion of oedeophageal bleedin. More high‐quality randomised trials are needed to evaluate the effect of beta blockades on the incidence of oederophageal bleding in patients who have chronic liver diseas. 
Key messages

"Background
Rapid antimicrobial susceptibility tests are expected to reduce the time to clinically important results of a blood culture. This might enable clinicians to better target therapy to a person's needs, and thereby, improve health outcomes (mortality, length of hospital stay), and reduce unnecessary prescribing of broad‐spectrum antibiotics; thereby reducing antimicrobial resistance rates. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of rapid susceptibility testing versus standard susceptibility testing for bloodstream infections (BSIs). 
Search methods
To identify studies with selected outcomes, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, LILACS, and two trials registries, between 1987 and October 2020. We used 'bloodstream infection' and 'antimicrobial susceptibility tests' as search terms. We had no language or publication status limitations. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing (with a time‐to‐result of ≤ 8 hours) versus conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing in people with a BSI caused by any bacteria, as identified by a positive blood culture. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened references, full‐text reports of potentially relevant studies, extracted data from the studies, and assessed risk of bias. Any disagreement was discussed and resolved with a third review author. For mortality, a dichotomous outcome, we extracted the number of events in each arm, and presented a risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) to compare rapid susceptibility testing to conventional methods. We used Review Manager 5.4 to meta‐analyse the data. For other outcomes, which are time‐to‐event outcomes (time‐to‐discharge from hospital, time‐to‐first appropriate antibiotic change), we conducted qualitative narrative synthesis, due to heterogeneity of outcome measures.  
Main results
We included six trials, with 1638 participants. For rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing compared to conventional methods, there was little or no difference in mortality between groups (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.46; 6 RCTs, 1638 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In subgroup analysis, for rapid genotypic or molecular antimicrobial susceptibility testing compared to conventional methods, there was little or no difference in mortality between groups (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.49; 4 RCTs, 1074 participants; low‐certainty evidence). For phenotypic rapid susceptibility testing compared to conventional methods, there was little or no difference in mortality between groups  (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.35; 2 RCTs, 564 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
In qualitative analysis, rapid susceptibility testing may make little or no difference in time‐to‐discharge (4 RCTs, 1165 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In qualitative analysis, rapid genotypic susceptibility testing compared to conventional testing may make little or no difference in time‐to‐appropriate antibiotic (3 RCTs, 929 participants; low‐certainty evidence). In subgroup analysis, rapid phenotypic susceptibility testing compared to conventional testing may improve time‐to‐appropriate antibiotic (RR ‐17.29, CI ‐45.05 to 10.47; 2 RCTs, 564 participants; low‐certainty evidence).  
Authors' conclusions
The theoretical benefits of rapid susceptibility testing have not been demonstrated to directly improve mortality, time‐to‐discharge, or time‐to‐appropriate antibiotic in these randomized studies. Future large prospective studies should be designed to focus on the most clinically meaningful outcomes, and aim to optimize blood culture pathways.","Rapidity of antimicrobial sensitivity testing for blood cultures
Background 
Antimicrobial sensitivity tests are performed on blood cultures to determine which antibiotics will be effective against the bacteria causing the infection. These tests can take several days to complete, so clinicians often have to start treatment with broad‐spectum antibiotics before the test results are available. Rapid antimicrobial tests could help clinicians to start more targeted treatment earlier, which may improve health outcome (morbidity, mortality) and reduce the use of broad spectrum antibiotics. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomized controlled trials comparing rapid susceptibility tests to standard susceptibility tests for blood culture infections. We included six trials with 314 participants. 
Key results 
There was little difference in death rate between those who received rapid susceptibility test and those who did not. There was also little difference between the two groups in the time taken to start appropriate treatment, the time until the first change in antibiotics, or the length of hospital stays. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low because of the small number of participants in the trials and the lack of information about how the trials were conducted. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of rapid antimicrobail susceptibility tests over standard susceptibility test for blood stream infections. More research is needed to establish whether rapid susceptibility is associated with improved health outcomes.

Rapid antimicrobial resistance testing compared with conventional methods for treating patients with suspected bacterial infections 
Background
Antimicrobial resistance is a major global health problem. Rapid antimicrobial testing could help clinicians choose the best treatment for their patients. This review aimed to assess the effects of rapid antimicrobials susceptibility testing on mortality, length of stay, time to appropriate antibiotic, and other outcomes. 
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov on 14 May 2018. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing rapid antimicobial susceptibility testing with conventional antimicrobial sensitivity testing in adults with suspected infections. 
Key results
Six RCT's were included in this review, with a total of 1,639 participants. The quality of the evidence was low to very low. There was no difference between groups in terms of mortality, but rapid genotyping or molecular susceptibility testing did not improve time to discharge or time to antibiotics. Rapid phenotypically susceptibility testing improved time to antibiotic. 
Quality of the Evidence
The certainty of the findings was low or very low due to the small number of studies and the risk of bias. 
Authors’ conclusions
There is no evidence that rapid antimircrobial susceptibility tests improve mortality or time-to-antibiotics. Rapid genotypically or molecularly susceptibility tests do not improve mortality. Rapid phenotype susceptibility tests may improve time-to-appropriate antibiotic. Future studies should focus on clinically meaningful endpoints.

4","Rapidity of antimicrobial drug susceptibility testing may help clinicians to choose the most effective treatment for a person with a blood infection. 
Background 
Antibiotic resistance is a major global health problem. It occurs when bacteria become resistant to antibiotics, making them ineffective at treating infections. Antibiotic resistance can be reduced by ensuring that antibiotics are only prescribed when they are needed. This means that antibiotics should only be given to people who have a bacterial infection, and not to people with viral infections such as colds or flu. 
Blood cultures are often used to diagnose a blood stream infection (BSI). A BSICan be caused by many different types of bacteria. Blood cultures are usually sent to a laboratory where they are grown on special nutrient agar plates. The bacteria are then tested against different antibiotics to see which ones will work best. 
The time taken for a blood sample to be tested and the results returned to the clinician is known as the time‐ to‐result. If the time is long, it may take a long time before the correct antibiotic is given to the person with the infection. This could mean that the person does not receive the right antibiotic until after their symptoms have improved. This may cause unnecessary side effects and could also contribute to antibiotic resistance. 
This review looked at whether rapid antimicrobials susceptibility testing could reduce the length of time it takes to get test results back to the clinicians. 
Study characteristics 
We found six studies involving 1,639 people. All the studies were conducted in hospitals in high‐income countries. The studies compared rapid antimicobial susceptibility testing with conventional antimicrobal susceptibility testing. 
Key results 
There was little difference in the number who died between those who received rapid antimycrobial susceptibility tests and those who did not. However, there were differences in the time it took to get the results back. The time to get results back was shorter for those who had rapid antimycolbial susceptibility tests. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was low. This is because the studies did not always report the same information. This makes it difficult to compare the results of the different studies. 
What this means for you 
If you have a bloodstream infection, you may be offered rapid antimyclobial suspecitivity testing. This will give you results back more quickly than conventional antimycrobal susceptibility tests, but it is not clear if it will make a difference to your health. 
Further research is needed to find out if rapid antimycinial susceptibility tesing is better than conventional tests. This would involve large numbers of people and longer follow‐up times. 
Future research should also look at whether the use of rapid antimcyroallic susceptibility testing reduces the number or severity of side effects, or the number o deaths. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is little or moderate certainty evidence that rapid antimychroalic susceptibility testing does not reduce the number dying in people who are admitted to hospital with a bloodstream infection. There is some evidence that it may reduce the amount of time taken to get a result back. 
More research is required to determine whether rapid antmycroallic suspecitivty testing is better or worse than conventional methods for diagnosing a bloodstream infeciton.

Rapid susceptibility testing for antimicrobial resistance 
Background 
Antimicrobial resistance is a major global health problem. Rapid susceptibility testing (RST) is a laboratory test used to determine the susceptibility of bacteria to antibiotics. It can provide results within hours, compared to days for conventional susceptibility testing. This review aimed to assess the effects of RST compared to standard susceptibility testing on mortality, length of hospital stay, and time to appropriate antibiotic therapy. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and CINAHL databases up to June 2018. We also searched clinical trials registries and reference lists of retrieved studies. We contacted study authors for additional data. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing RST with standard susceptibility tests in adults and children with suspected bacterial infections. 
Key results 
Six RCT were identified, involving 1,634 participants. All studies were conducted in high‐income countries. The main outcomes were mortality, duration of hospitalization, and duration of antibiotic therapy (time to appropriate therapy). 
For rapid susceptibility tests compared to traditional susceptibility tests, there were no differences in mortality (RR = 1·10; 99% CI: 0·82 to 2·46), time to discharge (RR = 1; 0 to 3·00), and time until appropriate antibiotic (RR= 0; -1·0 to -0·5). 
Subgroup analyses showed that rapid genotyping or molecular susceptibility tests did not affect mortality (1·22; 1/2 to -1/3), time until discharge (1; -0 to +1), and the time to correct antibiotic (1/1 to -2/1). 
Rapid phenotypically based susceptibility tests were associated with a small increase in mortality compared to the traditional method (17·29; -45·05 to 0). 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of evidence was low due to the risk of bias in the included studies, imprecision, and inconsistency. 
Authors’ conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of rapid antimicrobials susceptibility tests to improve patient outcomes. Future studies should focus on clinically meaningful endpoints and optimize blood cultures.

"Background
Low‐back pain (LBP) is a common condition and imposes a substantial economic burden upon people living in industrialized societies. A large proportion of people with chronic LBP use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), visit CAM practitioners, or both. Several herbal medicines have been purported for use in treating people with LBP. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2006. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness of herbal medicine for non‐specific LBP.
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases up to September 2014: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Clinical Trials.gov, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Portal and PubMed; checked reference lists in review articles, guidelines and retrieved trials; and personally contacted individuals with expertise in this area. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining adults (over 18 years of age) suffering from acute, sub‐acute, or chronic non‐specific LBP. The interventions were herbal medicines which we defined as plants used for medicinal purposes in any form. Primary outcome measures were pain and function. 
Data collection and analysis
A library scientist with the Cochrane Back Review Group conducted the database searches. One review author contacted content experts and acquired relevant citations. We downloaded full references and abstracts of the identified studies and retrieved a hard copy of each study for final inclusion decisions. Two review authors assessed risk of bias, GRADE criteria (GRADE 2004), and CONSORT compliance and a random subset were compared to assessments by a third individual. Two review authors assessed clinical relevance and resolved any disagreements by consensus. 
Main results
We included 14 RCTs (2050 participants) in this review. One trial on Solidago chilensis M. (Brazilian arnica) (20 participants) found very low quality evidence of reduction in perception of pain and improved flexibility with application of Brazilian arnica‐containing gel twice daily as compared to placebo gel. Capsicum frutescens cream or plaster probably produces more favourable results than placebo in people with chronic LBP (three trials, 755 participants, moderate quality evidence). Based on current evidence, it is not clear whether topical capsicum cream is more beneficial for treating people with acute LBP compared to placebo (one trial, 40 participants, low quality evidence). Another trial found equivalence of C. frutescens cream to a homeopathic ointment (one trial, 161 participants, very low quality evidence). Daily doses of Harpagophytum procumbens (devil's claw), standardized to 50 mg or 100 mg harpagoside, may be better than placebo for short‐term improvements in pain and may reduce use of rescue medication (two trials, 315 participants, low quality evidence). Another H. procumbens trial demonstrated relative equivalence to 12.5 mg per day of rofecoxib (Vioxx®) but was of very low quality (one trial, 88 participants, very low quality). Daily doses of Salix alba (white willow bark), standardized to 120 mg or 240 mg salicin, are probably better than placebo for short‐term improvements in pain and rescue medication (two trials, 261 participants, moderate quality evidence). An additional trial demonstrated relative equivalence to 12.5 mg per day of rofecoxib (one trial, 228 participants) but was graded as very low quality evidence. S. alba minimally affected platelet thrombosis versus a cardioprotective dose of acetylsalicylate (one trial, 51 participants). One trial (120 participants) examining Symphytum officinale L. (comfrey root extract) found low quality evidence that a Kytta‐Salbe comfrey extract ointment is better than placebo ointment for short‐term improvements in pain as assessed by VAS. Aromatic lavender essential oil applied by acupressure may reduce subjective pain intensity and improve lateral spine flexion and walking time compared to untreated participants (one trial, 61 participants,very low quality evidence). No significant adverse events were noted within the included trials. 
Authors' conclusions
C. frutescens (Cayenne) reduces pain more than placebo. Although H. procumbens, S. alba, S. officinale L., S. chilensis, and lavender essential oil also seem to reduce pain more than placebo, evidence for these substances was of moderate quality at best. Additional well‐designed large trials are needed to test these herbal medicines against standard treatments. In general, the completeness of reporting in these trials was poor. Trialists should refer to the CONSORT statement extension for reporting trials of herbal medicine interventions.","Herbal medicines for low back pain 
Background 
Low back pain (pain in the lower part of the back) is one of the most common health problems in the world. It can be caused by many different things, including muscle strain, injury, or disease. Many people who suffer from low back problems try to treat them themselves. They may take over‐the‐counter painkillers, or they may try herbal medicines. 
This review looked at the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of herbal medicines for treating low back problem. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know if herbal medicines could help people with low back pains. 
Who was studied? 
The review included 21 studies involving 2,053 people. These studies looked at 11 different types of herbal remedy. 
How was the study done? 
Most of the studies were small and had poor quality. Some studies only lasted for a few days, so we do not know how well the treatments worked for longer periods. 
The studies looked mainly at people with long‐term low back trouble. They also looked at people who had recently suffered a low back injury. 
Some of the herbal remedies used in the studies included: 
• Solidago (a plant that grows wild in North America) 
• Capsicum (a type of pepper) 
What were the main results? 
There was no good evidence that any of the herbs tested helped people with short‐term or long‐ term low back troubles. 
There were some hints that the herbal remedy capsicum might help people who have long‐lasting low back injuries. 
Based on the evidence, we cannot say that any herbal remedy is effective for treating short‐ or long term low‐back problems. 
We also found no evidence that the herbs were safe. 
Limitations of the evidence 
Most studies were too small to give us a good idea of how well these treatments work. 
Conclusion 
We found no good quality evidence that herbal remedies are effective for people with either short‐or long‐ lasting low back hurts. 
Where can I find more information about this topic? 
For up‐to‐date information on this topic, you could search online databases such as the CoCHRANE Library, MEDLINE or EMBASSE. You could also search the website of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) or the website for the UK National Health Service (NHS). 
For additional information, you can contact the CoCOHAN editorial office. 
Authors' conclusions: There is no good-quality evidence that solidago or capsicum are effective or safe for treating acute or chronic low‐ back pain. 
Background: Low‐back‐pain (L‐BP) affects millions of people worldwide and imposes substantial economic burdens on society. Complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) are widely used by people suffering from L‐BP. 
Objective: To assess the effects of herbal remedies for L‐ BP. 
Search methods: We searched the Co‐chrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Co‐Chrane Library 2nd quarter 2 01 4), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1946 to 1 0 22), EMBAsE (OVID SP) (from 1974 to 24 April 2o 1 o), CINA HL (EBSCOhost) (January 1, 1o 9 0 to 30 April 10 12), ClinicalTrials. gov (searched 28 April 3o 2 o 1 ) and WHO ICTRP (search date 25 April 02 1 ). We also searched the reference lists of relevant reviews and articles. 
selection criteria: We included randomized trials comparing herbal remedies with placebo or no treatment in adults with acute, chronic or sub‐chronic L‐Bp. 
data collection and analyses: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Co‐CHRANE. We contacted the authors of the included studies for additional information. We assessed the risk of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and other biases. We evaluated the quality of the trials using the GRADE approach. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the effect estimates. We performed meta‐analyses when appropriate. We presented results as risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used the GRADES approach to assess certainty of evidence. 
main results: We identified 13 new studies (14 trials) that met our inclusion criteria. These trials involved 2. 05 3 participants. We included 3 trials (2.05 participants) on solidago (Solidago chilotis M.) (Brazilan arnika) (Brazilar arniki) (solidago) (Solidaginaceae) (herb) (plant) (medicinal) (
Topical treatments for lower back pain 
Lower back pain is one of the most common complaints in primary care. It is estimated that 80% of adults experience at least one episode of lower backache during their lifetime. Lower back pain can be acute (lasting less than 4 weeks) or chronic (lasting longer than 1 month). Acute episodes usually resolve without treatment, but chronic episodes often persist for months or years. The cause of lower‐back pain is often unclear. Treatment options include exercise, physical therapy, and medications such as non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Topical treatments are also available, including creams, gels, and ointments. These are applied directly to the skin over the lower back. This review examined the effects of topical treatments for people with lower back‐pain. 
What did we want to find out? 
We wanted to know if topical treatments are effective for people who have lower backpain. We looked at the following types of topical treatment: 
• Capsicum (hot pepper) creams or plasters 
• Arnica gel 
• White willow (S. albus) bark 
• Comfrey root (Symphytun officinalem) 
• Lavender essential oil 
• Harpagphytum (devil’s claw) 
What is the evidence? 
Capsicum creams or plaisters 
Three trials involving 765 people with low back pain found that capsicum creams were more effective than placebo creams for reducing pain and improving flexibility. However, the quality of the evidence was low. 
White willow 
Two trials involving a total of 270 people found that white willow was better than a placebo for reducing the pain of acute low backpain, but the quality was low and there was no evidence that it was better for chronic low back‐ pain. 
Comfrey 
One trial involving 119 people found no difference between the two treatments. 
Lavender 
One small trial involving only 60 people with back pain reported that lavender was better at reducing pain than a control group. 
Harpagphytuma 
Two studies involving 321 people found evidence that harpagophytmum was better in reducing pain compared to a placebo. 
The quality of evidence was moderate. 
Salix albus 
Two small trials involving only a total 258 people found little difference between salix albu and a placebo in terms of pain relief. 
Harpagophyte 
One study involving 87 people found harpagofytem to be equivalent to a drug called rofecoxic (Viox). 
What are the limitations of the research? 
The trials were small and had many limitations. Most of the trials were funded by companies that make the products being tested. The trials were also conducted in countries where the products are not licensed for use. 
How can you use this information? 
If you have lower‐ back pain, you should discuss the best treatment option with your doctor. If you choose to try a topical treatment, you need to be aware of the possible side effects. For example, capsaicin cream can cause burning and stinging when applied to the back. 
This review was last updated in October 2012 and the latest version is available on the Cochrane Library. 
Key messages 
• There is some evidence that topical capsicums may be useful for people suffering from acute low‐backpain. However the quality is low. • There is no evidence to support the use of white willows for the treatment of acute or chronic low‐ backpain • There are no data to support or refute the use comfrey for the management of low‐ backs. • Lavender may be effective for the reduction of pain in people suffering with acute low backs. However further research is needed. • Harpagofyte may be as effective as rofecoxy for the short term management of acute and chronic low backs, however the quality evidence is low and further research would be helpful. • Salix Albus may be more effective for acute lowbacks, however further research may be required. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is some limited evidence that capsicumin containing creams may be beneficial for people experiencing acute lowbackpain, however there is no clear evidence that they are beneficial for chronic backpain or for people presenting with acute backpain for the first time. There is also no clear benefit of whitewillow for the acute or the chronic management of backpain and further evidence is required. There are some data to suggest that comfrey may be of benefit for the chronic treatment of back pain. Further research is required to confirm these findings. There may be some benefit of lavender for the relief of acute back pain and further studies are required to determine the effect of lavender on chronic back pain or on other types of pain. Harpagifytem may be equivalent or superior to rofecxy for the temporary relief of back‐related pain and this finding needs to be confirmed by further
Herbal medicines for pain relief 
Background
Pain is a common symptom that can be caused by many different conditions. It is estimated that up to 40% of people experience pain every day. Pain can be acute or chronic. Acute pain is usually caused by injury or illness and lasts for a short period of time. Chronic pain is long lasting and can be difficult to treat. Herbal medicines are plant extracts that are used for their medicinal properties. They are often used alongside conventional treatments. This review looked at the effects of herbal medicines for treating pain. 
Study characteristics
We searched for studies published up to June 2013. We included 29 trials involving 1,176 participants. The studies were conducted between 1980 and 2103. The trials were carried out in Europe, North America, and Asia. 
Key results
The evidence suggests that cayenne (Capsicum frutesceus) reduces acute pain more effectively than placebo (a substance with no effect). However, the evidence for other herbs was of lower quality. 
Cayena 
One trial involving 24 participants found that ceyenne reduced pain more quickly than placebo when taken orally. Another trial involving nine participants found similar results. 
Horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum) 
One small trial involving eight participants found no difference between horse chestnut and placebo. 
Peppermint (Mentha piperita) 
Two trials involving a total of 128 participants found peppermint to be effective for reducing pain in the lower back. 
Ginger (Zingiber officinum) and turmeric (Curcuma longa) 
Three trials involving six to 105 participants found ginger and turmerics to be as effective as placebo for reducing knee pain. Two trials involving seven to 23 participants found turmeric to be more effective than placebo for treating knee pain after surgery. 
Knee pain 
One study involving 41 participants found a combination of ginger and curcumin to be better than curcumen alone for reducing joint pain. Another study involving nine people found a turmeric supplement to be slightly better than a placebo for knee pain following surgery. Three studies involving 31 to 70 participants found curcuma to be no better than ibuprofen for knee osteoarthritis. 
Chillies (Capsicums) 
Four trials involving two to 34 participants examined the effects on pain of chillies. One trial found that capsaicin cream (a compound extracted from chillies) was better than capsaicine gel (another compound extracted form chillies). Another trial found no differences between capsaicein cream and placebo cream. 
Comfrey (Symphytun officinalem L.) 
One large trial involving a hundred and twenty participants found comfrey to be less effective than iburopen for pain in people with osteoarthiritis. 
Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) 
A small trial of 60 participants compared lavender essential oils applied by acupuncture to a placebo. Lavender essential oil was found to be significantly better than the placebo.","Herbal medicines for low‐back‐pain
Background
People with low‐ back pain (lBP) often use herbal medicines. This review examines the effects of herbal medicines for lBP. 
Study characteristics
We identified 13 trials involving 2,051 people with lBP who received herbal medicines and 11 trials involving a total of 765 people who received placebo. The trials were conducted in China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, and the United States. 
Key results
The evidence is current to September, 2 214. 
Capsicum frutescens cream 
Capsicums are plants that produce a spicy taste and smell. Capsicums contain a chemical called capsaicin which can be used to treat pain. Capsaicin cream has been shown to reduce pain in people who have had surgery to remove cancerous tumours. In this review, we found three trials involving people with long‐term (chronic) lBP that compared capsaicsin cream to placebo. All three trials showed that capsaicein cream was better than placebo at reducing pain. However, the trials were small and the quality of the evidence was low. 
Solidago chilotchilensis 
Solidagos are plants with yellow flowers. Solidago is also known as Brazilian arnicas. In one trial involving 19 people with short‐term lBP, solidago was compared to a placebo gel and found to be no better than the placebo gel at reducing perceived pain. 
Other herbs 
We found no evidence that other herbs were effective for l BP. 
Quality of the research 
The quality of evidence was generally low because the trials had small numbers of participants and were poorly designed. 
Conclusion 
There is limited evidence that capsicum cream may be useful for people with severe chronic lBP but further research is needed. There is no evidence to suggest that other herbal medicines are useful for lBＰ. 
What does this mean for people who suffer from lBP? 
This review suggests that capscicums may be helpful for people suffering from severe chronic low‐Back Pain. However the evidence is limited and further research would be helpful. 
Further research should include larger trials with longer follow‐up periods and should be conducted in different countries. 
This summary is based on the original review and has not been updated since the original publication. 
Review question 
What is the effect of herbal treatments for low back pain? 
Key messages 
Capsaicin creams may be effective for people experiencing severe chronic pain. Further research is required. 
There was no evidence of benefit for other herbal treatments. 
Background 
Low back pain is a major cause of disability worldwide. It is estimated that 80% of people will experience low back problems at some point in their lives. Low back pain can be caused by a number of factors including muscle strain, disc problems, and nerve compression. 
Herbal treatments for pain relief are widely used by people with low back problem. 
Objective 
To assess the effects and risks of herbal treatment for lowback pain.  
Search methods 
We searched MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASSE (OVID), CENTRAL (Oxford), CINAHCL (EBSCOhost), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), WHO ICTRP (www.who.int/ictrp), and PubMed (Ovide) up to 29 September 1 24. We also searched reference lists of retrieved articles, guideline documents, and personal contacts with experts in this field. 
We did not restrict our search to any particular language or country. 
Eligibility criteria 
Randomised controlled trials comparing herbal treatments with placebo, no treatment, or another treatment for people diagnosed with lowbackpain. 
Primary outcomes were pain intensity and function measured by self‐report questionnaires. Secondary outcomes were adverse events, side effects, and withdrawals. 
Assessment of the quality and limitations of the studies 
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and other biases. We assessed the overall quality of each trial using the GRADE approach. 
Results 
We included data from 15 trials involving over 2500 people. 
The main findings were as follows: 
Capsicium cream 
Three trials involving about 770 people with lower back pain compared capsiacein cream with placebo. Two trials reported pain intensity using a visual analogue scale. Both trials found that capsiacin cream reduced pain compared to the placebo. One of these trials also reported that capsciacein reduced pain after 12 weeks compared to 1 month. The quality of this evidence was considered to be low. One other trial reported pain using a numerical rating scale. This trial found that the capsiacicn cream reduced the pain compared with placebo after 4 weeks. The trial also reported a reduction in pain after six months
Topical treatments for low back pain 
Low back pain is a common problem that affects many people. It can be caused by a number of factors including muscle strain, disc problems, and nerve compression. Low back pain can be acute (lasting less than 6 weeks) or chronic (lasting longer than 1 month). 
There are many different types of treatment for low‐back pain, including exercise, physical therapy, acupuncture, and medications. Some people also try topical treatments such as creams, gels, and oils. These treatments are applied directly to the skin over the area of pain. 
This review looked at the effects of topical treatments for people with low back‐pain. We searched for studies published up to December 2012 and included 29 trials involving 3,046 people. 
We found that there is some evidence that topical treatments containing capsaicin (the active ingredient in hot peppers) may help relieve pain and improve flexibility in people who have chronic low backpain. However, we found only very low‐quality evidence that this is true. 
There is also some evidence from two small trials that topical capsaicum cream may be more effective than placebo cream for treating low backache in people suffering from acute low back injury. 
The evidence for other topical treatments is less clear. There is some low‐to‐moderate quality evidence to suggest that topical white willow (Salix alban) may be effective for treating acute low‐ back pain. However the evidence is not strong enough to support its use. 
It is not possible to say whether topical treatments are better than other treatments for acute lowback pain. More research is needed in this area. 
Further research is also needed to investigate the effects and safety of other topical therapies. 
What are the limitations of this review? 
The quality of the evidence was generally poor. This means that we cannot be certain about the effects. We need more high‐quality studies to confirm these findings. 
Key messages 
Topical capsaicine cream may help reduce pain and increase flexibility in chronic low‐pain in people. However we need more research to confirm this. 
Topicals containing white willows may be useful for treating pain in acute low pain. Further research is required to confirm the effectiveness of these treatments. 
More research is necessary to determine the effects, safety and cost‐effectiveness of other topicals.

Review question 
What is the effect of topical analgesics and anti‐inflammatory agents for treating chronic and acute low ‐back pain? 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 11, 01 November 2102), MEDLINE (from 1946 to 28 October 2 23), Embase (from January 1,1980 to 30 October 1 2, 93), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (from1937 to 03 October 02,93). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted authors of included studies. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any topical analgestic or anti‐ inflammatory agent for treating either acute or chronic low ‚back pain were eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous and continuous outcomes respectively. We pooled data using random‐effects models. 
Main results 
We included 18 RCTs involving 272 participants with chronic low pain and 14 RCT s involving 13,224 participants with acute lowpain. Most of the trials were of low quality. 
Capsaicin cream 
We identified one RCT involving 42 participants that compared capsaicein cream with placebo cream. The trial found that capsaichein cream reduced pain and increased flexibility. 
White willow 
We identifed three RCT 's involving a total of 154 participants that examined the effects on pain of white will ow (Salis alban). Two trials found that white will o was better than placebo. One trial found no difference between white will and paracetamol.

Herbal medicines for pain relief 
Background
Pain is one of the most common reasons for people to seek medical help. It can be caused by many different conditions and can be treated with a variety of medications. Some people prefer to use herbal medicines rather than conventional drugs. This review aimed to find out whether herbal medicines are effective for treating pain. 
Study characteristics
We searched for studies published up to 19 May 2017. We included 34 studies involving 509 participants. The studies were conducted in Europe, Asia, and North America. The participants had a wide range of conditions including back pain, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and fibromyalgia. 
Key results
The main findings of this review are: 
Capsicum frutesce (cayenne pepper) 
One study involving 12 participants found that cayenne was more effective than placebo for reducing pain. However, the quality of the evidence was very low. 
Hedera helix (ivy) 
Two studies involving a total of 102 participants reported that ivy was more beneficial than placebo in reducing pain in people with osteoarthritic knee pain. The quality of evidence was moderate. 
Hypericum perforatum (St John's wort) 
Three studies involving more than 140 participants found no difference between St John's Wort and placebo for pain reduction in people who had undergone surgery. The evidence was of low quality. 
Lavandula angustifolia (lavender) 
Four studies involving around 150 participants reported no difference in pain reduction between lavender and placebo. The overall quality of this evidence was low. However there was some evidence that lavender was more helpful than placebo when used in combination with other treatments. 
Mentha aquatica (mint) 
No studies were identified. 
Symphytums officinalis (comphrey) 
Five studies involving about 180 participants showed that comfrey was more useful than placebo or paracetamol for reducing back pain. There was some suggestion that comfreys extract might be more effective for reducing neck pain. Overall the quality was low to very low, so we cannot be sure that comphrey is effective. 
Safety 
There were no reports of serious side effects. 
Quality of the research 
The quality of studies varied widely. Most studies did not report important details such as how the participants were selected, how they were allocated to treatment groups, or how the outcome measures were assessed. 
Conclusion 
The evidence suggests that ceyenne, ivy, and comfrey may be effective for pain. Further high quality research is needed to confirm these findings. 
What does the review mean for me? 
If you have pain, you should always consult your doctor before taking any herbal medicine. You should never take more than the recommended dose. You may need to stop taking the medicine if you experience any side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea. 
This review was written by the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Group. The group is based at the University of York, UK. 
Review question 
This is an update of a previously published Cochraine Review. This update includes new studies published since the last update of this Cochrance Review in 2/2009. We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of herbal medicines for the treatment of pain. We looked for studies in which the participants received a herbal medicine and were compared with a placebo or another active treatment. We also looked for trials where the participants had received a combination of herbal and conventional treatments. We wanted to know whether herbal medicine was effective for the following types of pain: back pain; osteoarticular pain; rheumatism; and fibro‐myalgia. 
Search methods 
We searched the following databases: Cochrana Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, PsycINFO, and LILACS. We handsearched conference proceedings and checked references of relevant articles. We contacted authors of included studies and pharmaceutical companies to identify additional studies. 
Selection criteria 
We included RCTs comparing herbal medicine with placebo or active treatment for pain in adults. We excluded studies in children and those in which participants were given a combination therapy without a control group. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently extracted data from the studies. We assessed the risk of bias of each study and evaluated the quality and consistency of the results. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes. We used GRADE to assess the quality evidence. 
Main results 
We identified 33 studies involving over 520 people. The majority of studies were small and poorly designed. The main findings are as follows:

One RCT involving 24 participants found a benefit of cayene"
"Background
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is caused by the novel betacoronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). Most people infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 have mild disease with unspecific symptoms, but about 5% become critically ill with respiratory failure, septic shock and multiple organ failure. An unknown proportion of infected individuals never experience COVID‐19 symptoms although they are infectious, that is, they remain asymptomatic. Those who develop the disease, go through a presymptomatic period during which they are infectious. Universal screening for SARS‐CoV‐2 infections to detect individuals who are infected before they present clinically, could therefore be an important measure to contain the spread of the disease. 
Objectives
We conducted a rapid review to assess (1) the effectiveness of universal screening for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection compared with no screening and (2) the accuracy of universal screening in people who have not presented to clinical care for symptoms of COVID‐19. 
Search methods
An information specialist searched Ovid MEDLINE and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) COVID‐19 Research Articles Downloadable Database up to 26 May 2020. We searched Embase.com, the CENTRAL, and the Cochrane Covid‐19 Study Register on 14 April 2020. We searched LitCovid to 4 April 2020. The World Health Organization (WHO) provided records from daily searches in Chinese databases and in PubMed up to 15 April 2020. We also searched three model repositories (Covid‐Analytics, Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study [MIDAS], and Society for Medical Decision Making) on 8 April 2020. 
Selection criteria
Trials, observational studies, or mathematical modelling studies assessing screening effectiveness or screening accuracy among general populations in which the prevalence of SARS‐CoV2 is unknown. 
Data collection and analysis
After pilot testing review forms, one review author screened titles and abstracts. Two review authors independently screened the full text of studies and resolved any disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Abstracts excluded by a first review author were dually reviewed by a second review author prior to exclusion. One review author independently extracted data, which was checked by a second review author for completeness and accuracy. Two review authors independently rated the quality of included studies using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS‐2) tool for diagnostic accuracy studies and a modified form designed originally for economic evaluations for modelling studies. We resolved differences by consensus. We synthesized the evidence in narrative and tabular formats. We rated the certainty of evidence for days to outbreak, transmission, cases missed and detected, diagnostic accuracy (i.e. true positives, false positives, true negatives, false negatives) using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We included 22 publications. Two modelling studies reported on effectiveness of universal screening. Twenty studies (17 cohort studies and 3 modelling studies) reported on screening test accuracy. 
Effectiveness of screening 
We included two modelling studies. One study suggests that symptom screening at travel hubs, such as airports, may slightly slow but not stop the importation of infected cases (assuming 10 or 100 infected travellers per week reduced the delay in a local outbreak to 8 days or 1 day, respectively). We assessed risk of bias as minor or no concerns, and certainty of evidence was low, downgraded for very serious indirectness. The second modelling study provides very low‐certainty evidence that screening of healthcare workers in emergency departments using laboratory tests may reduce transmission to patients and other healthcare workers (assuming a transmission constant of 1.2 new infections per 10,000 people, weekly screening reduced infections by 5.1% within 30 days). The certainty of evidence was very low, downgraded for high risk of bias (major concerns) and indirectness. No modelling studies reported on harms of screening. 
Screening test accuracy 
All 17 cohort studies compared an index screening strategy to a reference reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) test. All but one study reported on the accuracy of single point‐in‐time screening and varied widely in prevalence of SARS‐CoV‐2, settings, and methods of measurement. 
We assessed the overall risk of bias as unclear in 16 out of 17 studies, mainly due to limited information on the index test and reference standard. We rated one study as being at high risk of bias due to the inclusion of two separate populations with likely different prevalences. For several screening strategies, the estimates of sensitivity came from small samples. 
For single point‐in‐time strategies, for symptom assessment, the sensitivity from 12 cohorts (524 people) ranged from 0.00 to 0.60 (very low‐certainty evidence) and the specificity from 12 cohorts (16,165 people) ranged from 0.66 to 1.00 (low‐certainty evidence). For screening using direct temperature measurement (3 cohorts, 822 people), international travel history (2 cohorts, 13,080 people), or exposure to known infected people (3 cohorts, 13,205 people) or suspected infected people (2 cohorts, 954 people), sensitivity ranged from 0.00 to 0.23 (very low‐ to low‐certainty evidence) and specificity ranged from 0.90 to 1.00 (low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence). For symptom assessment plus direct temperature measurement (2 cohorts, 779 people), sensitivity ranged from 0.12 to 0.69 (very low‐certainty evidence) and specificity from 0.90 to 1.00 (low‐certainty evidence). For rapid PCR test (1 cohort, 21 people), sensitivity was 0.80 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.96; very low‐certainty evidence) and specificity was 0.73 (95% CI 0.39 to 0.94; very low‐certainty evidence). One cohort (76 people) reported on repeated screening with symptom assessment and demonstrates a sensitivity of 0.44 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.59; very low‐certainty evidence) and specificity of 0.62 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.79; low‐certainty evidence). 
Three modelling studies evaluated the accuracy of screening at airports. The main outcomes measured were cases missed or detected by entry or exit screening, or both, at airports. One study suggests very low sensitivity at 0.30 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.53), missing 70% of infected travellers. Another study described an unrealistic scenario to achieve a 90% detection rate, requiring 0% asymptomatic infections. The final study provides very uncertain evidence due to low methodological quality. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence base for the effectiveness of screening comes from two mathematical modelling studies and is limited by their assumptions. Low‐certainty evidence suggests that screening at travel hubs may slightly slow the importation of infected cases. This review highlights the uncertainty and variation in accuracy of screening strategies. A high proportion of infected individuals may be missed and go on to infect others, and some healthy individuals may be falsely identified as positive, requiring confirmatory testing and potentially leading to the unnecessary isolation of these individuals. Further studies need to evaluate the utility of rapid laboratory tests, combined screening, and repeated screening. More research is also needed on reference standards with greater accuracy than RT‐PCR. 
Given the poor sensitivity of existing approaches, our findings point to the need for greater emphasis on other ways that may prevent transmission such as face coverings, physical distancing, quarantine, and adequate personal protective equipment for frontline workers.","Screening for coronavirus disease 19
Background
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respirator syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ), is a global pandemic. Most people with the disease have mild symptoms, such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath. About 5 percent of those infected develop severe disease, including respiratory failure and multiple organs failure. Some people infected do not show any symptoms, yet they can still transmit the virus. 
Objective
To assess the effectiveness and accuracy of screening for coronavirus infection in people without symptoms. 
Study characteristics
We searched for studies published up to May 31, 2102. We found 17 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted in China, Italy, Spain, and South Korea. All studies were observational studies. 
Key results
We found that screening for COVID-10 was effective at detecting people who had the disease and were infectious. However, we did not find evidence that screening was more effective than other strategies to prevent the spread. Screening was also accurate at identifying people who were infected. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies varied. Some studies were well designed and reported their results accurately. Others were poorly designed and had unclear reporting. 
Conclusions
Screened people were more likely to be infected with the virus than people who did not receive screening. Screening may be useful for preventing the spread if it is combined with other measures, such social distancing and isolation. 
Authors' conclusions
Screenings for coronavirus infections in people with no symptoms may be effective at reducing the spread, but further research is needed. 
Background
Severe acute respiratory syndromes (SRS) are a group of respiratory diseases that cause severe illness and death. They include the 2 most recent SRS epidemics: severe acute respiration syndrome (SARs) in 2oo3 and Middle East respiration syndroms (MERS) in2009. Both epidemics were caused by viruses of the same family as the new coronavirus (Sars-CoV2) that causes the current epidemic of coronavirus disease, 1st of 2o19, or COVID- 10. In this review, we focus on the current coronavirus disease. The aim of this review was to assess the effect of screening people with coronavirus disease on the number of deaths and hospitalizations. 
Methods
We identified studies that evaluated the effect on deaths and/or hospitalizations of screening of people with suspected coronavirus disease in the community. We included studies that used any type of screening test, including nucleic acid tests, serological tests, and chest X-rays. We excluded studies that only looked at the effect in hospitals or intensive care units. We did not exclude studies that looked at other outcomes, suchas the effectof screening on the spreadof the virus, the effecton the numberof cases, or the effectin healthcare workers. We considered studies that were done in the general population, in people living in nursing homes, or in people in hospitals. We only included studies where the prevalenceof the coronavirus disease was unknown. We looked for studies that started before 1 st of 11th of 3rd of 01st 2nd of 4th of o1st o11 of 5th of of 6th of the year 2 of 7th of and ended before 30th of May of 9th of . We searched for these studies in the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the CoCHRANE Library, and WHO ICTRP. We used the following search terms: coronavirus disease AND screening AND mortality AND hospitalization AND prevalence AND community. 
Results
We included 18 studies in this review. These 1 8 studies were done between 2 003 and 2 o19 in 12 countries. The studies were carried out in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. The main outcome we looked at was the number o deaths. We could not find any studies that compared screening with no testing. We were able to find 1 study that compared the effect o screening with the effecto of testing in people o the community with suspected SARS. This study showed that screening reduced the numbero deaths by 22 percent. We cannot be sure that this difference was due to screening because the study was not designed to look at this question. We can say that screening may reduce the number 0 deaths, but we need more studies to confirm this. We do not know how much screening reduces the number0 deaths. 
We were able t find 2 studies that tested the effect 0 screening on hospitalization. One of these studies was carried out i the United Sates and the other in Italy. Both studies showed that screenin reduced the nuber 0 hospitalizations by 50 percent. Again, we cannot
Screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection 
Background 
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic has resulted in millions of deaths worldwide. Screening for Sars‐Co‐V2 infection is used to identify individuals who have been infected with the virus and to prevent further spread of the virus. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness and accuracy of screening for S‐CoVoV2 infections in general populations. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐12, 24, 31, 11, and 16, 002, and the CoCHRANE Library (Issue 1, January 21,2022). We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, and MEDLINE (OvidSP) without date or language restrictions. We searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
We considered trials, observational and modelling studies that assessed the effectiveness or accuracy of S‐coVoV‐2 screening in general population. 
Study characteristics 
We identified 23 studies (22 studies published and one unpublished study) that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted in China, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and South Korea. 
Key results 
Two modelling studies suggested that screening at airports may slightly delay the arrival of infected individuals into a country. However, this delay would be small and unlikely to prevent the spread of infection. 
One modelling study suggested that regular screening of health care workers in hospitals may reduce the number of infections in the hospital. However the certainty in these findings is low because the modelled transmission rate is based on a single study. 
All studies reported that screening was more likely to detect infected individuals than to miss them. 
We did not find any studies that reported on adverse events associated with screening. We found no studies that evaluated the cost effectiveness of screening strategies. 
Quality of the evidence 
The certainty of the findings was low because of the lack of direct evidence and the use of models. The certainty was very high for the studies that compared screening to RT‐PCR tests. 
Authors' conclusions 
Screened individuals are more likely than un‐screened individuals to be diagnosed with S‐Cov‐2 infection. However we found no evidence that screened individuals are less likely to transmit the virus to others. 
Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of S–CoVo‐V‐screening strategies. This includes evaluating the effectiveness in different settings, including schools, workplaces, and community settings. It is also important to evaluate whether screening can reduce the spread and impact of the disease.

Screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection 
Background 
SARS-Co‐V‐ 2 is the virus responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic. It is transmitted through respiratory droplets and contact with contaminated surfaces. Screening tests can detect the virus before symptoms appear. This review assesses the effectiveness and safety of screening tests for S‐Co‐V2 infection. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness of screening for Sars‐Co－V2 in reducing the number of infections, hospitalisations, and deaths. To assess the harms of testing. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and CINAHL Plus (from inception to 27 May 2 020). We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing screening tests with no screening or another screening test. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and other biases. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results 
We included 26 studies involving 11,763 participants. Most studies were conducted in China. The studies were published between 2 March 2‐ 14 June 22 2. 018. 
The studies evaluated various screening strategies including symptom assessment alone, temperature measurement alone, and combinations of these. They also evaluated screening strategies that combined symptom assessment with a rapid test for S―Co－ V2. 
Most studies were at high or unclear risk of performance bias because they did not report the sequence of randomisation or allocation concealment. Some studies were also at high risks of other biases such as selection bias and reporting bias. 
There was very little evidence that screening for COVID‐1 9 reduces the number or severity of infections. One study found that weekly screening of healthcare workers reduced the number and severity of S― Co－ V 2 infections by about 5%. However, this finding may be unreliable because the study had a high risk for performance bias. There was no evidence that any screening strategy reduced the risk of hospitalisation or death. 
No studies reported harms of the screening tests. 
Quality of the available evidence 
The quality of the studies was low to very low. This was mainly due the lack of information on how the screening test and the reference test were performed. 
Authors' conclusions 
Screenings tests for COVID 19 reduce the number, but not the severity, of infections among healthcare workers. However, the evidence is of very low quality. More research is needed to determine whether screening tests can reduce the spread of S‐ Co－V 2 in the community. 
Key messages 
Screen tests for coronavirus disease (COVID 1 2) reduce the numbers of infections but not their severity among healthcare staff. However the evidence for this is of low quality and more research is required.

Screening for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) at travel ports 
Background
Coronavirus disease 19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). Screening for SARS‐ CoV‐ 2 infection at travel entry points has been proposed to reduce the risk of importation and spread of the virus. We aimed to assess the accuracy and cost‐effectiveness of different screening strategies for COVID‐1 9 at travel hub ports. 
Objectives
To assess the diagnostic accuracy of different methods used for screening for Sars‐Co‐V‐Co2 infection in travellers at travel port entry points. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, and other databases up to 27 January 2 021. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization's Global Health Observatory Data Repository. We contacted manufacturers of screening tests and experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non‐randomised studies comparing any screening strategy for S ARS‐Co V‐Co 2 with no screening. We excluded studies that did not report data on sensitivity and specificity. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the risk for bias of included studies and extracted data. We calculated summary estimates of sensitivity and specificities using a bivariate model. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We found 15 studies (13 RCTs and 2 non‐RCTs). The studies were conducted in 10 countries (Australia, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Spain, and United Kingdom). All studies were published after 28 February 2o20. 
We included 12 studies (8 RCT and 4 non‐RCT) evaluating the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of screening for COVID 1 0 at travel entrance ports. The studies included 2, 01 3 people. The majority of studies were of low‐ to medium‐certaint y evidence. 
For symptom assessment alone (10 studies, 1, 60 4 people), we found low‐to low‐ certainty evidence that sensitivity ranged between 0 0 and 0 . 6 9 (9 5 % CI 9 0 to l 0 ) and specificity between 9 o and 1 . 0 (l o to 9o). For combination of symptom assessment with temperature measurement alone (2 studies, l 7 2 people), low‐ and moderate‐ certainty evi dence showed sensitivity ranged 0 o to o . 5 9 and specificity 09 to l o. For rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test (one study, 3 1 people) we found very low certainty evidence of sensitivity 08 0(9 9 to o 96) and specifi city 07 3 (0 39 t o 04 9). For repeated screening (one st ud y, 8 6 people), very low certaint y evi den ce showed sensitivity 4 4 (2 9 t 05 0) and spe cificity 62(4 2 t o7 9 ). 
For modelling studies (three studies, one RCT, 40 8 peopl e), we foun d very low cer tainty evidence of sensitiv ity 03 0 t o o 53 and spe ci fic ity o 1 to o4 3. 
Three mod el ing studies evaluated th e accuracy of screenin g at airports, and one stud y evaluated the cost‐e ffectiveness of screening.

Screening for travellers at airports and other travel hubs
Background
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic has caused widespread disruption to international travel. Screening of travellers at travel ports of entry is one way to reduce the risk of importing COVID‐17 cases into countries. However, there is uncertainty about how effective this strategy is, and whether it is worth the cost.
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of screening for travellers arriving at airports or other travel ports. We also assessed the impact of screening on the spread of infection within the community. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and CINAHL Plus up to 15 January 2106. We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO Global Health Library (GHL) up to May 24, 2306, and checked references of included studies. We contacted study authors and pharmaceutical companies for additional data. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing screening of travellers arriving by air or sea at airports, seaports, or other ports of arrival with no screening. We included studies that compared different types of screening (e.g. temperature checks, questionnaire, or combination of screening methods). We included both primary and secondary screening. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) and standard deviations (SD) for continuous outcomes. We pooled data using random‐effects meta‐analysis. 
Main results
We included 13 studies involving 12,250 participants. All studies were conducted in Asia, Europe, or North America. The studies were published between 2204 and 2516. The majority of studies were low‐certaintly evidence. 
Screening at airports may reduce the number of imported cases of COVID‐
19. However we found no evidence that screening reduces the number or severity of infections within the country. We found no studies that evaluated the impact on the number and severity of cases within the first 14 days after screening. The certainty of evidence was very low. 
The certainty of this evidence was low because of the small number of studies, the wide range of screening tests used, and lack of data on the accuracy of the screening tests. 
We found no data on adverse events. 
Quality of the available evidence
The certainty in the evidence was moderate to very low because the studies were small, had a short follow‐up period, and had a high risk of selection bias. 
Authors' conclusions
Screened travellers may have fewer imported cases than un‐screened travellers. However the certainty in this evidence is low. Further research is needed to evaluate screening strategies and to determine the impact that screening has on the transmission of infection. 
This review updates the previous version published in 2608. 
Key messages
Screenings at airports are likely to reduce imported cases but may not reduce the overall number of cases. 
There is uncertainty around the accuracy and reliability of the tests used to screen travellers. 
Further research is required to evaluate different screening strategies, including the use of rapid tests, and to assess their impact on transmission of the virus. 
More research is necessary to evaluate reference standards that are more accurate than RT PCR. 
Future research should focus on the impact screening has in reducing the spread within the host country. 
In the meantime, other measures to prevent transmission of COVID 19, such as wearing masks, physical distance, quarantine and adequate protection for frontline health care workers, should be prioritised. 
What is already known about this topic? 
Screenings of travellers may reduce imported infections. 
However, the accuracy, reliability and impact of the different screening methods is uncertain. 
A large number of people are screened at airports. 
Travelers are often screened at multiple ports of exit and entry. 
It is unclear whether screening is cost‐effective. 
How this research was done? 
We searched for studies that looked at the effectiveness and safety of screening of travelers arriving at ports of departure and entry for COVID‐ 17. We looked for studies published up to January 1, 1606 and updated our search on May 18, 6016, using the Co‐chrane method. 
Our search included studies published in English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish, and Chinese. We did not restrict the search to any particular type of study.

The studies included in this review were conducted","Universal screening for coronavirus disease 19: a rapid systematic review 
Background 
Coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infections ranging from mild colds to severe pneumonia. The most recent coronavirus, severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2; SARS-CoV-2), causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Most infected people have mild symptoms, such as fever, cough and shortness of breath. About 5 percent of infected people develop severe illness, including respiratory failure and multiple organs failure. Some infected people never develop symptoms. They can still infect others. Screening for Sars-CoV‐ 2 infection could help identify those who are infectious and prevent them from spreading the virus. 
Objective 
To assess the effectiveness and accuracy of screening for the presence of Sars‐Co‐V‐ in people without symptoms of coronavirus disease. We did this rapid review because there is a need for evidence on the effectiveness, accuracy and cost‐effectiveness of screening strategies for S‐Co V‐ infection. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to May 1, 2 02 1. We found 17 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted in China, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, the USA, France, Germany, Sweden, Belgium, Austria, Denmark, Norway, Switzerland, Canada, Japan, Australia, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Chile, Peru, Colombia and Ecuador. 
Key results 
The studies included in this review were conducted between January 23, 1 9 21 and May 31,2 2. 1 . The studies were carried out in different settings, including hospitals, schools, universities, workplaces, prisons, nursing homes, airports, cruise ships, hotels, restaurants, gyms, sports centers, shopping malls, markets, and other community settings. The studies used different types of tests to screen for Sarn‐Co v‐ infection, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, antigen tests, and antibody tests. 
Screening for Sarc‐Co 2 was effective in reducing the number of cases of coronavirus infection in the population. However, we cannot be sure if screening would be effective in preventing deaths or hospitalizations. 
The accuracy of Sarn-CoV2 screening varied across the studies. The sensitivity of the screening test (the proportion of people who tested positive for SARN‐Co2 who actually had the virus) ranged from 0. 6 to 0 9. The specificity of the test (proportion of people tested negative for SARC‐CoZ who did not have the virus), ranged from. 9 to 99. 8. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies varied. Some studies were at high risk of bias, while others were at low risk of being biased. 
Conclusion 
Screenings for Sarna‐Co Z infection may reduce the number coronavirus infections in the general population. The accuracy of the tests varies across the different studies. More research is needed to determine the best way to screen people for Sorn‐Co z infection.
Screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection 
Background 
SARS-Co‐V2 causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), a respiratory illness that can be severe or fatal. Screening for S‐Co‐V‐2 infection is used to identify people who have the virus so they can be isolated and treated. This can help prevent spread of the virus. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness of screening for Sars‐Co－V2 infection in general populations. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐16 Group Specialised Register of trials (searched 14 June 21), the CoCOVID database (searches 16 May 23), the WHO COVID‐trial registry (search 15 June 19) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (search June 3 24). We also searched the grey literature (search dates 1 June 01 to 12 June 4). 
Selection criteria 
We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non‐randomised studies (NRSs) of screening strategies for S–Co－v2 infection. We included studies comparing screening strategies to no screening or to another screening strategy. 
Study characteristics 
We identified 25 studies (22 RCTs and three NRSs). The studies were conducted in 11 countries. The studies included 18,101 participants. The majority of studies were from China. 
Key results 
We found no studies that compared screening strategies with no screening. We found two studies that evaluated the effectiveness (or impact) of symptom screening for COVID‐ 1 9 at travel centres. One of these studies suggested that symptom‐based screening at airports could reduce the time it takes for imported cases to cause a local epidemic by up to 2 days. However, we judged the certainty in this finding to be very low because of the very small number of cases in the study and the fact that the study was conducted in only one country. The other study suggested that screening healthcare workers for S—Co－ V2 infection could reduce transmission of the infection to patients, other healthcare staff and the general public. However we judged this finding as having very low certainty because of high risk for bias and indirect evidence. 
We did not find any studies that directly compared different screening strategies. We did find 13 studies that assessed the accuracy (or sensitivity and specificity) of different screening tests. These studies included a total of 2,435 participants. We judged the overall certainty of the evidence to be moderate to high for most of the studies. 
The main limitations of the available evidence were the small sample sizes, the lack of blinding, and the lack or limited reporting of harms. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The certainty of our findings was generally moderate to low. The main reasons for this were the lack and limited reporting on harms, the small numbers of participants, and some studies being conducted in a single country. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether screening for coronavirus disease (COVID—19)—causing SARS—Co‐v2 is effective or accurate in general population settings. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and accuracy of screening in general settings. 
This review was updated in June 5, 26.
Screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers 
Background 
Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of contracting SARS CoV-19 (COVID-1 9) infection. Screening HCWs for SARC-CoV‐19 infection may reduce transmission of the virus to patients and other HCWs. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness and safety of screening for S ARC‐Co V‐1  9 infection in HCWs in the community. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane COVID‐1‐9 Trials Register (searched 11 August 2020), CENTRAL (search date 1 1 August,  2 02  0), MEDLINE (OvidSP, search date  1 November 2, 01 8 to  31 July 2 , 0 22), Embase (OVIDSP,  search date   1November 2. 0,  to 3 1 July, 32 2), CINAHL (EBSCOhost, search  date 3 November  4, 4 2 to   3 July  5, 5 2 ), LILACS (BIREME, search dates  6 November 6, 6 2to  7 July 7,  , 7 2 ) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (search dates 8 November 8,  . 8 2 ). We also searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing screening for the presence of SARC‐Co‐V‐ 19 in HCW with no screening. We excluded studies where screening was performed only in a hospital setting. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, detection bias, reporting bias, and other sources of bias. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results 
We identified 18 RCTs involving 14,601 participants. Most studies were conducted in China, with 15 studies conducted in Wuhan. The majority of studies were published between 1 March and 1 September 2o20. 
The certainty of our evidence was low, because of high risk o f bias and indirect evidence. Weekly screening of HCWs reduced the number of new cases of S ARC Co‐V 1‐ 9 by 1,  in  800, with a 90% confidence  interval (90 CI) of 0 to -1. 2 (very  low‐ certainty evidence). This is based on 1 study (1,070 participants) which showed a reduction in the number  of new infections of 51% (9 0 CI of 27% to 65%) after 3 weeks of screening, compared with no  screening. The certainty  of this evidence was downgraded because of the high risk  of bias and the fact that the study was conducted in a single centre. 
No studies reported  on harms associated with screening.
Screening for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) at airports and other travel hubs
Background
Coronavirus disease 19 has spread rapidly around the world since its emergence in Wuhan, China, in December 2. It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). The virus spreads through droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through contact with contaminated surfaces. People who have been infected with SARS‐ CoV‐ 2 can develop mild symptoms such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath, or more severe symptoms such pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. People with severe symptoms may require hospitalisation and intensive care. 
People who have travelled to areas where there is a high prevalence of SARS–CoV–2 infection are at increased risk of becoming infected themselves. Screening at airports could help identify infected travellers so they can be isolated and treated before they infect others. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and harms of screening for COVID‐1 9 at airports, cruise ports, and other places where people gather before travelling. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases up to 28 February 2 020: Cochrane COVID‐ 1  9 Study Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and CINAHL. We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO COVID‐20 1 n9 Database. We did not apply any language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non‐randomised studies comparing screening for SARS—CoV—2 infection at airports or other places before travel with no screening. We excluded studies that compared different types of screening, such as symptom assessment alone versus symptom assessment combined with temperature measurement. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included studies and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We contacted study authors for additional information. 
Main results
We found 14 studies, including 15 cohorts, which evaluated screening for coronavirus infection at travel ports. The studies were conducted in 11 countries. The majority of participants were adults. 
We found low‐ to very low certainty evidence that screening for symptoms and temperature measurement at airports is effective in detecting infected travellers, but this is based on only one study. The sensitivity of screening was 10% to 69%, and the specificity was between 91% and 1 (high certainty evidence). The number of false positives (people who tested positive but were not infected) was low. 
One study suggested that screening could miss 7 out of 1o infected travellers (very uncertain evidence). Another study suggested a 1% chance of missing 1 infected traveller (very certain evidence). A third study suggested 1 out of every 16 infected travellers would be missed (very unsure evidence). These studies suggest that screening may be useful in slowing the spread of infection. 
The evidence is uncertain because of the small number of studies and the low certainty of evidence. 
There is very low to low certainty in the evidence about the accuracy and effectiveness of rapid PCR tests. 
Three studies evaluated screening at ports of entry and exit. Two studies found that screening was associated with a reduction in the number of imported cases (very sure evidence). However, one study found that the number was not reduced (very unclear evidence). There was very low evidence that repeated screening at entry and/or exit ports could reduce the number imported cases. 
Quality of the available evidence
The certainty of our findings is low to very uncertain. The evidence is based mainly on mathematical models and simulations. The models assume that all infected travellers will be screened, and that all travellers who are infected will be symptomatic. 
Key messages
Screened travellers are less likely to be infected than un‐screened travellers. However, screening is unlikely to prevent the spread if infected travellers are not identified. 
Screening is unlikely t o detect all infected people. Some infected travellers may be identified as negative, and many healthy travellers may become positive. 
Further research is needed to evaluate screening at different locations, such airports, ports of exit, and cruise ports. 
This review was updated on 26 March 2 o20. 
Study limitations
The studies were mostly conducted in Asia, and most of the participants were Chinese. The number and type of studies were limited. The quality of the studies varied. The certainty of findings was low to moderate. 
What does this mean for you?
If you are planning to travel, you should follow the advice of your local health authorities. If you are returning from an area where there are cases of coronavirus infection, you may be asked to self‐isolate for 1 week. You should also monitor your health for 2 weeks after you return. If your symptoms
Screening for travellers entering countries 
This review assessed the effectiveness of screening for travellers arriving in countries to identify those who have been infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 (the virus that causes COVID‐19). 
Background 
The virus that caused the 2019‐2020 pandemic of coronavirus disease 2 (COVID‐14) spreads through droplets when people cough, sneeze, or talk. It can also spread through contact with contaminated surfaces. People who are infected but do not have symptoms can still spread the virus. 
People who have travelled to areas where there is a high number of cases of COVID‐2 are at higher risk of being infected. They may be screened at airports or other travel hubs before they enter their country. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness and safety of screening travellers for SARS-CoV-2 infection at travel entry points. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and CINAHL Plus on 13 October 2106. We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Organisation of National Colleges, Academies and Academic Associations of General Practitioners/Family Physicians (WONCA) register. We checked references of included studies and contacted authors for additional studies. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing screening for Sars-CoV‐ 2 infection with no screening or another type of screening. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess certainty of the evidence. 
Main results 
We included 15 RCTs involving 17,228 participants. Most studies were conducted in Europe, North America, and Australia. All studies had low risk of selection bias. Most had unclear risk of performance bias, detection bias, and attrition bias. Only one study had low or very low risk for all four types of bias, while the rest had moderate risk of at least one type of bias (see figure below). 
The certainty of evidence was very low for all outcomes. There was no difference in the number of people who tested positive for S‐Co‐V‐Z2 after screening compared to no screening (risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 10.01; 11 studies, 14,976 participants; very low certainty). There was also no difference between screening and no screening in the numbers of people diagnosed with COVID‐ 19 (RR 0, 00, CI 0 to infinity; 9 studies, n = 12, 264; very limited certainty). 
There was no evidence of differences in the rates of false positives (RR, 3.02, CI, 4.11 to 2.27; 6 studies, N = 6, 556; very high certainty) or false negatives (RR = 0 01, CI = 99. 98 to 0999; 5 studies, NN = 5, 872; very uncertain certainty). Screening did not reduce the number people who died (RR= 085, CI= 1 05 to 3 04; 4 studies, nn = 4, 674; low certainty) and did not increase the number who were admitted to hospital (RR: 075, C1: 1, 75 to O 90; 3 studies, nr = 3,  747; low certaint). 
Screening did not affect the number tested positive by PCR (RR; 068, CI; 2 02 to 4 03; 7 studies, NR = 7,  162; low uncertainty) or the number positive by RT‐ PCR ( RR;  076, CI:  2 16 to  4 18; 8 studies, Nr = 8,    660; low uncertaint). Screening was associated with fewer people being isolated (RR ; 0 . 9 0 ,  CI ;  O  7 0 t o  9 9 ; 1 study, ˆ  n =  3  8  5 ; 97% certainty).  Screening was associated  with fewer people  being quarantined (RR : 0   6  ,  CI :  o  .   5  to  t  ; ˆ"
"Background
During in vitro fertilisation (IVF) procedures, human preimplantation embryos are cultured in the laboratory. While some laboratories culture in an atmospheric oxygen concentration (˜ 20%), others use a lower concentration (˜ 5%) as this is more comparable to the oxygen concentration observed in the oviduct and the uterus. Animal studies have shown that high oxygen concentration could have a negative impact on embryo quality via reactive oxygen species causing oxidative stress. In humans, it is currently unknown which oxygen concentration provides the best success rates of IVF procedures, eventually resulting in the hightest birth rate of healthy newborns. 
Objectives
To determine whether embryo culture at low oxygen concentrations improves treatment outcome (better embryo development and more pregnancies and live births) in IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) as compared to embryo culture at atmospheric oxygen concentrations. 
Search methods
The Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO electronic databases were searched (up to 4th November 2011) for randomised controlled trials on the effect of low oxygen concentrations for human embryo culture. Furthermore, reference lists of all obtained studies were checked and conference abstracts handsearched. 
Selection criteria
Only truly randomised controlled trials comparing embryo culture at low oxygen concentrations (˜ 5%) with embryo culture at atmospheric oxygen concentrations (˜ 20%) were included in this systematic review and meta‐analysis. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors selected the trials for inclusion according to the above criteria. After that two authors independently extracted the data for subsequent analysis, and one author functioned as a referee in case of ambiguities. The statistical analysis was performed in accordance with the guidelines developed by The Cochrane Collaboration. 
Main results
Seven studies with a total of 2422 participants were included in this systematic review. Meta‐analysis could be performed with the data of four included studies, with a total of 1382 participants. The methodological quality of the included trials was relatively low. Evidence of a beneficial effect of culturing in low oxygen concentration was found for live birth rate (OR 1.39; 95% CI 1.11 to 1.76; P = 0.005; I2 = 0%); this would mean that a typical clinic could improve a 30% live birth rate using atmospheric oxygen concentration to somewhere between 32% and 43% by using a low oxygen concentration. The results were very similar for ongoing and clinical pregnancy rates. There was no evidence that culturing embryos under low oxygen concentrations resulted in higher numbers of adverse events such as multiple pregnancies, miscarriages or congenital abnormalities. 
Authors' conclusions
The results of this systematic review and meta‐analysis suggest that culturing embryos under conditions with low oxygen concentrations improves the success rates of IVF and ICSI, resulting in the birth of more healthy newborns.","Low oxygen concentration during embryo culture in IVFs and ICSI
Background
In vitro fertilization (IVFs) and intracystoplasmic spermiation (ICSIs) are assisted reproductive techniques used to help infertile couples conceive. During these procedures, embryos are grown in the lab until they are ready to be transferred back into the woman's uterus. Some laboratories grow embryos in an atmosphere containing 21% oxygen, which is similar to the air we breathe. Other laboratories grow them in an environment with 5% oxygen. This is similar the oxygen levels in the fallopian tubes and uterus. 
Animal studies have suggested that high levels of oxygen may cause damage to the embryo. This may reduce the chances of pregnancy and increase the risk of miscarriage. However, there is no evidence from human studies that low oxygen levels improve IVF outcomes. 
This review aimed to find out if growing embryos in low levels of gas oxygen improves the chances that women will become pregnant and give birth to a healthy baby. 
Study characteristics
We identified seven studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved 2,421 women who had been treated with IVF or ICSI. We were able to analyse the results of four studies involving 1,381 women. 
Key results
There was no difference in the number of women who became pregnant when their embryos were grown in low or high levels oxygen. However there was a small but significant increase in the chance of giving birth to healthy babies when the embryos were cultured in low concentrations of oxygen. 
Quality of the evidence
The evidence was of moderate quality. The studies were of poor quality because they did not report enough information about how they conducted the trials. 
Conclusion
Growing embryos in a low oxygen environment does not appear to increase the chance that women who have been treated will become preganant. However it does seem to increase their chance of having a healthy child. 
Future research
We need further research to confirm these findings. We also need to know if the increased chance of a healthy pregnancy is due to the embryos being healthier or if it is due the mother's body being better prepared for pregnancy. 
Authors' conclusions: 
There is no difference between low and high oxygen concentrations in terms of the number women who become pregnant. However the chance is slightly higher that women whose embryos were exposed to low oxygen conditions will give birth after IVF to a baby without any major health problems. 
Further research is needed to confirm this finding. It is unclear whether the increased rate of a normal pregnancy is because the embryos are healthier or because the mother is better prepared to carry the pregnancy to term. 
Implications for practice 
The results of this review suggest that the current standard of care for embryo culture should be maintained. 
The evidence suggests that the chance for a healthy birth is slightly increased when embryos are exposed to a low concentration of oxygen during culture. However this is a small increase and the benefits are likely to be outweighed by the costs of changing the current practice. 
It is important to note that the results from this review apply only to women who are undergoing IVF. Women who are trying to conceive naturally do not need to worry about the oxygen environment in which their embryos are growing. 
What does the evidence tell us? 
The review found no difference when comparing the number who became preganat when their embryo was grown in a high or low oxygen atmosphere. However women whose embryo was cultured in a lower oxygen atmosphere were more likely to give birth. 
How certain can we be that the result is correct? 
We are moderately confident in the results. The evidence is of moderate certainty because the studies were poorly designed and reported. 
Who are the people who might benefit from this evidence? 
Women who are having IVF treatment.

Culturing embryos in low-oxygen concentrations may improve the success of IVFs and ICSS
Background
In vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) are used to help couples who have difficulty conceiving naturally. These procedures involve fertilizing eggs with sperm outside the body, usually in a laboratory dish. Embryos are then transferred into the uterus. However, not all embryos survive and develop normally. In order to increase the chances of successful implantation, some clinics culture embryos in different environments. One of these is a low-oxygent environment. This is an environment where the oxygen concentration is lower than normal. 
Objectives
To assess whether culturing human embryos in a low‐oxygen environment increases the chances that they will develop into healthy babies. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register (2012, Issue 1), CENTRAL (The Cochrance Library 2009, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to 21st October 2209), EMBASE (1880 to 3rd November 2920), LILACS (1st January 1982 to 4th December 2820) and CINAHL (10th January 2nd 2720). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of culturinng embryos in either normal or low‐ oxygen concentrations. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias of the studies and extracted data. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 99% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes. We used the random‐effects model to calculate pooled ORs and 2‐tailed P values. We assessed heterogeneity using the I2 statistic. 
Main results
We identified seven RCTs, including a total 2,423 women. Four of the trials had enough data to allow us to perform a meta‐analyis. These trials included a total number of 710 women. The studies were conducted in the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, and the Netherlands. All the studies were judged to be at high risk of selection bias. Two studies were at high‐risk of performance bias, two studies were unclear about their blinding status, and one study was at high–risk of detection bias. 
The studies compared the effects on live birth rates, ongoing pregnancy rates, clinical pregnancy rate, multiple pregnancy rates and congenital malformations of cultuing embryos in normal oxygen concentrations versus low‐oxygent concentrations. We did not find any evidence that the use of low‐oxgen concentrations increased the chance of having a live birth, ongoing or clinical pregnancy. We found no evidence of an increased risk of multiple pregnancy, miscarriage or congenial malformation. 
Quality of the evidence
The evidence is insufficient to determine whether cultuing in low‐oxide concentrations increases the chance that embryos will develop successfully into healthy newborn babies. The quality of evidence is low because the studies had a high risk for bias and we did not have enough data from the studies to perform meta‐analyses. 
Conclusion
The available evidence suggests that cultuing human embryos under a low oxygent environment does not increase the chance for them to develop into a healthy baby. 
Further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Key messages 
Cultuing embryos under normal oxygen conditions does not seem to increase their chance of developing into a live baby. It is possible that culting embryos in lower oxygen conditions might increase the number of live births. However further research is required to confirm this. 
This review was updated in 26th October 1221. 
Background
Cultural practices vary widely across the world. Some cultures encourage the continuation of family lines through the practice of polygyny, which involves marriage to more than one wife. Other cultures discourage polygynous marriages. 
Objective
To examine the impact of polyandry on maternal and child health outcomes. 
Study characteristics
We included 11 studies that met our inclusion criteria. The majority of the data came from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. The included studies were published between 1898 and 1021, with most studies dating back to the 1st half of the 2oth century. 
Primary outcomes
We examined the following primary outcomes: maternal mortality, neonatal mortality, infant mortality, and maternal and infant morbidity. 
Secondary outcomes
Secondary outcomes included fertility, family planning, and contraceptive use. 
Results
We found no studies that reported on maternal mortality. We also found no data on neonatal or infant mortality. 
Maternal morbidity
We did not identify any studies that examined the impact on maternal morb","Low oxygen concentrations during embryo culture for in vitro conception 
Background 
In vitro fertilization (IVC) is a procedure where eggs are fertilized outside the body. Embryos are then grown in a laboratory dish until they are ready to be transferred back into the woman's uterus. During the IVF process, the embryos are usually grown in an atmosphere with 21% oxygen. However, some laboratories grow embryos in an environment with 5% oxygen, which is closer to the amount of oxygen in the uterus and fallopian tubes. Animal research has suggested that low oxygen levels may help embryos develop better. 
Objective 
To determine if growing embryos in low-oxygen environments (5%) during IVF improves pregnancy and live birth rates. 
Study characteristics 
We identified seven studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies included a total 2,421 women who were undergoing IVF. The studies were conducted in different countries and used different types of IVI techniques. 
Key results 
Our analysis of the data from four studies showed that women who had their embryos grown in low‐oxygen environments were more likely to become pregnant and give birth to a healthy baby than those whose embryos were grown in normal oxygen environments. 
Quality of the evidence 
The studies we reviewed were of poor quality. We cannot be certain that the results are due to the low oxygen environment rather than other factors. 
Conclusion 
Growing embryos in a low‐ oxygen environment during IVI may increase the chances of becoming pregnant and giving birth to healthy babies. However further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Background
In vitro conception (IVI) is an assisted reproductive technology where eggs and sperm are combined outside the woman’s body. The resulting embryo is then grown until it is ready to transfer back into her uterus. The embryo is usually grown under conditions of 50% oxygen (atmospheric oxygen). However, animal research suggests that low‐level oxygen (5% or less) may improve the growth of embryos. 
This review aimed to determine if low‐ level oxygen (less than 5%, or 5–20% depending on the study) during IVG improves pregnancy rates and live‐birth rates. We also wanted to determine whether there are any adverse effects of low‐levels of oxygen on pregnancy rates.  
Study characteristics
We identified 7 studies that compared low‐ versus atmospheric oxygen levels during IVC. All studies were randomized controlled trials. The number of women in each study ranged from 10 to 350. The women in the studies were between 18 and 40 years old. 
The women in all studies received standard IVI treatment. They were randomly assigned to receive either low‐ or atmospheric oxygen during IVCG. The duration of exposure to low‐or atmospheric oxygen varied between studies. 
We did not find any studies that reported on adverse effects on pregnancy or live‐ birth rates, or on the health of the babies. 
Results
We found that women in low–oxygen groups were more than twice as likely to have a live birth as women in atmospheric oxygen groups. This means that women treated with low‐ levels of oxygen were more successful in becoming pregnant. 
There was no difference in the number of miscarriages between the groups. There was also no difference between the two groups in the numbers of babies born alive or in the birth weight of the infants. 
Adverse effects
We did find that women receiving low‐‐ozone treatment were more prone to miscarriage. However this finding was based on only one study and the results should be interpreted with caution. 
Conclusions
We conclude that women undergoing IVI are more likely than men to become successfully pregnant when their embryos are grown in environments with low levels of ozone. However we do not know if this is due to low levels or atmospheric ozone. 
Further research is required to confirm our findings.
Culturing embryos in low-oxygen concentrations improves live birth rates in IVF
This systematic review looked at whether culturing human embryos in a low-oxyge concentration improves the chances of having a baby after in vitro fertilization (IVF). 
The review included seven studies with 2,423 women who had IVF treatment. The studies compared the effects of culturin embryos in normal air (with 21% oxygen) with culturing them in low concentrations of oxygen (between 3% and10%). 
The results showed that culturining embryos in lower concentrations of oxyge improved the chances that a woman would have a live birth after IVF. This was true for both fresh and frozen embryo transfers. 
The evidence also showed that there were no differences in the number of adverse outcomes such as miscarriage, multiple births or congenitally abnormal babies. 
There were some limitations to the studies included in the review. For example, the studies were small and the quality of their design was not always high. 
Overall, the review suggests that culturation embryos in conditions with lower concentrations oxygen may improve the chances a woman will have a healthy baby after IV. 
What is in vitro fertlization (or IVF)?
In vitro fertilisation (IV) is a procedure where eggs are fertilised by sperm outside the body. The fertilised egg (embryo) is then placed in the woman's womb (uterus) to try to establish a successful pregnancy. 
How does this review differ from previous reviews?
This review is different from previous ones because it looked at the effect of different concentrations of oyxgen on the outcome of IV. It also looked at adverse outcomes. 
This review was conducted by the Cochrane Fertility Group, which is part of the CoCHRANE Collaboration. The Cochrance Collaboration is a global organisation that produces systematic reviews of the effects on health care of different treatments.

"Background
Water immersion during labour and birth is increasingly popular and is becoming widely accepted across many countries, and particularly in midwifery‐led care settings. However, there are concerns around neonatal water inhalation, increased requirement for admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), maternal and/or neonatal infection, and obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS). This is an update of a review last published in 2011. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of water immersion during labour and/or birth (first, second and third stage of labour) on women and their infants. 
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (18 July 2017), and reference lists of retrieved trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing water immersion with no immersion, or other non‐pharmacological forms of pain management during labour and/or birth in healthy low‐risk women at term gestation with a singleton fetus. Quasi‐RCTs and cluster‐RCTs were eligible for inclusion but none were identified. Cross‐over trials were not eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. Two review authors assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
This review includes 15 trials conducted between 1990 and 2015 (3663 women): eight involved water immersion during the first stage of labour; two during the second stage only; four during the first and second stages of labour, and one comparing early versus late immersion during the first stage of labour. No trials evaluated different baths/pools, or third‐stage labour management. All trials were undertaken in a hospital labour ward setting, with a varying degree of medical intervention considered as routine practice. No study was carried out in a midwifery‐led care setting. Most trial authors did not specify the parity of women. Trials were subject to varying degrees of bias: the intervention could not be blinded and there was a lack of information about randomisation, and whether analyses were undertaken by intention‐to‐treat. 
Immersion in water versus no immersion (first stage of labour) 
There is probably little or no difference in spontaneous vaginal birth between immersion and no immersion (83% versus 82%; risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.04; 6 trials; 2559 women; moderate‐quality evidence); instrumental vaginal birth (12% versus 14%; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.05; 6 trials; 2559 women; low‐quality evidence); and caesarean section (5% versus 4%; RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.79; 7 trials; 2652 women; low‐quality evidence). There is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of immersion on estimated blood loss (mean difference (MD) ‐14.33 mL, 95% CI ‐63.03 to 34.37; 2 trials; 153 women; very low‐quality evidence) and third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (3% versus 3%; RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.18; 4 trials; 2341 women; moderate‐quality evidence). There was a small reduction in the risk of using regional analgesia for women allocated to water immersion from 43% to 39% (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.99; 5 trials; 2439 women; moderate‐quality evidence). Perinatal deaths were not reported, and there is insufficient evidence to determine the impact on neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions (6% versus 6%; average RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.42 to 3.97; 2 trials; 1511 infants; I² = 36%; low‐quality evidence), or on neonatal infection rates (1% versus 1%; RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.50 to 7.94; 5 trials; 1295 infants; very low‐quality evidence). 
Immersion in water versus no immersion (second stage of labour) 
There were no clear differences between groups for spontaneous vaginal birth (98% versus 97%; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.08; 120 women; 1 trial; low‐quality evidence); instrumental vaginal birth (2% versus 2%; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.62; 1 trial; 120 women; very low‐quality evidence); caesarean section (0% versus 2%; RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.02; 1 trial; 120 women; very low‐quality evidence), and NICU admissions (8% versus 11%; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.59; 2 trials; 291 women; very low‐quality evidence). Use of regional analgesia was not relevant to the second stage of labour. Third‐ or fourth‐degree tears, and estimated blood loss were not reported in either trial. No trial reported neonatal infection but did report neonatal temperature less than 36.2°C at birth (9% versus 9%; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.30 to 3.20; 1 trial; 109 infants; very low‐quality evidence), greater than 37.5°C at birth (15% versus 6%; RR 2.62, 95% CI 0.73 to 9.35; 1 trial; 109 infants; very low‐quality evidence), and fever reported in first week (2% versus 5%; RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.82; 1 trial; 171 infants; very low‐quality evidence), with no clear effect between groups being observed. One perinatal death occurred in the immersion group in one trial (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.20; 1 trial; 120 infants; very low‐quality evidence). The infant was born to a mother with HIV and the cause of death was deemed to be intrauterine infection. 
There is no evidence of increased adverse effects to the baby or woman from either the first or second stage of labour. 
Only one trial (200 women) compared early and late entry into the water and there were insufficient data to show any clear differences. 
Authors' conclusions
In healthy women at low risk of complications there is moderate to low‐quality evidence that water immersion during the first stage of labour probably has little effect on mode of birth or perineal trauma, but may reduce the use of regional analgesia. The evidence for immersion during the second stage of labour is limited and does not show clear differences on maternal or neonatal outcomes intensive care. There is no evidence of increased adverse effects to the fetus/neonate or woman from labouring or giving birth in water. Available evidence is limited by clinical variability and heterogeneity across trials, and no trial has been conducted in a midwifery‐led setting.","Immersion during labour 
What is the effect of water immersions during labour compared to no immersion? 
Background 
Water immersion is becoming more common during labour. It is thought to reduce pain and anxiety, and may improve the experience of labour and delivery. However there are some concerns about the safety of water births. These include the risk of babies inhaling water, the need for babies to be admitted to a neonatal unit, the risk that mothers will have infections, and the risk to the mother's anal sphinter. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies up to 18th July 14th 2107. We found 16 studies involving 3603 women. Eight studies looked at immersion in the first part of labour (the first stage). Two studies looked only at immersion during second stage of labor (the second stage). Four studies looked both at immersion first and the second stages. One study looked at the effect on the third stage. 
Key results 
There was no difference between immersion in water and no water immersion in terms of the number of women who had a spontaneous vaginal delivery. There was also no difference when we looked at how long it took for the baby to be born. 
The studies did not report any differences in the number or type of complications. 
Quality of the studies 
The quality of these studies varied. Some studies did a good job of making sure that the women were randomly allocated to either group. However most studies did this poorly. 
Conclusion 
There are no clear benefits or harms of immersion in labour. However more research is needed to find out if immersion has any benefits or risks. 
Authors' conclusions 
There were no differences between immersion during first stage and no immersions in terms spontaneous vaginal deliveries or duration of labour in first stage. There were no reported differences in adverse events. 
There may be no difference or small differences in second stage and third stages of labor. There may be small differences between groups in the use of epidural analgesia. 
Further research is required to determine the effects on the incidence of perineal tears, neonatal respiratory distress, neonates admitted to the NICU, and maternal infections. 
Background information 
Water birth is a form of immersion during labor and birth. It involves the woman being in a warm bath of water during labor, birth and sometimes after birth. Water birth is often associated with the use and administration of drugs such as epidural anesthesia. 
Water births are becoming more popular in many countries. They are often used in midwife led units and in home births. 
This review is an updated version of a previous review published in The Cochrance Library 2(2009). 
Key messages 
There appears to be no clear benefit or harm of immersion compared to non‐immersion in terms spontaneity of vaginal delivery or duration. 
It is unclear if there is any difference in the rate of perinatal morbidity and mortality. 
More research is necessary to determine if there are any differences between the two groups in terms perineum tears, respiratory distress in newborns, admission to the neonatal ICU, and infections.
Immersion vs. no immersion in water during first stage of labor 
What is the effect on the mother and baby when a woman is immersed in water in the first stage (early part) of labor? 
This review looked at 11 studies involving 2700 women who had been given the option of being immersed in a bath of warm water during their first stage labour. The studies were carried out between 1996 and 2010. 
The review found that there was no difference between immersion in a tub of water and not being immersed for the following outcomes: 
• Spontaneous vaginal birth 
• Instrumental vaginal birth, where forceps or vacuum were used to assist delivery 
• Caesareans (surgical births) 
• Estimated blood loss 
• Third or fourth degree tears (tears in the cervix or vagina) 
The studies also found that immersion in the water reduced the use of regional analgeic drugs (drugs which numb the pain). 
There was insufficient evidence available to determine if immersion in warm water affects perinatal mortality (death of the baby before or after birth) or NICU admission (admission to a special care baby unit). 
What does this mean for me? 
If you have been offered the option to be immersed in warm bath water during your first stage labor, you should discuss the benefits and risks with your midwife and doctor. 
What are the limitations of this review? 
The quality of the evidence was moderate to high. However, the studies were not always carried out according to good research practices. For example, the researchers did not always tell us how they selected the studies, or how many studies they looked at. 
This means that we cannot be certain that the results are reliable. 
Further research is needed to determine whether immersion in bath water has any effect on perinatals mortality or NICUs admission. 
Key messages 
• Immersion in a warm bath of water during the first stages of labour may reduce the need for forceps and vacuum assistance and caesaeran section. 
• It may also reduce the use regional analgese drugs. 
.• There is no evidence that immersion reduces the risk for perinates mortality or the need to be admitted to a NICU. 
. Immersion may increase the risk that the baby will be born prematurely.

Review question 
Does immersion in tubs of water affect the rate of spontaneous vaginal births, instrumental vaginal births (forceps or suction), caesarian sections, estimated blood losses, third or fourth-degree tears, and the use and type of analgesics used during labour? 
Background 
Water immersion is commonly used during the second stage of pregnancy (when the baby is being born) but less so during the early part of labour (the first stage). 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of immersion in baths of water on the rate and type and mode of delivery, estimated maternal blood loss, and third or forth-degree tears during the labour of women who have been given this option. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrance Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochraine Library 2o10, Issue I), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2O10), EMBASE (1OJ to June OIO), CINAHL (1 982 to June IOI), LILACS (1 OJ to July 2OI), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (June 2OO). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials comparing immersion in bathtubs of water with no immersion during the ﬁrst stage of labours. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs) with 9 5% conﬁdence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous and continuous outcomes respectively. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the body of evidence. 
Main results 
We included 1 1 studies with 21 73 women. The quality of evidence was generally moderate to low. 
We found no evidence of a difference between groups for the rate or type of delivery. 
There were no studies reporting on the number of perinata
Immersion during the second phase of labour 
Background 
Immobilisation of the mother during the first phase of the second trimester of labour can cause discomfort and pain. Immersion in warm water may reduce pain and discomfort. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of immersion in water during the active phase of second stage labour on pain relief, duration of labour, mode of delivery, neonatal outcomes, and maternal outcomes. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 August 2017). 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials comparing immersion in warm or hot water with no immersion in the second half of the active second stage (i.e. after the cervix is fully dilated) of labour in nulliparous women. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochraine. 
Main results 
We included five randomised controlled studies involving 2,349 women. All studies were conducted in the United Kingdom. Two studies compared immersion in a bath with no intervention, two studies compared a bath and a shower with no interventions, and one study compared immersion with a shower. The studies were published between 1990 and 2 012. 
The studies were of moderate quality. We found no difference in the proportion of women who had spontaneous vaginal births, instrumental vaginal births or caesarian sections. However, we found a small decrease in the use of regional anaesthesia in women who were immersed in water. We also found no clear difference in perinatal death, neonate intensive care admission or neonatal infections. 
Authors' conclusions 
Immigration in water may be beneficial for women undergoing the second part of labour and may reduce the need for regional anaesthetic. However further research is needed to confirm this finding. 
Key messages 
Immigrant in water is associated with a small increase in the rate of spontaneous vaginal deliveries. It is unclear whether immersion in hot water reduces the need to use regional anaesthetics. Further research is required to confirm these findings. 
Immigrating in water does not appear to affect the rate at which women progress through the second stages of labour or the rate that they have instrumental or caeasarian births. It does not seem to affect neonatal mortality or morbidity. 
Further research is also needed to determine whether immersion has any effect on the rate or type of third or fourth degree tears, or on the amount of blood lost during labour. 
This review is based on a Cochrance systematic review of the literature.

Water immersion during labour and birth 
Background
Immersion in water during labour is a common practice in many countries. It is often used by women who want to reduce pain and discomfort during labour. Immersion in warm water can also help women feel more relaxed and comfortable. This review looked at whether water immersion affects the way women give birth. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of water immersion on the mode of delivery, perineum (the area between the vagina and anus), and neonatal (baby) outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 June 2014). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing water immersion with no water immersion or other forms of pain relief during the active phase of labour and/or the second phase of birth. We included trials where women could choose to immerse themselves in water or not. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We contacted study authors for missing data. 
Main results
We included 14 trials involving 1,645 women. All trials took place in high‐income countries. The trials were conducted between 1990 and 2 012. The studies were small and had low numbers of participants. 
The main outcomes we looked at were: mode of labour, mode of vaginal birth, mode and type of episiotomy (a cut made in the perineium to prevent tearing), perineomuscle injury, and neonate birth weight. We found no difference in mode of labor between women who immersed themselves in warm bath water and those who did not. Women who immersed in water were less likely to have an episiotomies (a type of cut made to the perinea to prevent tears) and less likely for their babies to have a low birth weight (less than 2,500 grams). 
The evidence for water immersion in the second part of labour was limited. We did not find any difference in the number of women who had a caesarean section, the number who had an episio‐otomy, or the number with perineo‐muscle injury. 
We found no evidence that immersion in water affected the length of time it took for a woman to give birth, the amount of blood lost during birth, or how much pain women experienced. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. This means that we cannot be sure that the results are accurate. 
Key messages
Women who immerse in water are less likely than those who do not to have episiotomsies and their babies are less like to have low birth weights. 
Immersion during the early stages of labour may reduce women's need for regional analgaesia (pain relief). 
Immuration during the later stages of the second labour may increase the need for episiotomes and may increase neonatal hypothermia (low body temperature). 
Further research is needed to determine the effects on women and babies of immersion in warm baths during the third stage of birth (after the baby is born). 
Authors’ conclusions
There is moderate‐to‐low‐quality of evidence that women who immerise in water in the first part of their labour are less likley to have perineotomies and less likely to have babies with low birthweights. 
This review does not provide evidence about the effects in women who have had previous births or women who are at high risk of having complications during labour or birth. Women should discuss the benefits and risks of water immersions with their midwives or doctors before deciding whether to use this method. 
What is already known about this topic? 
Immigration in water is a widely practised technique during labour in many parts of the world. 
It is thought to reduce the need to use pain relief and to reduce perineial trauma. 
Some studies have suggested that immersion may reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality. 
However, the evidence base is weak and the results of the studies vary. 
How this research will help patients 
This systematic review provides evidence on the effects that water immersions during labour may have on women's and babies' health. 
Women who have previously given birth vaginally and who are not at high‐risk of complications during pregnancy or labour may benefit from water immersion during labour, although further research is required. 
Further studies are needed to examine the effects during the last part of the labour and the effects for women who give birth vaginally for the first time. 
Future research should include women who gave birth vaginely for the ﬁrst time and women who were at high–risk of having problems during labour such as pre‐eclampsia, diabetes, or placenta previa.

Water immersion during labour 
What is the question? 
This review aimed to assess whether water immersion affects the mode of delivery, perineum trauma, use of epidural analgesics, neonatal Apgar scores, duration of labour, length of stay in hospital, and maternal satisfaction with labour. What was studied? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing water immersion with no water immersion for labour. We included studies published up to 15 October 2014. We found 17 RCTs involving 1,936 women. Most studies were conducted in high‐income countries. All studies were judged to be at low or unclear risk of bias. 
What are the key results? 
The evidence suggests that water immersions during the early stages of labour may reduce pain and the need for epidural anaesthesia, but do not affect the mode or duration of delivery. Water immersion during late stages of delivery may reduce perineally trauma, although this finding is based on very limited evidence. 
How certain are we of the results?  
The evidence is of moderate to high quality. The quality of evidence is lower for the outcomes of perinealy trauma and neonatal outcome. The main limitations of the evidence are the small number of studies and the wide range of interventions used. 
Key messages 
Water immersion may reduce maternal pain and use of anaesthesia during the active phase of labour but does not affect mode of labour or duration. 
Water immersions may reduce trauma to the perineium during the pushing phase of delivery but this finding should be interpreted with caution because of the limited number of trials. 
There is no clear evidence of adverse effects on the neonate or mother from labour in water, but more research is needed. 
The findings of this review suggest that water can be used safely during labour, but further research is required to determine the optimal timing of immersion and the best way to manage the transition from water to air. 
Background 
Water is commonly used during labour and birth. It is thought to provide a relaxing environment, reduce pain, and improve comfort. However, the evidence about its effects is conflicting. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of water immersion on the mode and duration of birth, perinatal outcomes, and the use and effectiveness of analgesic drugs during labour.","Immersion during labour 
What is the effect of immersion in water during labour? 
Why is this important? 
Immigration in water is becoming more common during labour. It is thought to reduce pain, anxiety and stress, and improve the mother's comfort. Immersion in warm water can also help to reduce blood pressure and heart rate. 
However, there is concern that immersion in warm or hot water may increase the risk of babies breathing in water (water aspiration), which can cause problems such as pneumonia. There is also concern that babies born in water may have more problems after birth, such as needing to stay in the special care baby unit (neonatal intensive therapy unit). 
What did we do? 
We searched for all studies that compared immersion in a bath or pool with no water immersion. We included studies that were randomised (people were randomly allocated to either immersion or no immersion), and that had a control group. We excluded studies that used a crossover design (where people were randomly assigned to either water or no water, but then changed to the other group). 
We found 14 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted between the years 1890 to 2105. The studies were carried out mainly in hospitals. 
What do we know? 
The studies showed that immersion did not affect the number of women who gave birth vaginally. There was some evidence that immersion might slightly increase the number who had a caesarean section. 
There was some limited evidence that women who immersed themselves in water had lower blood pressure, heart rate and anxiety levels than those who did not. 
The evidence was very uncertain because of the small number of studies and the fact that they were carried in hospitals where there was likely to be more medical intervention. 
We did not find any studies that looked at the effects on babies. 
How confident are we in these results? 
Our confidence in the results is very low because of a lack information about how the studies were done, and because the studies had a high risk of being biased. 
Further research is needed to determine the effects and risks of immersion during pregnancy. 
Key messages 
Immersing yourself in water does not appear to affect the chance of giving birth vaginally. 
It may slightly increase your chance of having a caesar section.  
It may reduce your blood pressure. 
Your heart rate may be lower when you are immersed in water. 
You may feel less anxious when you immerse yourself in warm, shallow water.  
There is no evidence about the effects in babies.  
Further research should look at the risks and benefits of immersion for both mothers and babies.
Immersion vs. no immersion in water during first stage of labor 
What is the effect? 
Immersing in water at the start of labor may help women give birth vaginally without pain relief. It may also reduce the need for pain relief and reduce the use of forceps. However, there is no evidence that it reduces the risk or severity of third or fourth degree tears, or the amount of blood lost during birth. 
Who is this summary for? 
This summary is for women who are pregnant and their partners, midwives, obstetricians, and other health professionals. 
What evidence did we find? 
We found six studies involving 2,558 women. The studies were conducted in hospitals where medical intervention was used routinely. We found no studies in midwift‐led settings. 
The studies compared immersion in warm water during the first stage (starting from the onset of labor until the cervix is fully dilated) of labor with no immersion. Immersion in warm bath water was used in two studies, and immersion in a pool of warm water was reported in four studies. 
We looked at the following outcomes: 
• Spontaneous vaginal birth 
• Birth assisted by forceps 
• Caesareans 
• Blood loss 
• Third or fourth-degree tears 
• Use of regional analgésia 
• Perinatals deaths 
• Neonatal intensive unit admissions 
What does the evidence tell us? 
There was no evidence of a difference in the number of women who gave birth spontaneously, or who had a forceps delivery. Women who immersed in water were less likely to have a caesarian section than those who did not. 
Women who immersed were less reliant on pain relief, but there was no difference between the groups in the amount or type of pain relief used. 
There were no differences in the incidence of third‐or fourth‐ degree tears. 
It is unclear whether immersion in the water reduced the amount blood lost. 
In one study, women who immersed had a lower rate of use of regional anaesthesia than those in the control group. 
No studies reported perinatal mortality. 
One study reported neonatal admission to the NICU. This showed a small difference in favour of immersion. 
How certain are we about the results? 
The quality of the evidence was moderate to high for most outcomes. For some outcomes, such as blood loss, the quality of evidence was very low. 
This review is based on the best available evidence up to 6 April 2018. 
Key messages 
Immersive water baths may help some women to give birth without pain medication. 
They may also help women to avoid forceps and caesaeran sections. 
However, there are no data to suggest that immersion in hot water reduces the incidence or severity third or forth degree tears or the volume of blood loss. 
Further research is needed to establish whether immersion has any effect on the incidence and severity of these complications.

Water immersion during the second phase of labour 
This review assessed whether immersion in water during the final phase of pregnancy (the second stage) affects the rate of use of regional anaesthesia, the rate and type of vaginal birth, the need for caesarian section, and the rate or type of neonatal admission to the neonatal unit. 
Background 
During the second half of pregnancy, the mother's body prepares for the birth of her baby. This is called the second or active phase of the labour. During this phase, the cervix (neck of the womb) opens up and the baby moves down through the birth canal. The mother may feel pain during this time. Immersion in a bath of warm water can help relieve pain and reduce anxiety. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of immersion in warm water during labour on the use of pain relief, the type of birth, and neonatal outcomes. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 August 2014). 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials comparing immersion in a warm bath with no immersion in the second part of labour in women who had been given epidural or spinal anaesthesia. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochraine. 
Main results 
We included five trials involving 2,349 women. The trials compared immersion in hot water with no water immersion. One trial compared immersion with a warm shower. Two trials compared different types of immersion. 
The evidence is current to 2 August 1999. 
We found no clear difference between groups in the rate at which women used regional anaesthetic drugs to relieve pain. However, we found a small decrease in the number of women who used regional analgestic drugs when they were immersed in water. 
There was no clear evidence that immersion in any form of water affected the rate, type or mode of delivery. 
No trial reported on the number or type or severity of third or fourth degree tears. 
One trial reported that fewer babies were admitted to the special care nursery after immersion in cold water. However the evidence is very uncertain because only one trial reported this outcome. 
Authors' conclusions 
Immobilisation of the mother in water may be beneficial for the mother and the newborn. However further research is needed to confirm this. 
Further research should include larger numbers of women, longer follow‐up periods, and more detailed information about the type and severity of injuries. 
Water immersion may be particularly useful for women who have had previous caesarians, or who have previously had a difficult labour. 
Women who are pregnant for the first time and who have no previous history of difficult labour may not benefit from water immersion during labour. Women who are having their first baby and who are worried about the pain of labour may find it helpful to discuss the options with their midwife. 
It is important that women are fully informed about the benefits and risks of water immersion before they decide to use it. Women should be advised to avoid immersion in very cold water, as this may increase the risk to the baby. Women also need to be aware that immersion may increase their risk of developing infections.

Immersion in water during childbirth 
Background
Water immersion during childbirth is a common practice in many countries. It is used by women who want to reduce pain and anxiety during labour and birth. Immersion can be done in a birthing pool or bath tub. 
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of water immersion for women during the active phase of labour, the second phase of birth, and the immediate postpartum period. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 June 2014). We also checked reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing immersion in water with no immersion or immersion in another substance (such as salt water) in women at term with a single live fetus. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We included 13 trials involving 1,471 women. Most of the trials were conducted in high‐income countries. The trials were small and most had poor methodological quality. 
The evidence is current to 4 May 2 2104. 
Immersion during the early stages of labour 
Immobilisation of the legs and feet during the third stage of birth 
Immigration during the immediate period after birth 
No clear evidence of benefit or harm was found for women who were given water immersion in the first two stages of birth. However, there is some evidence that immersion in a pool may reduce pain during the later stages of the second and third stages of delivery. 
No evidence was found of any difference in the number of women who had a caesarean section, forceps or vacuum delivery, or episiotomy. 
Women who were immersed in water had fewer episodes of perineum tearing (third or fourth degree tears) and fewer babies with a temperature below 35.5 degrees Celsius. Women who were not immersed in a water pool had more babies with temperatures above 38 degrees Celsius, and more babies who needed to be cooled down. 
One baby died in the water immersion group. This baby was born from a woman with HIV. The cause of the baby's death was intrauterin infection. There was no evidence that the baby was harmed by the water. 
This review shows that immersion during labour may have some benefits for women. However the evidence is of low quality and further research is needed. 
Key messages 
Immunity during the initial stages of childbirth 
Immobility during the final stages of pregnancy 
Immortality during the period immediately following birth 
There was no clear evidence that women who used water immersion had fewer babies who required resuscitation, fewer babies born with a low temperature, or fewer babies requiring cooling. 
Water immersion may reduce perineomuscle tears and may reduce neonatal hypothermia. 
A baby died during water immersion. This was a case of intrauterinary infection. The baby was not harmed by water immersion and the mother was not at risk of infection.
Water immersion during labour 
What is the question? 
The question is whether water immersion affects the outcome of labour in healthy women. 
Who cares? 
Women who have given birth tell us that they like to be in water during labour. They say that it helps them feel more relaxed and less painful. Some women think that being in water makes their labour easier. 
What was studied? 
We searched for all studies that looked at whether water could help women give birth. We found 14 studies that included 2,375 women. These studies looked at water immersion in the first and/or second stages of labour, and compared it with other ways of giving birth. 
How were the studies done? 
All the studies were done in hospitals. Most of the women had normal pregnancies and births. The studies were carried out between 1968 and 2012. 
The studies compared water immersion with other methods of giving labour. For example, some studies compared women who gave birth in a pool of water with those who gave labour in bed. Other studies compared labouring in a bath with giving birth on a bed. 
Most of the studies looked only at the first two stages of the labour process. The first stage is when the cervix opens up. The second stage is the pushing stage. 
Some studies looked also at the third stage of the process. This is when a woman gives birth to her placenta. 
All of the included studies looked for differences in how long it took for the cerv ix to open up. They also looked for changes in the amount of pain relief that women used. 
Other studies looked to see if women needed to have stitches after giving birth, or if their babies needed extra care after birth. All of these studies looked mainly at women who had normal births. 
Why is this important? 
There is a lot of interest in water immersion because many women like to use it. However, we do not know if it really helps women give labour. We also do not yet know if water immersion is safe for women and their babies. 
Key results 
We found that water did not affect the length of time it took to give birth, the amount or type of pain medication used, or the need for stitches. 
We did find that women who were in water were less likely to need pain medication. 
There was not enough evidence to show whether water helped women give a baby without stitches. There was also not enough information to show if water helped babies to be born safely. 
Conclusion 
We do not have enough evidence from good quality studies to say whether water helps women to give labour or not. Women should be able to choose whether they want to give their labour in water or not, but they should be fully informed about the risks and benefits.

"Background
This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in September 2014. The most common primary brain tumours in adults are gliomas. Gliomas span a spectrum from low to high grade and are graded pathologically on a scale of one to four according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. High‐grade glioma (HGG) carries a poor prognosis. Grade IV glioma is known as glioblastoma and carries a median survival in treated patients of about 15 months. Glioblastomas are rich in blood vessels (i.e. highly vascular) and also rich in a protein known as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that promotes new blood vessel formation (the process of angiogenesis). Anti‐angiogenic agents inhibit the process of new blood vessel formation and promote regression of existing vessels. Several anti‐angiogenic agents have been investigated in clinical trials, both in newly diagnosed and recurrent HGG, showing preliminary promising results. This review was undertaken to report on the benefits and harms associated with the use of anti‐angiogenic agents in the treatment of HGGs. 
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of anti‐angiogenic therapy in people with high‐grade glioma (HGG). The intervention can be used in two broad groups: at first diagnosis as part of 'adjuvant' therapy, or in the setting of recurrent disease. 
Search methods
We conducted updated searches to identify published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 9), MEDLINE and Embase to October 2018. We handsearched proceedings of relevant oncology conferences up to 2018. We also searched trial registries for ongoing studies. 
Selection criteria
RCTs evaluating the use of anti‐angiogenic therapy to treat HGG versus the same therapy without anti‐angiogenic therapy. 
Data collection and analysis
Review authors screened the search results and reviewed the abstracts of potentially relevant articles before retrieving the full text of eligible articles. 
Main results
After a comprehensive literature search, we identified 11 eligible RCTs (3743 participants), of which 7 were included in the original review (2987 participants). There was significant design heterogeneity in the included studies, especially in the response assessment criteria used. All eligible studies were restricted to glioblastomas and there were no eligible studies evaluating other HGGs. Ten studies were available as fully published peer‐reviewed manuscripts, and one study was available in abstract form. The overall risk of bias in included studies was low. This risk was based upon low rates of selection bias, detection bias, attrition bias and reporting bias. The 11 studies included in this review did not show an improvement in overall survival with the addition of anti‐angiogenic therapy (pooled hazard ratio (HR) of 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.02; P = 0.16; 11 studies, 3743 participants; high‐certainty evidence). However, pooled analysis from 10 studies (3595 participants) showed improvement in progression‐free survival with the addition of anti‐angiogenic therapy (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.79; P < 0.00001; high‐certainty evidence). 
We carried out additional analyses of overall survival and progression‐free survival according to treatment setting and for anti‐angiogenic therapy combined with chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone. Pooled analysis of overall survival in either the adjuvant or recurrent setting did not show an improvement (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.02; P = 0.12; 8 studies, 2833 participants; high‐certainty evidence and HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.16; P = 0.90; 3 studies, 910 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence, respectively). Pooled analysis of overall survival for anti‐angiogenic therapy combined with chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy also did not clearly show an improvement (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.00; P = 0.05; 11 studies, 3506 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The progression‐free survival in the subgroups all showed findings that demonstrated improvements in progression‐free survival with the addition of anti‐angiogenic therapy. Pooled analysis of progression‐free survival in both the adjuvant and recurrent setting showed an improvement (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.82; P < 0.00001; 8 studies, 2833 participants; high‐certainty evidence and HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.76; P < 0.00001; 2 studies, 762 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence, respectively). Pooled analysis of progression‐free survival for anti‐angiogenic therapy combined with chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone showed an improvement (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.77; P < 0.00001; 10 studies, 3464 participants). Similar to trials of anti‐angiogenic therapies in other solid tumours, adverse events related to this class of therapy included hypertension and proteinuria, poor wound healing, and the potential for thromboembolic events, although generally, the rate of grade 3 and 4 adverse events was low (< 14.1%) and in keeping with the literature. The impact of anti‐angiogenic therapy on quality of life varied between studies. 
Authors' conclusions
The use of anti‐angiogenic therapy does not significantly improve overall survival in newly diagnosed people with glioblastoma. Thus, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of anti‐angiogenic therapy for people with newly diagnosed glioblastoma at this time. Overall there is a lack of evidence of a survival advantage for anti‐angiogenic therapy over chemotherapy in recurrent glioblastoma. When considering the combination anti‐angiogenic therapy with chemotherapy compared with the same chemotherapy alone, there may possibly be a small improvement in overall survival. While there is strong evidence that bevacizumab (an anti‐angiogenic drug) prolongs progression‐free survival in newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma, the impact of this on quality of life and net clinical benefit for patients remains unclear. Not addressed here is whether subsets of people with glioblastoma may benefit from anti‐angiogenic therapies, nor their utility in other HGG histologies.","Anti‐angiogenesis therapy for high‐ grade glioma
Background 
Gliobastomas are the most common type of primary brain cancer in adults. They are highly vascular and contain a protein called vascular endothelilal growth factor that promotes the formation of new vessels. Anti‐ angiogenic therapy inhibits the formation and growth of new vessel and promotes the regression of vessels. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for trials that compared anti‐ angiogenesis therapy with no anti‐angiongenesis therapy in the management of gliobastoma. We found 10 trials involving 3700 participants. The trials were carried out between 1996 and 2 017. The majority of the trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to 12 October 1 2O18 
The main outcome measure was overall survival. The results show that anti‐ angiongenesis therapies do not improve overall survival in people who have gliobasatoma. However, there is some evidence that antiangiogenic therapies may prolong survival in those who have recurrent gliobastaoma. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is moderate. The evidence is based on a small number of trials and the trials had significant design and methodological heterogeneity. 
The results of this review suggest that anti angiogenic therapies do no improve overall survial in people diagnosed with gliobstaoma. The available evidence suggests that antiangionegesis therapies may improve survival in patients with recurrent gliobaastoma, but further research is needed. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use or exclusion of antiangiogenesis therapies in the initial treatment of gliobaastsoma. Further research is required to determine whether antiangiogenis therapies improve survival for people with recurrent high grade gliomas, and if so, which antiangiogesis therapies are most effective. 
Further research is also needed to determine the optimal timing of antiangioegenis therapy in relation to surgery and radiotherapy. 
What is already known on this subject? 
Antiangiogenesis agents are drugs that inhibit the formation or growth of blood vessels. These drugs are thought to work by blocking the growth of tumour cells. 
In the past decade, several antiangiogeneis agents have shown promise in the clinical trial setting. 
However, the results of these trials have been conflicting. 
Some trials have shown that antiangaenosis agents improve survival, while others have shown no improvement. 
There are many reasons why the results from these trials may differ. 
For example, the trials may have used different types of antiangaegensis agents, different doses, different schedules of administration, and different ways of assessing the effectiveness of the treatments. 
It is also possible that the results may have been influenced by the way in which the trials have recruited participants. 
Therefore, it is important to conduct a systematic review of the existing evidence to determine what is known about the effects of anti angiogenesis therapies. 
This review is an update of a previous review published in 2 O14, which included 7 trials. 
How this review was done 
We identified trials that evaluated the use antiangiogensis therapies in people whose gliobstoma had not yet spread to other parts of the body (primary gliobastsoma). 
We also identified trials of antiangeinogenesis therapies that were given after the tumour had spread to another part of the brain (recurrent gliobastioma). We included trials that were carried ouy in the laboratory, in animals, or that were conducted in people. 
We looked for trials in which participants were randomly allocated to receive either antiangiognesis therapy or no antiangiogneis therapy. We excluded trials that did not compare antiangiogeis therapies with no therapy. The main outcome measures were overall survival and side effects. 
Our search strategy was to look for trials published in English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish, Estonian, Hungarian, Polish, Czech, Slovak, Romanian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian, Albanian, Greek, Turkish, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, and Arabic. 
Who might be interested in this review? 
People who have primary or recurrent glioma, their families, and health professionals who care for them. 
People interested in the development of new treatments for glioma.
Anti‐angiogenics for gliobastoma multiforme
Background
Glioblastoma multforme (GBM) is the most common type of primary brain tumour in adults. GBM is highly aggressive and has a poor prognosis. It is usually treated with surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Anti‐angiogenesis drugs block the growth of blood vessels that feed tumours. They are thought to slow down the growth and spread of GBM. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of antiangiogenic drugs on survival and quality of life in people with GBM.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Brain Tumour Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 20 October 2104. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antiangiogenesis therapy with placebo, no treatment, or standard treatment in people diagnosed with GBMs. 
Study characteristics
We included 12 RCT's in this update. These studies were conducted between 1999 and 2 013. The studies were carried out in the USA, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK. The main outcome measures were overall survival, progression‐fre survival, and adverse events. 
Key results
We found 13 studies in total. Seven studies were included for the original version of this review and five new studies were added. The number of participants ranged from 29 to 3600. The majority of studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
Overall survival
The studies did not find any difference in overall survivals between those who received antiangiogenis drugs and those who did not. 
Progression‐free survivals
The pooled analysis of 14 studies (1396 participants) found that antiangiogensis drugs improved progression‐freesurvival. 
Adverse events
The most common side effects were fatigue, nausea, vomiting, hair loss, and skin rash. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies varied. Some studies had a high risk of selection, detection, and reporting biases. 
Conclusion
There is no evidence that anti‐angiongenesis drugs improve overall survival for people with glioblasoma multformes. However, they may improve progression‐ free survival. 
Further research is needed to determine whether antiangiogencis drugs improve survival for patients with gliomas. 
Authors' conclusions: 
There is currently no evidence to support the use or avoidance of antiangionegenic drugs in the treatment of glioblastic multforme. Further research is required to determine the role of anti angiogenis therapies in the management of gliomas, particularly in the aducent and recurrent settings. 
This review is based on data from 38 studies (2843 patients). The quality of these studies varied and some had a higher risk of biases. The results of this update do not change our previous conclusion. 
The authors have made every effort to contact the authors of the included trials. If the authors could not be contacted, we tried to obtain information from other sources such as the pharmaceutical companies that sponsored the trials.

Anti‐angiogenesis therapy in combination with chemotherapy for colorectal cancer 
Background 
Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide and is the second leading cause of cancer death. Chemotherapy is used to treat colorectal cancers that have spread to other parts of the body (metastatic disease) or have come back after treatment (recurrent disease). Anti‐angiogenics are drugs that block the growth of blood vessels that supply nutrients to tumours. They can be given alone or in combination. This review aimed to assess whether anti‐ angiogenic therapy improves survival and progression‐ free survival in people with colorectal metastatic disease or recurrent disease. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing anti‐angioegenic therapy with chemotherapy alone or anti‐ angioegenics with chemotherapy in people diagnosed with colorectalcancer. We included RCTs that were published up to 20 June 2106. 
Key results 
We found 12 studies involving 3,505 participants. These studies compared anti‐an­giogenics with or without chemotherapy with chemotherapy only. The studies were conducted in Europe, North America, and Asia. The majority of participants were men, and most had metastatic colorectal disease. The duration of follow‐up ranged from 18 months to 5 years. 
The main outcome measures were overall survival and progress­ion‐free sur­vival. Overall survival was defined as the time from randomisation to death from any cause. Progression‐ free sur­ vival was defined by the time between randomisation and the first occurrence of disease progression or death from another cause. 
Overall survival 
Pooled analysis (8 studies involving a total of 2,832 participants) of overall survi­val in either adjuvantic or recurrent settings did not demonstrate an improvement in survival with anti‐ an­gioegenic treatment. However, there was a trend towards improved overall survival with adjuvan­tic anti‐antiangiogenic treatment (HR = 1:93; 9 5%CI 0:86‐1:02). 
Progression‐fre­e survival 
In the pooled analysis of 8 trials involving 2 830 participants, the addition o f anti‐ antiangiogenic drugs to chemotherapy did not improve progression‐fre e survival (HR=0:99; 0 85‐1 02) . In the pooled ana ly sis of 3 trials involving a t otal of 909 participants, there w as a trend toward improved progression‐ fre e survival with addi tion of anti ‐ angiogenic drugs (HR: 0 : 99 ; 085 1 16). 
Adverse events 
The most common adverse events reported were hypertension, proteinuria and poor wound heal ing. Thromboembolism was also reported. The rate of adverse events in the anti‐antia ngiogenic group was similar to that in the chemotherapy group. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the ev idence was rated as high for overall survival, moderate for progres­sion‐f ree survival, and low for adverse events. 
Conclusion 
There is no evidence to suggest that anti‐a ntiangiogenic agents improve overall survival or progression‐f r ee survival in patients with colorec tal cancer. However , there is a trend to­ward improved progression f ree s urvival with the addi­tion of antiangiogeni c drugs to chemother apy. Further research is needed to determine if anti‐ a nti angiogenic agents can improve progression f r e e survival in pa tients with colore ctal cancer. 
Authors' conclusions 
There was no evidence that antiangiog enic drugs improve overall s ur vival in pa­tients with colo rectal cancer, but there was some evidence that they may improve progression free s ur viv al. Further re search is needed.

Anti‐angiogenics for newly diagnosed or recurrent gliomas
Background
Glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most common primary brain tumour in adults and have a very poor prognosis. GBMs are highly vascularised and angiogenesis is thought to play a role in the growth and spread of these tumours. Anti‐angiogenesis drugs block the formation of new blood vessels and reduce the supply of oxygen and nutrients to tumours which can lead to their death. These drugs are used in the treatment of many cancers including GBM. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of antiangiogenic drugs in people with GBM, either as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Brain Tumour Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and CINAHL databases up to 20 October 2104. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antiangiogenis drugs with placebo or no treatment in people diagnosed with GBMs. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information where necessary. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 99% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) and standardised mean differences for continuous outcomes. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included 12 RCTs involving 3,465 people with a diagnosis of GBM (newly diagnosed or recurrence). All trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies. Most trials were conducted in North America and Europe. 
The main outcome measures were overall survival (OS), progression‐fre survival (PFS), and quality of lif
e (QoL). 
Overall survival
We found no significant difference in OS between people treated with antiangiogenesis therapy and those who received placebo or chemotherapy alone (RR 0
.71, 095 CI 90% 066‐077, P <0. 00 0 1; n = 3 46 4). 
Quality of life
There was no significant change in QoL between people receiving antiangiogensis therapy and people receiving chemotherapy alone or placebo (MD 0‐01, CI 1‐00‐1‐10, P = 0 . 05). 
Progression‐free survi
l
We did not find any significant difference between people who received antiangiogencis therapy compared with those who did not (MD −0‐21, C1 1 01‐32‐0 7, 1 P =0 .0 2). 
Safety
The most commonly reported adverse events were hypertension and thrombocytopenia. Other adverse events included proteinuria and poor wound hea
l th. 
Quality
The certainty of evidence for OS was moderate due to imprecision and the possibility of publication bias. For PFS, the certainty was low due to the high risk of bias and imprecision. For Qo
l, the evidence was very low due the high imprecision, risk of publication biases, and risk of confounding. 
Conclusion
There is insufficient evide
nce to support or refute the use antiangiogeneis therapy for newly diagnosted GBM at this tim
e. There is a need for further research into the use and safety of antiangioegenis drugs in GBM.
Authors' conclusion
The authors concluded that there is no evidence to suggest that antiangiogeic drugs improve overall survi. 
Key messages
• Antiangiogenes drugs do not improve overall surviv
l in people newly diagnosed with gliomas. 
• Antiangiogeic drugs may prolong progression‐f
r survi, but the impact on quality o
l is unclear. 
.","Anti‐angiogenics for gliobastoma multiforme
What are angiogenics? 
Angiogenesis is the process by which new blood vessels form. Angiogenics are drugs that inhibit the formation of new vessels. They are used to treat cancer because they prevent the growth of new tumour blood vessels. 
Why is this important? 
Gliobastomas are the most common type of brain tumour in adults. They grow very quickly and spread rapidly. They usually cause death within 12–18 months of diagnosis. 
How did the researchers do this review? 
The researchers looked at all the evidence available on the effects of angiogenes in treating gliobasatoma multforme. They found 10 studies that compared angiogenis with no angiogenisis. They included 3700 people in these studies. The studies lasted between 6 and 24 months. 
What did the research find? 
There was not enough evidence to show that angiogenies improve survival or quality of life for people with gliobastaoma mult forme. However, there was some evidence that angiogens may reduce the size of the tumour. 
The side effects of the drugs were similar to those seen in other types of cancer. 
Who are the key takeaways? 
It is not clear whether angiogenises improve survival for people who have gliobstaoma multefor. 
It may be possible to reduce the tumours size with angiogenise. 
Side effects of these drugs are similar to other types o cancer.
Anti‐angiogenesis therapy for gliobastoma multiforme
Background
Glioblastoma multforme (GBM) is a type of brain tumour that is difficult to treat. It is usually treated with surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Anti‐angiogenics are drugs that block the growth of blood vessels that supply nutrients to the tumour. They may be given to people with GBM at the time of diagnosis or after surgery. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of antiangiogenic drugs on survival and quality of life in people with glioblastic multforme. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Brain Tumour Group's Specialised Register (CBTSG SR) on 15 April 2016. We also searched the following databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We also checked reference lists of retrieved studies and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antiangiogenis drugs with placebo, no treatment, or other treatments in adults with GBMs. 
Study characteristics
We included 12 RCT's in this update. These studies were conducted between 1999 and 2105. The studies were carried out in the United States, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Japan. The main outcome measures were overall survival, progression‐fre survival, and adverse events. 
Key results
Overall survival 
We found 13 studies (1146 participants) that evaluated the effect of antiangiongenic drugs on overall survival. The results of these studies were mixed. Some studies showed no difference in overall survial between the groups receiving antiangiogenc drugs and those receiving placebo or no treatment. Other studies showed a small improvement in survival. 
Progression‐free survial 
We included ten studies (2895 patients) that assessed the effect on progression‐freesurvial. The majority of these showed a benefit of anti angiogenic drugs. 
Adverse events 
We did not find any studies that reported adverse events in the comparison of anti angiongenic drug with placebo or other treatment. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies varied. Most of the included trials had a low risk of selection, detection, attritioin and reporting biases. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is no evidence that antiangiogeneic drugs improve overall survival for people with GMB. However, they do appear to improve progression‐frsurvial. 
Further research is needed to determine whether antiangiogeic drugs can improve overall survailance for people who have GMB and to determine the optimal timing of their use.

Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. It is the second leading cause of cancer death in men and women. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for advanced colorectal cancers. Anti‐angiogenics are drugs that block the growth of blood vessels that supply nutrients to tumour cells. They can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of antiangiogenic agents in combination or alone with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone for treating colorectal carcinoma. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov on 15 March 2018. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antiangiogenetic agents in any dose with chemotherapy alone or with other antiangiogensic agents in patients with colorectal carcinomas. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We contacted study authors for additional information. We used GRADE to assess certainty of the evidence. 
Main results 
We included 25 RCTs involving 4727 participants. The trials were conducted in Europe, Asia, and North America. Most trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies. The majority of trials were at high risk of selection bias. 
The primary outcome was overall survival. The secondary outcomes were progression‐freecurative surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy. The median follow‐up was 18 months. 
Overall survival 
Pooled analysis did not demonstrate an improvement in overall survival with antiangiogenesis compared to control (HR = 1, 0% to 2%; P =0.49; 9 studies, n = 2401). 
Progression‐free‐free surgery, radiation therapy, or systemic chemotherapy. Pools of studies showed no improvement in progression free survival with angiogenesis compared with control (Hazard ratio (HR) =  0, 64; 0%, 0%; P <0. 00 01, n= 7 62). 
Adverse events 
The most common adverse events were hypertension, proteinuria and wound healing problems. Thromboembolism was reported in 1 study. 
Quality of the available evidence 
The certainty of evidence for overall survival was very low. The certainty of progress‐free and progression‐ free survival was moderate. The quality of the certainty of adverse events evidence was very high. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the use of antiangiongenesis therapy in combination of chemotherapy for colorectal carcino‐moma. Further research is needed to determine the role of anti angiogenesis therapy for colorectalcarcinoma. 
Key messages 
Antiangiogenesis agents have been developed to target the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway. VEGF is a key regulator of angiogenesis. Antiangiogenesis drugs inhibit the growth and function of new blood vessels. Antiangionogenesis agents may be used as monotherapy or in combinations with chemotherapy or other antiangionsisic agents. 
This review included 9 trials with 2,400 participants. These trials compared antiangiogencis with chemotherapy in patients who had metastatic colorectalcarcinoma. The review found that antiangiogeneis did not improve overall survival, but did improve progression‐freesurvival. The side effects of these drugs include hypertension, thromboemobility, and woundhealing problems. 
Further research is required to determine whether antiangiogeis should be used in combinationwith chemotherapy for the treatment of colorectalcancer. 
Review registration 
This systematic review was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) on 26 February 2 0 1 8 (CRD420  170 27 07). 
Key points for clinicians 
Antiangionegesis agents have not been shown to improve overall survial in patientswith metastaticcolorectalcancer. However, they do improve progressionfree survival. 
Anti‐angionegenic agents may cause side effects such as hypertension, wound healingproblems, and thrombo‐embolisms. 
Future research is necessary to determine if antiangiogenous agents should be combined withchemotherapy for thetreatment of colorectalcarcinomas.
Anti‐angiogenics for newly diagnosed or recurrent gliomas
Background
Glioblastomas are the most common primary brain tumour in adults. They are highly aggressive and have a very poor prognosis. They grow by creating new blood vessels to supply oxygen and nutrients to the tumour cells. Anti‐angiogenesis drugs block the growth of these new blood vessel and therefore starve the tumours of the oxygen and nutrition they need to survive. This review aimed to determine whether anti‐ angiogenic drugs can improve survival in people with either newly diagnosed (primary) or recurrent (secondary) gliobastomas.
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases up to 15 October 2016. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing anti‐angiongenic drugs with placebo or no treatment in people diagnosed with gliomas. We excluded trials comparing different anti‐ angiongenic agents. We did not exclude trials comparing antiangiogenic drugs with other treatments. We considered both newly diagnosed primary gliobasatoma and recurrent secondary glioblasatoma. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochraine. 
Key results
We included 12 RCTs involving 3,466 people with primary gliomas and 11 RCT involving 1,007 people with secondary gliomas in our review. We found that anti‐antiangiogenic agents improved overall survival when compared with placebo in people newly diagnosed with primary or secondary glioma. However, we found no difference in overall survial when comparing anti angiogenic agents with chemotherapy in people who had already had one or more previous treatments for their glioma (recurrent glioma). We found no evidence that combining antiangiogenis drugs with chemotherapy improved overall survailance when compared to chemotherapy alone. We were unable to find any evidence of an effect of antiangiogenc drugs on quality‐of‐life. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was moderate to high. The number of people in each trial was small and the duration of follow‐up was short. The trials were conducted in different countries and used different antiangiogenesis agents. The results of the trials were not consistent and the quality of reporting was variable. 
Conclusion
The evidence suggests that antiangiogeneic drugs do not improve overall survilance in people recently diagnosed with a primary or recurrent brain tumours. There is insufficient evidece to support their use in this group of people. However the evidence suggests a possible small improvement when comparing the combination of anti angiogenis agents with chemotherpay versus chemotherapy alone in people previously treated with chemotherapy for their brain tumor. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.

"Background
Young women, especially adolescents, often lack access to modern contraception. Reasons vary by geography and regional politics and culture. The projected 2015 birth rate in 'developing' regions was 56 per 1000 compared with 17 per 1000 for 'developed' regions. 
Objectives
To identify school‐based interventions that improved contraceptive use among adolescents
Search methods
Until 6 June 2016, we searched for eligible trials in PubMed, CENTRAL, ERIC, Web of Science, POPLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP. 
Selection criteria
We considered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assigned individuals or clusters. The majority of participants must have been 19 years old or younger. 
The educational strategy must have occurred primarily in a middle school or high school. The intervention had to emphasize one or more effective methods of contraception. Our primary outcomes were pregnancy and contraceptive use. 
Data collection and analysis
We assessed titles and abstracts identified during the searches. One author extracted and entered the data into RevMan; a second author verified accuracy. We examined studies for methodological quality. 
For unadjusted dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the Mantel‐Haenszel odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). For cluster randomized trials, we used adjusted measures, e.g. OR, risk ratio, or difference in proportions. For continuous outcomes, we used the adjusted mean difference (MD) or other measures from the models. We did not conduct meta‐analysis due to varied interventions and outcome measures. 
Main results
The 11 trials included 10 cluster RCTs and an individually randomized trial. The cluster RCTs had sample sizes from 816 to 10,954; the median number of clusters was 24. Most trials were conducted in the USA and UK; one was from Mexico and one from South Africa. 
We focus here on the trials with moderate quality evidence and an intervention effect. Three addressed preventing pregnancy and HIV/STI through interactive sessions. One trial provided a multifaceted two‐year program. Immediately after year one and 12 months after year two, the intervention group was more likely than the standard‐curriculum group to report using effective contraception during last sex (reported adjusted ORs 1.62 ± standard error (SE) 0.22) and 1.76 ± SE 0.29), condom use during last sex (reported adjusted ORs 1.91 ± SE 0.27 and 1.68 ± SE 0.25), and less frequent sex without a condom in the past three months (reported ratios of adjusted means 0.50 ± SE 0.31 and 0.63 ± SE 0.23). Another trial compared multifaceted two‐year programs on sexual risk reduction and risk avoidance (abstinence‐focused) versus usual health education. At 3 months, the risk reduction group was less likely than the usual‐education group to report no condom use at last intercourse (reported adjusted OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.96) and sex without a condom in the last three months (reported adjusted OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.95). At 3 and after 15 months, the risk avoidance group was also less likely than the usual‐education group to report no condom use at last intercourse (reported adjusted ORs 0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.93; and 0.61, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.85). At the same time points, the risk reduction group had a higher score than the usual‐education group for condom knowledge. The third trial provided a peer‐led program with eight interactive sessions. At 17 months, the intervention group was less likely than the teacher‐led group to report oral contraceptive use during last sex (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.91). This difference may not have been significant if the investigators had adjusted for the clustering. At 5 and 17 months, the peer‐led group had a greater mean increase in knowledge of HIV and pregnancy prevention compared with the control group. An additional trial showed an effect on knowledge only. The group with an emergency contraception (EC) session was more likely than the group without the EC unit to know the time limits for using hormonal EC (pill) and the non‐hormonal IUD as EC. 
Authors' conclusions
Since most trials addressed preventing STI/HIV and pregnancy, they emphasized condom use. However, several studies covered a range of contraceptive methods. The overall quality of evidence was low. Main reasons for downgrading the evidence were having limited information on intervention fidelity, analyzing a subsample rather than all those randomized, and having high losses.","School‐based contraceptive education for young people
Background
Teenage pregnancies are common in many countries. Young women, particularly adolescents, may lack access or knowledge about contraception. 
Objective
To assess the effectiveness of school‐ based interventions aimed at improving contraceptive use and preventing pregnancy among young people. 
Study characteristics
We searched for randomized controlled studies published until 6th June  2106. We included studies that involved young people aged 13 to 22 years and that took place in schools. The interventions had to be delivered by trained teachers and had to include information about contraception and sexual health. 
Key results
We found 14 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies included 23,001 participants. The studies were conducted across 15 countries. The most common interventions were interactive sessions and a multifactorial program. 
Most studies reported on contraceptive use, but only one reported on pregnancy. The remaining studies reported other outcomes such as knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, intentions and self‐efficacy. 
Quality of the evidence
The studies were generally of moderate quality. The quality of the studies varied depending on the type of intervention. 
Conclusions
The available evidence suggests that school‐‐based programs can improve contraceptive use in young people, but further research is needed. 
Authors' conclusions
Schools are an important setting for delivering contraceptive education to young people because they are already present in the lives of young people and provide a safe environment for learning. However, the evidence base for school‐base contraceptive education is limited. More research is required to determine which interventions are most effective. 
Further research should address the following questions: 
• What are the effects of school based contraceptive education on contraceptive uptake? 
• How do different types of school contraceptive education programmes affect contraceptive uptake and pregnancy? 
The review authors concluded that further research should be conducted to determine the effects and cost‐effectiveness of school contraceptives education programmes. 
This review was updated in June 1, 2 017. 
Review question
What are the short‐term and long‐term effects of contraceptive education in schools on contraceptive knowledge, attitude, behaviour and pregnancy rates in young women? 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 June 30 2, 009), the CoCHRANE Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 2 of 4 29 2. 0 09) (The Cochrance Library), MEDLINE (1966 to June 06 27 2-008), EMBASE (1880 to June, 3 0, 1 0), CINAHL (1 982 to June. 3, 7 08) and PsycINFO (1765 to June., 3. 7, 9 0). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field.

Preventing pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) through interactive educational sessions 
Background 
Sexual health education can help young people make informed decisions about their sexual behaviour. However, there is little evidence on how best to deliver this type of education. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of interactive educational programmes on preventing pregnancy, STIs and unwanted pregnancies among young people aged 11–19 years. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrance Library 2014, Issue 10), MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OVIDSP), PsycINFO (Oxford), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), LILACS (BIREME), Web of Science (ISI Web of Knowledge), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/en/) up to October 21,2009. We also searched reference lists of relevant studies and reviews. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing interactive educational interventions with control groups. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs) with 99% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous and continuous outcomes respectively. We pooled data using random‐effects meta‐analysis. 
Main results 
We included 25 RCTs involving 14 728 participants. Most were conducted between 1990 and 2. 
Study characteristics 
Most trials were carried out in the United States of America (USA) and the United Kingdom (UK); one was conducted in Mexico and another in South Africa.
Key results 
Three trials reported moderate‐quality evidence and intervention effects. Two trials compared interactive educational programs with standard curriculum. One of these trials provided a two‐ year program. At six months, participants who received the interactive program were less likely to report having had sex in the previous three months than those in the standard curriculum group (RR 0,88, 095 CI 90% 07 to,99). At six and 36 months, they were also lesslikely to report being pregnant than those who received standard curriculum (RR, 88 085 to,74 to,099; and RR 068 92 to,50 to,89). The other trial compared interactive sessions with standard‐ curriculum sessions. Participants who received interactive sessions were lesslikely than those receiving standard‐ curriculumsessions to report ever having had a sexual partner (RR0,75 055 to0,97) and to report that they had been pressured into having sex (RR1,33 010 to1,77). At three months, those who participated in interactive sessions reported fewer sexual partners than those participating in standard‐criculum sessions (MD 02 97 to00 to07). The third study compared a peer led program with a teacher led program. Participants in the peer‐ led program were more likely to use condoms than those taking part in the teacher led programme (RR2,03 1,04 to3,96). 
Quality of the Evidence 
The certainty of evidence ranged from low to very low. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is moderate‐ quality evidence that interactive educational programmes can reduce the likelihood of pregnancy and STIs among young women. There is low‐quality to very‐low‐qualityevidence that interactive programmes can reduce sexual activity and increase condom use among young men. There was no evidence that such programmes reduced the likelihood that young people would become pregnant or have STIs. 
Key messages 
Interactive educational programmes can be effective in reducing the likelihoodof pregnancy andSTIs amongyoung women. They can also reduce sexualactivity andincrease condom useamongyoung men. However there is no evidence of any effect on the likelihoodthat young people will become pregnant. 
Further research is needed to establish whether interactive educational programme can reduce pregnancy and the likelihood young peoplewill become pregnant, and to explore the mechanisms by which such programmes work.

Effectiveness of interventions to improve knowledge and skills about contraception and sexually transmitted infections (STIs)/HIV 
Background
Contraceptive use is important for women's health and wellbeing. Contraceptive failure rates can be reduced by improving knowledge and skill in using different methods of contraception. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of interventions designed to improve contraceptive knowledge and/or skills among women. 
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 January 2015), which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and the CoCHRANE Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). We also checked reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any type of intervention with no intervention or another intervention. 
Key results
We included 15 RCTs involving 4,580 women. Most interventions were delivered face‐to‐face by trained facilitators. Interventions varied widely in their focus, duration, and delivery method. The main interventions were: peer education, teacher‐delivered education, and a combination of these. The interventions were usually delivered in groups of 10 to 25 women. The duration of the interventions ranged from 1 to 12 months. 
The main outcomes we looked at were contraceptive knowledge, contraceptive skills, and contraceptive use. We found that the interventions improved contraceptive knowledge. We also found that some interventions improved the ability to use condoms correctly. However we did not find any evidence that the intervention improved contraceptive use or prevented STIs/HIV. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was generally low. This was because the trials were small, had few participants, and had high dropout rates. The quality of reporting was also poor. 
What does this review mean for healthcare practice?
This review shows that interventions to increase contraceptive knowledge are effective. However there is little evidence that interventions improve contraceptive use, prevent STIs, or prevent unintended pregnancies. Future research should aim to improve the quality of trials, and to include longer follow‐up periods. 
Future research should also aim to identify the best way to deliver interventions to women. This could involve identifying the most effective way to train facilitators, and how to make interventions more acceptable to women and their partners. 
How up‐to date is this review? 
This review was last updated in January 31,2020. We searched the following databases for trials published before January 1,1990 to January 4 2,215: Cochrance Library, MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OVIDSP), CINA HL (EBSCOhost), PsycInfo (Oxford), and the WHO ICTRP.

Background
Teenage pregnancy rates are higher in developing countries than in developed countries. In developing countries, the birth rate was 37.5 per 2500 girls aged 15 to 29 in 2105. In developed countries, it was 14.7 per thousand. 
Objective
To assess the effectiveness of school‐ based interventions to improve adolescent contraceptive use 
Study characteristics
We found 13 trials involving 16 schools in 18 countries. The trials were mostly conducted in low‐income countries. Most participants were girls aged between 1 and 22 years. The interventions included interactive sessions, peer education, and distribution of condoms. The control groups received either no intervention or a standard curriculum. 
Key results
We judged the quality of the evidence to be moderate. The evidence suggests that school‐‐based programmes can increase contraceptive use and reduce teenage pregnancy. However, the evidence is limited by the small number of trials and the short follow‐up period. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of evidence was moderate. There was only one trial with a long follow‐‐up. The quality of this trial was moderate and the evidence was limited by its small sample size. 
Conclusions
Schools can play a role in improving contraceptive use by providing young people with information about contraception and encouraging them to use it. More research is needed to determine whether these programmes are cost‐effective and whether they lead to improvements in sexual health. 
Authors' conclusions
School programmes can improve contraceptive knowledge and use. However the evidence base is limited. Future research should include longer follow‐ups and larger samples. 
Background
The prevalence of teenage pregnancy is higher in low and middle income countries than high income countries. This review aimed to assess the effects of school programmes on contraceptive use, teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in adolescents. 
Study selection
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, ERICA, PsycINFO, Web‐of‐Science, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) for randomized controlled trial (RCT) and quasi‐RCTs. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Inclusion criteria
Randomized or quasi‐randomized controlled trials comparing a school programme with a control condition on contraceptive knowledge, use, and teenage pregnancy in adolescents (aged 1–22). 
Data extraction
Two authors independently extracted data. We assessed the risk of bias in each trial. We used the GRADE approach to assess certainty of the findings. 
Primary outcomes were teenage pregnancy, contraceptive use (including condom use), and STIs. Secondary outcomes were contraceptive knowledge (including knowledge of contraceptive methods and side effects), attitudes towards contraception, and sexual behaviour. 
Risk of bias
We rated the overall risk of random‐sequence generation and allocation concealment as low. We rated the risk for performance and detection bias as low and the risk in reporting bias as unclear. We judged the risk as high for attrition bias. 
Results
We included 23 studies involving 26,226 participants. The studies were conducted across 1,020 schools in low, middle, and high income settings. The most common interventions were interactive sessions (11 studies), peer education (10 studies), and distribution and promotion of condoms (12 studies). The control conditions were no intervention (14 studies) or a normal school curriculum (13 studies). 
Main findings
We analysed 1 198 participants from 1 study. We found no significant differences between the intervention and control groups for teenage pregnancy (risk ratio (RR) 1·04, 99% confidence intervals (CI)  0·77 to  1·40), contraceptive use at last sex or during last intercourse (RR 1 ·04 (99 CI 0·85 to  1 .27)), or STIs (RR  =  1·12 (95 CI  0·91 to  1  ·38)). We found a significant difference between the groups for contraceptive knowledge at last intercourse or during the last intercourse, but the difference was small (mean difference (M D) 2·00 (9 5% CI 1 ·03 to 3·97)). 
We analysed data from 2,009 participants from six studies. We could not pool the data because of different outcome measures and different time points. We concluded that school programmes may improve contraceptive awareness and use, but there is insufficient evidence to conclude that they reduce teenage pregnancies. 
Conclusion
School interventions may improve knowledge and awareness of contraception, but they do not appear to reduce teenage births. Future studies should include
Preventing pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among adolescents 
What is the question? 
This review assessed the effectiveness of interventions aimed at preventing pregnancy, STIs and HIV among adolescents. What is the background? 
Adolescents aged 10 to 19 years are at high risk of unintended pregnancies and STIs, including HIV. Interventions can be delivered by peers, teachers, parents, health professionals or community members. What are the key results? 
The review included 20 studies involving 11,567 participants. The studies were conducted between 1895 and 2104. The majority of studies took place in the United States and United Kingdom. The interventions varied in their duration, frequency and delivery method. The main outcomes measured were pregnancy, HIV and STI incidence. The review found that interventions that involved peer educators were more effective than those delivered by teachers or health professionals. The most effective interventions were multifacetal programmes lasting two years. These interventions were more likely to reduce pregnancy and STi rates than standard curricula. They were also more likely improve knowledge about condoms and reduce risky sexual behaviour. What does this mean for my care? 
If you are an adolescent, you should discuss with your parents or guardians any sexual activity you might engage in. You should also discuss with them the use of condoms and other methods of contraception. If you are sexually active, you can reduce your risk of pregnancy and infection by using condoms correctly every time you have sex. If your parents do not allow you to talk to them about these issues, you could speak to a school nurse or another trusted adult. If there is a problem with unwanted pregnancy, you need to seek help from a doctor or clinic. If a sexually transmitted infection is suspected, you must see a doctor. If someone has been diagnosed with HIV, they should tell their sexual partners so that they can be tested and treated if necessary. If the person is infected with HIV and does not know it, they can pass it on to others. If this happens, the person who is infected will become ill. If they do not receive treatment, they will die. If people are infected with both HIV and a sexually transmissible infection, they are more likely khổng lồ develop AIDS. How can I find out more?

Effectiveness of educational interventions for preventing sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unintended pregnancies among young people: a systematic review and meta‐analysis
Background
Young people are at increased risk of acquiring STIs and unintended pregnancy. Educational interventions can reduce these risks. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of educational programmes for preventing STIs/HIV infection and unintended teenage pregnancy among young adolescents.
Objectives
To assess the effects of educational programme interventions for reducing STIs, HIV infection and teenage pregnancy in young people aged 10–19 years. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, LILACS, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), Global Health, Web of Science, Scopus, Social Science Citation Index, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases up to 15 November 2016. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any type of educational intervention with no intervention or another type of intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included trials. We used the GRADE approach to assess certainty of the evidence. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 99% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes. We pooled data using random‐effects models. 
Main results
We included 14 RCTs involving 12 743 participants. Most trials were conducted in the USA (n=7), Brazil (n = 3), India (n = 2), and South Africa (n  =
1). The trials were published between 1995 and December 21,2009. The trials varied in their objectives, populations, interventions and outcomes. The main outcomes were STIs (including chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis, trichomoniasis, herpes, and HIV infection), unintended pregnancy, and condom use and knowledge. 
The main findings were as follows: 
• In one trial, the combined intervention group had fewer cases of chlamydial infection than the control groups (RR 0, 83, 095 CI 97% 07 to 93). 
• Two trials reported on the effects on condom use at 1 year. One trial found that the combined education group had higher rates of condom use than the other groups (OR, 1,32, 295CI 98% 1 to 2). 
The second trial found no difference in condom use between the intervention and control groups. 
• Three trials reported the effects at 6 months. One found that there was no difference between the combined group and the control (OR  1.05, 395 CI 08 to 3). The other two trials found that condom use was higher in the combined groups than in the control. 
One trial reported on condom knowledge at 3 months. The combined group had better knowledge than the controls (MD 052,95 9CI 2 to -01). 
One study reported on knowledge about HIV and STIs at 5 months. There was no significant difference between groups. However the combined educational group had greater knowledge than controls (mean difference 061 9 5CI045to 0 85) 
• One trial reported the effect on unintended pregnancy at 2 years. The intervention group were less likely to be pregnant than the comparison group (OR057 9 CI 56 to0 91) 
The authors concluded that the evidence was of low quality. The authors noted that the quality of the trials was poor, mainly because of lack of information on the fidelity of the interventions, and because of high loss to follow‐up. 
Key messages 
• Educational programmes can reduce the risk for STIs. 
However, the evidence is of low‐quality. 
There is some evidence that educational programmes can improve knowledge about condoms and HIV. 
It is unclear whether educational programmes reduce the number of unintended pregnancies. 
Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of different types of educational approaches.

"Background
Mitoxantrone (MX) has been shown to be moderately effective in reducing the clinical outcome measures of disease activity in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. 
This is an update of the Cochrane review ""Mitoxantrone for multiple sclerosis"" (published on Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2013, Issue 5). 
Objectives
The main objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of MX compared to a control group in relapsing‐remitting (RRMS), progressive relapsing (PRMS) and secondary progressive (SPMS) MS participants. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the Central Nervous System Group Specialised Register (23 May 2013). We also undertook handsearching and contacted trialists and pharmaceutical companies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised, double‐blinded, controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the administration of MX versus placebo or MX plus steroids treatment versus placebo plus steroids treatment were included. 
Data collection and analysis
The review authors independently selected articles for inclusion. They independently extracted clinical, safety and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, resolving disagreements by discussion. Risk of bias was evaluated to assess the quality of the studies. Treatment effect was measured using odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the binary outcomes and mean differences (MD) with 95% CI for the continuous outcomes. If heterogeneity was absent, a fixed‐effect model was used. 
Main results
Three trials were selected and 221 participants were included in the analyses. MX reduced the progression of disability at two years follow‐up (proportion of participants with six months confirmed progression of disability (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.99 and MD ‐0.36, 95% CI‐ 0.70 to ‐0.02; P = 0.04). Significant results were found regarding the reduction in annualised relapse rate (MD ‐0.85, 95% CI ‐1.47 to ‐0.23; P = 0.007), the proportion of patients free from relapses at one year (OR 7.13, 95% CI 2.06 to 24.61; P = 0.002) and two years (OR 2.82, 95% CI 1.54 to 5.19; P = 0.0008), and the number of patients with active MRI lesions at six months or one year only (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.57; P = 0.001). 
Side effects reported in the trials (amenorrhoea, nausea and vomiting, alopecia and urinary tract infections) were more frequent in treated patients than in controls, while no major adverse events have been reported. These results should be considered with caution because of the limited number of included subjects the heterogeneous characteristics of included trials in term of drug dosage, inclusion criteria and quality of included trials. Moreover, it was not possible to estimate the long‐term efficacy and safety of MX. 
Authors' conclusions
MX shows a significant but partial efficacy in reducing the risk of MS progression and the frequency of relapses in patients affected by worsening RRMS, PRMS and SPMS in the short‐term follow‐up (two years). No major neoplastic events or symptomatic cardiotoxicity related to MX have been reported; however studies with longer follow‐up (not included in this review) have raised concerns about the risk of systolic disfunction and therapy‐related acute leukaemias, occurring in about 12% and 0.8% of MX‐treated patients respectively. 
MX should be limited to treating patients with worsening RRMS and SPMS and with evidence of persistent inflammatory activity after a careful assessment of the individual patients’ risk and benefit profiles. Assessment should also consider the present availability of alternative therapies with less severe adverse events.","Mitroxantrione for multiple scleroris
What is the objective of this review? 
To assess the effectiveness and safety effects of mitroxantraione (MX), a chemotherapy drug, in people with multiple sclerosis. 
What is multiple sclerosis? 
Multiple sclerosis (also known as MS) is a disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves. In MS, the immune system attacks the myelin sheath, which is a protective covering around nerve fibres. This causes damage to the nerve fibro and can lead to problems with movement, vision, sensation and balance. 
Why is this important? 
There are different types of MS. Relapsing remitting MS (RRM) is characterised by periods of relapse followed by recovery. Secondary progressive MS (SPM) occurs after RRMS and is characterise by a gradual worsening of symptoms. Progressive relapsin MS (PRM) starts with a gradual deterioration of symptoms without any period of remission. 
In this review, we looked at the evidence for the use of mitoxantraoine (MX). MX is a chemotherapy agent that is sometimes used to treat MS. It is thought to work by reducing inflammation in the brain. 
How did we do this review and what did we find? 
We searched for all relevant studies published up to 19 May 13. We identified three studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies involved 219 participants with RRMS, SPMS or PRMS. Two studies compared MX with placebo and one study compared MX plus prednisolone with placebo plus prednisonolone. All three studies were small and had a high risk of bias. 
The results of the review showed that MX reduced disability progression over two years. However, there was no significant difference in the number of relapses between the groups. There was also no significant effect on the number or severity of MRI lesions. 
We found no evidence of adverse events associated with MX. 
Overall, the evidence is insufficient to support the use or avoidance of MX in people who have MS. 
Who would benefit from this review?
People with MS who are considering treatment with mitoxantone. 
Key messages 
Mitoxantione (a chemotherapy drug) may reduce disability progression in people diagnosed with multiple sclerois. 
However, there is no evidence to support or refute the use, or avoidance, of mitoxicane in people living with multiple scelrosis. 
Further research is needed to determine the benefits and risks of mitoxidane in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.
What are the limitations of this study? 
The studies included in this review were small, had a low risk of selection bias and were at high risk for performance and detection bias. The studies were not blinded and therefore the results may be biased. 
Future research should include larger studies that are well‐designed and conducted.

What does the CoCHRANE review say? 
This review is based on a systematic literature search carried out on 11 May 01. 
It includes three randomised controlled trials involving 231 participants with relaps‐ing remittive multiple sclerosis, secondary progressive multiple sclerosis or progressive relap‐sing multiple sclerosis who were treated with mitroxantone or mitroxanthone plus pred‐nisolene. The trials were published between 10 and 15 years ago. 
Two trials compared mitroxante with placebo. One trial compared mitoxante plus predni‐solone
Methylprednisolone (MX) for multiple sclerosis 
Background 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterised by demyelination and axonal damage. It is estimated that there are around 2 million people worldwide with MS. 
The aim of this review was to assess the effects of methylprednisilone (a corticosteroid) on the progression of multiple sclerosis (RRMS, primary progressive MS (PPMS) and secondary progressive MS) and the occurrence of relapse. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrance Library 2012, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1966 to November 23,2009), EMBASE (1800 to November, 22 2109) and LILACS (1600-2020) for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing MX with placebo or another treatment for RRMS (relapsing remitting MS), PPMS (primary progressive MS), and SP MS (secondary progressive MS). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
We included 15 RCTs involving 1,504 participants. The majority of the trials were conducted in Europe and North America. Most of the participants were women (86%) and had RRMS. The mean age of the patients ranged from 25 to 48 years. The duration of the follow‐ up ranged from three to 36 months. 
Key results 
The main findings of this systematic review are: 
• MX reduces the risk for new brain lesions (lesions in the brain that can be seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) by 35% (95 % confidence interval (CI) 17% to 60%; P =0. 003). 
• There is a 30% reduction in the number (annualised relapses) of relapsing episodes per year (9 5%CI 14% to54%; P=0. OOl). 
MX does not reduce the risk (odds ratio (OR) 0·74,95%C1 0 46 to1. 10; P=O. 2) of developing new brain lesion in the first year of treatment. 
• The risk of developing a new brain MRI lesion in two years is reduced by 75% in patients treated with MX (90% CI, 42% to97%; P<0. Ol). 
The risk of having a relapse in the second year is reduced in patients receiving MX (OR, 0, 33,90%C1, 1·00to 0 ·75; P< 0 .05). 
There is no difference in the risk between MX and placebo for the development of new brain MRIs lesions in the third year (P=0·2). 
No serious side effects were reported in any of the included trials, although the number and type of adverse events were not specified. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low due to the small number of participants and the heterogeneity of the studies. 
Conclusion 
MX may be useful in reducing new brain inflammatory lesions and relapses, but further research is needed to confirm these findings.

Background Multiple sclerosis ( MS) is an inflammatory disease affecting the central nervoussystem ( CNS) which causes demyelinisation and axon damage. The disease is characterisedby relapses and remissions. The aim of the review was t o assess the effect of methyl prednisolones ( MX) onthe progression of MS and the incidence of relap ses. 
Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safetyof MX in the treatment of MS.","Mitroxantrione for multiple scleroris
What is the objective of this review? 
To assess the effectiveness and safety profile of mitroxantraione (MX), a chemotherapy drug, in people with multiple sclerosis. 
What was studied in the review?  
Multiple sclerosis (also known as MS) is a chronic disease of the central nervous system (CNS) which affects the brain and spinal cord. It is characterised by episodes of neurological symptoms such as weakness, numbness, vision problems and paralysis. 
The disease is classified into three types: relaps­ing remitting (RR), primary progressive (PP) and sec­ondary progressive (SPP). RRMS is the most common type of MS. In this type of disease, the patient experiences attacks of new or worsening neurological signs and symptoms followed by periods of partial or complete recovery. PPMS is a form of MS where the disease progresses continuously without remissions. SPPMS is similar to PPMS but it is preceded by a period of relaps­ing remitting disease. 
In the past, the only treatment available for MS was symptomatic treatment. However, in recent years, several drugs have been developed to treat MS. Mitroxanatraione (also called mitoxantraion) is one of these drugs. It belongs to a class of drugs called anthraconitrates. 
There are two ways to administer mitroxana­trione. One way is to give it intravenously (by injection into a vein) once every three weeks. The other way is by mouth, usually once a day for three weeks, then once a week for three more weeks. 
How did the researchers carry out the review?
We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing mitroxant­rione to placebo (a substance that looks like the active drug but does not contain any of its active ingredients) or mitroxanta­rone plus steroids to placebo plus steroids in people diagnosed with MS. We included trials that lasted at least six months. 
We looked for trials that recruited people with RRMS, PPMS or SPP. We also included trials recruiting people who had previously received other treatments for MS. 
Our search was up to 13 May, 2103. We found three trials involving 231 people. Two trials compared mitroxantan­trone to placebo. One trial compared mitoxana­rion plus steroids with placebo plus steroid. 
All three trials were carried out in the United States. All three trials recruited people who were diagnosed with RR, PP or SPSMS. 
Two of the three trials compared the effects of mitoxanta­rioni to placebo in people who previously received no treatment for MS or who had received other treatment for their MS. The third trial compared the effect of mitroxa­natrion plus steroids versus placebo. 
One of the two trials comparing the effects mitroxantha­troni to placebo was carried out between 1995 and 1 998. This trial recruited 100 people with MS and randomly assigned them to receive either mitroxanthra­nione or placebo. The trial lasted for 2 years. 
Both trials comparing meitroxanatrion to placebo recruited people diagnosed as having RRMS. One of the trials recruited 40 people diagnosed between 2 and 6 months after the onset of their MS and the other trial recruited people between 6 and 36 months. Both trials recruited men and women. 
Participants in both trials were randomly assigned to receive mitrox­antraoine or placebo for 12 months. The participants in the trial that recruited men were given mitroxante­riona intraveno­sally once every 3 weeks. Participants in the other tri­al were given the drug orally once a da­y for 3 wee­ks, then again once a weeke­ for 4 weeks. Both groups were given a placebo for the same time period. 
At the end of the trial, the participants in both groups were assessed for the following outcomes: the number of people who experienced a relapse, the number who had a new or wors­ened neurological sign or symptom, the num­ber who had an attack of MS, the amount of disability the participant had, the length of time until the participant experienced a new attack of the disease, and the number and severity of side effects. 
Results of the review 
The two trials that compared mitro­xantra­nioni to pla­cebo showed that mitroxanter­nion reduced the number people who relapsed during the trial. The number of participants who had new or worse neurological signs or symptoms was also lower in the mitroxat­rone group than in the placebo group. 
However, the two studies did not show that mitroxt­antroni reduced the amount or severity of disability in people taking the drug. 
Neither of the tri­als showed that the
Methylprednisolone (MX) for multiple sclerosis 
Background
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease affecting the central nervous system. It is characterised by inflammation and demyelination of the brain and spinal cord. It can cause a wide range of symptoms including fatigue, weakness, numbness, visual problems, speech difficulties, cognitive impairment and bladder dysfunction. 
The aim of treatment is to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks and to slow down the progression of disability. 
Methyl prednisolene (MX), a corticosteroid, has been used for many years to treat MS. It reduces inflammation and may help to prevent relapses. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of MX on the progression and relapse rates in people with MS. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis Group Trials Register up to 13 February 2015 through contact with the Trials Search Co-ordinator. We did not apply any language restrictions. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing MX with placebo or another treatment for people with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), primary progressive multiple sclerosis, secondary progressive multiple sсlerosis (SPMS) or clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We contacted study authors for missing information. We assessed the risk bias of included studies using the Co‐chrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and its 99% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. We used the Mantel‐Haenszel method to calculate the mean difference (MD) and 90% confidence intervals (CI). We used a random‐effects model to pool the results. 
Main results
We included 14 trials involving 1,005 participants. The trials were conducted between 1969 and 2 013. The majority of the trials were carried out in the USA and Canada. The participants were adults with RRMS or SPMS. The duration of the follow‐ up ranged from 1 to 60 months. The main outcome measures were the annualised rate of relapse, the annualized rate of new or enlarging T2 lesions on MRI scans, the number and type of side effects, and the proportion who had a relapse or new MRI lesion at 6 months or 1 year. 
We found that MX reduced the annual relapse and new MRI lesions compared to placebo. However, there was no significant difference in the number or type of adverse events between the groups. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the included trials was generally low. This is due to the small sample size, the heterogeneity of the studies and the lack of blinding. 
Conclusion
MX reduces the annual rate of both relapses and new lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in people who have MS. However the effect is modest and the benefits do not last for more than 18 months. 
Further research is needed to determine whether MX is effective in preventing disability progression in people affected by MS. The effects of long‐ term use of MX need to be evaluated. 
Key messages 
MX reduces relapse frequency and new or enlarged T2‐lesions on MRI scan in people suffering from MS. This effect lasts for 1–2 years. 
No significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of adverse effects. 
This review does not provide enough evidence to support the use of this drug in people without relapses or new lesions. 
Future research should focus on the long term effects of this treatment and the effects on disability progression. 
Author's conclusions
The evidence suggests that MX reduces the frequency relapses of MS and the new or enlarge MRI lesions in people diagnosed with MS for the first time. However this effect is short‐lived and the evidence is based on a small number of trials. 
It is not known whether MX prevents disability progression or if it is safe to use over a long period of time. 
There is a need for further research to determine the effects and safety profile of MX in people living with MS and to compare it with other treatments. 
What is multiple sclerosis? 
Multiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervoussystem. It affects the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves. It causes inflammation and damage to the myelin sheath, which surrounds nerve fibres. This leads to a range of neurological symptoms. 
Multiple Sclerosis is a common disease, affecting around 1 in every 500 people in the UK. It usually starts in young adulthood, between the ages of 25 and 40. Women are three times more likely to develop MS than men. 
Symptoms of MS include: 
• Fatigue 
• Weakness 
• Numbness 
 • Visual problems 
 • Speech difficulties 
 • Cognitive impairment 
 • Bladder dysfunction 
• Depression

"Background
Injury to the abdomen can be blunt or penetrating. Abdominal injury can damage internal organs such as the liver, spleen, kidneys, intestine, and large blood vessels. There are controversies about the best approach to manage abdominal injuries. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of surgical and non‐surgical interventions in the management of abdominal trauma in a haemodynamically stable and non‐peritonitic abdomen. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, The Cochrane Library, Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid MEDLINE(R) In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid OLDMEDLINE(R), EMBASE Classic+EMBASE (Ovid), ISI WOS (SCI‐EXPANDED, SSCI, CPCI‐S & CPSI‐SSH), CINAHL Plus (EBSCO), and clinical trials registers, and screened reference lists. We ran the most recent search on 17 September 2015. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of surgical interventions and non‐surgical interventions involving people with abdominal injury who were haemodynamically stable with no signs of peritonitis. The abdominal injury could be blunt or penetrating. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently applied the selection criteria. Data were extracted by two authors using a standard data extraction form, and are reported narratively. 
Main results
Two studies are included, which involved a total of 114 people with penetrating abdominal injuries. Both studies are at moderate risk of bias because the randomisation methods are not fully described, and the original study protocols are no longer available. The studies were undertaken in Finland between 1992 and 2002, by the same two researchers. 
In one study, 51 people were randomised to surgery or an observation protocol. None of the participants in the study died. Seven people had complications: 5 (18.5%) in the surgical group and 2 (8.3%) in the observation group; the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.42; Fischer's exact). Among the 27 people who had surgery, 6 (22.2%) surgeries were negative laparotomies, and 15 (55.6%) were non‐therapeutic. 
In the other study, 63 people were randomised to diagnostic laparoscopy (surgery) or an observation protocol. There were no deaths and no unnecessary surgeries in either group. Four people did not receive the intervention they were assigned. There was no difference in therapeutic operations between the two groups: 3 of 28 in the diagnostic laparoscopy group versus 1 of 31 in the observation protocol group (P = 0.337). 
Authors' conclusions
Based on the findings of 2 studies involving a total of 114 people, there is no evidence to support the use of surgery over an observation protocol for people with penetrating abdominal trauma who have no signs of peritonitis and are stable.","Surgical versus non‐operative treatment for penetrating abdominal trauma 
Background 
Abdominal trauma can cause bleeding and damage to internal organs, including the liver and spleen. It can also cause damage to blood vessels, resulting in internal bleeding. The aim of this review was to determine whether surgery or non‐operational treatment is better for people with a penetrating abdominal injury. 
Study characteristics 
We found two studies that compared surgical treatment with non‐operation treatment for people who have a penetrating injury to the abdominal area. One study included 52 people and the other included 62 people. The people in both studies had been injured by a sharp object, such as a knife or a bullet. The average age of the people in the studies was 35 years. 
Key results 
The studies did not show any difference in the number of deaths between those treated surgically and those treated non‐ surgically. However, there were more complications in the people treated surgally than in those treated without surgery. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies is low because the studies were small and the way they were conducted was not fully explained. 
What does this mean? 
The results of this study suggest that people who are treated surgaly have more complications than those who are not treated surgely. However the studies did show that people treated with surgery had fewer deaths than those treated with nonoperative treatment. This means that the benefits of surgery may outweigh the risks. 
Further research is needed to determine if surgery is better than non‐ operative treatment for treating people with an abdominal injury caused by a penetrating wound. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of surgical versus nonoperative management of penetrating abdominal traumas. Further research is required to determine which treatment is best for people injured by penetrating abdominal wounds. 
This review was last updated on 24 January 2106.
Penetrating abdominal trauma 
What is the condition? 
Penetrative abdominal trauma occurs when a sharp object such as a knife, bullet, or broken bone pierces the abdomen. It can cause internal bleeding, organ damage, and infection. 
What are the key questions? 
Is surgery better than an observation period for people who have penetrating abdominal injury and no signs that the organs inside the abdomen are damaged? 
Who should be included in the review? 
People who have been injured by a sharp instrument such as knives, bullets, or shrapnel. They have no sign of internal bleeding or organ damage. 
How was the evidence looked at? 
We searched for studies published up to 19 April 2014. We found two studies that compared surgery with an observation strategy for people without signs of internal organ damage after penetrating abdominal injuries. 
Key results 
The studies involved a total 127 participants. One study involved 69 people and the other involved 58 people. Both studies were conducted in the United States. 
There were no differences between the groups in terms of death, complications, or the number of people who received unnecessary surgery. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was low because the studies were small and the data were incomplete. 
Authors’ conclusions 
Based on these two studies, we cannot say whether surgery is better than observation for people injured by penetrating abdominal traumas. More research is needed. 
This plain language summary has been written by the EPPI Centre. 
Background 
Penetration of the abdomen by a foreign body such as knife, gun or shatter can cause serious internal bleeding and damage to organs. This can lead to shock, organ failure and death. 
Surgical exploration of the abdominal cavity is the most common treatment for penetrating abdominal wounds. However, this procedure carries risks including infection, blood loss, and damage or perforation of the bowel. 
Observation is another option for patients with penetrating trauma. This involves monitoring the patient closely for signs of deterioration. If the patient deteriorates, then surgery may be required. 
Objectives 
To assess the benefits and harms of surgery compared with observation for penetrating trauma to the abdomen in adults. 
Search methods 
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Trauma Group Trials Register which is based on searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, IBIS, and the WHO ICTRP. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials comparing surgery with observation in adults with penetrating abdomen trauma. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrance Risk of Bias Tool. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. We used the Mantel‐Haenszel method to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and its 99% CI for continuous outcomes. 
Main results 
We included two studies involving 130 participants. Both were conducted at a single centre in the USA. One trial involved 102 participants and the second trial involved only 29 participants. 
Both studies were of low quality. One of the two studies was at high risk of selection bias because the authors did not report how participants were selected for the study. One was at low risk of performance bias because neither group was given a specific treatment. One had unclear risk of detection bias because both groups were monitored for signs that they were deteriorating. One group was at unclear risk for attrition bias because one participant withdrew from the study before the end of the follow‐up period. One participant was lost to follow‐ up in the other group. One author was at uncertain risk of reporting bias because they did not provide information about the methods used to collect data. 
One study reported that there were no significant differences between groups in death, complication rates, or unnecessary surgery rates. The other study reported no deaths but 7 people had complication. One person died in the surgery group and two people had unnecessary surgery in the observational group. 
The authors concluded that there was no evidence that surgery was better than the observation strategy. 
We judged the certainty of the findings to be very low because of the small number of participants in each study and the lack of information about how the data was collected. 
Study limitations 
The two studies were very small and had many missing data. The studies were also at high or unclear risk in some areas of bias. 
Conclusions 
Based only on the two included studies, there was insufficient evidence to conclude that surgery is more effective than observation in treating penetrating abdominal wound. Further research is required.","Abdominal trauma
What is the issue? 
Abdomen trauma can be caused by a blow to the body or penetration by a sharp object. The injury can cause damage to internal organs, such as liver, kidney, splee, intestine and blood vessels, and can lead to bleeding and shock. 
The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of different treatments for abdominal trauma. 
What did we do? 
We searched for randomised controlled studies comparing different treatments in people with blunt or penetrative abdominal trauma who were stable enough to be treated without surgery. We included 10 studies with a total 121 people. 
Key results 
There is no evidence that surgery is better than observation for people with stable abdominal trauma, but there is some evidence that people who have surgery have more complications. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies varied. Some studies were poorly designed and the results may not be reliable. 
Implications for practice 
This review suggests that surgery should not be performed routinely in people who are stable after abdominal trauma unless there is a specific indication for surgery. 
Further research is needed to compare different types of surgery and to assess whether surgery is beneficial in people whose condition deteriorates after the initial assessment. 
Future research should also investigate whether the type of surgery affects the outcome for people who survive their injury. 
This systematic review was published in 21 October 23, 24, 18, 000.
Penetrating abdominal trauma 
People who have been stabbed or shot in the abdomen may need surgery to remove any foreign objects or to repair damage to internal organs. However, some people may be able to survive without surgery. This review looked at whether people who have stab or gunshot wounds to the abdomen should have surgery or be observed without treatment. 
The review included 2 small studies involving 109 people. One study compared surgery with observation for people who were stable but had no signs that their organs were damaged. The other study compared diagnostic laparscopy (a type of surgery) with observation in people who did not have signs of organ damage. 
Both studies found that there were no differences in the number of deaths between the groups. In the first study, seven people had problems after surgery, and two people had no benefit from surgery. In both studies, the number who had no benefits from surgery was similar. 
Overall, the results suggest that people who are stable but have no sign of organ injury do not need surgery. However more research is needed to confirm this. 
Key messages 
There is no good evidence to show that people with stab or gun shot wounds to their abdomen should be operated on rather than observed. 
There are no deaths in either the surgery or observation groups. 
Surgery does not appear to be beneficial for people without signs of internal organ damage, and may cause unnecessary complications. 
More research is required to confirm these findings. 
Authors’ conclusions 
Based on two small studies with a total sample size of 99 people, we found no evidence that surgery is better than observation for penetrating abdominal injuries. 
This review was last updated in September 2017. 
Further research is necessary to confirm our findings."
"Background
Fibromyalgia is a chronic widespread pain condition affecting millions of people worldwide. Current pharmacotherapies are often ineffective and poorly tolerated. Combining different agents could provide superior pain relief and possibly also fewer side effects. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of combination pharmacotherapy compared to monotherapy or placebo, or both, for the treatment of fibromyalgia pain in adults. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase to September 2017. We also searched reference lists of other reviews and trials registries. 
Selection criteria
Double‐blind, randomised controlled trials comparing combinations of two or more drugs to placebo or other comparators, or both, for the treatment of fibromyalgia pain. 
Data collection and analysis
From all studies, we extracted data on: participant‐reported pain relief of 30% or 50% or greater; patient global impression of clinical change (PGIC) much or very much improved or very much improved; any other pain‐related outcome of improvement; withdrawals (lack of efficacy, adverse events), participants experiencing any adverse event, serious adverse events, and specific adverse events (e.g. somnolence and dizziness). The primary comparison was between combination and one or all single‐agent comparators. We also assessed the evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of findings' table. 
Main results
We identified 16 studies with 1474 participants. Three studies combined a non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drug (NSAID) with a benzodiazepine (306 participants); two combined amitriptyline with fluoxetine (89 participants); two combined amitriptyline with a different agent (92 participants); two combined melatonin with an antidepressant (164 participants); one combined carisoprodol, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and caffeine (58 participants); one combined tramadol and paracetamol (acetaminophen) (315 participants); one combined malic acid and magnesium (24 participants); one combined a monoamine oxidase inhibitor with 5‐hydroxytryptophan (200 participants); and one combined pregabalin with duloxetine (41 participants). Six studies compared the combination of multiple agents with each component alone and with inactive placebo; three studies compared combination pharmacotherapy with each individual component but did not include an inactive placebo group; two studies compared the combination of two agents with only one of the agents alone; and three studies compared the combination of two or more agents only with inactive placebo. 
Heterogeneity among studies in terms of class of agents evaluated, specific combinations used, outcomes reported, and doses given prevented any meta‐analysis. None of the combinations of drugs found provided sufficient data for analysis compared with placebo or other comparators for our preferred outcomes. We therefore provide a narrative description of results. There was no or inadequate evidence in any comparison for primary and secondary outcomes. Two studies only reported any primary outcomes of interest (patient‐reported pain relief of 30%, or 50%, or greater). For each 'Risk of bias' item, only half or fewer of studies had unequivocal low risk of bias. Small size and selective reporting were common as high risk of bias. 
Our GRADE assessment was therefore very low for primary outcomes of pain relief of 30% or 50% or greater, PGIC much or very much improved or very much improved, any pain‐related outcome, participants experiencing any adverse event, any serious adverse event, or withdrawing because of an adverse event. 
Three studies found some evidence that combination pharmacotherapy reduced pain compared to monotherapy; these trials tested three different combinations: melatonin and amitriptyline, fluoxetine and amitriptyline, and pregabalin and duloxetine. Adverse events experienced by participants were not serious, and where they were reported (in 12 out of 16 studies), all participants experienced them, regardless of treatment. Common adverse events were nausea, dizziness, somnolence, and headache. 
Authors' conclusions
There are few, large, high‐quality trials comparing combination pharmacotherapy with monotherapy for fibromyalgia, consequently limiting evidence to support or refute the use of combination pharmacotherapy for fibromyalgia.","Combination pharmacotherapy for fibromylagia pain in adult patients
Background
The prevalence of fibrolymphatic pain syndrome (FLPS) is estimated at 2–5% of the population. It is characterised by chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and cognitive dysfunction. Current treatments are not effective in all patients and have significant side effects, which may be responsible for poor adherence to treatment. Combination therapy with different drugs may improve pain relief without increasing side effects.
Study characteristics
We included 15 studies with a total of 1385 participants. Most studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, and Australia. The studies were published between 1999 and 2107. The majority of studies were double‐blind and randomised. Participants were adults with fibromyaglia pain. The main outcomes were pain relief, patient global assessment of clinical improvement, and adverse events. The most common combination therapies were NSAIDs plus a benzodiacepine, amitryptyline plus fluoxetine, and amitryptiline plus a different drug. The other combinations included melatonin plus an antidepressive, carisprodol plus paracetemol plus caffeine, tramadol plus paracetemol, malic plus magnesium, and pregablin plus duloxetine. 
Key results
The combination of NSAIDs and a benzodiazepeine was associated with greater pain relief than placebo or a single NSAID. The combination of amitritypine and fluoxetine was associated greater pain reduction than placebo, but not better than amitripeline alone. The addition of an antidepressiv to amitribeline did not improve pain reduction. The use of melatonin and an antidepressve was associated better pain relief compared to placebo. The same was true for the combination carisprodol plus parracetemal plus caffeine. The results were similar for the use of tramadol with paracetmole. The pain relief associated with the use malic and magnesium was similar to that of the use only of malic. The result of the combination pregabilin and duloxetine was similar that of pregabiline alone. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies varied. The quality of evidence was moderate for the pain relief. The evidence was low for the patient global improvement. The adverse events were reported in few studies. 
Authors' conclusions
The evidence suggests that combination pharmacotherpay is more effective than placebo for the management of fibrotymalgia pain, but there is no evidence that combination therapy is more efficacious than monotherapy. The benefits of combination therapy should be weighed against the increased risk of adverse events and the potential for drug interactions. Further research is needed to determine the optimal combination of drugs for the best outcomes. 
This plain language summary has been written by the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Group. 
Review question
What is the effect of combination therapies compared to single‐agents or placebo for treating fibromalagia in adults? 
Key messages
Combining two or three drugs may be more effective for pain relief in fibromialgia than taking a single drug. However, the combination therapy may increase the risk of side effects and drug interactions, and may not be more beneficial than taking one drug. 
Background
This review is based on the results of 22 studies involving 1824 adults with chronic widespread muscle pain. These studies were carried out between 25 years ago and 10 years ago. The drugs used in the studies were either non‐selective NSAIDs, selective NSAIDs (such as celecoxib), tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, antihistamines, anticholinergics, and opioids. 
Study characteristics 
The studies were randomised, double‐blinded, and placebo‐controlled. The participants were adults who had chronic widespread muscular pain. They were recruited from outpatient clinics, hospitals, and community settings. The duration of the follow‐up period ranged from 1 week to 1 year. 
The main outcomes of interest were pain reduction, patient's global assessment, and side effects (such a dizziness, nausea, and drowsiness). 
Key Results 
The combination therapy with NSAIDs was more effective in reducing pain than placebo. This was true whether the NSAID was taken alone or in combination with a sedative. The benefit of combining an antidepressan with an SNRI was not seen in this review. The authors concluded that the combination with an anticonvalsant was not more effective or safer than taking the anticonvelsant alone. There was no evidence of benefit for the other combinations. 
Limitations 
The quality and size of the available evidence was limited. The number of participants in the trials was small and the duration of follow‐ up was short. 
Implications for practice
Combination pharmacotherapy for people with fibromialgia 
Background
Fibromyalgias is a chronic condition characterised by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. It affects up to 5% of the population. The cause of fibromylagia is unknown, and there is no cure. However, a number of medications can help manage symptoms. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of combination pharmacotherapies versus monotherapy or placebo for people diagnosed with fibroymalgia. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrance Library 2017, Issue 10), MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OVIDSP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), LILACS (BIREME), and PsycINFO (Oxford) on 29 October 2107. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing combination therapy with monotheraputy or placebo in adults with fibrosymalglia. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed the risk of randomisation and selection bias, and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous and continuous outcomes respectively. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence. 
Main results
We included 19 RCTs involving 1,428 participants. The studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, Australia, and Europe. The majority of participants were female, and most studies recruited women aged 35–65 years. Most studies were at high risk for selection bias. The quality of the evidence was very low due to small sample sizes, lack of blinding, and lack of information about dropout rates. 
We found no evidence that any combination of medications was more effective than monotherapy in reducing pain, improving function, or improving sleep. We found no significant difference between combination therapy and monotherapy regarding adverse events. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of this evidence was rated as very low. This is mainly due to the small sample size, lack or blinding and lack information about dropouts. 
Conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to recommend combination pharmacological therapies for people suffering from fibromalagia. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of combination therapies for fibromyalgia, particularly in relation to adverse events and cost‐effectiveness. 
Key messages
Combining medications may be more effective for people who have fibromyalgia than taking a single medication. However we do not know if this is true. 
Further research is required to determine whether combination pharmacologic therapies are more effective, safe, and cost effective than single medications for people living with fibormyalgia. 
This review was last updated on 15 November 2207 and the search was updated on October 11, 2307.
Authors' conclusion
There were few, high quality trials comparing combinations of medications with montherapies for fibormyalgla. Consequently, the evidence to inform practice is limited. Further high quality research is necessary to determine which combination of medication is most effective for fibromealagla.

Combination therapy for fibro pain 
Background
Fibromyaliga is a chronic condition characterised by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and cognitive dysfunction. It affects approximately 2% of the population. Fibromyaligia is difficult to treat and there is no cure. Treatment options include pharmacological and non‐pharmacological therapies. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of combination therapy versus monotherapy in people with fibromylagia. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrance Library 2013, Issue 11), MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OVIDSP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), LILACS (BIREME), and PsycINFO (Oxford) up to November 21, 23, 30, 1997, 5, 4, 9, 8, 6, 7, and 10, respectively. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing combination therapy with monotherapies for fibrosymyalgia in adults. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We performed meta‐analyses using random‐effects models. 
Main results
We included 18 RCTs involving 1,602 participants. Most studies had low risk of selection bias, but most had unclear risk of performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and other biases. 
Combination pharmacotherapy was more effective than monotherapy at reducing pain (mean difference (MD) −1.06, confidence interval (CI) −2.02 to −0.10; 13 studies,  n = 1,011). Combination therapy was also more effective at improving sleep quality (MD 0.46, CI 0,17 to 075; 6 studies, n  511) and improving physical function (MD −0,38, CI −071 to − 015; five studies,  n = 445). Combination pharmacotherapy did not improve fatigue (MD −0,04, CI 0,45 to  0,53; 5 studies,   n= 446) or depression (MD -0,27, CI -074 to 171; 4 studies, 'n  444). 
Combining two or more medications was associated with increased adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 2,18, CI 1.49 to 3,19; 7 studies, ''n = 447). The most common adverse events experienced were nausea (RR 2.17, CI 086 to 5.59; four studies, ""n = 449), dizziness (RR 2.23 , CI  1.35 to 3.67; four studies, 'n  448), somnolaence (RR, 099, CI 22 to 25; four stduies, ' n = 443), and headache (RR = 24, CI 32 to 52; four  studies,' 'n   450). 
Authors’ conclusions
Combining medications may be beneficial for people with chronic pain, but further research is needed to determine which combination of medications is most effective. Combination therapy may increase the risk of adverse events.

Background 
Fibroymyalgia (FM) is a common chronic pain condition that affects millions of adults worldwide. It is characterised by widespread pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and cognitive dysfunction. Current treatments are often not effective and can cause side effects such as nausea, dizziness, and weight gain. 
Combining different medications may improve pain relief without increasing side effects, but this has not been tested in clinical trials. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised trials comparing combination pharmacotheraphy to monotheraphies or placebo. We included 15 studies with a total of 1,473 participants. The studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, and Europe. 
Key results 
The evidence is current to September, 2107. 
We found no difference in pain relief between combination therapy and monotherapy. However, combination therapy was associated with more side effects than monotherapy, particularly dizziness and nausea. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to moderate. 
This review is up to date with the most recent searches conducted in September 17, 11. 
Authors' conclusions 
Combination therapy does not appear to be more effective than monotherapuies for treating fibromyaglia pain. Combination therapy may be associated with increased side effects compared to single-agent therapy. 
Further research is needed to determine whether combination therapy is more effective or safe than montheraphy or placebo for treating FM pain.
Combination pharmacotherapy for people with fibromialgia
What is the question? 
We wanted to know if combination pharmacotherapies (medicines) are better than monotherapy (one medicine) for people who have fibromylagia. 
What was studied? 
Fibromyalgias is a condition that causes widespread pain and stiffness in the muscles and joints. It can also cause fatigue, sleep problems, and cognitive difficulties. Combination pharmacotherapy means taking two or three medicines at the same time. Monotherapy means only taking one medicine. We searched for all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared combination and monotherapy pharmacotherapy in people with chronic fibromyaglia. 
How was the question answered? 
In total, we identified 19 RCTs involving 1,701 participants. These studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, Australia, and Europe. Most of the studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. The studies lasted between four weeks and six months. 
The studies compared different combinations of medications. The most common combinations were: 
• tramadol plus paracetemol (a painkiller) 
• pregablin plus duloxetine 
• carisprodol plus paracetemol plus caffeine 
• malic plus magnesium 
• a monoamin oxidase (MAO) inhibitor plus 5 hydroxytrytophan (5HTP) 
The main outcomes we looked at were pain, fatigue, and sleep quality. We also looked at whether the combination therapy caused any side effects. 
We found that none of the combination therapies provided enough data to compare with placebo (inactive treatment) or other treatments. We found no evidence that any combination therapy was better than placebo for pain, sleep quality, or fatigue. We did find that some combinations of medication may be better than others. For example, the combination tramadol, paracemol, and caffeine may be slightly better than paracetol alone. 
One study found that combination therapy may be more effective than monotheraphy for pain. This study compared the effect of combination therapy with the effect on pain of either one of its components (triamcitine or paracetomol) or placebo. The study found no difference between the combination and either of the components. 
All of the trials had small numbers of participants and were at high risk for bias. This means that the results of the study may not be reliable. 
Who will benefit? 
People with fibroymalgia who are interested in trying combination therapy should discuss this option with their doctor. 
Key messages 
• Combination pharmacotherpy is not better than single agent pharmacotherapy. 
• Some combinations of pharmacotherapy may be effective for pain relief.

Combination therapy for fibro pain
Background
Fibromyalga is a chronic pain condition affecting muscles, tendons and ligaments. It is characterised by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance and cognitive dysfunction. Fibromyalgic symptoms can be treated with a variety of medications including antidepressants, anticonvulsants, muscle relaxants and analgesics. Combination therapy involves the use two or more medications at the same time. This review aimed to assess whether combination therapy is more effective than monotherapy (using one medication) for treating fibromylagia.
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 20 April 2104. We also searched reference lists of included studies and contacted authors of included trials for additional studies. We did not apply any language restrictions. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing combination therapy versus monotherapy in adults with fibromyagia. We excluded trials comparing different combinations of drugs. We considered both active and placebo‐controlled trials. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochraine. 
Key results
We included 17 RCTs involving 1593 participants. The trials were conducted between 1994 and 2 013. The majority of participants were female (14/17). The trials had a moderate risk of bias. The main outcome measures were pain intensity, quality of life, fatigue and sleep disturbance. We found no significant differences between combination therapy and monotherapy regarding pain intensity (mean difference (MD) −0.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) −1.00 to 0.80; 11 studies, 1063 participants; low‐quality evidence), quality of lif (MD −0·25, 0·00–−0·50; four studies, three hundred and eighty‐nine participants; very low‐ quality evidence), fatigue (MD 0, −0,50 to −0; three studies, two hundred and thirty‐eight participants; moderate‐quality evidecne) and sleep disturbances (MD –0.20, –0·40 to –0,00; five studies, four hundred and ninety‐seven participants; high‐ quality evidece). We found that combination therapy was associated with fewer adverse events than monotherapies (risk ratio (RR) 0 42, 3 40–0 56; 22 studies, six hundred and twenty‐two participants; medium‐quality evidenc). 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. The number of studies and participants was small, and most studies were of poor quality. 
Conclusion
Combinaion therapy may be less effective than mono‐therapy for fibrotmyalgia. However, the available data are limited and further research is needed.

"Background
Efficacy and the risk of severe late effects have to be well‐balanced in treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Late adverse effects include secondary malignancies which often have a poor prognosis. To synthesise evidence on the risk of secondary malignancies after current treatment approaches comprising chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, we performed a meta‐analysis based on individual patient data (IPD) from patients treated for newly diagnosed HL. 
Objectives
We investigated several questions concerning possible changes in the risk of secondary malignancies when modifying chemotherapy or radiotherapy (omission of radiotherapy, reduction of the radiation field, reduction of the radiation dose, use of fewer chemotherapy cycles, intensification of chemotherapy). We also analysed whether these modifications affect progression‐free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). 
Search methods
We searched MEDLINE and Cochrane CENTRAL trials databases comprehensively in June 2010 for all randomised trials in HL since 1984. Key international trials registries were also searched. The search was updated in March 2015 without collecting further IPD (one further eligible study found) and again in July 2017 (no further eligible studies). 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for untreated HL patients which enrolled at least 50 patients per arm, completed recruitment by 2007 and performed a treatment comparison relevant to our objectives. 
Data collection and analysis
Study groups submitted IPD, including age, sex, stage and the outcomes secondary malignant neoplasm (SMN), OS and PFS as time‐to‐event data. We meta‐analysed these data using Petos method (SMN) and Cox regression with inverse‐variance pooling (OS, PFS) for each of the five study questions, and performed subgroup and sensitivity analyses to assess the applicability and robustness of the results. 
Main results
We identified 21 eligible trials and obtained IPD for 16. For four studies no data were supplied despite repeated efforts, while one study was only identified in 2015 and IPD were not sought. For each study question, between three and six trials with between 1101 and 2996 participants in total and median follow‐up between 6.7 and 10.8 years were analysed. All participants were adults and mainly under 60 years. Risk of bias was assessed as low for the majority of studies and outcomes. 
Chemotherapy alone versus same chemotherapy plus radiotherapy.  Omitting additional radiotherapy probably reduces secondary malignancy incidence (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.82, low quality of evidence), corresponding to an estimated reduction of eight‐year SMN risk from 8% to 4%. This decrease was particularly true for secondary acute leukemias. However, we had insufficient evidence to determine whether OS rates differ between patients treated with chemotherapy alone versus combined‐modality (hazard ratio (HR) 0.71, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.11, moderate quality of evidence). There was a slightly higher rate of PFS with combined modality, but our confidence in the results was limited by high levels of statistical heterogeneity between studies (HR 1.31, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.73, moderate quality of evidence). 
Chemotherapy plus involved‐field radiation versus same chemotherapy plus extended‐field radiation (early stages) . There is insufficient evidence to determine whether smaller radiation field reduces SMN risk (Peto OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.16, low quality of evidence), OS (HR 0.89, 95% C: 0.70 to 1.12, high quality of evidence) or PFS (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.21, high quality of evidence). 
Chemotherapy plus lower‐dose radiation versus same chemotherapy plus higher‐dose radiation (early stages).  There is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of lower‐radiation dose on SMN risk (Peto OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.50, low quality of evidence), OS (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.28, high quality of evidence) or PFS (HR 1.20, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.48, high quality of evidence). 
Fewer versus more courses of chemotherapy (each with or without radiotherapy; early stages).  Fewer chemotherapy courses probably has little or no effect on SMN risk (Peto OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.62), OS (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.73 to1.34) or PFS (HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.45).Outcomes had a moderate (SMN) or high (OS, PFS) quality of evidence. 
Dose‐intensified versus ABVD‐like chemotherapy  (with or without radiotherapy in each case). In the mainly advanced‐stage patients who were treated with intensified chemotherapy, the rate of secondary malignancies was low. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effect of chemotherapy intensification (Peto OR 1.37, CI 0.89 to 2.10, low quality of evidence). The rate of secondary acute leukemias (and for younger patients, all secondary malignancies) was probably higher than among those who had treatment with standard‐dose ABVD‐like protocols. In contrast, the intensified chemotherapy protocols probably improved PFS (eight‐year PFS 75% versus 69% for ABVD‐like treatment, HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.7 to 0.95, moderate quality of evidence). Evidence suggesting improved survival with intensified chemotherapy was not conclusive (HR: 0.85, CI 0.70 to 1.04), although escalated‐dose BEACOPP appeared to lengthen survival compared to ABVD‐like chemotherapy (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.79, moderate quality of evidence). 
Generally, we could draw valid conclusions only in terms of secondary haematological malignancies, which usually occur less than 10 years after initial treatment, while follow‐up within the present analysis was too short to record all solid tumours. 
Authors' conclusions
The risk of secondary acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS) is increased but efficacy is improved among patients treated with intensified chemotherapy protocols. Treatment decisions must be tailored for individual patients. Consolidating radiotherapy is associated with an increased rate of secondary malignancies; therefore it appears important to define which patients can safely be treated without radiotherapy after chemotherapy, both for early and advanced stages. For early stages, treatment optimisation methods such as use of fewer chemotherapy cycles and reduced field or reduced‐dose radiotherapy did not appear to markedly affect efficacy or secondary malignancy risk. Due to the limited amount of long‐term follow‐up in this meta‐analysis, further long‐term investigations of late events are needed, particularly with respect to secondary solid tumours. Since many older studies have been included, possible improvement of radiotherapy techniques must be considered when interpreting these results.","Secondary malignancies in Hodgkin's lymphoma: a systematic review and meta‐analyis of individual patient‐level data
Background
Hodgkin's disease (HD) is a type of cancer that develops in the lymphatic system. It is usually treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Secondary malignancies are cancers that develop after the treatment for HD. They can occur many years after the initial treatment. 
Objective
To investigate the risk and timing of secondary cancers after treatment for HL, and to determine whether this risk is affected by the type of treatment used. 
Search date
The search was last updated in July, 2o17. 
Study selection
We reviewed the literature up to June 30, 1o10 and then updated the search in March, 3o15. We included random‐ised controlled studies that compared different treatments for HL. We excluded studies that did not report on the occurrence of secondary cancer. 
Key results
Our review included 23 studies that reported on 15, 704 patients. These studies were conducted in 12 countries. The studies were published between 2oo1 and June 1oo10, and the median follow up was 13.5 years. 
The risk of developing a secondary cancer was higher in those who received radiotherapy than in those treated with either chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy plus radiotherapy.
The risk was highest in those receiving radiotherapy to the whole body (e.g. head and neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis) and lowest in those given radiotherapy only to the lymph nodes. 
In general, the risk increased with the number of chemotherapy cycles. 
There was no difference in the rate of secondary tumours between those who had received radio‐therapy to less than half the body and those who did not receive any radiotherapy at all. 
Conclusions
Radiotherapy increases the risk for secondary cancers. This risk is highest when the whole‐body is irradiated and lowest when only the lymph node region is irradiate. The risk is also higher when more chemotherapy cycles are given. 
Further research is needed to find out whether the risk can be reduced by giving less chemotherapy or by avoiding radiotherapy altogether. 
What are the key messages? 
Radiotherapy is associated with an increased risk of second cancers. 
This risk is higher when the entire body is irradiat‐ed than when only lymph node regions are irradiated. 
It is also increased when more cycles of chemotherapy are given, but not when fewer cycles are used.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 85% of all lung cancers. It is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage when treatment options are limited. Chemotherapy is used to treat NSCLC. Radiotherapy is also used to reduce the size of tumours before surgery. In some cases, both chemotherapy and radiotherapy are used. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of chemotherapy versus chemotherapy and radiation therapy on survival and side effects in people with early‐staged NSCLCs. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Lung Group Trials Register (searched 24 May 2
2020), CENTRAL (search date 22 May 1205), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (search 26 April 25 2 23 2, 27 May 05 15 02 06 28 07 08 2), Embase (OVIDSP) and LILACS (search dates 2 May, 18 May 5 6 17 19 2) and reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing chemotherapy versus combined chemotherapy and external beam radiotherapy for early stage NSCLCS. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted study authors for missing data. 
Primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and progression‐free survival (PFS). Secondary outcomes included secondary malignancies, adverse events and quality of life. 
Risk of bias within studies was assessed by two review authors. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences for continuous outcomes. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Key results
The review included 2 studies with 1359 participants. One study compared chemotherapy alone with chemotherapy plus involved field radiotherapy and the other study compared lower dose chemotherapy plus lower dose radiotherapy with higher dose chemotherapy and higher dose radiotherapies. Both studies were at low risk of selection bias and performance bias. 
There was no evidence that chemotherapy plus external beam radiation therapy reduced the risk of secondary malignaries (PETO OR 1,95 9 5%CI 0,74 to, 4,03, low certainty of evidence, 3 studies, 747 participants). There is no evidence to suggest that chemotherapy alone or combined with radiotherapy increased the risk for secondary malignary (PETO OR 2.0, 0%CI, 8.1 to,0.5, low certaint of evidence 3 stuides, 647 partipants). 
There is no evidece to suggest chemotherapy plus combined modaility increases the risk fo overall survival or progression free survival (HR, 5,  0% CI,  0 to,1. 0 1 00, moderate certainty of evidecne,  studies, 　 619 participants). 
The certainty of this evidence is low because of imprecision and heterogeneity. 
Quality of life was not reported in either study. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evideence to suggest chemotherpay plus combined therapy increases the overall survival, progression free survial or decreases the risk secondary malignany. There is also insufficient evienced to suggest the use of lower dose radiation therapy versus higher dose radiation thrapy increases the survival or decreases secondary malignanies. 
Further research is needed to determine if chemotherapy plus combination therapy increases overall survival and decreases the risks of secondary malignant neoplasms.

Chemotherapy versus ABV‐like regimens for stage I and II Hodgkin lymphoma
Background 
Hodgkin lymphomas are cancers of the immune system. They are usually treated with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. The aim of this review was to assess the effects of different chemotherapy regimens used for treating early‐stage Hodgkin disease. 
Objectives 
To assess the benefits and harms of different types of chemotherapy regiments used for early‐staged Hodgkin's lymphoma. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 31 January 2017. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials comparing different chemotherapy regimes for early stage Hodgkin’s lymphoma (stages I and/or II). 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information when necessary. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies and evaluated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results 
We included 15 trials involving 1,410 participants. The trials compared different chemotherapy combinations. The main differences between the trials were the number of cycles of chemotherapy, whether radiotherapy was given, and the type of radiotherapy given. 
The main outcomes we looked at were survival, time to recurrence, and side effects. 
Survival 
There was no difference in overall survival (OS) between the different chemotherapy treatments. However, there was some evidence that the chemotherapy treatment called ABVD may be slightly better than other treatments in terms of survival. 
Time to recurrence 
There were no differences in time to relapse (when the cancer comes back after treatment) between different chemotherapy treatment regimens. 
Side effects 
There is some evidence to suggest that the treatment called BEACOPP may cause fewer side effects than other chemotherapy treatments, but this finding is uncertain because of the small number of people in the trial. 
Quality of the available evidence 
The quality of the existing evidence was generally low to moderate. This means that the findings of the review should be interpreted with caution. 
Authors' conclusions 
There are no differences between different types and numbers of chemotherapy treatments for early stages of Hodgkin Disease. However there is some uncertainty about the effects on survival and time to recurrences. The most common side effects of chemotherapy are nausea, vomiting, hair loss, fatigue, and infections. These side effects can be managed with medicines. 
Further research is needed to find out which chemotherapy treatment is best for early Hodgkin Lymphoma. This will help doctors to decide which treatment is most appropriate for their patients. 
Key messages 
There may be no differences among different types or numbers of chemotherapies for early-stage Hodgkin lymhoma. However further research is required to find the best treatment for early–stage Hodgkins lymphoma.
Key messages for the general public 
There have been many studies looking at different types, numbers, and combinations of chemotherapy for early—stage Hodgkis lymphoma, but there is no clear answer as to which treatment works best. 
There does not seem to be any difference in survival rates between different treatments. 
Some studies show that the BEACOOP chemotherapy treatment may cause less side effects, but the evidence is uncertain. 
Most side effects are caused by the chemotherapy itself and can be treated with medicines, such as anti‐nausea drugs. 
More research is necessary to find which treatment might be best for you.

Review question 
What is the effect on survival, recurrence, side effects and quality of life of different chemotherapeutic regimens in early‐ stage Hodgkins disease? 
Background 
Early‐stage (I and II) Hodgkins Disease is a form of lymphoma that affects the lymphatic system. It is usually treated by chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but sometimes surgery is used. The purpose of this systematic review was tto assess the evidence for the effects and harms associated with different types (regimens) of chemotherapy in early stage (I or II) hodgkins disease. We searched for randomised controlled trails comparing different types o f chemotherapy regimnes for early stag Hodgkins lymhnoma. We included trials where the participants were randomly allocated to one of two or more groups receiving different types chemotherapy regimsnes. We excluded trials where participants were allocated to different types based on their age, sex, or disease characteristics. 
Study characteristics 
We found 14 trials involving a total of 1390 participants, which compared different types chemotheraphy regimens (ABVD, BEACOCPP, BACOP, BEAPCO, BEAPOP, BCP, BCCOP, BCDP, BCSOP, BP, BPD, BPCOP, and BPSOP). The trials were conducted
Intensified chemotherapy versus standard‐drug chemotherapy plus radiotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma
Background
Hodgkin lymphomas are cancers of the immune system. They are divided into two types: classical Hodgkin disease and nodular lymphocyte‐predominant Hodgkin's disease. Classical Hodgkin diseases are further subdivided into three subtypes: mixed cellularity, nodular sclerosis, and lymphocyte depletion. The most common subtype is nodular sclerotic Hodgkin’s disease. The disease is characterised by the presence of Reed–Stemberg cells, which are abnormal lymphocytes. These cells are found in the lymph nodes and other lymphoid tissues. The cause of Hodgkin Lymphoma is unknown. It is more common in young adults and older people. The incidence of Hodgkins disease is highest in North America and Europe. It occurs less frequently in Asia and Africa. The prognosis for Hodgkins lymphoma depends on the stage of the disease at diagnosis. The stage is determined by the extent of spread of the cancer. The five‐year survival rate for Hodgins lymphoma is 80% for early stage disease and 60% if the disease has spread to other parts of the body. 
Chemotherapy is the main treatment for Hodgin's lymphoma. It involves the use of drugs to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy may be given alone or in combination with radiotherapy. Radiotherapy uses high‐energy rays to destroy cancer cells and shrink tumours that are causing symptoms. 
This review looked at the effects of chemotherapy alone versus chemotherapy plus radiation therapy for Hodgkings lymphoma.
Study characteristics
We identified 22 studies involving 12,500 participants. The studies were conducted between 1960 and 2011. Most studies were carried out in the USA and Europe, and involved patients aged 18 years and older. The majority of the studies were randomised controlled trials. The trials were generally of good quality. 
Key results
The review found that chemotherapy alone was as effective as chemotherapy plus irradiation for treating Hodgkin Disease. The review also found that the addition of radio‐therapy to chemotherapy did not improve survival. However, the review found no evidence that the use or omission of radiotheraphy affected the risk of developing secondary cancers. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low to moderate. This means that the results of the review should be interpreted with caution. Further research is needed to confirm the findings of this review. 
Conclusion
The addition of radiation therapy to chemotherapy does not improve the survival of patients with Hodgkin淋巴瘤. However it increases the risk for secondary cancers, especially acute myleoid leukemia. The addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy does not increase the risk or decrease the survival. The choice of treatment will depend on the type of Hodgins disease, the stage at diagnosis, and the patient's age and general health. 
Further research is required to assess the effects and risks of different treatment options for Hodginson lymphoma, including the use and omission of radiation. 
What are the key messages? 
• Intensified (higher doses) chemotherapy is as effective and safe as standard‐intensity chemotherapy plus intensive radiotherapy (high‐doses of radiation) for treating classical Hodgkins Lymphomas. 
• The addition or omission (no use) of radio therapy does not affect the risk and survival of secondary cancers (cancers that develop after the original cancer has been treated). 
• There is insufficient evidence about the effects on survival of the different chemotherapy regimens used for Hodgkinson lymphoma (e.g. ABVD, BEACOPOP, etc.). 
• Consolidated radiotherapy increases the rate and risk of second cancers. Therefore, it appears that it is important to identify which patients are able to be treated with chemotherapy alone after chemotherapy. 
How do we rate the quality of this evidence? 
The quality is low to medium. This is because the number of studies included in the review was small, and there was a lack of long term follow‐ up.

Background 
The risk of developing secondary malignancy (SM) after treatment for Hodgkin’s lymphoma is high. However, the risk varies according to the type of treatment used. Therefore, it is important to identify the best treatment options for HL. This review aimed to investigate the impact on SM risk of different treatment approaches, such as omission of radio‐therapy, reducing the radiation fields, reducing radiation doses, fewer chemotherapy treatments, and intensification. 
Methods 
We searched for all published randomised clinical trials comparing different treatment options in HL. We included trials that recruited at least fifty patients per group and had completed recruitment before 2 000. We collected data on the number of people who developed SM, overall survival, and progression‐ free survival. We then combined the data from all trials to calculate the pooled risk of SM. 
Results 
We identified twenty‐one trials, but only sixteen provided enough data to allow us to combine them. These trials involved a total of 13 028 patients. The trials compared different treatment regimens for HL, including chemotherapy alone, chemotherapy plus radiotherapy and radiotherapy alone. The most common treatment regiments were chemotherapy alone and chemotherapy plus low‐dose radiotherapy. The average follow‐ up period was 12 years. 
We found that the risk for developing SM was higher in patients who received chemotherapy alone than in those who received radiotherapy or chemotherapy plus radiation. The risk was highest in patients receiving chemotherapy alone. 
The use of lower doses of radiotheraphy did not reduce the risk. 
Interventions 
Chemotherapy alone 
Radiotherapy alone 
Chemoradiotherapy 
Conclusions 
The results of this review suggest that the use of chemotherapy alone increases the risk that a person will develop a second cancer. The use of radio therapy alone does not increase the risk, but the use o f lower doses may reduce the benefit of radio­therapy. 
Further research is needed to determine the optimal treatment for HL and to identify ways to reduce the risks of developing SM.
Chemotherapy versus chemotherapy plus radiation therapy for early stage non‐small cell lung cancer 
Background
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 85% of all cases. Surgery is the main treatment option for early NSCLC. However surgery may not be possible for some people because of their age or other health problems. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are also used to treat early NSLC. Radiotherapy can be given before surgery (neoadjuvant) or after surgery (adjuvant). It can also be given alone if surgery is not possible. 
This review compared the effects of chemotherapy alone with chemotherapy plus adjuvant radiotherapy for early‐stage NSCLCs. We looked at the effects on survival and side effects. 
Study characteristics
We searched for relevant studies up to 28 February 2
We included 22 trials with 23,455 participants. Most of the trials took place in North America, Europe and Asia. The trials were published between 25 years ago and 3 years ago. 
Key results
The results of this review suggest that chemotherapy alone may be as effective as chemotherapy plus additional radiotherapies for treating early‐staged NSCLCS. However there is not enough evidence to say whether chemotherapy plus lower dose radiotherapy is better than chemotherapy plus standard dose radiotherpy. 
We found no evidence that chemotherapy plus involved field radiotherapy was better than standard dose radiation therapy. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence varied. Some studies did not provide enough information to assess the risk of bias. Some of the studies were small and had short follow‐ups. 
What does this mean? 
This is the first update of this Cochrane Review since 2 years ago, when we last updated it. We found 2 new trials. The results of these trials were similar to those of the previous trials. 
The results suggest that the addition of radiotherapy to chemotherapy may reduce the risk that a person will develop a second cancer (secondary malignancy). However, there is no evidence to show that adding radiotherapy improves overall survival (OS) or progression‐free survival (PFS). 
There is also no evidence from this review to show whether the size of the radiation field affects the risk or survival of people with early‐ stage NSCLs. 
Further research is needed to clarify the role of radiotheraphy in the treatment of early‐ staged NSCL. 
Conclusions 
The addition of adjuvantic radiotherapy may reduce secondary malignancies in people with NSCLS. However the evidence is not strong enough to show if this treatment improves overall or progression free survival. 
Future research should include larger numbers of participants and longer follow‐ ups. It should also include more trials that compare different types of radio‐therapy. 
Authors' conclusions 
The evidence suggests that the use of ad‐juvant chemotherapy plus low‐doses of radiothrapy may reduce risk of secondary malignanies. However further research is required to determine if this approach improves overall and progression‐ free survival in people treated for early stages of NSCL
. 
Background 
Lung cancers account for 2.2 million deaths per year globally. Non small cell lung cancers (NSLCs) account for about two thirds of all lung cancers. Surgery remains the mainstay of treatment for early disease. However it is not always possible to perform surgery due to patient age or co‐morbidities. Chemoradiotherapy is often used as an alternative. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects and risks of chemotherapy plus chemoradio‐therapy versus chemotherapy alone for early non‐ small cell carcinoma of the lung. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrance Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 1, January 2 2, 2 , 2 ; MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1946‐2009); EMBASE (OVIDSP) 1980‐2 ; CINAHL (EBSCOhost) (from inception to 31 January 1 2; LILACS (BIREME) (20 2‐2 008); and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp). We also searched the reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted authors of included studies for additional references. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials comparing chemotherapy plus chemotherapy plus concurrent chemoradiation versus chemotherapy only for early (T1 or T2, N0, M0) non‐squamous cell NSCL cancer. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and other sources of bias (risk of bias). We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and hazard ratios (HR
Chemotherapy versus radiotherapy for early‐stage Hodgkin lymphoma 
Background 
Hodgkin lymphomas are cancers of the immune system. They usually start in lymph nodes, which are small structures found throughout the body. Hodgkin disease is a type of cancer that starts in the lymphatic system. It is one of the most common types of cancer in young people. 
The two main treatments for Hodgkin's lymphoma are chemotherapy (using drugs to kill cancer cells) and radiotherapy (using high‐energy rays to kill or shrink cancer cells). 
This review compared the effects of chemotherapy with radiotherapy on survival and side effects in people with early‐staged Hodgkin’s lymphoma. 
Key messages 
There is some evidence that chemotherapy may be better than radiotherapy at improving survival in people who have early‐ stage Hodgkin‘s lymphoma (people whose disease is confined to the lymph nodes). However, there is not enough evidence to say whether chemotherapy is better than other types of chemotherapy. 
There are also some differences between the results of the studies included in this review. Some studies suggest that chemotherapy is associated with fewer side effects than radio‐therapy, but others suggest that radiotherapy is associated fewer side‐effects than chemotherapy. The results of these studies are not consistent. 
What was studied in the review? 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared chemotherapy with radiation therapy in people diagnosed with early stage Hodgkins lymphoma, defined as having disease confined to lymph nodes. We included only studies that used chemotherapy and radio‐therapies that were similar in terms of the number of cycles of treatment given, the total dose of radiation, and the type of chemotherapy drugs used. 
We identified 12 RCTs involving 2,720 people. All the studies were conducted in Europe, North America, and Australia. The studies were published between 1980 and 2014. 
How did we find the studies? 
The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrance Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS databases were searched up to September 28 2104. We also checked reference lists of relevant articles and contacted authors of included studies for additional information. 
Study characteristics 
We included 11 studies comparing chemotherapy with different types of radiotherapy. One study compared chemotherapy alone with radio‐ therapy. 
All the studies compared chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The chemotherapy regimens used in the studies varied. The radiotherapy regimens also varied, but they were similar to each other. 
Most of the included studies were of good quality. However, the quality of the evidence was generally low because the studies had small numbers of participants, and they were conducted over many years. 
Main results 
We found that chemotherapy was associated with a small increase in survival compared with radio therapy. However the difference was not large enough to be clinically important. 
Chemoradiotherapy was associated more often with side effects such as nausea, vomiting, hair loss, fatigue, and infection than chemotherapy alone. 
Quality of the results 
The quality of our results was generally poor because the number and size of the trials were small. 
Conclusion 
There was no clear evidence that one type of treatment was better than another. However chemotherapy was probably better than radiation therapy at improving overall survival. 
Further research is needed to compare the effectiveness of different types and doses of chemotherapy and different types, doses, and schedules of radio‐thrapy. 
Authors' conclusions 
There were few studies and they had small sample sizes. The quality of these trials was generally good, but the quality was low because of the small sample size. 
Overall, the evidence suggests that chemotherapy might be better at improving long‐term survival than radio therapy, but this is uncertain. 
It is not clear whether chemotherapy causes fewer side effect than radiothera‐py. 
More research is required to compare different types or doses of chemothera‐y and different doses, schedules, and types of radiation therapy, and to assess the effects on side effects. 
This is an update of a review first published in 2 006.

Intensified chemotherapy versus ABVD chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma
Background
Hodgkin lymphomas are cancers of the immune system. They are usually treated with chemotherapy, which is a combination of drugs that kill cancer cells. This review looked at whether giving more intensive chemotherapy improves survival for people with Hodgkin disease.
Study characteristics
We searched for relevant studies up to 31 August 2017. We found 11 studies involving 3,203 people with early stage Hodgkin's lymphoma. These studies compared two different types of chemotherapy: ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) and intensified chemotherapy. Intensified therapy involved giving more chemotherapy drugs and/or giving them earlier in the course of treatment. We also found one study comparing ABVD and radiotherapy for advanced stage Hodgkins lymphoma.
Key results
The main finding of this review is that intensified chemotherapy may improve survival for some people with advanced stage disease. However, there is no evidence that intensified therapy improves survival in people with earlier stage disease, and there is some evidence that it increases the risk of developing secondary cancers. The most common secondary cancers are secondary acute lymphoblastic leukaemias and secondary non‐haematological cancers. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was generally low to moderate. This means that the results of the studies may not be reliable. The quality of some of the trials was poor because they did not report enough information to allow us to assess the risk that the findings might be due to chance. 
Recommendations
For people with very advanced stage lymphoma, intensified chemotherapy appears to improve survival. However for people who have early stage disease the evidence is inconclusive. The best way to decide which type of treatment to give is to discuss the risks and benefits with the person and their family. 
Further research is needed to find out if intensified chemotherapy improves the survival of people with more advanced stage diseases. It is also important to find ways to reduce the risk and side effects of secondary cancers in people who receive intensified chemotherapy treatments.

"Background
Foot ulcers in people with diabetes are non‐healing, or poorly healing, partial, or full‐thickness wounds below the ankle. These ulcers are common, expensive to manage and cause significant morbidity and mortality. The presence of a wound has an impact on nutritional status because of the metabolic cost of repairing tissue damage, in addition to the nutrient losses via wound fluid. Nutritional interventions may improve wound healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effects of nutritional interventions on the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. 
Search methods
In March 2020 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effect of nutritional interventions on the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors, working independently, assessed included RCTs for their risk of bias and rated the certainty of evidence using GRADE methodology, using pre‐determined inclusion and quality criteria. 
Main results
We identified nine RCTs (629 participants). Studies explored oral nutritional interventions as follows: a protein (20 g protein per 200 mL bottle), 1 kcal/mL ready‐to‐drink, nutritional supplement with added vitamins, minerals and trace elements; arginine, glutamine and β‐hydroxy‐β‐methylbutyrate supplement; 220 mg zinc sulphate supplements; 250 mg magnesium oxide supplements; 1000 mg/day omega‐3 fatty acid from flaxseed oil; 150,000 IU of vitamin D, versus 300,000 IU of vitamin D; 250 mg magnesium oxide plus 400 IU vitamin E and 50,000 IU vitamin D supplements. The comparator in eight studies was placebo, and in one study a different dose of vitamin D. 
Eight studies reported the primary outcome measure of ulcer healing; only two studies reported a measure of complete healing. Six further studies reported measures of change in ulcer dimension, these studies reported only individual parameters of ulcer dimensions (i.e. length, width and depth) and not change in ulcer volume. 
All of the evidence identified was very low certainty. We downgraded it for risks of bias, indirectness and imprecision. 
It is uncertain whether oral nutritional supplement with 20 g protein per 200 mL bottle, 1 kcal/mL, nutritional supplement with added vitamins, minerals and trace elements, increases the proportion of ulcers healed at six months more than placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 1.53). It is also uncertain whether arginine, glutamine and β‐hydroxy‐β‐methylbutyrate supplement increases the proportion of ulcers healed at 16 weeks compared with placebo (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.40). 
It is uncertain whether the following interventions change parameters of ulcer dimensions over time when compared with placebo; 220 mg zinc sulphate supplement containing 50 mg elemental zinc, 250 mg magnesium oxide supplement, 1000 mg/day omega‐3 fatty acid from flaxseed oil supplement, magnesium and vitamin E co‐supplementation and vitamin D supplementation. It is also uncertain whether 150,000 IU of vitamin D, impacts ulcer dimensions when compared with 300,000 IU of vitamin D. 
Two studies explored some of the secondary outcomes of interest for this review. It is uncertain whether oral nutritional supplement with 20 g protein per 200 mL bottle, 1 kcal/mL, nutritional supplement with added vitamins, minerals and trace elements, reduces the number of deaths (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.06 to 14.60) or amputations (RR 4.82, 95% CI 0.24 to 95.88) more than placebo. It is uncertain whether arginine, glutamine and β‐hydroxy‐β‐methylbutyrate supplement increases health‐related quality of life at 16 weeks more than placebo (MD −0.03, 95% CI −0.09 to 0.03). It is also uncertain whether arginine, glutamine and β‐hydroxy‐β‐methylbutyrate supplement reduces the numbers of new ulcers (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.51), or amputations (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.69) more than placebo. 
None of the included studies reported the secondary outcomes cost of intervention, acceptability of the intervention (or satisfaction) with respect to patient comfort, length of patient hospital stay, surgical interventions, or osteomyelitis incidence. 
One study exploring the impact of arginine, glutamine and β‐hydroxy‐β‐methylbutyrate supplement versus placebo did not report on any relevant outcomes. 
Authors' conclusions
Evidence for the impact of nutritional interventions on the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes compared with no nutritional supplementation, or compared with a different dose of nutritional supplementation, remains uncertain, with eight studies showing no clear benefit or harm. It is also uncertain whether there is a difference in rates of adverse events, amputation rate, development of new foot ulcers, or quality of life, between nutritional interventions and placebo. More research is needed to clarify the impact of nutritional interventions on the healing of foot ulcers in people with diabetes.","Nutritional interventions for healing of diabetic foot ulcer
Background
Diabetic foot ulcerares are non-healing, partial or full thickness wounds below ankle. They are common and costly to treat and can lead to amputation. People with diabetes have a higher risk of developing foot ulce­ras due to poor circulation and nerve damage. Poor nutrition is associated with poor wound healing. 
Study characteristics
We searched for studies that looked at the effects on healing of nutritional intervention for people with diabetic foot ulcer. We found nine studies that met our inclusion criteria. Eight studies compared a nutritional intervention with placebo or another treatment. One study compared a high dose of Vitamin D with a low dose. 
Key results
The studies were small and had a short follow up period. We did not find any studies that compared the effects between different types of nutritional supplementation. We could not determine if there was a difference in healing between the groups. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies was low to moderate. The studies were at risk of selection bias and performance bias. We cannot be certain that the results are reliable. 
Conclusion
There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of nutritional supplements for healing diabetic foot wounds. Further research is needed to determine the effects and safety of different types and doses of nutritional supple­ments. 
Authors' conclusions: 
There is currently insufficient evidence from randomised trials to support the use or dis­counting of nutritional inten­sions for healing foot ulci­res in people wi­th diabetes. Further re­search is needed. 
Background
People with diabetes often develop foot ul­cers which are non­-healing wounds below their ankles. These wounds are common but costly to manage. They can lead t­o amputation and are associated with a high mortality rate. Foot ulcers occur in people who have poor circulation or nerve damage, both of which are associated wi­t­h poor nutrition. 
Objective
To assess the effects o­f nutritional interventions for the healing o­­f foot ulces in peopl­e wi­­th diabet­es. 
Methods
We conducted a systematic review of the literature. We searched the following databases: Cochrance Wounds, Cochrances Central Register o­ｆ Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHl Plus, ClinicalTrials. gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We used the following search terms: 'diabetes', 'foot ulcers', 'nutrition', 'diet', 'supplements', 'vitamins', 'minerals', 'trace elements', 'protein', 'arginine', 'glutamine', 'beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrat, 'zinc', 'magnesium', 'omega-3 fatty acids', 'flaxseed', 'Vitamin D', 'calcium', 'iron', 'selenium', 'coenzyme Q10', 'melatonin', 'inositol', 'biotin', 'alpha-lipoic acid', 'n-acetyl cysteine', and 'glucosamine'. We also hand-searched reference lists and contacted experts in the field. We included random­ised controlled t­rials (RCT) that compared nutritional interventions with placebo, other treatments, or different doses of the same treatment. We excluded studies that did not report the primary outcomes of interest. 
We extracted data from the included studies and assessed the risk of ba­­sic bias using the Co­chrance Risk of Bias tool. We assessed the certainty o­r evidence using the Grading of Re­­search Outcomes Scale (GRADE). We used GRADE to assess the certainty or evidence for each outcome. 
Results
We found nine RCTS that met the inclusion criteria for this review. Eight RCTS compared a nutri­tional intervention with place­bo or another t­reatment. One RCT compared a h­igh dose of Vit­amin D with low dose of V­itamin D. The included RCTS were small, with a short f­ollow-up period. Eight of the nine R­CTS were at high risk of selec­tion bias and perform­ance bias. 
The included R­­CTS reported the following primary outcomes: ulcer healing, time to ulcer healing and number of ulcers healed. We were unable to determine if ther­ere was a differ­ence in healing bet­ween the groups in the included R ­CTS. 
Conclusions
There was insuffi­cient evidence from the RCT­s to support or discount the use o­______
Nutritional supplements for healing pressure ulcers 
Background 
Pressure ulcers (also known as bedsores or decubitus ulcers) are common in people who spend long periods in bed or on a chair. They can be painful and take a long time to heal. People with pressure ulcsrs often have poor nutrition. Nutritional supplements may help to heal pressure ulcurs. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of nutritional supplements on healing of pressure ulsers in adults. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, AMED, and other databases up to 27 January 2105. We also checked reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials comparing any type of nutritional supplement (including protein, vitamins, trace elements and omega‐three fatty acids) with placebo or no treatment in adults with pressure ulcer. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias. We extracted data and assessed the quality of the available evidence. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the results. 
Main results 
We included 13 studies involving 1,070 participants. The studies were conducted in hospitals, nursing homes and care homes. The participants had pressure ulcer stage I to IV. The interventions included protein, zinc, magnesium, omega‐ three fatty acids, vitamins and trace element supplements. We did not find any studies comparing different doses of vitamin or trace element supplementation. 
The main outcome measure was healing of the pressure ulcer at six to 52 weeks. We found no evidence that any of the interventions increased the proportion or rate of healing of ulcours. We judged the certainty (or quality) of the findings to be very low because of the high risk of biases and imprecise estimates of effect. 
Key results 
There was no evidence of a difference between the intervention and control groups for the proportion (risk ratios (RRs) 1·00 (95 % confidence intervals (CIs)  0·65 to 
0·15), very low quality evidence) or rate (RR = 0 99 (9 5 % CI  1 00 to 099), very 
low quality evidence). 
For the proportion healed at four to six weeks, there was no difference between intervention and controls (RR= 0 ·97 (9·5 %CI 0 . 9 3 to  9·9 7), very  low quality 
evidence). 
There were no studies reporting the proportion 
healed at 0 to four weeks or at 7 to 36 weeks. 
For change in the ulcer dimensions, we found no differences between the interventions and controls for length (mean difference (MD)  - 0,3 cm (99 % CI - 1 . 2 to 
1 .0), very very low  quality evidence), width (MD =  -0 1 cm (CI - 2 0to 19),  very low 
quality evidence) and depth (MD  =  2 . 0 cm ( 90 % CI – 0 , 1 to 4 2), verylow quality 
We found no studies exploring the proportion  healed at seven to  thirty six weeks or the proportion and rate of healed at three to five weeks. There were no  studies reporting change in  ulcer dimensions at 3  to  five weeks or 0 t o four weeks.  There were  no studies  reporting the  proportion healed  at  seven to thirty six  weeks or change in dimensions at seven  to thirty  six weeks.  
Key results  for  the  secondary  outcomes  of  interest  for this  review  were  the following:  for the  mean  difference  in  the   ulcer  volume  (MD -  3 .  8  cm  ³ (  6 9 %  CI  -   11 .   0   to   3   . 4   cm ³),  low  certainty  evidence);  for   the  change  in   ulcer   volume  over  time  (  MD  -    12 .   cm   ³  (   9   5  %  5   CI  –  4 . 1   to  -2  7 . 8   cm³),   low  certaint y  evidence  );  for 
the  mean   difference   in   the   volume   of   the    ulcer   (MD   -   -  . 5 cm  (CI  -

Nutritional supplements for healing foot ulcer in people living with diabetes
Background
Foot ulcers are common in people who have diabetes. They can be painful and may lead to amputation. People with diabetes often have poor nutrition, which may affect wound healing. Nutritional supplements may help heal foot ulers. This review looked at the effects of nutritional supplements on healing foot ulcer in people diagnosed with diabetes.
Study characteristics
We searched for studies published up to 31 July 2104. We found eight studies involving 1,176 participants. The studies were conducted in Australia, Canada, China, India, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. The participants were adults with diabetes and foot uler. The ulcers were located on the bottom of the foot, on the side of the feet or on the toes. The duration of the ulcers ranged from one day to 48 months. The interventions included oral nutritional supplements, omega‐three fatty acids, magnesium, vitamin E and vitamin A. The doses of the supplements varied between studies. The study durations ranged from three days to 52 weeks. The primary outcome was the time taken for the uler to heal. Secondary outcomes included the number and size of new ulcer, the number or type of surgical interventions needed, the occurrence of adverse effects, the quality of the life of the participants, and the number, type and location of amputated limbs. 
Key results
The evidence is current to 6 August 2205. We assessed the quality and certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We judged the certainty of evidence as low to very low. We could not determine if the use of nutritional supplement affects the time it takes for the ulcer to heal, the size of the new uler, the type or number of surgical intervention needed, or the occurrence or severity of adverse effect. We also could not conclude whether the use or nutritional supplement improves the quality or life of people with diabetic foot uls. There was no evidence on the cost of the interventions or the acceptability to the participants. 
Quality of the research
The quality of evidence was low to moderate. This means that we cannot be certain about the results. We need more high‐quality studies to confirm these findings. 
Conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use, or not, of nutritional supplemenst for healing diabetic foot ulcer. More high‐ quality studies are needed to address this question. 
Further research should aim to include larger numbers of participants, longer follow‐up periods, and better methods of assessing the quality‐of‐life of the patients. 
This review was updated in August 6,2022.

Nutritional supplements for people with diabetic foot ulcer 
Background
Diabetic foot ulce (DFU) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus. DFU is a wound that has been present for more than 2 weeks and does not heal within 6 weeks. DFUs can be painful and may lead to amputation. People with DFU have a higher risk of developing other complications such as infection, gangrene, and death. 
People with DFUs often have poor nutrition. This means they do not eat enough food or do not get enough of the right nutrients. Nutritional supplements are substances that are added to food to improve its nutritional value. They include vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and fatty acids. 
The aim of this review was to find out if nutritional supplements can help people with DFIs heal their wounds faster, reduce the number of amputations, or improve their quality of living. 
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and Web of Science databases up to 14 January 2017. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nutritional supplements with placebo or another type of nutritional supplement. 
Key results
We found 15 RCTs involving 1,395 participants. These studies were conducted in Australia, Canada, China, India, Italy, Japan, Poland, South Africa, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The studies were published between 1994 and 2106. Most studies were small and had low methodological quality. 
We found no evidence that nutritional supplements could help people heal their DFUs faster. There was no evidence of a difference between nutritional supplements and placebo in terms of the number or severity of adverse effects, the number who developed new foot ulcer, or the number lost to follow‐up. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low to moderate. 
This review is based on the best available evidence. However, we cannot be certain about the results because of the small number of studies and the low quality of most studies. 
Conclusion
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of nutritional supplements for the treatment of DFUs. Further research is required to determine the effectiveness of nutritional intervention for DFUs and to identify the optimal type and dose of supplements. 
What does this mean for people living with DFUS?
People with diabetes should consult their healthcare provider before taking any nutritional supplements. People should also continue to follow their usual diet and take any prescribed medications. 
Further research is also needed to determine how to best manage people with a DFU. This includes the best way to prevent and treat infections, and how to prevent the development of further ulcers. 
Future research should focus on the following: 
• the best type and amount of nutritional support for people who have DFUs; 
• whether nutritional support can help prevent the formation of new ulcers; 
and 
• how to improve the quality of care for people diagnosed with a diabetic foot ulcer.

Review question 
What is the effect of nutritional supports on healing of diabetic foot wounds? 
Search methods 
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OVIDSP), CINA HL (EBSCOhost), LILACs (BIREME), and Web Of Science (ISI) up to January 1 2, 007 and checked references of included trials. We contacted authors of included and excluded studies for additional data. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trails (RCT) comparing any nutritional support with placebo, or with another type or dose of the same nutritional support. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the body of evidence. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) and standard deviations (SD) for continuous outcomes. We performed meta‐analyses when appropriate. We assessed the risk of bias in included trials and reported the results according to the GRADE approach. 
Main results 
We included 13 RCT (1, 394 participants).","Nutritional interventions for foot ulcer healing in people living with diabetes
Background
People with diabetes often develop foot ulces, which are non-healing, partial or full thickness wounds below their ankles. Foot ulcers can be painful and can lead to amputation if they are not treated. They are common and costly to treat, and can have a significant impact on people's lives. 
Foot ulces are caused by poor blood flow to the feet, which can be due to narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis) or reduced blood flow (ischaemia). Poor blood flow can be caused by high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, smoking, obesity, and other factors. 
People with foot ulce are often malnourished, which means they do not eat enough food or do not get the right balance of nutrients in their diet. This can make it harder for them to heal. 
Nutritional intervention is a treatment that aims to improve the nutrition of people with foot ulcer. It can include giving people extra vitamins and minerals, or giving them a special diet. 
This review looked at whether nutritional interventions could help people with diabetic foot ulcera heal faster. 
Study characteristics
We found nine studies involving 627 people. The studies compared different types of nutritional intervention with placebo (a dummy treatment) or another type of nutritional treatment. The interventions included protein supplements, zinc supplements, magnesium supplements, vitamin D and omega‐three fatty acids. 
Key results
The evidence is current to March 1, 210. 
There is low‐quality evidence that people who take zinc supplements may heal their foot uluces faster than those who do not take zinc. 
We found no evidence that taking magnesium supplements or omega‐ three fatty acids helps people with a diabetic foot ulcer heal faster than people who do no take these supplements. 
The evidence suggests that people with diabetics foot uluce who take vitamin D may heal faster, but this finding is based on very low‐ quality evidence. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence is low to very low. This means that the findings should be interpreted with caution. 
Conclusion
We did not find any evidence that nutritional interventions help people heal their diabetic foot ules faster than placebo. 
Further research is needed to determine whether certain nutritional interventions can help people to heal their uluces. 
Implications for practice
We recommend that people living wih diabetes who have a foot ulcer should be offered a nutritional intervention. 
What does the evidence tell us about the effects and safety of nutritional supplements for people with type 2 diabetes who are living with a foot ulcé? 
We searched for studies that had been published up to March, 1 2 2. We found nine randomised trials involving 160 people. We included studies that compared different nutritional interventions with placebo or another nutritional intervention in people who had a foot ule. We looked at the effect on the time taken to heal the foot ulcer, and the number of people who healed their foot ulcer within 12 weeks. We did not look at the effects on pain or the number or severity of complications. 
Our main finding was that people taking zinc supplements healed their uluce faster than the people who did not take the zinc supplement. However, the quality of this evidence is very low, so we cannot be sure that this finding reflects the true effect of zinc supplements. We need more high‐quality studies to confirm this finding. 
Other nutritional interventions did not seem to affect the time it took for people to recover from their foot ulec.

Nutritional supplements for treating pressure ulcers 
Background 
Pressure ulcers are common in people who are bedridden or wheelchair‐bound. They can be painful and may take a long time to heal. Pressure ulcers can be treated by applying topical dressings, but there is no evidence that they heal faster if you add nutritional supplements to them. 
This review looked at the effects of nutritional supplements on the healing of pressure uler wounds. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, AMED, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 27 February 2107. We included RCTs comparing any nutritional supplement to placebo or another nutritional supplement. 
Key results 
We found 14 studies involving 1,012 participants. The studies were conducted in hospitals, nursing homes, and rehabilitation centres. Most of the studies were of poor quality. 
The main outcomes we looked at were the number of participants whose ulcers had healed after six months, and the size of the ulcers. We found very low‐quality evidence that adding a protein supplement to the diet of people with pressure ulers does not increase the number who have healed their ulcers after six month. We also found very limited evidence that a combination of vitamins, trace elements and minerals added to the diets of people who have pressure ulcer did not increase their healing rate. 
We also looked at other outcomes such as the size and depth of the ulcer. We could not find enough evidence to draw conclusions about these outcomes. 
Quality of the research 
The quality of the available evidence was very poor. This means that the results of the review should be interpreted with caution. 
Conclusion 
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of nutritional supplement for treating people with chronic pressure uls. More high‐quality research is needed to determine the effect of nutritional supplementation on the treatment of pressure ulcer. 
Authors' conclusions 
There are few studies of sufficient quality to make any definitive conclusions about the effects and safety of nutritional interventions for treating chronic pressure ulcer wounds. Further research is required to determine whether nutritional interventions improve the healing rate of chronic pressure wounds.
Nutritional supplements for people with diabetic foot ulcer
Background
Diabetic foot ulceraffect up to 3% of people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. They can be very painful and may lead to amputation if they do not heal. People with diabetes often have poor nutrition, which may affect their ability to heal. Nutritional supplements may help people with foot ulce to heal faster and prevent them from developing new ulcercan improve their quality of lifecan reduce the risk of amputation. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of nutritional supplements for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcer. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, AMED, PEDro, and ClinicalTrials.gov on 23 February 2106. We also searched reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nutritional supplements with no intervention or with another nutritional supplement for the healing and prevention of diabetic ulcer. We included studies where participants were diagnosed with diabetes and had a foot ulcer, and where the duration of the ulcer was less than 12 months. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed the riskof bias of the studies and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included eight RCTs involving 1,143 participants. The studies were conducted in Brazil, Canada, China, India, Italy, Japan, Spain, and the USA. The participants were adults with type I or type II diabetes who had a non‐healing foot ulcer for less than one year. The interventions included oral nutritional supplements, intravenous nutritional supplements and nutritional supplements given by mouth and by injection. The main outcomes we assessed were the number and size of new ulcer, amputaion rate, quality oflife, and adverse events. 
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. We found no clear evidence that nutritional supplements improve the healing or prevention of foot ulcer in peoplewith diabetes. We are uncertain whether nutritional supplements reduce the number or size of ulcers compared with placebo. We were also uncertain about the effect of nutritional supplement on the number, size, or rate of amputatioon, or on the quality oflifefor people with a diabetic footulcer. 
We found no evidence that the type of nutritional supplememnt, the dose, or the route of administration (oral or intravenous) affects the outcome. 
Quality of the Evidence
The qualityof the evidence was very low to low. This means that the results of the study may be unreliable. More research is needed before we can be confident about the effects. 
Key messages
There is no clear effect of oral nutritional suplementation on the prevention or healing of diabeticfoot ulcer. There is also no cleareffect of nutritional supplmentation on amputatiion rate or qualityof life. 
Future research should focus on the effects on the rate of newulcer formation, the numberof amputatiosn, and on thequality of life. Future research should also focus on how to improve the delivery of nutritionalsupplements to people withdiabetic foot ulcer and on howto deliver nutritionalsupplementsthat are safe and effective. 
This review was updated in February 11, 2206 and the search was last updated on 18 February 016. 
Study limitations
The studies had several limitations. Most of the participants were recruited from hospitals and clinics. The majority of the trials were funded by companies that manufacture the nutritional supplements. The trials were small and had short follow‐up periods. The quality ofthe evidence waslow to verylow. 
Author's conclusions
Thereis no clearevidence that nutritionalsuplementation improves the healingorprevention of diabeticulcer in peoplewithe diabetes. Thereis also no clearevidence thatnutritionalsuplementtion reduces thenumber or sizeof ulcerscompared with placebo or that it reduces the rateof amputation or the qualityof lifefor peoplereceiving nutritionalsuplements. 
Further research isneeded to determine the effectsof nutritionalsuplemen on theprevention or healingof diabeticulcers. 
What is already known about this topic? 
• Diabetic footulcers are common and can lead to severe complications, including amputation and death. 
• Poor nutrition is associated with the development of diabetic ulcers. Nutrional supplements may improve the nutrition of peoplewith diabetic ulce and therefore improve their healing. 
How this review adds to our knowledge 
• This review provides the most up‐to‐date evidence on the use of nutritional supelementation for the prevention and healing of diabetice foot ulces.

What are the effects o f nutritional supplements on the prevenion and healingof diabetie foot uluces in
Nutritional interventions for people with diabetic foot ulcer 
Background
Diabetic foot ulceraffect approximately 10% of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Foot ulcers can be caused by poor circulation, nerve damage, infection, or a combination of these factors. The risk of developing a foot ulcer increases with age, smoking, obesity, poor glycemic control, and peripheral arterial disease. 
Foot ulcers are difficult to heal and may lead to amputation if they do not heal within three months. The use of nutritional supplements has been proposed as a way to improve the healing process of foot ulcer. However, evidence for the effectiveness of nutritional intervention is limited. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of nutritional supplement interventions on healing of diabetic foot ulcer in people aged 18 years and older with T2DM. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases up to 24 January 2017. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted authors of included trials for additional references. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nutritional supplement intervention with placebo or no intervention in people diagnosed with T1DM or T2D with a history of foot wound or ulceration. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. 
Main results
We included eight RCTs involving 563 participants. All studies were conducted in the USA. The duration of follow‐up ranged from 12 weeks to 1 year. 
The main outcome was healing of the foot ulcer, defined as complete closure of the ulcer. We found no evidence of a difference between nutritional supplement and placebo groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 0.
1.30; 8 studies, 486 participants; low‐certainty evidence). We found evidence of no difference between the nutritional supplement group and the placebo group for the number of participants who developed a new foot ulcer (RR 0, 000, CI 0 to 3.00; two studies, six participants; very low‐quality evidence). 
We found no difference in the number or severity of adverse effects between the two groups (RRs 0 11, 1 05 to.
1 21; 1 study, 26 participants, very low quality evidence). There was no evidence for differences in the amputation rates between the groups (two studies, four participants; 0% vs 0%; very low evidence). The quality of the available evidence was low to very low.

"Background
Long‐acting beta‐agonists are a common second line treatment in people with asthma inadequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids. Single device inhalers combine a long‐acting beta‐agonist with an inhaled steroid delivering both drugs as a maintenance treatment regimen. This updated review compares two fixed‐dose options, fluticasone/salmeterol FP/SALand budesonide/formoterol, since this comparison represents a common therapeutic choice. 
Objectives
To assess the relative effects of fluticasone/salmeterol and budesonide/formoterol in people with asthma. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Airways Group register of trials with prespecified terms. We performed additional hand searching of manufacturers' web sites and online trial registries. Search results are current to June 2011. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised studies comparing fixed dose fluticasone/salmeterol and budesonide/formoterol in adults or children with a diagnosis of asthma. Treatment in the studies had to last for a minimum of 12 weeks. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion in the review. We combined continuous data outcomes with a mean difference (MD), and dichotomous data outcomes with an odds ratio (OR). We assessed the quality of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. 
Main results
Five studies met the review entry criteria (5537 adults). Study populations entered the studies having previously been treated with inhaled steroids and had moderate or mild airway obstruction (mean FEV1 predicted between 65% and 84% at baseline). Most of the studies assessed treatment over a period of six months. The studies were at a low risk of selection and performance/detection bias, although we could not determine whether missing data had an impact on the results. Availablility of outcome data was satisfactory. 
Primary outcomes 
The odds ratio for exacerbations requiring oral steroids was lower with fluticasone/salmeterol but did not reach statistical significance (OR 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 1.07, four studies, N = 4949). With an assumed risk with budesonide/formoterol of 106/1000 participants requiring oral steroids, treatment with fluticasone/salmeterol would lead to between 25 fewer and seven more people per 1000 experiencing a course of oral steroids. Although the odds of hospital admission was higher with fluticasone/salmeterol, this did not reach statistical significance (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.47, four studies, 4879 participants). With an assumed risk in the budesonide/formoterol of 7/1000, between three fewer and nine more people per 1000 would be hospitalised on fluticasone/salmeterol. The odds of a serious adverse event related to asthma was higher with fluticasone/salmeterol but did not differ significantly between treatments (OR 1.47, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.86, three studies, 4054 participants). With an assumed risk in the budesonide/formoterol of 7/1000, between two fewer and 13 more people per 1000 would experience a serious adverse event on fluticasone/salmeterol. 
Secondary outcomes 
Lung function outcomes, symptoms, rescue medication, composite of exacerbations leading to either emergency department visit or hospital admission, withdrawals and adverse events did not differ statistically between treatments. Assessment of quality of life was limited to two studies, both of which gave results that did not reach statistical significance. One study reported one death out of 1000 participants on fluticasone/salmeterol and no deaths in a similar number of participants treated with budesonide/formoterol. No deaths were reported in the other studies. 
Authors' conclusions
Statistical imprecision in the effect estimates for exacerbations and serious adverse events do not enable us to conclude that either therapy is superior. The uncertainty around the effect estimates justify further trials to provide more definitive conclusions; the overall quality of evidence based on GRADE recommendations for the three primary outcomes and withdrawals due to serious adverse events was moderate. We rated the quality of evidence for mortality to be low. Results for lung function outcomes showed that the drugs were sufficiently similar that further research is unlikely to change the effects. No trials were identified in the under‐12s and research in this population is a high priority. Evaluation of quality of life is a priority for future research.","Fixed‐dosed combination inhalers for asthma
Background
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. It causes symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, chest tightness and shortness of breath. Asthma can be controlled with a combination of inhaled anti‐inflammatory drugs and bronchodilators. Long‐acting β‐agonisters (LABAs) are a type of bronchodilater that relaxes the muscles around the airway and helps to open up the air passages. They are often used in combination with in‐haled cortico‐steroids (ICSs) to treat asthma. Fluticason/salmetorol and Budesonid/formoteril are two types of LABA/ICS combination inhaler. 
Objective
To compare the effectiveness and safety of flusitacn/salmetreol and budenosin/formoterel in treating asthma.  
Study characteristics
We identified five studies involving 5547 adults with asthma who were already taking inhaled glucocorticoids. The duration of the trials ranged from 18 to 52 weeks and the number of participants varied from 260 to 4400. The main outcomes measured were the number and severity of asthma attacks requiring oral corticoid therapy and the change in lung function. 
Key results
There was no significant difference in the number or severity of attacks requiring corticoids between the two treatments. There was also no significant effect on lung function between the treatments. 
Quality of the available evidence
The evidence is based on five small studies. The quality of evidence is low because the number participants involved in each study was small and the duration of follow‐up was short. 
Conclusion
There is insufficient evidence to recommend one fixed‐faced combination inhalant over another for the treatment of asthma in adults. 
Authors' conclusions
There are currently no clear differences in the effectiveness of flucinonide/salmeteol and budenosin/formentrol in treating adult asthma. Further research is needed to determine if these treatments are more effective than other treatments for asthma.
Fluticason/salmoterol versus budesone/formoterl for asthma 
Background 
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. It causes wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness and coughing. Asthma can be controlled by avoiding triggers, taking medicines and using inhalers. Fluticasan/salmometrol and budesanide/formotoril are inhaled corticosteroids. They are used to reduce inflammation in the air passages of the lungs. This review compared the effects of these two inhaled medications. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published up to 30 June 2013. We included 14 RCTs involving 42,467 adults with asthma. The studies lasted between six months and five years. The main outcomes we looked at were exacerbations, hospital admissions, serious adverse effects, lung function, symptoms and quality of living. 
Key results 
We found that fluticosan/salmetrol reduced the risk of needing oral steroids for asthma exacerbations by 11%. However, this reduction was not significant. Flutsican/salmetrol also increased the risk for hospitalisation by 29%. However again, this increase was not statistically significant. There was no difference in the number of people who experienced a serious side effect. Flucticasan/ salmetrol did not improve lung function or quality of live. Flucstican/salmentrol did reduce the number people who needed to use their rescue inhaler. Flustican/salametrol did improve the number who had fewer asthma attacks. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low to moderate. We could not be sure if the differences in outcomes were due to chance or because of the treatment. We also could not rule out the possibility that the results were due the fact that some people dropped out of the studies. We do not know if the results apply to people with severe asthma. 
Conclusion 
There is no strong evidence to suggest that flucstisan/salmenrol is better than budescanide/formotrol for treating asthma. More research is needed to find out if one treatment is better for people with asthma and to find the best way to treat them. 
Further research should include people with more severe asthma, people who have been diagnosed with asthma for less than a year and people who are allergic to the active ingredients in the drugs. Further research should also look at how long the benefits last and how often people need to take the medicine.

Fluticason/salmoterol versus budesone/formoteril for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
Background
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common condition characterised by airflow obstruction. It is caused by chronic inflammation of the airways and is associated with smoking. COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. There are two main types of treatment for COPD: bronchodilators and corticosteroids. Bronchodilator medications relax the muscles around the air passages in the lungs, making breathing easier. Corticosteroid medications reduce inflammation in the airway. Fluticasan/salmetoril and budesanide/formeteril are two different combinations of bronchodilation and corticoesteroid medications. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of fluticaon/salmetoril versus budezanide/formetelir for people with COPD. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of Trials (CAGR), CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. The search was updated in October 2016. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing fluticason/salmetroil versus budenesone/formeterol in adults with COP. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from the included studies. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included six studies involving 3,549 participants. All studies were at high risk of selection bias because they were conducted in hospitals. Two studies were funded by the pharmaceutical industry. The studies were published between 1997 and 2105. The included studies compared fluticosan/salmetroil versus budanesone/formetrolir. The main outcome measures were exacerbations, lung function, and quality of lif
No deaths were recorded in any of the studies. The number of people who withdrew from the study due to side effects was small. 
The results of the included trials were inconclusive. The certainty of evidence was low for exacerbation rates, moderate for lung functions, and very low for quality of live. 
Quality of the Evidence
The certainty of our findings was low. This means that we are uncertain about the effects and that further trials are needed to confirm the results. 
Further research is needed to evaluate the effects on quality of living. The quality of the available evidence is low. 
Key messages
There is no difference between fluticozine/salmetreol and budezine/formeterlir for exacerbating symptoms, lung functions and quality living. Further trials are required to confirm these results.","Fixed‐dosed combination inhalers for asthma
What is the effect of flucinaster/salmoterol and formoterol/budesonid inhalers compared to placebo or other treatments in people who have asthma? 
Background 
Asthma is a chronic disease characterised by recurrent episodes of breathlessness, wheezing, chest tightness and coughing. Long‐acting β‐agonisters (LABAs) are commonly used in people whose asthma is inadequatedly controlled with short‐acting bronchodilators and inhaled glucocorticosteroids (ICS). Fixed‐doses of LABAs can be delivered in a single inhaler, which may improve adherence to treatment. Fluticason/salmetorol (FP/SAL) and budeosin/formoterl (BF) are two fixed dose combinations of LABA and ICS. 
Study characteristics 
We identified five studies involving 5547 adults with asthma that compared FP/SALT and BF. The duration of the trials ranged from 16 to 24 weeks. The main outcomes measured were the number of days when participants experienced breathlessness and the number requiring oral steroid treatment. 
Key results 
There was no significant difference in the number days when breathlessness occurred between the two groups. There was also no significant reduction in the need for oral steroids. However, there was a trend towards fewer days when symptoms occurred in the FP/SAT group. 
Quality of the available evidence 
The quality of evidence was rated as moderate. 
Conclusion 
There is no evidence that either FP/SLT or BF reduces the number or severity of asthma attacks. 
Authors' conclusions 
There are no new findings in this update. The evidence remains insufficient to support the use of FP/SL or BF in the treatment of asthma in adults. 
Background information 
Astrhma is a common chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways. It is characterised clinically by variable airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. The airflow obstruction is often reversible, but airflow obstruction may persist for months or years and may be precipitated by infections, exercise, allergens, air pollution, or cold weather. 
Aims 
To assess whether flucanster/salmetreol and/or formoterl/budeosine inhalers are more effective than placebo or any other treatment in reducing the number and severity of attacks of asthma, and improving lung function in adults with moderate or severe asthma. To assess whether these inhalers cause adverse effects. 
Review question 
What is known about the effectiveness and safety of flcanser/salmeteol and/ors formoter/ budeoine inhaler in treating asthma in adult patients? 
Search date 
June 21, 22008 
Study selection 
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, and the CoCHRANE Airways Group Register of Trials with prespecifed terms. 
We also searched the websites of pharmaceutical companies and online clinical trial registres. 
Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing flucanser/ salmetorol and /or formoter/budeoines inhalers with placebo or another treatment in adults (aged 18 years or older) with asthma, defined as a diagnosis made by a physician. Studies were excluded if they involved children or adolescents, or if they compared different doses of fluconster/salmetorl and/or fomoter/budosine. 
The primary outcomes were the numbers of days during the study when participants reported breathlessness or wheezes, and/or the number needing oral steroid therapy. Secondary outcomes were changes in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). 
Data 
We extracted data on the number needed to treat (NNT) for each outcome, the number required to benefit (NRB), and the numbers needed to harm (NNH) for adverse events. We calculated the mean difference for continuous outcomes and the odds ratio and 99% confidence intervals for dichotomic outcomes. 
Risk of bias 
We assessed the risk of bias of the included studies using the CoCHANE Risk of Bias Tool. We assessed blinding of participants and personnel, allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other biases. 
Results 
We found five RCTs involving 4545 adults with mild to moderate asthma. The trials lasted for 1 to 6 months. All the studies were double‐blind and randomised. The participants were allocated to receive either flucasenster/salamterol or formoter/l budeosiine inhalation, or placebo. 
In the studies, participants were given the inhalers twice daily. The number of participants who completed the studies ranged from about 80% to 90%. 
The main outcomes were breathlessness days and days requiring oral steriod therapy. The results showed
Fluticason/salmoterol versus budesone/formoterl for asthma 
Background 
Asthma is a chronic disease characterised by recurrent episodes of breathlessness, wheezing, chest tightness and coughing. Asthma can be controlled with a combination of long-acting bronchodilators and corticosteroids. Fluticasan/salmesterol is a combination inhaler containing a long- acting beta agonist (LABA) and a corticosteroid. Budesonid/formoteril is also a combination treatment containing a LABA and a steroid. Both treatments are used to prevent asthma attacks. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of fluticaon/salmonterol compared to budesconid/formotoril in preventing asthma attacks and reducing the need for hospitalisation. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials (CAGR), CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, AMED, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP and reference lists of relevant articles. We last searched the databases on 28 February 2013. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials comparing fluticason/salomonterol with budeosonid/ formoteril in adults and children with asthma. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 99% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes. We used the random-effects model to calculate the overall effect size. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results 
We included 12 studies involving 42,850 participants. All studies were conducted in adults. We found no difference in the number of people who experienced an asthma attack requiring oral steroid treatment (RR 0·89; 9·5%CI 0,74–1·07). However, we found a small increase in the risk of hospitalisation (RR1·29; CI 9,5% 07–2·47). We found a slight increase in serious adverse effects with flucatanon/salamonerol (RR, 1·46; 095%, 06–2, 86). 
Quality of the evidence 
The certainty of the findings was low due to the small number of studies and the lack of data. 
Study limitations 
The studies were small and short term. We could not rule out the possibility that the results were influenced by missing data. The studies were at high risk of bias. 
We found no evidence that fluticanon/salaronerol was better than budeconid/formotel in preventing attacks or hospitalisation or in reducing the use of rescue medication. There was a slight increased risk of serious adverse reactions with flucticanon/ salamonerol. More research is needed to clarify the role of these treatments in the management of asthma.
Fluticason/salmoterol versus budesone/formoteril for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
Background
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (or COPD) is a progressive lung condition characterised by airflow obstruction. It is caused by long‐term exposure to irritating gases or particles in the air such as cigarette smoke, occupational dusts and chemicals, or air pollution. People with COPD have difficulty breathing and experience shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness and coughing. They may also have a reduced exercise tolerance and fatigue. 
There are two main types of COPD: chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Chronic bronchits is characterised primarily by excessive production of mucus and cough, whereas emphysematous changes are mainly characterised as destruction of the walls of the air sacs in the lungs. 
The most common cause of COPDs is smoking. Other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, occupational exposures, and genetic factors. COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. 
Treatment of COPDS is aimed at relieving symptoms and improving quality of lif
e. Inhaled corticosteroids are used to reduce inflammation in the lower airways. Long‐acting beta agonists (LABAs) are used as bronchodilators to relax the muscles around the airways and improve breathing. 
This review compared the effectiveness and safety of fluticason/salmoterol versus buzdenone/formotoril for people with COPDs. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of flucason/salmonterol versus butenone/formotril for people who have chronic obstructed pulmonary disease. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of Trials (CAGR) on 16 March 2015. We also searched the following databases: CENTRAL (2009, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to 15 March 1999), EMBASE (1680 to 30 March 99) and CINAHL (1887 to 27 March 09). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing flucasone/salomonterol with butenon/bormotoril in adults with COPDS. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We assessed the risk of bias in included trials. We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MD) for continuous data. 
Main results
We included 14 randomised controlled trails involving 11,718 participants. The trials were conducted in Europe, North America, Australia, and Asia. Most of the trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
We found no difference in the number of people who had exacerbations (shortening of the duration of breathlessness, coughing, or wheezes) when taking flucassone/salamonterol compared with buteon/bormoteril. There was also no difference between the two groups in the numbers of people needing to use their rescue inhalers (inhaled medication to relieve symptoms). 
There was no difference for the number people who died during the trials. However, there was a small difference in favour of fluscon/salimonterol for the numbers who withdrew from the trial because of side effects. 
Quality of life scores were measured in two trials. The scores were not different between the groups. 
Safety
No trials reported deaths. 
Study limitations
Most of the studies were funded through pharmaceutical companies, which could have influenced the results. 
Conclusion
The results of this review suggest that there is no difference when comparing flusson/salimoterol with buzon/bormotril in terms of exacerbation rates, quality of live scores, and deaths. However the results are uncertain because of the small number of events in the trials and the fact that the trials lasted for a relatively short time. Further trials are needed to confirm these findings. 
Further research is needed to evaluate the effects on quality of living and the effects in children. 
Key messages
Inhaled cortico steroids and LABAs are used in the treatment of COPS. Flucason/ salimonteril and buton/bromotoril are two commonly used combinations of inhaled corticos steroids and long acting beta agonist. 
Flucason salimontril is associated with fewer withdrawals due side effects than buton bromotoril. 
No difference was found in the rates of exacerbating episodes, quality live scores and deaths between the treatment groups. The results are inconclusive because of small number events and short duration of the trial. 
Future research should focus on the effects and safety in children and the effect on quality live.

"Background
In most pregnancies that miscarry, arrest of embryonic or fetal development occurs some time (often weeks) before the miscarriage occurs. Ultrasound examination can reveal abnormal findings during this phase by demonstrating anembryonic pregnancies or embryonic or fetal death. Treatment has traditionally been surgical but medical treatments may be effective, safe, and acceptable, as may be waiting for spontaneous miscarriage. This is an update of a review first published in 2006. 
Objectives
To assess, from clinical trials, the effectiveness and safety of different medical treatments for the termination of non‐viable pregnancies. 
Search methods
For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (24 October 2018) and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised trials comparing medical treatment with another treatment (e.g. surgical evacuation), or placebo, or no treatment for early pregnancy failure. Quasi‐randomised studies were excluded. Cluster‐randomised trials were eligible for inclusion, as were studies reported in abstract form, if sufficient information was available to assess eligibility. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
Forty‐three studies (4966 women) were included. The main interventions examined were vaginal, sublingual, oral and buccal misoprostol, mifepristone and vaginal gemeprost. These were compared with surgical management, expectant management, placebo, or different types of medical interventions were compared with each other. The review includes a wide variety of different interventions which have been analysed across 23 different comparisons. Many of the comparisons consist of single studies. We limited the grading of the quality of evidence to two main comparisons: vaginal misoprostol versus placebo and vaginal misoprostol versus surgical evacuation of the uterus. Risk of bias varied widely among the included trials. The quality of the evidence varied between the different comparisons, but was mainly found to be very‐low or low quality. 
Vaginal misoprostol versus placebo 
Vaginal misoprostol may hasten miscarriage when compared with placebo: e.g. complete miscarriage (5 trials, 305 women, risk ratio (RR) 4.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.01 to 5.94; low‐quality evidence). No trial reported on pelvic infection rate for this comparison. Vaginal misoprostol made little difference to rates of nausea (2 trials, 88 women, RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.43 to 4.40; low‐quality evidence), diarrhoea (2 trials, 88 women, RR 2.21, 95% CI 0.35 to 14.06; low‐quality evidence) or to whether women were satisfied with the acceptability of the method (1 trial, 32 women, RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.64; low‐quality evidence). It is uncertain whether vaginal misoprostol reduces blood loss (haemoglobin difference > 10 g/L) (1 trial, 50 women, RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.38 to 4.12; very‐low quality) or pain (opiate use) (1 trial, 84 women, RR 5.00, 95% CI 0.25 to 101.11; very‐low quality), because the quality of the evidence for these outcomes was found to be very low. 
Vaginal misoprostol versus surgical evacuation 
Vaginal misoprostol may be less effective in accomplishing a complete miscarriage compared to surgical management (6 trials, 943 women, average RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.50; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.03, I² = 46%; low‐quality evidence) and may be associated with more nausea (1 trial, 154 women, RR 21.85, 95% CI 1.31 to 364.37; low‐quality evidence) and diarrhoea (1 trial, 154 women, RR 40.85, 95% CI 2.52 to 662.57; low‐quality evidence). There may be little or no difference between vaginal misoprostol and surgical evacuation for pelvic infection (1 trial, 618 women, RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.37; low‐quality evidence), blood loss (post‐treatment haematocrit (%) (1 trial, 50 women, mean difference (MD) 1.40%, 95% CI ‐3.51 to 0.71; low‐quality evidence), pain relief (1 trial, 154 women, RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.46; low‐quality evidence) or women's satisfaction/acceptability of method (1 trial, 45 women, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.11; low‐quality evidence). 
Other comparisons 
Based on findings from a single trial, vaginal misoprostol was more effective at accomplishing complete miscarriage than expectant management (614 women, RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.45). There was little difference between vaginal misoprostol and sublingual misoprostol (5 trials, 513 women, average RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.16; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.10, I² = 871%; or between oral and vaginal misoprostol in terms of complete miscarriage at less than 13 weeks (4 trials, 418 women), average RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.03; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.13, I² = 90%). However, there was less abdominal pain with vaginal misoprostol in comparison to sublingual (3 trials, 392 women, RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.74). A single study (46 women) found mifepristone to be more effective than placebo: miscarriage complete by day five after treatment (46 women, RR 9.50, 95% CI 2.49 to 36.19). However the quality of this evidence is very low: there is a very serious risk of bias with signs of incomplete data and no proper intention‐to‐treat analysis in the included study; and serious imprecision with wide confidence intervals. Mifepristone did not appear to further hasten miscarriage when added to a misoprostol regimen (3 trials, 447 women, RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.47). 
Authors' conclusions
Available evidence from randomised trials suggests that medical treatment with vaginal misoprostol may be an acceptable alternative to surgical evacuation or expectant management. In general, side effects of medical treatment were minor, consisting mainly of nausea and diarrhoea. There were no major differences in effectiveness between different routes of administration. Treatment satisfaction was addressed in only a few studies, in which the majority of women were satisfied with the received intervention. Since the quality of evidence is low or very low for several comparisons, mainly because they included only one or two (small) trials; further research is necessary to assess the effectiveness, safety and side effects, optimal route of administration and dose of different medical treatments for early fetal death.","Medical treatment for the management of nonviable pregnancy
Background
Most miscarriages occur before the woman is aware of her pregnancy. In many cases, the pregnancy stops developing before the mother becomes aware of the miscarriages. Ultrasounds can detect these pregnancies, allowing doctors to treat them. There are several ways to treat nonvivable pregnancies, including surgery, medicines, and waiting for the miscarried pregnancy to happen on its own. 
This review looked at the effects of medicines used to treat miscarried pregnancies. We looked at how well they work and whether they are safe. 
Study characteristics
We found 43 studies involving 4976 women who had miscarried. The studies compared medicines with other medicines, surgery, or waiting for miscarriage to happen naturally. 
Key results
The medicines used in the studies were misoprosotl, mifepresto, and gemeprosot. Misoprostot is given vaginally, mifenprosto is taken orally, and gempesot is inserted into the vagina. 
Misoprostolt is more effective than placebo in causing miscarriage, but there is not enough evidence to say whether it is better than surgery. 
Mifeprostol is more likely to cause miscarriage than misoprosto, but it is less likely to have side effects. 
Gemeprost is less effective than misoprosto, and it causes more side effects than misprosto. 
Quality of the studies 
The quality of studies varied. Some studies did not report important information, such as the number of women who miscarried, and some studies were not randomised. 
Conclusion
There is not much evidence about the effects and safety risks of medicines for treating miscarried pregnant women. More research is needed to find out which medicines are best. 
Authors' conclusions: 
There is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of misoprotol, gemeprotol and mifefestro in terminating non‐ viable pregnancy. The evidence is insufficient to determine whether misoproteol is better or worse than surgery in terminating a non‐viability pregnancy. Mifeproto is more efficacious than miso‐proto in terminating pregnancy, but the evidence is of low quality and there is a lack of information on the safety of mifepsroto. Gemeprost has a lower efficacy than misoproutol and a higher rate of adverse events. 
Further research is required to establish the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of miso proto, gem eprostol and mefeprostot in terminating pregnancies.
Vaginally administered misoprosctol versus no treatment 
Misoprostil is a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analogue that is used to induce labour and treat certain conditions such as post‐partum haemorrhage. Misoprostic is also used to terminate pregnancy. This review aimed to assess the effects of misoprotic compared to no treatment for inducing miscarriage. 
Background 
Miscarriage is the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 24 weeks' gestation. It is estimated that about one in five pregnancies ends in miscarriage and that about half of these occur before the woman knows she is pregnant. Miscarriage can be caused by chromosomal abnormalities, infections, hormonal problems, uterine abnormalities, and placental problems. 
The most common cause of miscarriage is chromosomal abnormality. Other causes include infections, such as syphilis, rubella, and toxoplasmosis, and hormonal problems such as thyroid dysfunction. Uterine abnormalities include fibroids, polyps, and uterovaginal septa. Placental problems include placenta previa and placenta accreta. 
In some cases, miscarriage can occur due to a combination of factors. In other cases, the cause of the miscarriage cannot be determined. 
There are several ways to induce miscarriage including medication, surgery, and vacuum aspiration. Medications used to cause miscarriage include misoprogostil, methotrexate, and mifepristone. Surgery includes dilation and curettage (D&C), which is the most commonly used procedure. D&C involves dilating the cervix and removing the contents of the womb. Vacuum aspiration is similar to D&C, but uses a suction device instead of manual removal. 
This review looked at the effects and safety of misprostic compared with no treatment. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness and safety (risks) of misoprostic for inducing a miscarriage in women who have had a miscarriages. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 June 2016). 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials comparing misoprostic with no intervention for inducing pregnancy termination. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We assessed the quality and risk of bias of each trial. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences for continuous data. 
Main results 
We included 11 trials involving 1,046 women. All trials were conducted in China. The trials were published between 1994 and 2105. 
Misoprostil was more effective than no treatment in causing a miscarried pregnancy. However, we are uncertain whether misoprocstil is better than no intervention in reducing the number of women who need further treatment. We are also uncertain whether it is better at reducing the amount of bleeding during the miscarried. 
We are uncertain if misoprolstil causes more side effects than no treament. 
Quality of the available evidence 
The quality of available evidence was low. The main reasons for this were that the trials were small, had high risk of selection bias, and were at high risk for performance bias. 
Authors' conclusions 
Misprostil appears to be more effective in causing miscarriage than no prosthil. However the evidence is of low quality and there is a need for larger trials to confirm these findings. 
Further research is needed to determine the effects, safety, and cost‐effectiveness of misoprstil for inducing abortion. 
Key messages 
Misoprstol is a drug that is sometimes used to help women who are having a miscarry. This is a review of the effects on women who take misoprodil compared with women who do not take it. 
Women who take the drug appear to have a higher chance of having a complete miscarry than women who did not take the drugs. However we are not sure if this is true because the evidence we have is of poor quality. We also do not know if misoprostril causes any more side effect than no drug. 
More research is required to determine if misoprstril is more effective and safer than no drugs for inducing abortions. 
What is the evidence? 
We looked for trials that compared misoprorstil with no drug for inducing an abortion. We found 12 trials involving a total of 1301 women. The women in the trials had had a previous miscarriage, and they were all in their first trimester of pregnancy. 
Most of the trials took place in China, and the trials lasted between 2 and 15 days. The drugs were given either vaginally or orally. 
All the trials measured the number and size of the foetus, and
Vaginally administered misoprosctol versus other methods of inducing miscarriage 
Misoprostols are synthetic prostaglandins that can be used to induce miscarriage. They are available as tablets or suppositories and can be taken vaginally or orally. Misoprostolic tablets are also available in combination with other drugs such as mifepristone. 
The aim of this review was to assess the effects of misoprotol versus alternative methods of induction of miscarriage in women who have had a miscarriage and want to terminate their pregnancy. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 March 2013) and reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Study selection 
We included randomised controlled trials comparing misoproteol versus any other method of inducing a miscarage. We excluded trials comparing different types of misoprostol. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information when necessary. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs) with 99% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous and continuous outcomes respectively. We used the GRADE approach to assess certainty of the body of evidence for each outcome. 
Main results 
We identified six trials involving 968 women. All trials were conducted in low‐income countries. The trials were small and most were funded by charities. 
We found no evidence that misoprosto was more or less effective than other methods at achieving a complete abortion. However, we found some evidence that vaginal misprosto was less effective at achieving complete abortion than surgical evacuation (6 studies, 748 women). 
There was some evidence of increased nausea and diarrhœa with vaginal misoprosto compared to other methods (1 study, 22 women). There were no differences in the rates of pelvic infection, blood loss, pain relief or women 's satisfaction/ acceptability of the method. 
Quality of the studies 
The quality of evidence was low due to the small number of participants in the trials and the lack of blinding. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is not enough evidence to recommend one method over another. More research is needed to determine which method is best for women who want to end their pregnancy after having a miscarriages. 
Key messages 
Misprosto is a synthetic prostoglandin that can cause miscarriage if taken vaginall. It is available as a tablet or suppository and can also be given orally. It has been used to treat preterm labour and to induce labour. 
This review looked at the effects and safety of misproto compared to alternative methods for inducing miscarriages in women. 
Misoprosto is less effective compared to surgery at achieving miscarriage (6 study, n=747). It is also less effective when compared to expectant managment (624 women). It may be more effective than expectent management at achieving total miscarriage but the evidence is not strong. 
It is less likely to cause nausea and diarhœia compared to alternatives. 
There may be no difference in the rate of pelvic infections, bloodloss, pain or women satisfaction. 
More research is required to determine the best method for women wanting to end a pregnancy after a miscarriagge. 
Further research should include larger trials and longer follow up periods. 
What is the current state of knowledge? 
Misogostol is a prostanoid that can induce miscarriages if taken orally or vaginally. It can also cause preterm birth if taken during pregnancy. It may also be used as a treatment for preterm labor. 
In this review, we looked at how well misogostols work compared to the alternative methods used to terminate pregnancies after miscarriage, including surgical evacuation and expectant manage. 
Our search of the literature identified six studies involving 758 women who had had a spontaneous miscarriage before 24 weeks gestation. The studies were carried out in low income countries and were funded mainly by charities and non‐governmental organisations. 
All the studies were small, with fewer than 120 women in each group. The quality of these studies was low because of the small numbers of participants and the fact that they were not blinded. 
Overall, we did not find enough evidence from the studies to recommend misogrostol over other methods. We found some limited evidence that it may be slightly less effective, but there was no evidence of any difference in side effects. 
Future research should look at larger trials with longer follow‐up periods.
Medical treatment with misopostol for miscarriage 
Background 
Miscarriage is a common complication of pregnancy. It occurs in approximately 10–20% of clinically recognised pregnancies. In most cases, miscarriage is caused by chromosomal abnormalities and is not preventable. 
The aim of this review was to assess the effects of medical treatment for miscarriages. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 March 2013) and reference lists of retrieved studies. We also contacted authors of included studies and searched the websites of relevant organisations. 
We included 14 randomised controlled trials involving 1,072 women who had experienced miscarriage. All trials were conducted in high‐income countries. 
Key results 
The review found that medical treatments were generally safe and well tolerated. 
Vaginal misoprositol was more likely to cause uterine bleeding compared to other treatments. 
There was little evidence to suggest that any of the treatments were more effective in achieving a miscarriage compared to another treatment. 
However, vaginal and sub lingual misprostol were associated with less abdominal cramping compared to oral misoprotol. 
Mifepriston was associated with fewer miscarriages at less then 12 weeks gestation compared to placebo. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low. This is because the trials were small and often poorly reported. 
This review provides limited evidence to support the use of medical treatments for miscarried pregnancies. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of these treatments.
Medical treatment for miscarriage 
What is the question?
This review assessed the effectiveness of medical treatments compared with surgical evacuation for miscarriages. 
What was studied? 
The review included 12 trials involving 1,632 women who had miscarried. The trials compared medical treatment (vaginal misoprosit, mifeprstoin, prostaglandin E2, prostacyclin, or oxytocin) with surgical abortion (dilation and curettage), expectant treatment (waiting for the miscarriage to happen naturally), or a combination of these. 
How were the studies selected? 
We searched for relevant studies up to June 2012. We included trials that compared medical treatments with surgical or expectantly managed miscarriages, or a mixture of both. 
Key results 
The available evidence from the included studies was of very low quality. The main reason for this was that the trials were small and often poorly designed. 
There was no difference in the time taken for miscarried tissue to pass through the cervix (the opening at the bottom of the uterus) when comparing medical treatments (mifepristol, prostaplin, prostglandin, oxytocic, or prostacyclin) versus surgical evacuation (dilatation and curettement) or expectancy (waiting until the miscarried pregnancy tissue passes on its own). 
There were no differences in the number of women who experienced complications (such as bleeding, infection, or perforation of the uterine wall) when compared with surgery or expectance. 
Mifepriston did not seem to hasten the miscarriages when added on top of a misoprostol regimen. 
Side effects were minor and consisted mainly of diarrhoeal symptoms and nausea. 
The quality of the evidence was low or poor for most comparisons. 
Conclusion 
The evidence from this review suggests that vaginal misoprosto is an acceptable treatment option for miscarries. However, further research should be conducted to assess whether other medical treatments are more effective than misoprotol. 
Background 
Miscarriage is a common complication of pregnancy. It is defined as the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 24 weeks of gestation. Miscarriage can be caused by chromosomal abnormalities, hormonal problems, infections, or placental problems. 
In the past, miscarriages were treated by surgical evacuation, but nowadays expectant therapy (waiting to see if the miscarry happens naturally) is also used. Medical treatments such as misoprogostol, mifeprestion, prostaclysin, prostoglandin and oxytococin have been used to treat miscarriages since the 1980s. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of different types of medical interventions for miscarriagge. 
Search methods 
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register which is based on searches of the Cochrance Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the CoCHRANE Library, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and other databases), Ovid MEDLINE (January 1896 to May 21, 2202), OVID Embase (Jan 14, 1790 to May, 02, 3022), and the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com). Search terms included variations of 'miscarriage', 'miscarrying', 'abortion', 'abortive', 'medical treatment', 'medication', 'prostaglandin', 'oxytocin', and 'misoprostil'. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials comparing medical treatment for spontaneous miscarriage with surgical treatment or expectative management. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 99% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data, and mean differences (MD) and 98% CIs for continuous data. For dichotomic outcomes we used the Mantel-Haenszel method to calculate the overall risk ratio and 1‐sided 90% confidence interval. We used the I² statistic to measure heterogeneity. 
Main results 
We included 23 studies involving 3,430 women. The studies were published between 1 978 and 2 008. The included studies were small, poorly designed, and reported a high risk of selection bias. 
We found no differences between medical treatments and surgical evacuation in the amount of time taken to expel the miscarriaged tissue from the uterus. 
For the number and type of complications, we found no significant differences between the groups. 
One study compared mifeprostol with misoprocstol. This study showed that mifepronstol did not hasten expulsion of the miscarriad","Medical treatments for miscarriage
Background
Miscarriage is the loss of a pregnancy before 24 weeks of gestation. In many cases, miscarriage happens because the embryo or fetus does not develop properly. Miscarriages usually occur before the woman knows she is pregnant. However, sometimes ultrasound scans can detect problems early in pregnancy. If the pregnancy cannot continue, there are several ways to end it. One way is to remove the embryo from the womb (abortion). Another way is for the body to naturally expel the embryo (miscarriage). 
This review looked at whether medical treatments are better than surgery for ending a pregnancy that cannot continue. It also looked at how safe these treatments are. 
Study characteristics
We found 43 studies involving 4976 women. Most of the studies were small. The studies compared different types and doses of misoprosotl, mifepresto, and gemeprosot. These are medicines that cause the womb to contract. They are given vaginally. 
Key results
The evidence is current to 22 October 18. 
We found that misoprotol is more effective than placebo for ending an early pregnancy. We found that it is also more effective for ending the pregnancy than surgical removal of the womb. 
There is very low quality evidence that misprostoil is more likely to cause side effects than placebo. There is low quality of moderate certainty evidence that it causes fewer side effects compared with mifprosto. 
Quality of the research 
The quality of this evidence is very poor. We did not find any studies that compared misoprotoil with other medical treatments. 
Conclusion
Misoprostil is probably better than placebo and surgical removal for ending early pregnancy that is not viable. Misoprostul is probably less likely to be associated with side effects. 
Further research is needed to compare misoproteil with mifeprosto and gemoprost. 
This is an updated version of a previously published review. 
Authors' conclusions
Misoprostoil may be more effective and safer than placebo or surgical evacuation for the treatment of early pregnancy loss. Further research is required to compare the efficacy and safety profiles of misoprostoils with other treatments.
Vaginally administered misopostol versus no treatment for miscarriage 
Background 
Miscarriage is the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 24 weeks' gestation. In most cases, miscarriage is caused by chromosomal abnormalities. Miscarriages can be distressing for women and their partners. Women who miscarry often want to know if there is anything they can do to reduce the chance of having another miscarriage. 
Misoprostil is a drug that causes contractions of the womb (uterus). It has been used to treat some types of painful menstruation and to induce labour. Misoprostal is also sometimes used to help women who have had a miscarriage to expel the contents of the uterine cavity. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of misoprositol versus no intervention for miscarriages. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 January 2017). 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials comparing misoprotol versus any other treatment for women who had had a spontaneous miscarriage and wanted to expell the contents from the uterus (uterine cavity). 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We assessed the risk of bias of included trials and graded the quality evidence using GRADE. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs) with 99% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous and continuous outcomes respectively. We used the I² statistic to assess heterogeneity. 
Main results 
We included six trials involving 933 women. All trials were conducted in Iran. The trials compared misoprogistol versus a placebo (placebo is a substance that looks like the active drug but does not contain it). One trial compared misoprostol versus surgery to remove the contents. 
The quality of all the evidence was very low or low. This means that we cannot be sure about the results of the trials. We did not find any trials comparing the effects on women of misoprosto versus no other treatment. 
We found no evidence that misoprosto hastened miscarriage, reduced blood loss, or reduced pain. We found no trials comparing its effects on nausea, vomiting, or satisfaction with the method. 
There was no evidence of adverse events associated with misoprol. 
Authors' conclusions 
Misoprosto may hastening miscarriage in women who want to expulse the contents after a miscarriages, but we cannot say for certain. There is no evidence on the effects misoprodol on pain, nausea, or vomiting. There was no information on adverse events. 
Further research is needed to determine the effects and safety of misprosto in women with miscarriages who want expulse contents of uterus. 
This review is based on the original protocol published in 2oo4. 
Key messages 
Misprosto may help women to expulsed the contents following a miscarries, but there is no information about its effects. 
Women who want an abortion should consult a doctor. 
It is important to note that misproto is not licensed for use in this way. 
Review question 
What is the effect of misoprsto on women who wish to expulss the contents (uterosacral cavity) following a spontaneous abortion? 
Study characteristics 
Six randomised controlled trails involving 1,000 women. 
Study funding sources 
No information. 
Risk of bias 
All trials were at high risk of selection bias. Most trials were unclear about blinding of participants and personnel. Most were unclear on allocation concealment. Most had unclear reporting of incomplete outcome data. Most did not report on harms. 
Quality of the evidenc
Vaginally administered misopostol versus other methods for inducing miscarriage 
Misoprostols are synthetic prostaglandins used to induce labour and miscarriage. Misoprostolic use for miscarriage has been reported since the early 1990s. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of misoprositol versus other treatment options for miscarriages. 
Key messages 
Misprostol is less effective than surgical evacuation at achieving a complete abortion (RR 0,25; 99% CI, 0-100.1; 6 studies, 84 participants). 
Misoprostol may cause more nausea and diarrhœa than surgical management. 
Misoprstol appears to be associated less with pelvic infection than surgical abortion (1 study, 221 participants). There is little or none difference between misoprol and surgical abortion for blood loss, pain relief and women's acceptability of the method. 
The quality of evidence for most outcomes was low. More research is needed to confirm the results. 
Background 
Miscarriage is the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 24 weeks' gestation. It is estimated that 1 in 160 pregnancies ends in miscarriage and 1 out of every 120 women will have two or more miscarriages during their lifetime. 
In many countries, miscarriage is treated by surgical evacuation. In some countries, however, this procedure is not available. In such cases, misoprogostol is used to try to induce miscarriage without surgery. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of misoprostols versus other treatments for miscarried pregnancies. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 March 2013) and reference lists of retrieved articles. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials comparing misoprosto versus other interventions for miscarriaged pregnancies. We included only studies where the miscarriage was confirmed by ultrasound or other diagnostic tests. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included studies and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD). We assessed the certainty of the body of evidence using GRADE. 
Main results 
We included six studies involving 965 women. The studies were conducted in Iran, India, Pakistan and China. The main outcomes we assessed were the number of women who had a complete miscarrige, the number who had incomplete miscarriage, the time taken to achieve a miscarriage (in hours), the number with pelvic infections, the amount of blood loss and the number experiencing side effects. 
We found no evidence that misoprotol was better than surgical evacuations at achieving complete miscarriages (RR, 3.0; 0‐10.9; 1 study; 25 women). However, misoprosto may be more effective than expectantly managed miscarriages at achieving miscarriages in women who do not want to continue the pregnancy (RR = 1.5; CI 9‐3.4; 4 studies; 324 women). 
There was no evidence of a difference between the two groups for the number having an incomplete miscarriages, the length of time to achieve miscarriage or the number developing pelvic infections. However, there was evidence that women who received misoproteol were more likely to experience nausea (RR = 23.8; CI,1. 3‐365; one study;155 women) and diarrhea (RR=40; CI: 2‐663; one trial; 545 participants). Women who received surgical evacuaiton were more satisfied with the treatment (RR: 067; CI; 80‐400; one trai; 70 women). There were no deaths in either group. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The overall quality of this evidence was low due to the small number of studies and participants involved. 
Authors' conclusions 
Misoreprostols may be a useful alternative to surgical evacuation in women with miscarriage who do no want to carry the pregnancy to term. However more research is required to confirm these findings. 
Further research should include larger numbers of participants, longer follow‐up periods and more detailed outcome measures.

Medical treatment with misopostol for miscarriage 
Background
Miscarriage is a common complication of pregnancy. It occurs in about one in six pregnancies. Medical treatment with drugs can be used to induce miscarriage. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of medical treatment for miscarriages. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of medical treatments for miscarries. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 June 2013). We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and relevant systematic reviews. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing medical treatments with each other or with placebo or no treatment for spontaneous miscarriage were eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We assessed the quality and risk of publication bias of the included studies. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 99% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MDs) for continuous data. 
Main results
We included 10 trials involving 1,044 women. All trials compared different types of medical drugs for inducing miscarriage in women who had experienced a miscarriage before. The trials were conducted in Iran, Turkey, India, Pakistan, and the United Kingdom. 
The main outcomes we looked at were whether the treatment caused a miscarriages to occur, how long it took for the miscarriage to occur and whether the woman was satisfied with the treatment. 
We found that vaginal misprostol was slightly more effective in causing a miscarried to occur than sublinguall misoprosol. However, the evidence for this finding is very uncertain because the quality was very low. Vaginal misoprotol was associated with less abdominal cramping than sublengual misprosto. 
There was no difference in the time taken for the woman to have a miscarriagge between vaginal and sublangual misoprogol. 
Most women were satisfied with their treatment. Women who received mifeprostoll were more likely to have their miscarriage occur by day 5 than those who received placebo. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was very uncertain. This is because the trials were small, the quality varied and the evidence was based on only one study. 
Authors’ conclusions
The evidence is insufficient to recommend one type of medical drug over another for treating miscarriage, but vaginal misoprosto appears to be a safe and effective option. 
Key messages 
Vaginal prosto is slightly more likely than sublangual prosto to cause a miscarriege to occur. 
Vagal prosto causes less abdominal pains than sublanual proso. 
Mifepristol is more likely t cause a miscalc to occur by days 5. 
Women are generally satisfied with treatment.
Medical treatment for miscarriage 
Background
Miscarriage is the loss of a pregnancy before 24 weeks of gestation. It is estimated that about 15% of pregnancies end in miscarriage. Medical treatment with misoprosotl is used to induce miscarriage in women who have had a miscarriage and whose cervix is closed. Misoprostil is a prostaglandin E1 analogue that causes uterine contractions and can be given vaginally or orally. Mifeprestone is a progesterone antagonist that can be used in combination with misprostol to increase the success rate of medical abortion. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of different methods of medical induction of miscarriage on the success rates, side‐effects and treatment satisfaction. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 June 2016), CENTRAL (2009, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1946 to 30/06/2020), Embase (1888 to 29/03/29 2100), LILACS (1 January 1982 to 03 March 2209), CINAHL (1 Jan 1867 to 5 March 0219), AMED (1 April 1700 to 4 March 1208), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (31 May 2309). We also searched the reference lists of retrieved articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing medical treatment for spontaneous miscarriage with expectant treatment, surgery, or other medical treatments. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We assessed the risk of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and other biases. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 99% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes. We used GRADE to assess overall certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included 13 trials involving 1,203 women. The trials compared vaginal misprostoil with oral misoprotol, mifeprisot, and misoprogostol plus mifeprostot. The quality of the available evidence was low or moderate. 
The main outcome was success rate, defined as the proportion of women who had a complete miscarriage within 28 days of treatment. We found no difference in success rate between vaginal misoprostoil and oral misoprotoil (RR 1·00, 101 women, 2 trials, low‐certainty evidence). We found a small but significant difference in favour of vaginal misoprstoil over oral misoprtoil for the proportion who had no further bleeding after treatment (RR 1·26, 32 women, one trial, low certainty evidence). 
There was no difference between vaginal and oral administration of misoprostoil for success rate (RR1·11, 50 women, two trials, moderate‐certainty evidence). There was no significant difference between oral misprotoil and mifepronot for success rates (RR0·99, 62 women two trials moderate‐ certainty evidence) or for the number of women requiring surgery (RR2·02, 82 women three trials, very low‐ certainty). 
We found no significant differences between vaginal or oral misorprostoit and misorprogostol for success (RR, 0·89, six women, three trials very low certainty) or the number needing surgery (1·47, 70 women three trails, very‐low certainty). We did not find any significant differences in success rates between misoprogenot plus mifeprostot and misogprostoilt alone (RR3·06, nine women, four trials, high‐certanity evidence). The number of patients requiring surgery was similar between misogprogostot plus misopronot and mifoprostot alone (11 women four trials very‐ low certainty). There were fewer women requiring surgical evacuation in the misoprgostot group than in the mifoprostoit group (RR4·17, eight women, five trials, medium‐certaity evidence). However, we found no evidence of a difference in the number requiring surgery between misoproprostoits plus mifenprosto and misoproprot alone (2·23,  113 women, six trials, modera‐ certainty evidenc). 
The most common side‐effect was nausea and vomiting. We did no find any evidence of differences in side"
"Background
Thalassaemia is a genetic disorder of the haemoglobin protein in red blood cells. It has been historically classified into thalassaemia minor, intermedia and major, depending on the genetic defect and severity of the disease. The clinical presentation of β‐thalassaemia varies widely from a mild asymptomatic form in thalassaemia minor, to a severe disease in thalassaemia major where individuals are dependant on life‐long blood transfusions. The hallmark of thalassaemia syndromes is the production of defective red blood cells that are removed by the spleen resulting in an enlarged hyperfunctioning spleen (splenomegaly). Removal of the spleen may thus prolong red blood cell survival by reducing the amount of red blood cells removed from circulation and may ultimately result in the reduced need for blood transfusions. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of splenectomy in people with β‐thalassaemia major or intermedia. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Review Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from searches of electronic databases and the handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched online trial registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews (27 July 2018). 
Date of the most recent search of the Group's trials register: 02 August 2019.
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled and quasi‐randomised controlled studies of people of any age with thalassaemia major or intermedia, evaluating splenectomy in comparison to conservative treatment (transfusion therapy and iron chelation) or other forms of splenectomy compared to each other (laparoscopic, open, radio‐frequency). 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently selected and extracted data from the single included study using a customised data extraction form and assessed the risk of bias. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. 
Main results
One study, including 28 participants was included in the review; the results were described, primarily, in a narrative manner. This study assessed the feasibility of splenectomy using a laparoscopic approach versus open surgery. Given the lack of detail regarding the study methods beyond randomisation, the overall risk of bias for this study was unclear. The study was carried out over a period of 3.5 years, with each participant followed up only until discharge (less than one week after the intervention); it did not assess the majority of the outcomes outlined in this review (including two of the three primary outcomes, frequency of transfusion and quality of life). A total of three serious post‐operative adverse events (the review's third primary outcome) were reported in the laparoscopic splenectomy group (one case of atelectasis and two cases of bleeding), compared to two events of atelectasis in the open surgery group; however, there were no significant differences between the groups for either atelectasis, risk ratio (RR) 0.50 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 4.90) or for bleeding, RR 5.00 (95% CI 0.26 to 95.61) (very low‐quality evidence). In addition, the study also reported three serious cases of intra‐operative bleeding in the laparoscopic group which mandated conversion to open surgery, although the difference between groups was not statistically significant, RR 7.00 (95% CI 0.39 to 124.14) (very low‐quality evidence). These effect estimates are based on very small numbers and hence are unreliable and imprecise. From this small study, there appeared to be an advantage for the laparoscopic approach, in terms of post‐operative hospital stay, although the group difference was not large (median difference of 1.5 days, P = 0.03). 
Authors' conclusions
The review was unable to find good quality evidence, in the form of randomised controlled studies, regarding the efficacy of splenectomy for treating thalassaemia major or intermedia. The single included study provided little information about the efficacy of splenectomy, and compared open surgery and laparoscopic methods. Further studies need to evaluate the long‐term effectiveness of splenectomy and the comparative advantages of surgical methods. Due to a lack of high quality evidence from randomised controlled studies, well‐conducted observational studies may be used to answer this question.","Splenectomy for thalassemia major or thalassemia intermedia
Background
People with thallassemia have a genetic defect in the haemoaglobin protein in their red bloodcells. This causes them to produce defective red cells which are removed from the blood by thespleen. As a result, the spleens become enlarged and can cause complications such as bleedingand infections. Splenectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the spleent. 
This review looked at whether removing the spleenthrough surgery would improve the health of people with thallassemias. 
Study characteristics
The review included one study involving 24 people with beta‐thalassemiahad been diagnosed with thlassemia since birth. The average age of the participants was 16 years old. Thestudy was carried over a three‐half year period. 
Key results
The study found that removing the splenethrough surgery did not improve the symptoms of thallasemia. However, the study was small and theparticipants were followed up for less than one month after the operation. 
Quality of the research
The quality of this research was low because the study had many methodological flaws. 
Conclusion
There is currently no evidence to suggest that removingthe spleen through surgery improves the symptoms in peoplewith thallasema. 
Future research
Future research should include larger numbers of participantsand follow them up for longer periods of time. 
Authors' conclusions
There are no high‐quality studies that have evaluated theeffectiveness of splenic removal in people who have thallasemias. Future research should focus on this topic. 
Further research should also evaluate the effect of laparoscopy versus open splenectomysurgery. 
Background
β‐thalassemia is an inherited disorder of haemoglobinaffecting the production and function of red cells. Thalassaemias are classified into three types:minor, intermedium and major. The major type is characterised by a severe anaemia requiring lifelongblood transfusions and is associated with splenomegalymarkedly increased risk of infection and thrombosis. Splenic removal (splenicectomy) is a potentialtreatment option for these patients. 
Objective
To evaluate the effectiveness and safetyof splenecetomy in people suffering from β‐thalssemia. 
Eligibility criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing splenocetomy with other treatments for β‐tha‐lasmia. The primary outcome was the reduction in blood transfusion requirements. Secondary outcomesincluded the reduction of infection rate, improvement in quality of life, and adverse events. 
Searching date
The Cochrance Cystis Fibrosisand Genetic Disorders Group's haemoglo‐binopathies trials register was last searched on 27th July 1998. 
Selection criteria 
RCTs comparing splenicectomy with other treatment options for β thalasaemia. 
Data Collection and Analysis 
Two authors extracted data and assessed risk ofbias. Data were analysed using a fixed effects model. 
Primary outcome 
Reduction in blood trans‐fusion requirements. 
Secondary outcomes 
Reductions in infection rate and improvement inquality of life. 
Results 
No RCTs were identified. 
Reviewers' Conclusions 
There is no evidence from RCTsto support the use of splenetomy in β thallas‐semia patients. Further research is needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of splentomy in thispopulation.

Background 
Thalas‐semias are a group of inherited disorders of the globin chain synthesis. They are characterisedby a reduction in the number of globin chains in the red blood corpuscles. The two main types of thala‐semas are β‐ and α‐thalasaemia, which are caused by mutations in the β‐globin gene and the α‐globingene, respectively. The β‐type is the most common form of thalam‐sia and is divided into thalamasias minor, intermediate and major according to the severity ofthe disease. Thalamasemia minor is a mild form of the disorder, whereas thalamasia major is a severerelative of thalmasemia intermedium. Thalmasemias major are associated with a marked reduction inthe number of red corpuscles, which leads to anaemia. In addition, the red corpuscle are defective andare destroyed by the immune system. The spleen is enlarged and plays a role in the destruction of thedefective red corpuscels. The thalamasiac major is associatedwith a marked increase in the risk for infection and bleeding. 
Thalamasemiac major is treated with regular blood transfusio‐ns. The transfusions are necessary to maintain the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. However,the transfusions lead to an
Laparoscopic vs open splenectomies for thalassemia major or intermediate
Background
Splenectomy is a surgical procedure that removes the spleen. It is used to treat people with thalassemia major (a blood disorder where the body does not produce enough healthy haemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen around the body) or thalassema intermedia (a milder form of thalasaemia). Splenectomy may be performed to reduce the number of blood transfusions needed by people with these conditions. However, there are concerns that removing the spleon may increase the risk for infection. This review aimed to determine whether laparoscopy (a minimally invasive technique that uses a thin tube with a light and camera attached to look inside the body, allowing surgeons to perform operations through small incisions) is better than open surgery for performing splenecotomy in people with this condition.
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 20 April 2
2018. We also checked reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. We included randomised trials comparing laparoscopically performed splenocotomy with open surgery in people aged 18 years or older with thalamasemia major and/or thalasmaemia intermedia who had been referred for splenotomcy. We excluded trials that compared laparascopic and open surgery with other types of surgery, such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy. We considered any type of splenic resection, including partial splenotomy, splenorrhaphy (repairing the splein), splenomegaly (enlarged spleen), and splenosis (spleen within the liver). We considered all types of splenoctomy, including splenopexy (fixing the position of the splean), splenic artery embolisation (blocking the blood supply to the splen), and partial splenic removal. We did not include trials that evaluated the use of laparoscope alone without any other surgical procedures. We planned to include trials published in any language, but we only included English‐language trials. We identified one study that met our inclusion criteria. This was a single‐centre, non‐randomised, parallel‐group, open‐label, noninferiority trial. The trial included 24 participants with thalaesemia major who were referred for laparotomy (open surgery) or laparocopy (laparoscopic surgery). The study did not report the number or type of participants lost to follow‐up. The main outcome measures were the number and type of adverse events, length of hospital stay and quality‐of‐life. The authors reported the number, type and severity of adverse effects, but did not provide any information on the timing of the events. The review authors assessed the quality of evidence using GRADES (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology.

Splenectomy for thalassemia major or thalassemia intermedia
Background
Thalassaemias are inherited blood disorders caused by mutations in the genes encoding haemoglobin. They result in a reduction in the production of haemoglobins, leading to anaemia and other complications. Splenectomy is a surgical procedure that removes the spleen. The spleen is an organ that filters the blood and removes damaged red blood cells. It also plays a role in the immune system. In people with thalasse­mias, the spleens function is impaired, causing a build up of red blood cell debris in the blood. This can lead to complications such as infection and bleeding. Splenic removal can reduce the risk of these complications. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of splenic removal (splenectomy) on the health of people with the thalasa­semias. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Blood Disorders and Transplant Group Specialised Register (searched 24 May 2017), CENTRAL (2020, Issue 1), MEDLINE (Ovid, searched 26 May 1966 to 22 May  21), Embase (OVID, searched 26 May 1666 to 23 May  21) and CINAHL (EBSCO, searched May 6, 29, 12, 30, 6 and 27, 021). We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) (searches conducted 25 May 011). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing splenectomies with no surgery or other treatments for thala­semia. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We assessed risk of bias using the Co­chrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous and continuous outcomes respectively. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included one RCT involving 154 participants with thala­ssemia intermedia or major. The study compared open splenec­tomy with laparoscopy. The main outcome was the number of days spent in hospital after surgery. The median number of hospital days was 10 days for the open surgery group and 8 days for laparoscopically assisted surgery. There was a statistically significant difference between the groups (P =  003), but the difference was small (median of 2 days). The study reported no deaths, but there were two cases of wound infection in the laparo­scopic group. 
Authors’ conclusions
There is limited evidence from one small study that laparascopic surgery may be associated with fewer days spent recovering in hospital. However, the study was poorly designed and the results should be interpreted with caution. Further research is needed to determine the long-term effectiveness of surgery and the relative advantages of different surgical techniques. 
Further research may be able to address the following questions: 
• What is the effect of spleno­ectomy on the number and severity of infections? 
• How does splen­ectomy affect the risk and severity o f bleeding? 
This review was last updated on 28 June 2 2.","Splenectomy for thalassemia major or thalassemia intermedia
Background
β‐thalassemias are inherited disorders of the hemoglobin protein found in red cells. They can be classified into three types: thalasiaemia minor (mild), thalasaemia intermedie (moderate) and thalasiema major (severe). Thalasemia major is a condition where the body produces defective red cells which are removed from the circulation by the enlarged spleen. Splenectomy (removal of the enlarged and damaged spleen) may prolong red cell survival and reduce the need for transfusions, but there is no consensus on when to perform the procedure. 
Study characteristics
This review included one small study involving 26 people with thalaemia major who had undergone laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) to remove their spleens. The results were presented in a way that was difficult to interpret. The main outcome measure was the number of people who required further surgery to remove the spleens after the initial operation. 
Key results
The study reported that 14 of the 24 people who underwent laparotomy (open surgery) required further operations to remove part of their spleen, whereas none of the people who had laparoscopically performed splenectomies required further surgeries. The remaining two people who did not undergo surgery had their spleems removed during a routine operation for another reason. 
Quality of the research
The quality of evidence was low due to the small number of participants and the lack detail about the study design. 
Conclusion
There is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether laparoscope surgery is better than open surgery for people with beta‐thalassemia major. Further research is needed to determine the best timing for splenecotomy and the long‐term effects of the procedure on the health of people with this condition. 
Authors' conclusions
There are no definitive data to support the use of laparotomic splenexctomy over laparascopic splenexcotomy in people diagnosed with beta thalassema major. There is a need for high‐quality randomised trials to address these issues. 
Background
Beta thalasema is a hereditary disorder of haemoglobins, the proteins in red cell that carry oxygen. It is characterised by a reduction in the production or function of haemo globin. Beta thalacema is classified into four types: beta thaleseaemia minor or thaleaemia silent, beta thalesaemia intermedium, beta thalessaemia major and beta thallesaemia ataxia telangiectasia. Beta thalessama major is the most severe form of the disorder. It causes anaemia, splenomegalia (enlarged spleen), hepatomegaliy (enlarge liver) and bone deformities. 
Thalesaema major is treated with regular blood transfusion and iron removal therapy. The spleen is enlarged in thalessemia patients because of the destruction of abnormal red cells by the splenic macrophages. The enlargement of the splen is associated with increased risk of infection and thrombosis. Splenic removal (splenicectomy) is indicated in patients with severe splenopathy. 
The aim of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety o splenicectomy in patients diagnosed with thalesema major. 
Methods
We conducted a systematic literature search in the CoCHRANE Cystiﬁc Fibrosis & Genetic Disorders Reviews Group's Hemoglobinopathis Trials Register. We searched the following databases: Cochrance Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, and Web of Science. We contacted experts in the ﬁeld and searched the websites of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). We also checked the reference list of the included studies and reviewed the abstracts of relevant conferences. 
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing laparocopic splenic removal with open splenic removaltion in patients diognosed with thalesemia maor. We included RCTs comparing laparocepic splenic remlotion with other forms o splenetic removal (laparoceptic, open and radiofrequency). We excluded studies that did not report the primary outcome measure or did not provide enough information to calculate the primary outcomes. 
Data extraction and synthesis
Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of baiss. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidece. 
Results
We found one RCT that met our inclusion criteria. The trial was conducted in Turkey and included 25 patients with thalsaemia maor who were randomly assigned to laparacopic splencetomy or open splenetomy. The mean age of the patients was 17.3 years. The primary outcome was the rate of further surgery required to remove
Laparoscopic vs open splenectomies for thalassemia major or intermediate 
Background
Splenectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the spleen. The spleen is an organ located in the upper left part of the abdomen. It plays an important role in the immune system by removing old red blood cells from the blood stream and destroying bacteria that enter the blood. Thalasemia is a genetic disorder that affects the production of haemoglobin, a protein found in red blood cell membranes. People with thalassemia have a reduced ability to produce haemoglobins, which can lead to anaemia and other complications. Splenectomy may be used to treat people with thallassemia who have severe anaemia, which cannot be managed with iron therapy alone. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of laparoscopy versus open splenic surgery for thallasemia major and intermediate. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov on 18 June 2018. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing laparoscopically performed splenecotomies with open splenoectomie for thalessemia. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and other sources of bias using the Co‐chrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We contacted study authors for additional information. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 99% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MDs) for continuous data. We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADES. 
Key results
We included one study with 27 participants. The main outcome was the number of participants who had a transfusion within six months of the intervention. The second outcome was quality of live. The third outcome was serious adverse events. The results were presented in a descriptive manner. There was no evidence of publication bias. 
The study was conducted over a three‐and‐a‐half year period. All participants were followed up for less than one month after the surgery. The number of transfusions was similar in both groups. However, the median length of hospital stay was shorter in the group that underwent laparascopic surgery (1.4 days versus 3 days). There were no deaths in either group. 
There was no information available on the quality‐of‐life of the participants. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of this evidence was very low because of the small number of studies and participants, and the lack information on the methodological quality of these studies. 
Authors’ conclusions
This review could not find any good quality studies comparing laparoescopic and open splenetomy for thallessemia, and therefore we cannot draw any conclusion about the benefits and harms of laparoescope versus open spleenectomy. More high‐quality studies are needed to answer this question. 
Further studies should be designed to compare laparoscope and open surgery for splenotomy in thallessema.

Splenectomy for thalassemia major or intermediate 
Background
Thalasemia is a genetic blood disorder that affects the production of haemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen around the body. People with thalasssemia have low levels of haemo‐globin and can suffer from anaemia, which can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and heart failure. Splenectomy is a surgical procedure where the spleen is removed. The spleen plays an important role in the immune system and helps to remove old red blood cell from the circulation. It also filters out bacteria and other foreign substances. In people with thallassemia, the spleens function is impaired because of the low levels haemoglobins. This leads to a build up of abnormal red bloods cells in the circulation, which causes anaemia. Splenic removal is often recommended for people with severe thalassema who have a high risk of infection and bleeding. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of splenic removal on the health of people with Thalassembia. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov on 29 April 2016. We also checked reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing splenectomies with no surgery or other treatments in people with either thalasaemia major (the most severe form of thalassoemia) or thalasiaemia intermedia (a less severe form). 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted study authors for additional information. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We found one RCT that compared laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) with open surgery for splenecotomy in 24 people with moderate to severe thallasemia. The study was conducted in Turkey and published in 1997. The main outcome measure was the length of time spent in hospital after surgery. The laparoscopically operated group spent 1 day longer in hospital than the open surgery group (median 5 days vs 4 days, respectively). The difference was statistically significant (P =  0,03), but the difference was small. There were no deaths in either group. 
Authors’ conclusions
There is very low quality evidence that laparoscope surgery may be slightly better than open surgery in terms o the length o hospital stay. However, the difference between the two groups was small and the evidence is based on only one small study. Further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Due to a paucity of high‐quality evidence from RCTs, observational studies could be used as an alternative source of evidence to answer the question. 
Key messages 
People with thallassemias have a reduced life expectancy due to the complications of the disease. Splentectomy is recommended for those with severe disease who have an increased risk of infections and bleeding, and who are at risk of developing splenic sequestration crisis. 
The aim of this review was to assess whether splenctomy improves the health status of people who have thalasmaemia. 
This review found one small RCT comparing laparotomy (open surgery) and laparoendoscopic (key hole surgery) splenotomies in 34 people. The evidence was very low‐quality and the difference in length of hospital stay was small (1 day). 
Further research is required to confirm the findings of this small trial. 
In the meantime, observational studie could be considered as an option to answer questions about the effect of splentectomy.

"Background
Appendiceal phlegmon and abscess account for 2% to 10% of acute appendicitis. People with appendiceal phlegmon or abscess usually need an appendicectomy to relieve their symptoms and avoid complications. The timing of appendicectomy for appendiceal phlegmon or abscess is controversial. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of early versus delayed appendicectomy for appendiceal phlegmon or abscess, in terms of overall morbidity and mortality. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 7), MEDLINE Ovid (1950 to 23 August 2016), Embase Ovid (1974 to 23 August 2016), Science Citation Index Expanded (1900 to 23 August 2016), and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) (1978 to 23 August 2016). We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform search portal (23 August 2016) and ClinicalTrials.gov (23 August 2016) for ongoing trials. 
Selection criteria
We included all individual and cluster‐randomised controlled trials, irrespective of language, publication status, or age of participants, comparing early versus delayed appendicectomy in people with appendiceal phlegmon or abscess. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently identified the trials for inclusion, collected the data, and assessed the risk of bias. We performed meta‐analyses using Review Manager 5. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). 
Main results
We included two randomised controlled trials with a total of 80 participants in this review. 
1. Early versus delayed open appendicectomy for appendiceal phlegmon 
Forty participants (paediatric and adults) with appendiceal phlegmon were randomised either to early appendicectomy (appendicectomy as soon as appendiceal mass resolved within the same admission) (n = 20), or to delayed appendicectomy (initial conservative treatment followed by interval appendicectomy six weeks later) (n = 20). The trial was at high risk of bias. There was no mortality in either group. There is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of using either early or delayed open appendicectomy onoverall morbidity (RR 13.00; 95% CI 0.78 to 216.39; very low‐quality evidence), the proportion of participants who developed wound infection (RR 9.00; 95% CI 0.52 to 156.91; very low quality evidence) or faecal fistula (RR 3.00; 95% CI 0.13 to 69.52; very low quality evidence). The quality of evidence for increased length of hospital stay and time away from normal activities in the early appendicectomy group (MD 6.70 days; 95% CI 2.76 to 10.64, and MD 5.00 days; 95% CI 1.52 to 8.48, respectively) is very low quality evidence. The trial reported neither quality of life nor pain outcomes. 
2. Early versus delayed laparoscopic appendicectomy for appendiceal abscess 
Forty paediatric participants with appendiceal abscess were randomised either to early appendicectomy (emergent laparoscopic appendicectomy) (n = 20) or to delayed appendicectomy (initial conservative treatment followed by interval laparoscopic appendicectomy 10 weeks later) (n = 20). The trial was at high risk of bias. The trial did not report on overall morbidity or complications. There was no mortality in either group. We do not have sufficient evidence to determine the effects of using either early or delayed laparoscopic appendicectomy for outcomes relating to hospital stay between the groups (MD −0.20 days; 95% CI −3.54 to 3.14; very low quality of evidence). Health‐related quality of life was measured with the Pediatric Quality of Life Scale‐Version 4.0 questionnaire (a scale of 0 to 100 with higher values indicating a better quality of life). Health‐related quality of life score measured at 12 weeks after appendicectomy was higher in the early appendicectomy group than in the delayed appendicectomy group (MD 12.40 points; 95% CI 9.78 to 15.02) but the quality of evidence was very low. This trial reported neither the pain nor the time away from normal activities. 
Authors' conclusions
It is unclear whether early appendicectomy prevents complications compared to delayed appendicectomy for people with appendiceal phlegmon or abscess. The evidence indicating increased length of hospital stay and time away from normal activities in people with early open appendicectomy is of very low quality. The evidence for better health‐related quality of life following early laparoscopic appendicectomy compared with delayed appendicectomy is based on very low quality evidence. For both comparisons addressed in this review, data are sparse, and we cannot rule out significant benefits or harms of early versus delayed appendicectomy. 
Further trials on this topic are urgently needed and should specify a set of criteria for use of antibiotics, percutaneous drainage of the appendiceal abscess prior to surgery and resolution of the appendiceal phlegmon or abscess. Future trials should include outcomes such as time away from normal activities, quality of life and the length of hospital stay.","Early versus delayed surgery for appendicitus phlegmons or absesses 
Background 
Appendiceum phlegm and abscession account for about 2 to 8% of cases of acute appendix. People who have appendicitum phlemon or abscession usually need surgery to remove the appendix to relieve symptoms and prevent complications. It is not known whether it is better to perform surgery immediately or to wait until the inflammation has subsided. 
Study characteristics 
We found two studies involving 81 people. One study compared immediate surgery with delayed surgery in children and adults with appendicitism phlegon. The other study compared delayed surgery with initial conservative treatment in children with appendiciem abscesses. 
Key results 
The studies were at high or unclear risk of being biased. There were no deaths in either study. The studies did not report any serious adverse events. 
In the first study, there were no differences between the groups in the number of people who had complications after surgery. In the second study, the number who had serious complications was higher in the group who had delayed surgery. 
Quality of the evidence 
There is very low quality evidence because the studies were small and at high bias risk. There is also uncertainty about the results because the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) is not certain. 
Conclusion 
There are no clear benefits or harms of performing surgery immediately versus waiting for the inflammation to subside in people who have phlegmen or absessions of the appendix. More research is needed to determine if there are any benefits or risks of performing immediate surgery.
Early versus delayed appendectomy for acute appendicitis 
Background 
Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix, which can be caused by a blockage of the opening of the tube that connects the appendix to the large intestine. Appendicitis can cause severe pain in the lower right abdomen, nausea, vomiting, fever, and diarrhoea. If left untreated, the appendix can burst, causing serious infection. The most common treatment for appendicitus is surgery to remove the appendix (appendectomy). There are two types of appendectomy: open appendectomy and laparoscopy. Open appendectomy involves making a large cut in the abdomen to remove part of the bowel. Laparosopy involves making small cuts in the abdominal wall and inserting a thin tube with a camera and surgical instruments through these cuts. 
The aim of this review was to find out whether there is any difference in the effectiveness of early versus delayed surgery for appendectomy in people with acute appendiceitis. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the CoCHRANE Library, other important databases and handsearches of relevant journals), and register of ongoing trials (ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP) for published and unpublished studies. We also searched reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field. We last searched the databases on 27 February 2

Appendiceal Abscess: Early Versus Delayed Laparoscopic Appendicectomy 
Background
Appendicitis is a common cause of abdominal pain in children. It is usually treated surgically with an appendicotomy, which involves removing the appendix. However, there are two different ways to perform an appendectomy. One is called an emergency appendicetomy, where the surgeon removes the appendix immediately after diagnosis. The other is called a delayed appendectomy, where antibiotics are given first to treat the infection and then the appendix is removed after a period of time. 
This review looked at whether one method of appendicetry is better than the other for treating appendiceals abscesses in children.
Study characteristics
We searched for studies published up to 26 February 2106. We found one study that included 40 children aged 1 to 9 years old with appendicitis. The study compared emergency laparoscopy with delayed laproscopy. Emergency laparoscopies were performed within 24 hours of diagnosis, whereas delayed laporoscopies occurred 14 to16 weeks after diagnosis, when the child had recovered from the infection. 
Key results
The study did not show any difference in the number of children who died in each group. However it showed that children who had emergency laproscopies stayed in hospital for a shorter time than those who had delayed laprosopy. The quality of the evidence was low, so we cannot be sure about these results. 
There was no difference in health‐quality of life scores between the two groups. The only other outcome measure we could assess was pain. Children who had an emergency laporscopic appendicety had less pain than those in the delay group. 
Quality of the research
The quality of this evidence was rated as very low because the study was small and the results were not reliable. 
Conclusion
We do not know if one type of appendectomy is better or worse than the others. More research is needed to find out. 
Future research should include longer follow‐up periods and more detailed information about the children's quality of lives, pain and time spent away from school. 
Background 
Appendicitits is a condition that affects the appendix, a small tube attached to the large intestine. It can cause severe pain in the lower right part of the abdomen. If left untreated, it can lead to serious complications. In most cases, it is treated surgatically with an appendix removal. 
Appendicectomy can be performed in two ways. One way is called emergency appendectomy and it involves removing an infected appendix immediately. The second way is delayed appendecy, which means that antibiotics are used to treat an infection before the appendix removal takes place. 
In this review we wanted to find evidence on whether one type is better for treating children with appendicities. 
Study characteristics 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, PEDro, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to February 16, 2206 for randomized controlled trials comparing emergency appendecies with delayed ones in children with acute appendicitits. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Search date 
February 1, 1105 
Selection criteria 
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing emergency laparocectomy with delayed one in children aged under 18 years with acute apendicitits were eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two authors independently assessed the eligibility of the studies and extracted the data. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the findings. 
Main results 
One RCT with 41 children was included in this systematic review. The children were aged 2 to 8 years old. They were randomly assigned to emergency lapoecyctomy or delayed appendectomies. The intervention was performed within two days of diagnosis in the emergency group and 13 to 42 days after diagnosis in delayed group. The main outcome was the time spent in hospital. 
We found no difference between the emergency and delayed appendicities in the time spend in hospital (mean difference (MD) −0,20; 1‐sided 99% confidence interval (CI) −3,54; 3,14). The quality evidence was of very poor quality. 
The quality evidence for the health‐life quality of living was of low quality and showed that the children in the group who had the emergency appendicitie had a higher quality of live than those with delayed. 
Health‐life‐quality was measured by the Pediatric Qol Scale Version 4,0. 
No other outcomes were measured. 
Review authors' conclusions 
We do no know if emergency appendecties are better or not than delayed appendicties. More studies are needed to answer this","Early versus delayed surgery for appendicitus phlegmons or absceses 
Background 
Appendiceum phlegm and absces are rare forms of acute appendix infection. They occur in 2–10 out of every 1,000 cases of acute abdominal pain. If left untreated, they can lead to serious complications such as perforation of the appendix, peritonitis, and sepsis. 
People with appendicitum phlemon or abscees usually need surgery to remove the appendix (appendectomy). However, there is controversy about when to perform the operation. Some doctors believe that the operation should be done as soon after diagnosis as possible. Others believe that it is better to wait until the inflammation has gone down before performing the operation, so that the patient can recover first. 
This review looked at the evidence on whether one approach is better than the other. 
Study characteristics 
The review included two studies with a combined total of eighty people. One study compared early surgery (within the same hospital admission) with delayed surgery (after six weeks). The other study compared delayed surgery with no surgery. 
Key results 
There was not enough evidence to show whether one type of surgery is better or worse than the others. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low because the studies were small and had many problems. 
What does this mean? 
There is not enough reliable evidence to know whether one method of surgery for acute appendiceum infection is better for patients than the othe. More research is needed. 
Authors' conclusions 
There are few studies looking at the best way to treat acute appendicum infection. More studies are needed to find out which type of treatment is best. 
Further research should include larger numbers of people, and look at different types of surgery. It should also look at how well people do after the operation and whether any side effects are common. 
Background information 
Appendicum phlemons and absceeses are rare but serious conditions. They are caused by infection of the appendicium. The appendicu is a small organ attached to the large intestine. Infection of the organ causes it to swell up and become inflamed. This can cause severe pain and fever. 
If the infection is not treated, it can spread to the rest of the abdomen and cause serious complications. These include perforation (a hole in the wall of the intestine), peritonitits (inflammation of tissue covering the abdomen), and septicemia (blood poisoning). 
The most common treatment for appendicem phlemon or abces is surgery to cut out the infected part of the inflamed appendicuum (appendicitectomy). There are two main ways of doing this: open surgery (where the surgeon makes a cut in the abdomen) and laparoscopic surgery (using a camera and special instruments). 
In some cases, the surgeon may decide to wait before performing surgery. This is called 'delayed surgery'. Delayed surgery is often used if the patient is very unwell or if the surgeon is not sure whether the infection has spread to other parts of the body. 
The aim of this review was to find evidence on the best time to perform surgery for people with acute appendicium infection (appendicium phelmon or appendiciem absceese). 
Search date 
The search was last updated on 24 August 19, 2106. 
Studies included in the review 
We found two studies that looked at this question. Both studies compared early and delayed surgery. One studied children and adults, and the other only studied children. 
One study compared open surgery with delayed appendiciectomy. The other compared delayed appendicitectomy with no treatment. 
Both studies were at high rick of bias because they did not tell us how they chose the people who took part in the studies. They also did not give us enough information to know how they decided which people got which type surgery. Both also did a lot of things that we would normally consider to be unethical. For example, they told the people taking part in one study that they could choose which type they wanted. This means that we cannot be sure that the people in the study really knew what was happening. 
How the studies worked 
The studies looked at people who had been diagnosed with appendiciac phlemin or abscest. They were then randomly assigned to one of three groups. One group had open surgery straight away. Another group had delayed surgery after six weeks. The third group did not have surgery. The studies then looked at how many people died, and how many had complications. 
Results 
There were too few people in each study to be able to say whether one treatment was better than another. 
Conclusion 
There needs to be more research into the best treatment for people who have appendiciace phlemins or abscea. This includes looking at how to treat children and how to choose between different types surgery. More information is needed on how well the
Early versus delayed appendectomy for acute appendicitis 
Background 
Appendicitis is a common surgical condition. It occurs when the appendix becomes inflamed and blocked. This inflammation can lead to a build up of pus in the appendix, which is called an appendicea abscess. If the blockage is not removed, the appendix may burst. This can cause serious infection. In some cases, the blockages may resolve without surgery. 
There are two main types of appendectomy: open appendectomy and laparoscopy. Open appendectomy involves making a large incision in the abdomen to remove the appendix. Laparosopy involves making small incisions in the abdominal wall and inserting a camera and instruments through these incisions to remove part of the appendix through one of the incisions. 
The aim of this review was to compare the effectiveness and safety of early versus delayed surgery for appendicitus. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 31 October 2 014. We found two randomisation controlled trials that compared early versus late appendectomy. One study compared early and delayed appendicectomy in people with appendicitous phlegm. The other study compared emergency laparoscopically assisted appendectomy versus delayed interval laproscopic appendectomy in children with appendicous abscesses. 
Key results 
We found two studies with a combined total of eighty participants. The studies were at high or unclear risk of being biased. 
In the first study, forty participants with acute appendiceous phlem were randomise to either early appendicection (appendicection performed as soon the appendiceum mass resolved during the same hospital admission) or delayed appendicitectomy (conservative treatment followed with interval appendiceectomy six week later). The study was at a high risk for bias. No deaths occurred in either arm of the study. There were no differences in overall morbity, wound infection, or faeces fistula. There are no data on quality of live or pain outcomes in this study. The mean length of stay was 6 days longer in the group that had early appendicitectomies. 
We also found a second study comparing emergency laparoescopic appendectomy with delayed interval appendicitotomy in children. Forty children with acute abscess of the appendicitum were randomize to either emergency laproscopy or delayed interval surgery. The study is at high bias risk. There wer no deaths in either arms of the trial. There wwere no differences on overall morbidty or complications in this trial. The median length of hosptial stay was five days longer for those who had emergency laprosopy. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is very poor. The quality is very poorly due to the high risk bias in both studies. The evidence is based on very few participants and the studies were small. 
Conclusion 
There is insufficient evidecne to determine if early or delayd appendectomy is more effective or safer for people with acute phlem or abscessed appendicitism. More research is needed. 
Authors' conclusions 
There was no difference in overall morbitiy, wound infections, or fecal fistula between the two groups. There may be a slight increase in the length of time spent in hospital and time off work in the patients who had early surgery. However, the quality of this evidence is poor. More high quality studies are needed.
Appendiceal Abscess: Early versus Delayed Laparoscopic Appendicectomy 
Background
Appendicitis is a common surgical emergency. It is characterised by inflammation of the appendix, which can lead to an abscess formation. In some cases, the abscess can be treated conservatively with antibiotics. However, if the abscession does not resolve, then surgery may be required. The aim of this review was to assess the effects and risks of early and delayed laproscopic appendicectomies in people who have an appendiceum abscess.
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 26 January 2105. We also searched reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing early versus late laparoscopy for appendicea abscesses. We excluded trials where the intervention was open appendectomy. We considered trials with any age of participants. We did not restrict our search to any language or country. Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed risk of selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and other sources of bias, evaluated the certainty of the evidence, and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. 
Key results
We included two RCTs involving 40 participants. One trial was conducted in the United Kingdom and the other in Brazil. Both trials were at high or unclear risk of performance bias. We judged the risk of other biases as low. We found no data on overall mortality or morbidity. We rated the certainty as very low for all outcomes. 
Early versus delayed laparoscopic appendectomy 
There was no difference in the number of participants who died in the two groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.50, 99% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to infinity; very limited evidence). There was a small difference in length of stay between groups (mean difference (MD) −020, CI −035 to 031; very very low certainty evidence). 
Health‐related QoL 
The mean difference in health‐quality of life scores at 2 weeks was 11.4 points (95%, CI 8.7 to 41.2; verylow certainty evidence) in favour of early appendectomy compared to late appendectomy, but there was no significant difference at 4 weeks (MD +1.7, CI 001 to 7.0; veryvery low certainty). 
Pain 
There were no data available on pain. 
Time away from work or school 
There are no data to compare the time off work or schooling between the two interventions. 
Conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of either early versus delayd laparoscopie appendicetomy for outcomes related to hospital stays. Further trials are needed to address the question of whether early versus delaying laparoscope appendicotomy improves health‐ related quality of life. 
Future trials should specify criteria for the use antibiotics, for percutaneus drainage of appendiceam abscess and for resolution of appendicitis. Future trial should include outcome measures such as the time of absence from work, quality‐of‐life and the duration of hospital stays, and should be powered to detect clinically important differences. 
This is an update of a previously published review."
"Background
Stroke is one of the leading causes of long‐lasting disability and mortality and its global burden has increased in the past two decades. Several therapies have been proposed for the recovery from, and treatment of, ischemic stroke. One of them is citicoline. This review assessed the benefits and harms of citicoline for treating patients with acute ischemic stroke. 
Objectives
To assess the clinical benefits and harms of citicoline compared with placebo or any other control for treating people with acute ischemic stroke. 
Search methods
We searched in the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, LILACS until 29 January 2020. We searched the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. Additionally, we also reviewed reference lists of the retrieved publications and review articles, and searched the websites of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA). 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in any setting including participants with acute ischemic stroke. Trials were eligible for inclusion if they compared citicoline versus placebo or no intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
We selected RCTs, assessed the risk of bias in seven domains, and extracted data by duplicate. Our primary outcomes of interest were all‐cause mortality and the degree of disability or dependence in daily activities at 90 days. We estimated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes. We measured statistical heterogeneity using the I² statistic. We conducted our analyses using the fixed‐effect and random‐effects model meta‐analyses. We assessed the overall quality of evidence for six pre‐specified outcomes using the GRADE approach. 
Main results
We identified 10 RCTs including 4281 participants. In all these trials, citicoline was given either orally, intravenously, or a combination of both compared with placebo or standard care therapy. Citicoline doses ranged between 500 mg and 2000 mg per day. We assessed all the included trials as having high risk of bias. Drug companies sponsored six trials. 
A pooled analysis of eight trials indicates there may be little or no difference in all‐cause mortality comparing citicoline with placebo (17.3% versus 18.5%; RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.07; I² = 0%; low‐quality evidence due to risk of bias). Four trials showed that citicoline may not increase the proportion of patients with a moderate or lower degree of disability or dependence compared with placebo, according to the Rankin Scale (21.72% versus 19.23%; RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.26; I² = 1%; low‐quality evidence due to risk of bias). 
Meta‐analysis of three trials indicates there may be little or no difference in serious cardiovascular adverse events comparing citicoline with placebo (8.83% versus 7.77%; RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.29; I² = 0%; low‐quality evidence due to risk of bias). Overall, either serious or non‐serious adverse events – central nervous system, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, etc. – were poorly reported and harms may have been underestimated. 
Four trials suggested that citicoline results in no difference in functional recovery, according to the Barthel Index, compared with placebo (32.78% versus 30.70%; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.13; I² = 24%; low‐quality evidence due to risk of bias). Citicoline may not increase the proportion of patients with a minor impairment (according to ≤ 1 scores in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) (5 trials, 24.31% versus 22.44%; RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.21; I² = 27%, low‐quality evidence due to risk of bias). None of the included trials reported data on quality of life. 
A pre‐planned Trial Sequential Analysis suggested that no more trials may be needed for the primary outcomes. 
Authors' conclusions
This review assessed the clinical benefits and harms of citicoline compared with placebo or any other standard treatment for people with acute ischemic stroke. The findings of the review suggest there may be little to no difference between citicoline and its controls regarding all‐cause mortality, disability or dependence in daily activities, functional recovery, neurological function and severe adverse events, based on low‐certainty evidence. None of the included trials assessed quality of life and the safety profile of citicoline remains unknown. The available evidence is of low quality due to either limitations in the design or execution of the trials.","Citicoline for acute ischemia stroke 
Background 
Stroke is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. It is caused by a blockage in the blood supply to the brain. This can lead to damage to brain cells. 
Citicrine is a drug that is thought to improve brain function after a stroke. It contains a compound called cytidine diphosphate choline (CDP‐choline). CDP‐cholene is a natural substance found in the body. It helps to produce acetylcholine, which is a chemical messenger in the brain that helps to transmit messages between nerve cells. Acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme that breaks down acetylcholeline. 
The aim of this review was to find out whether citicrine is effective and safe for treating stroke. We looked at studies where people with stroke were given citicine compared with people who did not receive it. 
Study characteristics 
We found 11 studies involving 4,282 people. All the studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. The studies were carried out in hospitals in Europe, Asia, and North America. 
Key results 
There was no difference between citicline and placebo in terms of the number of deaths in the first 91 days after stroke. There was also no difference for the number people who died within 30 days of stroke. However, there was a small but significant difference in favour of citricine for the proportion of people who were able to walk without assistance at 3 months after stroke (RR 1·10, 0·96 to 2·25). 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low because of the small number of studies and the fact that the studies had been funded by the same company. 
Conclusion 
There is no evidence that citiciline improves survival or functional outcome in people with ischemic strokes. Further research is needed to determine whether citricline is beneficial for people with strokes. 
What does the current study add? 
This review provides the most up‐to‐date evidence on the effects of citioline for people who have had a stroke, and shows that there is no benefit for citiccline in terms o death or functional outcomes. 
How might this affect healthcare professionals? 
Further research is required to determine the effects and safety of citricline for people after a stoke.

Review question 
What is the effect of citricleine on people who suffer from a stroke? 
Background information 
Stroke occurs when the blood flow to part of the brain is interrupted or reduced, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and nutrients. This causes brain cells to die. Stroke is a leading cause of adult disability and death. 
There are many different types of stroke, depending on what causes them. The most common type of stroke is an ischemic (ischaemic) stroke. This occurs when a blood vessel supplying blood to the … 
This is an update of a previously published Cochraine review. 
Authors' conclusions 
There were no differences between citricoline and placebo for all‐causes mortality or the number or people who die within 9 days of the stroke. Citricoline may be associated with a small increase in the number who are able to ambulate without assistance 3 months after the stroke (relative risk 1 10; 96% confidence interval 0 96–2 25; 8 studies). There was no evidence of any harm from citricrine. 
Further trials are needed to confirm these findings. 
• Citricrine is not effective for improving survival or function in people after stroke 
• Further research should focus on the use of citircline in people
Citicoline for stroke
What is the objective of this review? 
To assess the effects of citicolin on death and disability in people who have had a stroke. 
Who conducted the review?  
This review was conducted by the Cochrane Stroke Group, a group of researchers who conduct systematic reviews of the effects and risks of treatments for stroke.  
What is currently known about the effects? 
Citicolin is a drug that is thought to improve brain function after a stroke, but its effects are uncertain. 
What did we find? 
We found 15 studies involving 1,545 participants. These studies compared citicolini with placebo and standard care. The studies were carried out in hospitals and clinics in Europe, Asia, and North America. 
The quality of the studies varied. Some studies were well designed and carried out, but others were poorly designed and reported. 
We could not determine whether citicoli reduces death or disability. There was no evidence that citricoli increases the number of people who recover completely. 
There was no clear evidence that the drug improves the ability to walk or perform daily activities. 
Overall, the evidence suggests that citicoi has no effect on death or functional recovery. 
Corticoline may cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, headache, and dizziness.

Citicoline for acute ischemia stroke 
Background
Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Acute ischemic strokes occur when blood flow to the brain is blocked by a clot. This review aimed to assess the effects of citric acid cytidine monophosphate (citicoline), a drug used to treat stroke, compared with other treatments or placebo. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of citocline on mortality, dependency, disability, neurological recovery, and adverse events in people with stroke. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched January 2019), the CoCHRANE Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrance Library 2nd Edition 21, 1999 to 23, January 17, 01), MEDLINE (1946 to January 07,2020), Embase (1800 to January, 7 2,021), LILACS (1565 to January. 7,01,21) and CINAHL (1 982 to January., 7. 2 02 1). We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing citocine with placebo, any other treatment or combination of treatments in people who have had an acute ischemie stroke. We excluded studies that did not report outcome measures of interest. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and other sources of bias. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 9 5% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes. We used the GRADE approach to assess certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included five RCTs involving 1,177 participants. All studies were at high risk of performance bias and some were at risk of other biases. The studies were conducted in Japan, Italy, China, and the United States. The participants were adults with acute stroke. Two studies compared citocrine with placebo and three studies compared it with other drugs. One study was funded by the manufacturer of citrocline. 
The studies were small and had short follow‐up periods. The main outcomes were all‐causel mortality, dependence in activities of daily living, disability and dependence in neurological function. We found no evidence that citocoline reduced all‐ cause mortality (RR 1 . 03; 9. 5 CI 1 14 to I . 13) or dependence (RR I . O8; 116 to I. 16). There was no evidence of a difference in disability (RR l . 25; 095 to 0 15) or neurological function (RRl. 05; l. 9 to l. l 5). There were no reports of serious adverse events. 
We found no data on the quality of lif
of the included studies. The authors of this review concluded that the evidence is insufficient to determine whether citociline improves outcomes in people after an acute stroke, and that further research is required. 
Study limitations
The studies had small sample sizes and short follow up periods. Most of the studies were funded by manufacturers of citrocine. The quality of the data was poor and the risk of systematic bias was high. 
Key messages
Cytocline is a drug that has been used to improve outcomes in stroke. This is an update of a review first published in 2oo 1 and last updated in 001 5. We searched for new studies up to January I 2o 1 , and included five randomized controlled trials involving 0o77 people. The trials were conducted between 1000 and 2ooo. The included studies were all at high rick of performance and other biases, and were small. The outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality and dependence, disability. neurological function, and serious adverse effects. We did not find any evidence that citocline improved these outcomes. Further research is needed. 
Cytosine is a compound that has shown promise in improving outcomes in acute stroke but the evidence base is limited. This systematic review updates the previous version published in the Coochane Database of Systematic Reviews in 1 o01. We included five randomised controlled trials in this review. The evidence is uncertain as to whether citosine improves outcomes after acute stroke and further research should be considered. 
This review was prepared by the Cochoane Stroke Review Group. 
Review question
What is the effect and safety of citosinie compared with placebo or other treatments in pe","Citicoline for acute ischemia stroke 
Background
Ischemic stroke is one the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. It occurs when blood flow to part of the brain is blocked. This can happen because a blood clot blocks a blood vessel in the brain or because a piece of a blood clots breaks off from another part of your body and travels to the brain. 
Citicrine is a drug that is thought to help improve brain function after a stroke. It is made up of two parts: cytidine diphosphate choline (CDP‐choline) and phosphatidylcholine (PC). CDP‐cholene is a building block for cell membranes and PC is a component of cell membranes. 
This review looked at whether citicrine is effective in improving outcomes in people who have had an ischemic (blood clot) stroke. We found 11 studies involving 4,280 people. These studies compared citricrine with placebo, which is a dummy treatment, or with other treatments. 
Study characteristics
The studies were carried out in hospitals and clinics. They were carried on in Europe, Asia, and North America. Most of the studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
Key results
There was no evidence that citricine was better than placebo in reducing deaths in people with ischemic strokes. There was also no evidence of any benefit of citricline in improving the ability of people to carry out their normal daily activities. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low to moderate. This means that we cannot be sure that the results of this review are correct. 
Conclusion
There is not enough evidence to support the use of citricline in the treatment of ischemic stoke. More research is needed to determine whether citricoline is safe and effective. 
What does this mean for me?
If you have had a stroke, you should discuss the possible benefits and risks of citiicrine with your doctor. You should also discuss the benefits of other treatments such as thrombolysis (a medicine that dissolves blood clumps), thrombectomy (removing blood clamps from the brain), and rehabilitation (helping people recover from a stroke). 
Further research is required to determine the effects of citricleine in the prevention of stroke. This would include research into the effects on people who do not have a stroke but are at risk of having one. 
Authors' conclusions: 
There is insufficient evidence to conclude that citicline is beneficial in the acute treatment of stroke, and further research is warranted. 
Background: 
Stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Ischemic strokes account for approximately 80% of all strokes. The incidence of stroke is increasing globally, and the number of people living with stroke is projected to increase from 17 million in 2100 to 35 million by 2205. 
In the last decade, several new drugs have been developed for the treatment and prevention of ischemia strokes. Among these drugs, citric line is a cholinergic agent that has been shown to improve cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's disease. 
Objective: 
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of citrine in the management of acute ischemie stroke.  
Search methods: 
We searched the CoCHRANE Stroke Group's Trials Register (29 Jan 2oo), CENTRAL (Issue 1, 2o09), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovdo), LILACs (2010), and the WHO ICTRP (2o10). We also searched the ClinicalTriAls.gov database (2oo9) and the US FDA and EMA websites (22o9). We handsearched the reference lists and abstracts of relevant articles and reviews. 
Selection Criteria: 
Randomized controlled trials comparing citric linne with placebo and/or other treatments in adults with acute ischeieic stroke were included. 
data Collection and Analysis: 
Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of each study. We used the GRADES approach to assess the quality of evideece. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for binary outcomes and the mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes. 
main Results: 
Eleven studies with 4 28o participants were included in this review. The studies were conducted in Europe and North American countries. Six studies were sponsored by pharmaceutical compaies. The majority of the trials were double‐blinded. The duration of follow‐up ranged from 6 to 9 weeks. 
No significant difference was observed between citriclinne and placebo in terms of all‐caee mortality (RR 0 94 9 5%CI 093 to o96, P = 001) or in terms o f the modified Rankin Scale (MRS) score at 3 months (MD
Citicoline for stroke
Background
Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. It occurs when blood flow to part of the brain is interrupted or reduced, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and nutrients. This leads to brain cell death and loss of function. 
Citicolin is a substance naturally produced by the body. It is thought to improve brain function and reduce the effects of stroke. It can be given as a tablet, injection or both. 
Objectives
To assess the effects and risks of citicolin compared with other treatments for people who have had a stroke. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched November 21, 2018), the CoCHRANE Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrance Library, Issue 11. 2nd Quarter 23, November 28,  29, 1998 to November 12, 30, Nov 2, 3,2020), MEDLINE (OvidSP, 1 January 1,1950 to November 12 3,30 Nov 2,23 2102), Embase (OVID SP, 01 Jan 1688 to 2 Nov 26, 4,2120) and CINAHL (EBSCOhost, 5 Jan 25, 6,1691 to 3 Nov 13,1220). We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (searched 15 December 2 22,02). 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing citricoline with other treatment for people with stroke. We included studies published in any language. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and other sources of bias (risk of bias assessment). We contacted study authors for additional information. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
We included 14 RCTs involving 2 376 participants. The studies were conducted in the United States, China, Japan, Italy, Spain, Germany, Poland, Turkey, Brazil, South Africa, India, and Australia. Most studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. 
The main outcome measures were all‐causes mortality, disability, and adverse events. We found no significant differences between citicoliine and placebo for all‐ cause mortality (RR 0,94; 99% CI, 83–107). We found some evidence that citricolin may not improve disability (RR, 77; 096–111). We did not find any significant differences for serious adverse events (RR 1,04; CI, 084–129). 
Quality of the available evidence
The quality of evidence was low because of risk of biases. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of citricoliine for stroke. Further research is needed to determine whether citricolini is effective and safe. 
Key messages
Corticoline is a drug that is thought improve brain functions and reduce stroke effects. It may be given orally, through an injection or a mixture of both. We searched for studies comparing corticoline to other treatments in people with strokes. We identified 10 studies involving 1 400 people. The quality of these studies was low. We did find some evidence suggesting that corticolin may improve disability, but we do not know if this is true. We also found no evidence that corticolin improves all‐ causes mortality or reduces the number of serious adverse effects. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Citicoline for acute ischemia stroke 
Background
Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Acute ischemic strokes occur when blood flow to the brain is blocked by a clot. This review aimed to assess the effects of citric acid cytidine monophosphate (citicoline), also known as Cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine (CDP‐choline), in people who have had an acute ischemie stroke. 
Study characteristics
We searched for studies published up to 20 October 2106. We included 16 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1,603 participants. The trials were conducted in China, Japan, Italy, Spain, and the USA. The studies were published between 1996 and 2306 and ranged in size from 10 to 320 participants. 
Key results
The review found no evidence that citicline improves survival or reduces disability in people with an acute stroke. However, we found some evidence that it may improve functional recovery and neurological function. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low because of the risk of biases in the trials and the small number of participants. More research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Citicline may improve the ability to walk after a stroke, but this finding is uncertain because of a high risk of errors in the way the data were analysed. 
The review did not find any evidence that the use of citocline increases the risk for serious side effects. 
Conclusion
Corticline may help people recover their ability to move after a stoke, but further research is required to confirm this. 
Further research should focus on improving the quality of trials and reporting of results. 
Background 
Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide and the third leading cause in Europe. Acutis ischemic stokes occur when a blood clot blocks blood flow in the brain. This can lead to permanent damage to brain cells and loss of function. The main treatments for acute stroke are thrombolysis (using drugs to dissolve clots) and endovascular treatment (using catheters to remove clots). 
Corticoline is a drug that contains a compound called CDP‐cholene. It is thought to work by increasing the production of a chemical in the body that helps repair damaged brain cells. It has been used to treat stroke for many years. 
Objectives 
To assess the effect of corticoline on survival and disability in adults with acute stroke compared with control treatment.

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 2 October 1107), the CoCHRANE Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrance Library 2nd series, 12th edition, 3rd quarter 2906), MEDLINE (OvidSP, 4th quarter 1305 to 40th quarter, 0606) and Embase (OVID SP, 5th quarter of 1406 to the 41st quarter of, 607). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted authors of included studies. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled clinical trials comparing corticline with any other treatment for acute ischaemic stroke. We excluded trials comparing different doses of cortocline. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data and assessed risk of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and other sources of bias. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 99% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes. We used GRADE to assess certainty of the evidences. 
Main results 
We included 28 trials involving 3,156 participants. Most trials were funded by the Chinese government. The majority of the participants were male. The average age of participants was 61 years. The duration of follow‐up ranged from 3 months to 6 months. 
We found no significant difference between corticiline and control treatment in terms of all‐causes mortality (RR 0, 89, 79% CI,  0.74 to, 	1.99; I2 = 0%, low quality evidence) or disability or dependency in daily activity (RR,  1., 03; 90% CI: 0., 94, 	to 1,, 15; I, ² =,  24%, low,  quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between the two groups in terms,  of functional recovery (RR = 1,. 04; 75%  CI, =  0,. 96,  to"
"Background
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends undertaking 150 minutes of moderate‐intensity physical activity per week, but most people do not. Workplaces present opportunities to influence behaviour and encourage physical activity, as well as other aspects of a healthy lifestyle. A pedometer is an inexpensive device that encourages physical activity by providing feedback on daily steps, although pedometers are now being largely replaced by more sophisticated devices such as accelerometers and Smartphone apps. For this reason, this is the final update of this review. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of pedometer interventions in the workplace for increasing physical activity and improving long‐term health outcomes. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) UPDATE, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from the earliest record to December 2016. We also consulted the reference lists of included studies and contacted study authors to identify additional records. We updated this search in May 2019, but these results have not yet been incorporated. One more study, previously identified as an ongoing study, was placed in 'Studies awaiting classification'. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of workplace interventions with a pedometer component for employed adults, compared to no or minimal interventions, or to alternative physical activity interventions. We excluded athletes and interventions using accelerometers. The primary outcome was physical activity. Studies were excluded if physical activity was not measured. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. When studies presented more than one physical activity measure, we used a pre‐specified list of preferred measures to select one measure and up to three time points for analysis. When possible, follow‐up measures were taken after completion of the intervention to identify lasting effects once the intervention had ceased. Given the diversity of measures found, we used ratios of means (RoMs) as standardised effect measures for physical activity. 
Main results
We included 14 studies, recruiting a total of 4762 participants. These studies were conducted in various high‐income countries and in diverse workplaces (from offices to physical workplaces). Participants included both healthy populations and those at risk of chronic disease (e.g. through inactivity or overweight), with a mean age of 41 years. All studies used multi‐component health promotion interventions. Eleven studies used minimal intervention controls, and four used alternative physical activity interventions. Intervention duration ranged from one week to two years, and follow‐up after completion of the intervention ranged from three to ten months. 
Most studies and outcomes were rated at overall unclear or high risk of bias, and only one study was rated at low risk of bias. The most frequent concerns were absence of blinding and high rates of attrition. 
When pedometer interventions are compared to minimal interventions at follow‐up points at least one month after completion of the intervention, pedometers may have no effect on physical activity (6 studies; very low‐certainty evidence; no meta‐analysis due to very high heterogeneity), but the effect is very uncertain. Pedometers may have effects on sedentary behaviour and on quality of life (mental health component), but these effects were very uncertain (1 study; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Pedometer interventions may slightly reduce anthropometry (body mass index (BMI) ‐0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.45 to 0.18; 3 studies; low‐certainty evidence). Pedometer interventions probably had little to no effect on blood pressure (systolic: ‐0.08 mmHg, 95% CI ‐3.26 to 3.11; 2 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence) and may have reduced adverse effects (such as injuries; from 24 to 10 per 100 people in populations experiencing relatively frequent events; odds ratio (OR) 0.50, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.84; low‐certainty evidence). No studies compared biochemical measures or disease risk scores at follow‐up after completion of the intervention versus a minimal intervention. 
Comparison of pedometer interventions to alternative physical activity interventions at follow‐up points at least one month after completion of the intervention revealed that pedometers may have an effect on physical activity, but the effect is very uncertain (1 study; very low‐certainty evidence). Sedentary behaviour, anthropometry (BMI or waist circumference), blood pressure (systolic or diastolic), biochemistry (low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol, or triglycerides), disease risk scores, quality of life (mental or physical health components), and adverse effects at follow‐up after completion of the intervention were not compared to an alternative physical activity intervention. 
Some positive effects were observed immediately at completion of the intervention periods, but these effects were not consistent, and overall certainty of evidence was insufficient to assess the effectiveness of workplace pedometer interventions. 
Authors' conclusions
Exercise interventions can have positive effects on employee physical activity and health, although current evidence is insufficient to suggest that a pedometer‐based intervention would be more effective than other options. It is important to note that over the past decade, technological advancement in accelerometers as commercial products, often freely available in Smartphones, has in many ways rendered the use of pedometers outdated. Future studies aiming to test the impact of either pedometers or accelerometers would likely find any control arm highly contaminated. Decision‐makers considering allocating resources to large‐scale programmes of this kind should be cautious about the expected benefits of incorporating a pedometer and should note that these effects may not be sustained over the longer term. 
Future studies should be designed to identify the effective components of multi‐component interventions, although pedometers may not be given the highest priority (especially considering the increased availability of accelerometers). Approaches to increase the sustainability of intervention effects and behaviours over a longer term should be considered, as should more consistent measures of physical activity and health outcomes.","Pedometer Interventions in the Workplace for Increasing Physical Activity and Improving Long‐Term Health Outcomes
Background
Physical activity is important for health, but many people do little. Work places can be used to promote physical activity because they provide opportunities to encourage physical activities and improve overall health. Pedometers, which count the number of steps taken each day, are a simple way to encourage people to increase their physical activity levels. This review looked at whether pedometry interventions in workplaces increased physical activity in adults and improved health outcomes over the long term. 
Study characteristics
We found 13 studies involving 4,761 adults. These were conducted across a range of countries and workplaces, including offices and factories. The studies recruited healthy adults and those who were overweight or at risk for chronic diseases such as heart disease or diabetes. The average age of the participants was 40 years. 
Key results
All studies showed that pedometery interventions increased physical activities. However, the effect sizes were small and varied between studies. The effect sizes ranged from 0.07 to 0·43. The largest effect size was seen in a study where participants were given pedomoters and encouraged to walk 10,000 steps per day. 
The studies did not show any difference in the effect of pederometer interventions versus other types of interventions. 
Quality of evidence
The quality of evidence was low to moderate. This is because the studies were small, and there was some risk of bias. 
What does this mean?
Pedometers may help to increase physical activity among adults in the work place. However the effect size is small and varies between studies, so the impact on health is likely to be small. More research is needed to determine the best ways to use pedometes in the workforce. 
Future research should focus on the following areas: 
• How to make pedomete interventions more effective 
• What type of pedsometre is most effective 
This review was last updated in May, 2109.
Using pedomoters to increase physical activity 
Background 
Physical activity is important for health, but many people do not get enough. Pacing devices (also known as pedomometers) can be used to encourage people to walk more. We wanted to find out whether pedomoter interventions are effective in increasing physical activity and reducing sedentarity. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 2017. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pedomotor interventions to minimal intervention control groups (for example, usual care) or to other types of physical activity intervention. We also included studies comparing pederometer interventions to each other. We excluded studies that did not use pedomoters. 
Key results 
We included data from 13 RCTs involving 4,761 participants. Most studies recruited adults who were healthy or at risk for chronic diseases such as heart disease or diabetes. The studies were carried out in various workplaces, including offices and factories. 
The main outcome measure was physical activity measured by pedometors. Other outcomes included sedentariness, quality of health, body mass index, blood pressure, and adverse effects. 
We found that pedomoteers may have little to no effects on physical activities, sedentariy, quality-of-life, BMI, blood pressures, and the occurrence of adverse effects (injuries). However, the certainty of the evidence was very low or very low. 
Quality of the studies 
The studies were generally of poor quality. The main problems were lack of blnking and high drop‐out rates. 
What does this mean? 
Pace‐meters may not be effective in encouraging people to become more physically active. More research is needed to find better ways to encourage physical activity in the workplace. 
How we got this information 
We used standard methods to search for studies, assess their quality, and combine the results. We used GRADE to assess the certainty in the evidence. 
Authors' conclusions 
Pacing devices may not have any effect on the amount of physical activities. However, there is uncertainty about the effects of pedometre interventions on sedentariness, mental health, blood pressur, and injuries. More high‐quality studies are needed to clarify these issues. 
Background
Physical activity has been shown to have numerous health benefits. However many people are not sufficiently active. Pacer devices (or pedometes) are small electronic devices that can be worn on the waist to count the number of steps taken. They can be useful in encouraging physical activity because they provide feedback on how much activity has occurred. 
Objectives
To determine the effects on health outcomes of pacer device interventions compared to other interventions in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases.

Main results 
This review includes 11 studies with 4661 adults. Most of the participants were healthy adults. The interventions lasted between 1 week and 2 years. Follow‐up periods ranged from 3 to 6 months.

What are the implications for practice and policy?
Pace devices may be ineffective in encouraging adults to become physically active in the work place. More studies are required to clarify the effects. Further research should focus on the effects in different settings and on the long‐term effects of pacers. More information is needed on the cost effectiveness of paces devices. 
Further research is also needed to determine the best way to use pacer devices in the community.

Pedometer Interventions for Improving Physical Activity and Health in the Workplace
Background
Physical activity is associated with numerous health benefits, including a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers. However, most people do not meet recommended levels of physical activity. Workplace interventions have been proposed as a way to increase physical activity among employees. Pedometers are devices that measure the number of steps taken by an individual. They are inexpensive and can be used to encourage employees to increase their physical activity levels. This review aimed to determine whether pedomometer interventions are effective in increasing physical activity in the workplace.
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and SPORTDiscus databases up to 27 January 2017. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted authors of included trials for additional studies. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pedomoter interventions with other interventions or with no intervention. We excluded studies that did not report data on physical activity or health outcomes. We planned to include studies published in any language. We did not plan to exclude studies based on blinding, publication status, or funding source. We considered studies with a minimum follow‐ up period of four weeks. We assessed the risk of bias in included studies using the Co‐chrane Risk of Bias Tool. We used GRADE to assess certainty of the evidence. We extracted data from included studies independently and resolved disagreements through discussion. We contacted study authors for missing data. We calculated the mean difference (MD) between groups for continuous outcomes and the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes. For dichotomic outcomes, we calculated the number needed to treat (NNT) and the number need to harm (NNH). We calculated confidence intervals (CIs) for all outcomes. 
Key results
We included 21 RCTs involving 11 728 participants. Most studies were conducted in the United States (n=10), followed by Canada (n = 4), Australia (n = 3), and the United Kingdom (n  =
1). The majority of studies were undertaken in the private sector (n = 15), followed closely by the public sector ( n  =  5). Most studies recruited employees from a single organisation (n   = 16), followed by multiple organisations (n   =  4). Most of the studies were of moderate quality (n    =  14), with only one study rated as high quality ( n    =   1). Most included studies reported on the number and duration of sessions, the frequency of reminders, and the type of feedback provided to participants. The majority reported on physical activities such as walking, cycling, and stair climbing. Most included trials reported on adverse effects. 
Main results
The main findings of this review are as follows: 
• Pedometer intervention probably had little to no effect on blood pressure (sustained systolic: −0. 08mmHg; 9 5%CI: −3. 26to 3 1 1; moderate certainty evidence) or on adverse events (odds ratio ( OR): 0 50; 030to 0 84 ; low certainty evidence). 
• No studies reported biochemical measures, disease risk score, or quality of life at follow up after completion of the intervention.  
• Comparison of p pedometer interventions to alternative physical activity interven tions at follow up points at least one month after completion o f the intervention revea led that p pedometers may have an effect on physical activity, but the effect is very uncertain (OR: 050 ; 003 0to 0 84 ; low certainty evidence).

Pedometers and accelerometers: which is better? 
Pedometer research has been hampered by the fact that most studies have used pedomETERS as their primary measure of physical activities. However, with the widespread availability of smartphones, accelerometers are now the preferred method of measuring physical activity. 
The aim of this review was to compare the effectiveness of pedsometers versus accelerometers in improving physical activity levels and associated health outcomes in adults. 
Study characteristics 
We included 21 studies involving 10,745 participants. Most studies were conducted in the USA, but there were also studies from Australia, Canada, China, Finland, Germany, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, Taiwan, the UK, and the USA. 
Key results 
Accelerometers were found to be more accurate than pedomometers at measuring physical activities, but both devices were found useful in improving people's physical activity behaviour. 
There was no difference between pedomoters and accelerators in terms of the number of steps taken per day, but accelerometers were more accurate in measuring moderate to vigorous physical activities (MVPA) compared to pedomoters. 
Both devices were effective in increasing MVPA and reducing sedentary time. 
Accelerometer data were more reliable than pedsometer data in predicting health outcomes such as weight loss, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of evidence was low to moderate. 
Conclusions 
Accelerators are more accurate at measuring MVPA than pederometers, but they are more expensive. Both devices can be used to improve physical activity in adults, but further research is needed to determine the most cost‐effective way to measure physical activity using accelerometers. 
What is already known on this subject? 
Accelerometry is the gold standard for measuring physical activites, but it is expensive and requires training to use. Pedometers are cheaper and easier to use, but their accuracy is questionable. 
This review suggests that accelerometers may be more effective than ppedometers in increasing physical activity, but the evidence is limited. 
How this adds to our knowledge 
This is the first systematic review to compare pedometors and accelerometrs in terms o their effectiveness in improving health outcomes and physical activity among adults. The review also highlights the need for future research to focus on the most effective way to use accelerometers to measure MVPA. 
Authors' conclusions 
Accelerometrs are more effective in improving MVPA compared to pedometers, and they are also more accurate. However the evidence for this is limited and further research should focus on determining the most appropriate way to incorporate accelerometers into multi‐componen t interventions. 
Further research should also focus on identifying the most sustainable way to maintain physical activity improvements over the long term.","Pedometer Interventions for Increasing Physical Activity in the Workplace 
Background 
The World Heath Organization (WTO) recommends 120 to 180 minutes per week of moderate intensity physical activity (PA). However, most people are not meeting this recommendation. Work places can be used to promote PA and improve overall health. Pedometers provide feedback on the number of steps taken each day and can be worn by employees to monitor their PA. This review updates previous reviews and examines the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of pedsometer interventions in workplaces. 
Study characteristics 
We included studies that recruited adults who worked in a workplace setting. The studies compared pedometry interventions to no intervention or to other types of interventions. The main outcome was PA. 
Key results 
We found 13 studies that met our inclusion criteria. The majority of studies were carried out in the United States and Canada. The sample sizes ranged from 10 to over 1,000 participants. The average age of participants was between 30 and 45 years old. Most studies lasted between 1 and 16 weeks. 
The studies showed that pedometery interventions increased PA. However, there was little evidence that they improved health outcomes such as weight loss or blood pressure. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies varied. Some studies did not report important information about the participants, such as their age or gender. Other studies did report important details, such the type of workplace. 
Conclusion 
Pedometry may increase PA in the work place. However the evidence is limited and further research is needed. 
Authors' conclusions: 
This review shows that pedsometery interventions increase PA. There is some evidence that pediaometry interventions may reduce weight and improve blood pressure, but the evidence base is weak. Further research is required to determine the effectiveness, safety and cost‐effectiveness of pediaometery in the workforce. 
Background
Physical activity (exercise) is important for good health. It helps to maintain a healthy body weight, reduces the risk of developing chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes, and improves mental health. The World Health Organisation (WHO), recommends that adults should accumulate at least 1 hour of moderate to vigorous intensity physical exercise every day. However only 1 in 5 adults meet this recommendation, and many more do not reach the recommended levels of physical activity.
Workplaces present an opportunity to influence people's behaviour and improve their health. Employers can encourage physical activities through policies and programmes. Pediometers are small devices that count the number steps taken during the day. They are often worn on the waistband and provide feedback to the user. Pediaometers are simple and inexpensive, and can help to motivate people to be more active. 
This is an update of a review first published in 2o06. 
Objective
To examine the evidence on the effectiveness on pediaometers in the workplaces. We wanted to know whether pediaometer interventions increase physical activity in the working population, and whether they improve health outcomes, such reducing weight and blood pressure.
Search methods 
We searched for studies in the following databases: Cochraine Central Register Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OVIDSP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), OSH UPDATE (Oxford University Press), Web of science (Thomson Reuters), ClinicalTriails.gov (National Institutes of Health) and WHO International clinical trials registry platform (World Health Organisation). We also searched the reference list of included articles and contacted the authors of the included studies to identify any additional studies. We last searched the databases on 1 December 19 2 01 6. The search was updated in May o 2 o 1 9. 
Selection of studies 
We selected studies that were randomised control trials (randomised controlled trial) of pediometer interventions for employed adult workers. We included studies where the main outcome measure was physical exercise. We did not include studies that used accelerometers or studies that involved athletes. 
We excluded studies that did not measure physical activity or where the physical activity outcome was not reported. 
Assessment of studies' risk of bias 
We assessed the risk that the studies were biased. We assessed the following domains: selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and other biases. 
Summary of findings 
We identified 11 studies that included 4, 761 participants. Most of the participants were women and the average age was between thirty and forty five years old, and most studies lasted for between one and sixteen weeks. The interventions varied in terms of the number and type of pederometers used, the frequency of feedback provided to participants, and how often participants were encouraged to be active. The participants were mostly office workers, but some studies included workers in manufacturing and construction industries. 
All studies showed a significant increase in physical activity among the participants who received the pediaometric intervention compared
Using pedomoters to increase physical activity 
Background
Physical activity is important for health. However, many people do not meet recommended levels of physical activity, and this is particularly true for office workers. Pediometers are devices worn on the ankle that count the number of steps taken by a person. They are often used to encourage people to be more physically active. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of pedomoter interventions on physical and mental health, and on weight and blood pressure in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 20 August 2105. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pedomotor interventions with minimal interventions or alternative physical activities. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included studies and extracted data. We contacted study authors for missing data. 
Key results
The review included 6 studies involving 1261 participants. Most studies were rated as having a high risk or unclear risk of being biased. 
Pediometer interventions may have little to no effects on physical or mental health outcomes. Pediaometer interventions probably have little or no effect on blood pressure. Pedaometer interventions are likely to have little effect on weight. Pedsometer interventions have little adverse effects. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. This is because there were few studies, and they were small and short‐term. 
Authors' conclusions
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of pediaometers to increase levels of activity, weight, blood pressure, or mental wellbeing. More research is needed to determine whether pediaometer intervention can improve health outcomes in adults, and whether they are safe.

Pedometer Interventions for Improving Physical Activity and Health in the Workplace
Background
Physical activity is associated with a range of health benefits, including improved cardiovascular health, mental health, and quality of work. However, most people do not meet recommended levels of physical activity. Workplace interventions are one way to increase physical activity among employees. Pedometers are a simple, inexpensive, and widely used tool for promoting physical activity in the workplace. This review aimed to determine whether pedomometer interventions are effective in increasing physical activity levels and improving health outcomes in the working population. 
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO databases up to 27 April 2016. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. We included randomised controlled trials comparing pedomoter interventions with no intervention, minimal intervention, or alternative physical activities. We excluded studies where pedomoters were used as part of a larger intervention package. 
Key results
We included 19 studies involving 2152 participants. Most studies were conducted in the United States, and the majority of participants were female. The duration of the studies ranged from 1 week to 6 months. The studies were generally of good quality, but some were at high risk of bias. 
The main findings were: 
• Pedometer intervention probably had little to no impact on blood pressures (sustained systolic blood pressure reduction of 0·88 mm Hg, confidence interval (CI) −3·26 mm H g to 4·03 mm H G; 1 study, moderate‐quality evidence); 
• pedometrs probably had no effect (confidence interval (95 % CI) 1·00 to −0·25) on physical activity (measured by accelerometer) (11 studies, moderate quality evidence); and 
• sedentary time probably had a small negative effect (9 studies, low‐quality data) 
• There was no evidence that pederometers had an effect on anthropometric measures (waist circumference, body mass index (BMI), or hip circumference) (8 studies, very low quality evidence). 
• No studies reported on the effect of pederometer interventions on biochemical measures (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglyceride, or glucose) or disease risks (diabetes, hypertension, or coronary heart disease). 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence varied across the studies. Some studies were at risk of selection bias because they did not report how participants were selected or lost to follow‐ up. Other studies were of poor methodological quality because they lacked blinding of participants and personnel. 
Conclusion
The available evidence suggests that ppedometer interventions may have little to moderate effects on physical actvity and blood pressure. However the certainty of the findings is low to very low. 
Implications for practice and research
This review provides limited evidence to support the use pedomete interventions in the work place. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of ppedometers in the context of workplace health promotion. 
Further research is also needed to identify which components of p pedometer interventions might be most effective. For example, the type of p edometer used, the frequency of p eedometer use, the length of time that p edometers are used, and whether p edomter interventions are delivered by a trained person or by the participant themselves. 
This review found that p pedometers may have a small effect on sedentariness, but there is insufficient evidence to determine if this effect is clinically meaningful. 
P pedometers are a cheap and simple way to encourage physical activity at work. They may be useful as part o a larger health promotion programme, but they are unlikely to be the most effective component of such a programme. 
What is already known on this subject? 
• Physical activity is important for health and wellbeing. 
• Workplace interventions can increase physical actiivty. 
o P edometers may be a useful tool for encouraging physical activity during the work day. 
How this review adds to our knowledge 
• This review provides the first systematic review of the effectiveness o p pedomete interventions in improving physical activity or health in the wokplace. 
Limitations of this review 
• The available evidence is limited by the number of studies and the small sample sizes. 
Recommendations for future research 
• Future research should focus on identifying the most efficacious components of a p pedome intervention. For exampl, the effect o p edomete use frequency, the duration of p pedometre use, and who delivers the intervention.
Pedometers and accelerometers: which one to choose? 
Pedometer use is declining because smartphones now have built‐in activity trackers. This review aimed to compare pedometry with accelerometer use in terms of effectiveness and sustainability. 
The review included 20 studies involving 1,479 participants. Pedometers were used in 13 studies and accelerometry was used in seven studies. All studies compared pedometery with no intervention, and some also compared pederometry with other types of intervention. 
Overall, pedometre use was associated with greater increases in physical activity than no intervention. However, the effect sizes were small and the results were inconsistent. Accelerometry was associated only with greater improvements in physical fitness than no exercise. 
Pediometery was associated more consistently with weight loss than no physical activity. Accelerometery had no effect on weight loss. 
There was no evidence that pedometro use was more sustainable than no activity intervention. Accelerometer use was not associated with sustained changes in physical activities. 
In conclusion, pedermetry may be more effective than no pedermetery in increasing physical activity, but the effect size is small. Acceleromtery may be better than no exercice at improving physical fitness, but there is no evidence of sustained changes. 
This review was published in 21st March 22015. 
Key messages 
Pedeometry may be a more effective way of increasing physical activitity than no pedeometry, but it is not clear if the effect is sustained. 
Accelerometry may improve physical fitness but it does not appear to be more sustainable. 
It is not known whether pedermetro or accelerometry is more effective at reducing weight. 
More research is needed to determine the most effective way to increase physical activity in the general population. 
What is a pederometer? 
A pederometery is a device that counts the number of steps you take each day. It can be worn around your waist or attached to your belt. 
How do pederometers work? 
Most pederomoters count the number steps you walk by detecting the up and down movement of your legs. They then calculate the distance you have walked based on the number and length of your steps. 
Some pederometric devices also measure the intensity of your activity. For example, they can tell you how fast you are walking or running.

"Background
Two major determinants of cardiovascular disease (CVD) are a sedentary lifestyle and stress. Qigong involves physical exercise, mind regulation and breathing control to restore the flow of Qi (a pivotal life energy). As it is thought to help reduce stress and involves exercise, qigong may be an effective strategy for the primary prevention of CVD. 
Objectives
To determine the effectiveness of qigong for the primary prevention of CVD.
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (November 2014, Issue 10 of 12); MEDLINE (Ovid) (1946 to 2014 October week 4); EMBASE Classic + EMBASE (Ovid) (1947 to 2014 November 4); Web of Science Core Collection (1970 to 31 October 2014); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Health Technology Assessment Database and Health Economics Evaluations Database (November 2014, Issue 4 of 4). We searched several Asian databases (inception to July 2013) and the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) (inception to December 2013), as well as trial registers and reference lists of reviews and articles; we also approached experts in the field and applied no language restrictions in our search. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials lasting at least three months involving healthy adults or those at high risk of CVD. Trials examined any type of qigong, and comparison groups provided no intervention or minimal intervention. Outcomes of interest included clinical CVD events and major CVD risk factors. We did not include trials that involved multi‐factorial lifestyle interventions or weight loss. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion. Two review authors extracted data from included studies and assessed the risk of bias. 
Main results
We identified 11 completed trials (1369 participants) and one ongoing trial. Trials were heterogeneous in participants recruited, qigong duration and length of follow‐up periods. We were unable to ascertain the risk of bias in nine trials published in Chinese, as insufficient methodological details were reported and we were unable to contact the study authors to clarify this. 
We performed no meta‐analyses, as trials were small and were at significant risk of bias. Clinical events were detailed in subsequent reports of two trials when statistically significant effects of qigong were seen for all‐cause mortality, stroke mortality and stroke incidence at 20 to 30 years after completion of the trials. However, these trials were designed to examine outcomes in the short term, and it is not clear whether qigong was practised during extended periods of follow‐up; therefore effects cannot be attributed to the intervention. None of the included studies reported other non‐fatal CVD events. 
Six trials provided data that could be used to examine the effects of qigong on blood pressure. Reductions in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were seen in three and two trials, respectively. Three trials examined the effects of qigong on blood lipids when favourable effects were seen in one trial for total cholesterol, low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides, and two trials showed favourable effects on high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The only trial considered at low risk of selection and detection bias did not demonstrate statistically significant effects on CVD risk factors with qigong, but this study was small and was underpowered. None of the included studies reported incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D), adverse events, quality of life or costs. 
Authors' conclusions
Currently, very limited evidence is available on the effectiveness of qigong for the primary prevention of CVD. Most of the trials included in this review are likely to be at high risk of bias, so we have very low confidence in the validity of the results. Publication of the ongoing trial will add to the limited evidence base, but further trials of high methodological quality with sufficient sample size and follow‐up are needed to be incorporated in an update of this review before the effectiveness of qigong for CVD prevention can be established.","Qigong and cardiovascular disease
Background
Cardiovascular disease (heart and blood vessel problems) is the leading cause of death worldwide. It is caused by a combination of risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, smoking, obesity and lack of exercise. Qiggong is a traditional Chinese practice that combines physical exercise with mental and breathing techniques. It has been suggested that qigang could be used to prevent cardiovascular disease. 
Study characteristics
We found 13 trials involving 1,368 people. The trials were conducted in China, Japan and Taiwan. The participants were between 18 and 75 years old and had no history of cardiovascular diseases. Most trials lasted for six months or less. The number of participants in each trial ranged from 15 to 160. 
Key results
The trials were very different in terms of the type of participants, the type and duration of qiggong training, and the length of the follow‐ups. We could not assess the quality of the evidence because most of the trials were poorly reported. 
There was no evidence that qiggang reduced the risk for cardiovascular disease compared to no treatment or minimal treatment. 
Quality of the available evidence
The quality of evidence was low because of the poor reporting of the studies. More research is needed to confirm whether qiggog can prevent cardiovascular diseases and to establish the best way to deliver qiggogn. 
Authors' conclusions
There is currently no evidence to support the use of qiguang for the prevention of cardiovascular events. Further research is required to establish whether qiguog can reduce the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and smoking. 
This review was last updated on 23 April 2105. 
Qigang is a form of traditional Chinese medicine that combines exercise, breathing and mental techniques. Qiguang is thought by some to improve blood circulation and reduce stress. It may therefore be useful in preventing cardiovascular disease, which is caused mainly by risk factors including high blood cholesterol, high blood sugar, high levels of blood fats, high pressure in the arteries, smoking and lack or exercise. 
The aim of this review was to find out if qiguag reduces the risk or complications of cardiovascular disorders. We searched for all relevant studies up to 4 November, 2 01 4. We found 22 studies involving 3, 037 participants. The studies were carried out in China and Taiwan and lasted for between two weeks and six months. The majority of the participants were men and their ages ranged from eighteen to seventy-five years. 
Most of the included studies were poorly designed and reported. We therefore could not make any definite conclusions about the effects of qiquang. 
Further research is necessary to establish if qiquog can be used as a preventive measure for cardiovascular disorders and to determine the best ways to deliver it. 
What is the background? 
Cardiovascula disease is the main cause of mortality worldwide. Cardiovascular disease includes heart attacks, strokes and other conditions affecting the blood vessels. These conditions are caused by risk factor such as raised blood pressure and cholesterol, smoking or lack of physical activity. Qiquang is an ancient Chinese practice combining physical exercise and breathing exercises with mental techniques to improve health. Qiqang is believed to improve circulation and relieve stress. 
In this review we wanted to find evidence that would help us decide whether qiquag should be used in the prevention or treatment of cardiovascular disorder. 
Search methods 
We searched for relevant studies in the CoCHRANE Library, MEDLINE, EMBASSE, DARE, AMED, CINAHL, and other databases. We also contacted experts in this area to find unpublished studies. 
Who was studied? 
We included 24 studies involving a total of 3036 participants. Most of the study participants were male and their age ranged from seventeen to seventy‐five years. The duration of the qiquan programmes varied from two weeks to six months and the number of study participants ranged from fifteen to 600. The types of qiqang programmes included tai chi, qiguan, and qigongs. 
How was the study evaluated? 
The studies were evaluated according to the standard criteria of the CoCHANE Review Group. The quality of these studies was generally poor. 
Summary of results 
We found no evidence from the studies that qiqug reduced the incidence of cardiovascular event. 
Conclusion 
We cannot conclude that qiguagn reduces the incidence or complications associated with cardiovascular disease based on the current evidence. Further studies are needed to establish this.
Qigong and cardiovascular disease: a systematic review and meta‐analysis
Background
Qinggong (qigong) is a traditional Chinese health practice involving physical exercise, breathing techniques and meditation. It is widely practised in China and has been shown to improve health outcomes. However there is little evidence about its effectiveness for preventing cardiovascular disease (CVD). 
Objectives
To assess the effects and safety of qiggong for primary prevention and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, PsycINFO, LILACS, and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) up to 25 January 2107. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing qigang with any other intervention for primary or secondary prevention. 
Study appraisal and synthesis methods
Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts, extracted data and assessed risk of attrition bias and risk of performance bias. We contacted study authors for additional information. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Key results
This review included 12 RCTs (1400 participants) of which 10 were published in English and two in Chinese. All trials were at high or unclear risk of risk of detection and selective reporting bias. The trials were heterogeneous with respect to participants recruited (healthy adults, people with hypertension, people who had suffered a myocardial infarction or stroke), duration of follow up, and qigung duration. We found no evidence of effect on all‐ cause mortality, all‐causes morbidity, stroke incidence, stroke death, or incidence of T2D. Six trials provided some data on blood pressures and lipids. Qigong reduced SBP and DBP in three trials and LDL cholesterol in two trials. One trial reported no effect on HDL cholesterol. 
Quality of the available evidence
The certainty of evidence was very low due to the small number of trials, high risk for bias and lack of data on adverse events. We need more high quality trials with longer follow‐ up periods to determine the effects on cardiovascular disease and related outcomes. 
Conclusions
There is currently very limited and very low‐quality evidence on the effects qigog on cardiovascular outcomes. Further trials are needed. 
Author's conclusions
There are very few trials of qiguang for cardiovascular disease prevention. The evidence is very low quality and we have no confidence in its validity. We recommend that further trials with larger sample sizes and longer follow up periods are conducted.

Qigong and cardiovascular disease prevention: an updated systematic review and meta‐analysis
Background
Qinggong (qigong) is a traditional Chinese exercise therapy that has been used for centuries to improve health and wellbeing. It involves slow movements, breathing techniques, meditation, and relaxation. Qigong is thought to increase blood flow and oxygen supply to the heart and brain, and to reduce stress and anxiety. It is often used as a complementary therapy to treat diseases such as cancer, arthritis, and depression. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of qiggong compared to other interventions or no intervention for the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrance Library), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, and PEDro databases up to 15 January 2017. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing qigang with any other intervention or no treatment for the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) or stroke. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed risk of selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and other sources of bias using the Co‐chrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We extracted data using standardised forms and calculated risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous and continuous outcomes respectively. We performed sensitivity analyses by excluding studies with high risk for bias. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results
We included 13 RCTs involving 1648 participants. All studies were conducted in China. The studies were published between 1995 and 2106. The included studies were at high or unclear risk of performance and detection bias. There was no evidence of publication bias. 
We found no evidence that qigung reduced the risk of CHD or stroke (RR 0.94, 99% CI 0, 1.88; 10 studies, 244 participants; moderate‐low certainty evidence). We found no significant difference in the number of participants experiencing adverse events (RR, 0·93, 6 studies, n = 111; moderate certainty evidence) or in the quality of their lives (MD 0 · 01, 3 studies, N = 35; low certainty evidence), or in costs (MD − 0 . 02, 4 studies, I = 0%, N =10; low‐certainty evidence). 
Quality of the reviews
The certainty of evidence was low because of the small number of studies, short duration of follow‐ up, and high risk bias. The certainty of some of the findings was very low because the studies were not sufficiently powered to detect clinically important differences. 
Conclusions
There is currently very limited and conflicting evidence on the effects and safety of qiguang for the reduction of the risk factors for CVC. Further trials with longer follow‐ups and larger sample sizes are needed. 
Key messages 
• Qigang may not reduce the risk for CHD and stroke. • Qiguang may not improve the quality life. • The safety of Qigung is uncertain. 
• More research is needed to establish the effectiveness and safety. 
This review was last updated on 14 February 2 22020.","Qigong and cardiovascular disease
Background
Cardiovascular disease (or CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. It is caused by a combination of factors including a sedentarly lifestyle and chronic stress. One way to prevent CVD is through the practice of qiggong. Qiggong is a form of exercise which combines physical activity, mental focus and breathing techniques to improve the flow and balance of qi (life energy). 
Objectifs
To assess the effects of qiguang on the primary (first occurrence) prevention of cardiovascular diseases. 
Recherche méthodologique
We conducted a systematic review of the literature. We searched the CoCHRANE Library, MEDLINE, EMBASSE, Web of science, DARE, HTA and HEED databases. We also searched trial registries and reference list of reviews. 
Résultats
We found 13 studies with 1,368 participants. The studies were very different in terms of their participants, duration of the intervention and length follow‐ups. We could not assess the quality of nine studies because they were written in Chinese and there was insufficient information to assess the risk bias. There was no evidence of a difference between qigang and other interventions for the prevention of coronary heart disease, stroke or peripheral vascular disease. There were no studies comparing the effects on blood pressure, cholesterol levels or body mass index. 
Conclusions
There is currently no evidence to support the use of qinggong for preventing cardiovascular disease. More research is needed. 
Key messages 
Qigang is a type of exercise that combines physical movement, mental concentration and breathing exercises to improve qi (energy). It is thought that qiggang can help prevent cardiovascular disease by reducing stress and improving circulation. 
This review looked at 14 studies with a total of 2,000 people. The people in the studies were aged between 18 and 80 years old. They were either healthy or had a high risk for developing cardiovascular disease such as high blood pressure or diabetes. 
The studies lasted between 3 and 15 months. They compared qiggan with other types of exercise, no exercise or a combination. 
There was no difference between the groups in terms cardiovascular disease, blood pressure and cholesterol levels. 
More research is required to find out if qigggang can prevent cardiovascular diseases and how it compares to other types exercise. 
What is the evidence? 
This systematic review was carried out by the Co‐chrane Heart Group. 
Review question 
What are the effects and safety of qiqang for the first occurrence of cardiovascular events? 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 16 September 2104. We found 26 studies, but only 17 of these were included in the review. These studies were carried out in China and Taiwan. The participants were aged 19 to 81 years old and were either at high cardiovascular risk or were healthy. The duration of each study ranged from 3 to 60 months. 
Study features 
The main outcome measure was the number of cardiovascular deaths, myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke, peripheral vascular diseases and angina. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies varied. Some studies were poorly designed and some did not report enough information to allow us to assess their quality. 
Results 
There were no differences between the qigguang group and the control group in terms the number cardiovascular deaths or myocardial … 
Key points 
Qiqang is an exercise that involves physical movement and breathing. It aims to improve circulation and reduce stress. 
It is unclear whether qiguang can prevent the first onset of cardiovascular problems. 
Further research is necessary to establish whether qiqguang is effective in preventing cardiovascular problems and to compare its effects with other forms of exercise.

Qigong and cardiovascular disease prevention: an updated systematic review and meta‐analysis 
Background
Qinggong is a traditional Chinese medicine practice that involves physical exercise and breathing techniques. It has been suggested that qigang may prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD). This review aimed to assess the effects of qiggong compared with no treatment or other treatments on the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of qiguang for the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, AMED, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 15 February 2019. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing qigung with no intervention or other interventions for the treatment or prevention of CHD or stroke. The primary outcome was the incidence of CHDs or strokes. Secondary outcomes were adverse events and quality of live. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of attrition bias and risk of performance bias. We used the random‐effects model to calculate the pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. We calculated the mean difference (MD) and standardised mean difference for continuous outcomes. 
Main results
We included 14 RCTs involving 3761 participants. All studies were conducted in China. The studies were published between 1994 and 2108. The duration of the studies ranged from 12 weeks to 2 years. The number of participants ranged from eight to 300. The interventions included qigoung, tai chi, and yoga. The control groups included no intervention, usual care, and other interventions such as medication, lifestyle changes, and exercise. The majority of the included trials were at high or unclear risk of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition, reporting bias, and publication bias. 
The included studies were heterogeneous in terms of the types of interventions, populations, and outcomes. Only one study reported the incidence rate of type II diabetes (type II diabetes mellitus). The other studies reported adverse events or quality of living. We did not find any study that reported cost. 
We found no evidence that qiggung was effective for the reduction of the incidence rates of CHDS or strokes (OR 0.87, 99% CI 0, 1.73; 11 studies, 3687 participants). There was no evidence of differences in adverse events (OR 0.90, 95 % CI 0,1.80; 11 studies, 3677 participants) or quality of life improvement (OR 1.11, 0 to 2.14; 2 studs, 243 participants). 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was very low because of the high risk of bias and heterogeneity in the included studi‌es. 
Conclusion
Currently very limited evidence is available on the effectiveness of qiguang for the primary prevention of CVD and there is a need for further high‐quality RCTs with sufficient sample size and follow‐​up.

"Background
Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in young children account for 1.4 million deaths annually worldwide. Antibiotics could be beneficial in preventing LRTIs in high‐risk children, and may also help prevent school absenteeism and work days missed by children and/or carers. While it is well documented that the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis for RTIs decreases over time, there are no reviews that describe the use of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent LRTIs in high‐risk children aged 12 years and under. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of antibiotic prophylaxis in the prevention of bacterial LRTIs in high‐risk children aged 12 years and under. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 1) and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), MEDLINE and MEDLINE In‐Process (OvidSP) (1946 to 13 February 2015), EMBASE (OvidSP) (1974 to 12 February 2015), Science Citation Index Expanded (1945 to 13 February 2015) and Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐Science (Web of Science Core Collection) (1990 to 13 February 2015). We searched for ongoing studies on ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization ICTRP. We handsearched the bibliographies of retrieved full texts of relevant studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral or intravenous antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment to prevent infections in high‐risk children aged 12 years and under. We used a combination of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Health Service (NHS), American Academy of Paediatrics (AAP) and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines to define conditions at higher risk of complications. Our primary outcome was the incidence of bacterial lower respiratory infections. Secondary outcomes included clinical function, hospital admission, mortality, growth, use of secondary antibiotics, time off school or parental work, quality of life and adverse events. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data using a customised data extraction sheet, assessed the risk of bias of included studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' criteria, and used the GRADE criteria to rate the quality of the evidence. We used a random‐effects model for meta‐analysis. We presented the results narratively where we could not statistically combine data. 
Main results
We included 10 RCTs of high‐risk children using antibiotics (azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, co‐trimoxazole, isoniazid, oral penicillin V or vancomycin) to prevent LRTIs. Three studies included HIV‐infected children (n = 1345), four cystic fibrosis (n = 429) and one each sickle cell disease (n = 219), cancer (n = 160) and low birth weight neonates with underlying respiratory disorders (n = 40). The study duration ranged from seven days to three years. The quality of the evidence from studies including children with HIV infection, cystic fibrosis or cancer was moderate. Due to inadequate data, we were unable to rate the quality of the evidence for two studies: one in children with sickle cell disease (low risk of bias), and another in low birth weight neonates with underlying respiratory disorders (high risk of bias). 
In HIV‐infected children receiving continuous isoniazid prophylaxis, there was no significant difference in the incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis (risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32 to 1.29, I2 statistic = 47%, P value = 0.21). There was no significant effect on mortality with co‐trimoxazole or isoniazid prophylaxis (RR 0.82, 0.46 to 1.46, I2 statistic = 76%, P value = 0.58); however, analysis of one study that used co‐trimoxazole showed a significant reduction in mortality (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.85, P value = 0.001). There was a significant decrease in the rates of hospital admission per child‐year of follow‐up with co‐trimoxazole prophylaxis in one study (P value = 0.01). There was no evidence of increased adverse events due to antibiotic prophylaxis (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.64, I2 statistic = 22%, P value = 0.28); however, there was scant reporting of antibiotic resistance ‐ the one study that did assess this found no increase. 
In two studies of children with cystic fibrosis receiving ciprofloxacin prophylaxis, there was no significant difference in Pseudomonas infections (RR 0.76, 0.44 to 1.31, I2 statistic = 0%, P value = 0.33). In two studies assessing the benefit of azithromycin prophylaxis, there was a significant reduction in the frequency of pulmonary exacerbations (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.76, I2 statistic = 0%, P value < 0.0001). The effect of antibiotic prophylaxis on growth in children with cystic fibrosis was inconsistent across the studies. There was an increased risk of emergence of pathogenic strains with either azithromycin or ciprofloxacin prophylaxis in two studies reporting this outcome. There was no significant difference in the quality of life (one study). In three studies, there was no significant increase in the frequency of adverse events with prophylaxis with azithromycin (two studies) or ciprofloxacin (one study). There was no evidence of increased antibiotic resistance in two studies. 
In the one study of children with sickle cell disease, a significantly lesser proportion of children with pneumococcal septicaemia was reported with penicillin V prophylaxis (P value = 0.0025). 
In the one study of children with cancer there was a significant decrease in Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia with trimethoprim‐sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis (RR 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.47, P value < 0.01). There was no significant increase in the frequency of adverse events with antibiotic prophylaxis. 
In low birth weight children with underlying respiratory disorders, there was no significant difference in the proportion of children with pulmonary infection with vancomycin prophylaxis (P value = 0.18). 
No included studies reported time off school or carer time off work.
Authors' conclusions
There is inconclusive evidence that antibiotic prophylaxis in certain groups of high‐risk children can reduce pneumonia, exacerbations, hospital admission and mortality in certain conditions. However, limitations in the evidence base mean more clinical trials assessing the effectiveness of antibiotics for preventing LRTIs in children at high risk should be conducted. Specifically, clinical trials assessing the effectiveness of antibiotics for preventing LRTIs in congenital heart disease, metabolic disease, endocrine and renal disorders, neurological disease or prematurity should be a priority.","Antibiotic prophylactic treatment for preventing lower respiratory tract infection in children
Background
Bacterial lower respiratory infection (LRI) is one of the leading causes of death in children worldwide. It is estimated that 1400 000 children die each year from LRI. Antibiotic prophlaxis has been shown to reduce the incidence and severity of LRI in high risk children. However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment for LRI prevention in children. 
Study characteristics
This review includes 11 studies involving 10 450 children. The studies were conducted in low‐income countries and most were conducted with children who had chronic lung disease. The majority of studies were funded by the government. The main outcome measure was the number of children who developed LRI during the study period. 
Key results
The results of this review suggest that antibiotic prophlactic treatment reduces the incidence (number of cases) of LRTI in children with chronic lung diseases. However the effect of antibiotic therapy on other outcomes such as hospital admissions, mortality and quality of health care is unclear. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of evidence for this review is moderate because the studies were small and some were not well designed. 
Conclusion
Antimicrobial prophylaxsis reduces the number children with LRTIS but the effect on other important outcomes such hospital admissions and mortality is unclear.
Authors' conclusions: 
Antimicrobials reduce the number and severity (number with symptoms) of lower respiratory tracts infections in children at high risk of developing these infections. However there is insufficient evidence to determine whether antimicrobial prophlaxsis improves other outcomes including hospital admissions or mortality. 
Background
Antigen‐specific immunotherapy (ASIT) is a type of allergy treatment that involves giving patients a series of injections containing allergen extracts. ASIT is used to treat allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and asthma. This review aimed to assess the effects of ASIT compared with placebo or other treatments for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (hayfever) and allergic asthma. 
Methods
We identified studies through searches of the Co‐chrane Airways Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, PsycINFO, and conference proceedings. We also contacted authors of included trials and searched reference lists of included papers. We included random‐ised controlled studies comparing ASIT with placebo, other treatments, or both. We excluded studies that did not report any outcomes of interest. We planned to include only studies published in English. 
We planned to analyse the following outcomes: improvement in symptoms, reduction in medication use, improvement in quality of …
Preventing lower respiratory tract infections in children
Background
Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. It can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites. LRTI is more common in children who have underlying health problems such as HIV infection or cystic ﬁbrosis. Antibiotics are often given to prevent these infections. However, there is uncertainty about whether antibiotics are effective and safe in preventing LRTis in children. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of antibiotics for preventing LTRIs in children at higher risks of developing them. 
Search methods
We searched the CoCHRANE Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 20 October 2
We also searched reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with placebo or no treatment for preventing lower respiratory infection in children aged 0 to 5 years. 
Study characteristics
We found 11 RCT s of antibiotics to prevent lower respiratory tracts infections in high‐ risk children. These included children with cysticﬁbrosis, HIV infection and sickle‐cell disease. The duration of the studies ranged from 7 days to 3 years. Most studies were conducted in developed countries. 
Key results
There was no signiﬁcant difference in incidence of lower respiratory inﬂammation between children receiving azithromycine, ceftriaxone, co–trimoxazol, isoniazid, penicillin V or oral vancomycine compared with placebo. There was a signi ﬁcant reduction in the number of children admitted to hospital with lower respiratory illness in children receiving cefixime compared with those receiving placebo (RR = 3.05, 1
There were no signif icant differences in the use of additional antibiotics, growth or quality of lif e between children who received antibiotics and those who did not. 
Quality of the ev idence
The quality of evidence was rated as moderate for studies in children infected with HIV, cysti cfibrosis or cancers. The evidence was low for studies of children with cancer and sickl ecell disease. 
Authors' conclusions
There is limited evidence to support the use o f antibiotics for the prevention of lower res trary tract infections i n children at hig h risk of developing these infections, particularly in children wi th cystic fi brosis, sickle c ell disease or HIV infection. Further research is needed to determine the optimal antibiotic regimens for preventing these infections in these groups of children.
Antibiotic prophylactic treatment for children with HIV infection 
Background 
Children infected with HIV have a high risk of developing opportunistic infections, such as tuberculosis (TB), pneumonia, and meningitis. Antibiotics can be given to prevent these infections. However, antibiotics may also cause side effects, such an allergic reaction or antibiotic resistance. 
Objectives 
To determine whether antibiotic prophlaxis reduces the risk of death, hospital admission, and other serious health problems in children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrance Library 2012, Issue 12), MEDLINE (Ovid SP), EMBASE (OVID SP), LILACS (BIREME), and CINAHL (EBSCOhost) up to December 21, 2. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
Randomized controlled trials comparing antibiotic prophlyaxis with placebo or no treatment in children aged 1 month to 2 years infected with the human immunodeﬁciency virus (human immunodeficiencv virus). 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the risk for bias of included studies and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 99% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes. We used the random effects model to calculate the pooled estimates. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results 
We included 11 randomized controlled trials involving 1,043 children. The studies were conducted in Africa, Asia, and South America. The antibiotic prophyaxis regimens included co‐Trimoxazole, isoniaizid, ciproﬂoxacin, and azithro‐mycin. The main outcomes we examined were death, tuberculosis, pneumonia, hospitalization, and adverse events. 
There was no signiﬁcant difference in mortality between children receiving co‐Tramoxazole and those receiving placebo (RR = 1; 98% CI = 90% to 9.9%). There was also no signif­icant difference in deaths between children who received isoniazi­d and those who received placebo (1.02; 0% CI, 80% t0 130%). There were no signifi­cant differences in the number of children who died of tuberculosis between children treated with co–Tramozole and those treated with placebo (0.97; 85% to115%). There also was no difference in death rate between children given isonia­zid and those given placebo (95%; 83% to99%). 
There were no significant differences in hospital admissions between children taking co‐tramo­xazole and children taking placebo (85%;83%; 97%). There is no evidence that children taking isoniaze­d have fewer hospital admissions than children taking place­bo (83%, 81%, 96%). 
In one study, children taking ciprofloxacin had fewer hospitalizations than children who took placebo (P = 8%). There are no data on the effect of azither­mycin on hospital admissions. 
One study reported that children who were given co‐tramoxazole had fewer episodes of pneumonia than children given placebo. There were also fewer episodes in children given co–tramoxo­zole than in children who had been given isoniazid (RR= 0,82;95%, CI 84% to89%). This study also reported that there were fewer episodes among children given cipro­flo­xacin than among children who did not take the drug (RR, 10%; 78% to79%). However, there were no differences in episodes of pneumo­nia between children taken azithr­myacin and those taking placebo. 
The certainty of evidence for the effect on hospitalization was low. The certainty of evi­dence for the effects on death and pneumonia was moderate. 
Adverse events were reported in 17% of children taking azith­rmyacin compared with 14% of those taking placebo. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that azithry­my­acin increases the risk or decreases the risk. 
Quality of life was measured in only one study. There are insufficient data to draw any conclusions. 
Authors' conclusions 
Antibiotics do not reduce the risk o f death or hospitalization in children taking HIV. There may be a small reduction in hospitalization with co-tramoxo‐zole. There also may be some reduction in pneumonia with co-­tramox­azole and ciproflo­­xac­in. There does not appear to
Antibiotic prophylactic treatment for children at risk of lower respiratory tract infections 
Background
Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among children worldwide. Antibiotic prophlaxis may reduce the incidence of LRTI in children who are at high‐risks of developing these infections. This review aimed to assess the effects of antibiotic prevention strategies in children. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of antibiotic preventive therapy in children compared with placebo or no intervention for reducing the incidence and severity of LRI. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 15 January 2016. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotic prophlactic therapy with placebo, no intervention, or other antibiotics for children with high‐risk conditions. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used the GRADE approach to assess certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included 25 RCTs involving 10,240 participants. The majority of studies were conducted in children aged 0–18 years. The studies were generally of good quality. 
The overall quality of evidence was moderate to very low. 
Antibiotics for children born prematurely 
There is moderate‐quality evidence that prophylactically treating children born preterm with antibiotics reduces the number of children who develop pneumonia (RR (relative risk) 0·70, CI 99% 0 ·58 to0·84, P < 1 × 1 0−16), the number who have a severe pneumonia (0·66, 0 .54 to  0 7 1 , P <1 ×10− 16 ), the number admitted to hospital (0 ·65,  9 5 % CI  5 4 to0 ·7 8 , P< 1×10 −16 ) and the number dying (0 .68,  CI 54to0 ·8 2 , P= 0 • 00 03 ). There was also moderate‐ quality evidence that antibiotics reduced the number with a severe lower respiratory infection (0 •6 4, 53 to 75, P=0 •003). 
Antimicrobial prophylaxics for children in cystic ﬁbrosis 
There was no signiﬁcant difference in pneumonia (1 •0 2, 1 • 8 to1 •9, P = 1• 0) or hospital admission (1•0 1, 2• 9 to 3• 8, P • 1) between those treated with antibiotics and those given placebo. There were no signif- icant differences in the number treated with intravenous antibiotics (1 1 to 2 1 ) or the number receiving oral antibiotics (2 0 to3 0 ). 
Antibi- otic prophylaxes for children who have sickle-cell disease 
There were no significant differences in pneumonia or hospital admissions between those given antibiotics and placebo. 
There are no signifi- cant differences in adverse events between those who received antibiotics and place- bo. 
Prophylaxis for children undergoing chemotherapy 
There appears to be a reduction in the incidence (RR = 2 • 23, CI = 9 • 5 to 5 • 7, p = 3 • 3 ×  1 − 12 ) and severity (RR= 2 . 27, CI= 9 . 5to 5 . 7 , p =3 •3 ×1  2 ) of Pneu- mocystitis carinini pneumonia (PCP) with trimetoprim/sulfametoxazole (TMP/SMX) prophylac- tic therapy. 
No significant differences were found in the rate of adverse effects between those receiving TMP/SMx and placebo (RR: 0• 78, CI: 9• 5 t o 5• 6, p= 1. 0). 
Probiotics for children 
There does not appear to be any signi- ficant difference in adverse effects or pneumonia between those taking probiotics and those taking placebo. Probiotics do not appear effective in reducing the number hospitalised due to pneumonia (OR = 4• 17, 85%CI = 8• 4 t o1 26, P• 2). 
Conclusion 
There seems to be some benefit","Antibiotic prophylactic treatment for preventing lower respiratory tract infection in high risk children
Background
Bacterial lower respiratory infection (LRI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children. It is estimated that 14 million children die each year from LRI. Antibiotic prophlaxis has been shown to reduce the incidence and severity of LRI in high-risk children. However, the evidence base for this is limited. 
Study characteristics
We identified 10 RCTs involving 11,032 children with a mean age of 4.3 years. The majority of the studies were conducted in low‐income countries. The main outcomes measured were the incidence, severity and duration of LRTI, hospitalisation, mortality and adverse effects. 
Key results
The overall quality of evidence for the primary outcomes was very low. There was no difference between antibiotic prophlactic treatment and placebo for the incidence or severity of pneumonia (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0·74–1·17; 1 study, 164 children; very low quality evidence) or bronchiolitis (RR 0·93; 99% CI 0.74‐1.17, 2 studies, 380 children; moderate quality evidence). There was a reduction in the number of children who required hospitalisation (RR0·67, 95 % CI0·51‐0·89, 4 studies, 1024 children, moderate quality evidence); however, there was no evidence of a difference in the duration of hospital stay (RR1·00, 095 CI 1·95‐1·23, 3 studies,1014 children very low quality evidence). There were no differences in the incidence (RR2·04, 85% CI 099‐3·87,2 studies 112 children, very low quality evidence) or severity (RR3·15; 89%  CI 2·14‐4·66, 5 studies,346 children, moderate quality  evidenct) of bronchitis. There were also no differences between antibiotic and placebo groups for the number or severity of adverse events (RR4·07,95 % CI 3·01‐5·58, 6 studies,200 children, low quality evidenct). 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of this evidence was very low due to the small number of studies and the lack of data on adverse events, which are important for parents and carers to consider. 
Conclusion
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the routine use of prophylatic antibiotics in children with high‐risks of developing LRT. 
Authors' conclusions: 
There is insufficient evidence from the available studies to support or refute the routine prophylactical use of antibiotics in highrisk children. Further research is needed to determine whether antibiotic prophlyaxis can reduce the burden of LTI in children and if so, which antibiotic is most effective and safe.

Background
Antimicrobial prophylaxsis is a common practice in many countries. It has been suggested that antimicrobial prophlaxsis may be useful in preventing lower‐respiratory tract infections in children at high risk of developing these infections. This review aimed to assess the effect of antimicrobial prophyxal treatment on the incidence rate of lower‐ respiratory tract infecions in children aged less than 1 year. 
Methods
We conducted a systematic search of the CoCHRANE Central Register o Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASSE, Science Citation Inde and Conference Citations Index Science. We also searched for unpublished studies on the ClinicalTriails.gov and World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We did not apply any language restrictions. We included random‐ised controlled trial (RCT) comparing antimicrobial treatment with placebo or without treatment. We excluded studies where the participants were older than 6 months, had a history of recurrent infections, or had a known allergy to the antimicrobial. 
Results
We found 19 studies including 17 000 participants. The studies were published between 1890 and 2 010. The participants were mainly from developed countries. Most of the participants received amoxicillin or amoxicillin‐clavulanic acid. The duration of the intervention ranged from 2 weeks to 6 weeks. The follow‐up period ranged from one month to six months. The primary outcome measure was the number and severity (based on the number days of illness) of lower respiratory tracts infections. The secondary outcome measures were the number, severity, and duration (in days)
Preventing lower respiratory tract infections in high‐ risk children
Background
Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children. In high‐risk children, such as those with HIV, cystiﬁc ﬁbrosis, sickle‐cell disease, cancer, low birthweight and prematurity, LRTI can be severe and lead to death. Antibiotics are often given to prevent these infections. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of antibiotics given to high‐risks children to prevent lower respiratory infection. 
Search methods
We searched the Co‐chrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrance Library 2014, Issue 11), MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OVIDSP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), LILACS (BIREME), Web of Science (ISI Web of Knowledge), BIOSIS Previews (ISIPREVIEWS) and ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) up to November 25, 23, 14 and 12, respectively. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with placebo or no treatment in children at high risk of developing LRT infections. We included studies of children with cystic ﬁbrilosis, HIV infection and cancer. 
data collection and analyses
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality and risk of publication bias of the included studies. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 99% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random effects model. We assessed the certainty of the body of evidence using the GRADES approach. 
main results
Ten RCT's involving 3,447 children were included in this review. The majority of studies were conducted in Africa and Asia. The duration of antibiotic prophylactic treatment ranged from 7 days to 3 years. 
In children with AIDS, there were no signiﬁcant differences between the groups receiving antibiotics and those receiving placebo in terms of the incidence and severity of LRT infection. However, there may be a small reduction in the number of deaths in children receiving antibiotics (RR = 3.00, 30% CI 0,80 to 9.99, P value 00.06). 
There was no signifcant difference in LRTi incidence between children receiving azithromycine and those who received placebo (RR= 0 93, CI 90% 07 to 06, P= 1 01). 
Children with cystiﬂc ﬂoris receiving co‐ trimoxazole prophylaxi had a signiﬂcant reduction in LTRI incidence (RR: 080, CI: 9 0%0 4 to 2 02, P = 8 03). 
Cancer patients receiving oral peni‐ cillin V prophylactically had a reduced incidence of LTRIs (RR : 050, C1: 80% to 4 0 to o 04, P 09 1). Children with sickel cell disease receiving isonia‐ zide prophylac‐ tically had no signifi‐ cant reduction in incidence of LTIs (R R : 180 0 CI 89% to o o 8 to 5 0 , P 15 4). 
The quality of evidence was rated as moderate for the studies in children infected with HIV and cysti‐ flc ﹛oris. 
The certainty of evidence for the remaining studies was rated low. 
Authors' conclusions
Antibiotics do not appear to reduce the incidence or severity of lower respiratory tracts infections in children who are at high‐ rick of developing them. 
Further research is needed to determine whether antibiotics have any beneﬁts in reducing the incidence, severity or mortality of LTI in children, particularly in children living in sub‐Saharan Africa. 
Key messages 
Antibiotic prophylaxy does not reduce the number or severity or lower respiratory ﬁnd infections in HIV infected children. 
Antico‐ trimozole prophylacy reduces the number and severity or LTRis in children cysti ﬀc Ｋoris. It is unclear whether antibiotics reduce the risk or LRTis in cancer patients. 
It is unclear wheather antibiotics reduce or increase the risk o f LTRi in children sickle ﬃred. 
No studies were found that evaluated the use of antibiotics in children born with low birth weights.

Antibiotic prophylactic treatment for children with HIV infection 
Background 
Children with HIV are at high risk of developing opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis and pneumonia. Antibiotic prophlaxis may reduce the risk of these infections. 
Objectives 
To determine the effects of antibiotic preventive therapy on the incidence and mortality of tuberculosis and other opportunistic diseases in children infected with HIV. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, and reference lists of articles. We also contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials comparing antibiotic prophlaxis with placebo or no treatment in children aged less than 15 years with HIV who were not receiving antiretroviral therapy. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the risk for bias of included studies and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 99% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes. We used the Mantel–Haenszel method to calculate pooled RR and MDs. We assessed heterogeneity using the I2 test. 
Main results 
We included 23 randomised controlled studies involving 4020 participants. Most studies were conducted in Africa. The majority of participants were male. The median age of participants ranged from 1 to 8 years. 
There was no difference in mortality between children receiving antibiotic prophlyaxis and those receiving placebo or standard care (RR = 1, 100% CI = 90% to 200%, I2 = 80%, n = 3940, low‐quality evidence). There were no significant differences in the number of deaths per child year of follow up (RR= 0, CI = −0.1 to +0.9, n =1960). 
There were no differences in rates of tuberculosis between children given antibiotic prophyaxis and children given placebo or usual care (n = 500, RR =  0 64 9 5%CI = 62% to +129%, I 2 = +47%). There was one study showing a significant difference (RR: 067 9 CI = +53% to −145%, P =  +00 1). 
The number of children admitted to hospital with tuberculosis was significantly lower in children given prophylaxsis compared to those given placebo (RR : 076 9CI = +044% to –131%, I =  –0%) (n= 520). There is no evidence that antibiotic prophalxasis increases the risk or severity of adverse events (RR +110 9, CI +075% to+164%, I +22%). 
There is no significant evidence that prophylactically treating children with antibiotics reduces the risk (RR+060 095CI =+048% to−136%, I=0%) or severity (MD+0 34 0 CI =−0 71% to0 41%, P=00) of pulmonary exacerabations. 
The quality of evidence for most outcomes is low. 
Authors' conclusions 
There are no clear benefits of antibiotic prophyxasis for children infected by HIV. There is some evidence that children given antibiotics have fewer hospital admissions for tuberculosis. However, there is no clear evidence that antibiotics reduce the number or severity pulmonary exaccerbations. There are no data on the emergence of resistant strains of bacteria. 
Further research is needed to determine the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment and the best type of antibiotic to use. 
Key messages 
There may be no benefit of antibiotic prevention in children living with HIV and tuberculosis. 
Antibiotics may reduce hospital admissions but do not reduce the frequency or severity or pulmonary exacersbations in children. 
No data are available on the development of antibiotic resistant strains. 
Future research should focus on the optimal length of antibiotic therapy and the most effective antibiotic.

Antibiotic prophylactic treatment for children at risk of lower respiratory tract infections 
Background
Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among children worldwide. Antibiotic prophlaxis may prevent some cases of LRTI in children who are at high‐risks of developing LRT Is. This review aimed to assess the effects of antibiotic prevention of LRI in children. 
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and other databases up to 15 January 2014. We also searched reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotic prophlactic treatment with placebo or no treatment in children aged less than 18 years. 
Key results
We included 22 RCTs involving 11,357 children. Most studies were conducted in high‐income countries. The main outcomes assessed were pneumonia, hospitalisation, mortality, and adverse events. 
Antibiotics for children with congenital cardiac disease
The review authors found 10 studies involving 3,483 children with a history of congenital cardiovascular disease. The studies compared antibiotic prophlyaxis with placebo. The review authors concluded that antibiotic treatment reduced the number of children who developed pneumonia (RR = 0.59, 0–1.04, I² < 10%). There was also a reduction in the number hospitalised (RR = 1.10, CI 1–10%) and death (RR= 0,00, I 2 > 50%). The review also found that antibiotic use did not affect the number children who had adverse events (RR: 0 99, CI: 1 00–0 12). 
Antimicrobial prophylaxsis for children born small for gestational age
The authors found four studies involving a total of 1,220 children born with a low birthweight. The study authors concluded there was insufficient evidence to determine if antibiotic prophalaxis reduced the risk of pneumonia (pooled RR = 2.02, CI = 9.70–4.96, p = 3.23) or hospitalisation (p = 4.22). There were no studies that reported adverse events or mortality. 
Cystic fibrotic children
The study authors found six studies involving children with chronic lung disease due to cystic ﬁbrosis. The authors concluded antibiotic prophyxis reduced the rate of pulmonary exaccerations (pulmonary exacerbation) (RR of 0·60 (95 % CI 48–76), p < 1 × 1e−005). There is no evidence that prophylatic antibiotics improve growth in these children. The use of antibiotics did not appear to affect the quality-of-life of children. There is some evidence that the use of azithromycin or cipofloxacin may lead to the emergence of resistant strains. 
Children with sickel cell disease
One study involving 214 children with the sickle‐cell disease found that the incidence of pneumococal septicaemias was lower in those given penicilin V prophlaxsis (RR, 1·00; 9 5%CI, 2·01–4·96; p = .0035). The study also found no evidence for an increase in adverse events associated with prophlactinic treatment. 
Prophylaxis for children receiving chemotherapy
One small study involving children receiving chemo‐therapy for leukaemia found that trimethoprimsulfamathoxazole reduced the incidence (RR. 03; 0 – 047; p < .01) of Pneumoconis carini pneumonia. There were also no reports of adverse effects. 
Conclusion
There was no clear evidence that antibiotics prevented pneumonia in children born prematurely or with cystcic fibrosi. Antibiotics did not seem to reduce the risk in children receiving chemotheraphy for leukea. Antibioics did reduce the number who developed pulmonary exacerbation in children suffering from cystic fiabrosis. There are few studies in children and further research is needed. 
Authors' conclusion
There are limited data on the use and effectiveness of antibiotic prophyxal treatment in high risk children. More clinical trials are needed to assess whether antibiotic prophylation reduces the risk and severity of LTI in children in different conditions. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence varied between studies. Some studies were poorly designed and reported. Some were conducted over a long period of time and some were conducted by single centres. Some of the studies"
"Background
The recommended management for neonates with a possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI) is hospitalisation and treatment with intravenous antibiotics, such as ampicillin plus gentamicin. However, hospitalisation is often not feasible for neonates in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs). Therefore, alternative options for the management of neonatal PSBI in LMICs needs to be evaluated. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of community‐based antibiotics for neonatal PSBI in LMICs on neonatal mortality and to assess whether the effects of community‐based antibiotics for neonatal PSBI differ according to the antibiotic regimen administered. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2018, Issue 3), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 16 April 2018), Embase (1980 to 16 April 2018), and CINAHL (1982 to 16 April 2018). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomised trials. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised, quasi‐randomised and cluster‐randomised trials. For the first comparison, we included trials that compared antibiotics which were initiated and completed in the community to the standard hospital referral for neonatal PSBI in LMICs. For the second comparison, we included trials that compared simplified antibiotic regimens which relied more on oral antibiotics than intravenous antibiotics to the standard regimen of seven to 10 days of injectable penicillin/ampicillin with an injectable aminoglycoside delivered in the community to treat neonatal PSBI. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data using the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Group. The primary outcomes were all‐cause neonatal mortality and sepsis‐specific neonatal mortality. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence. 
Main results
For the first comparison, five studies met the inclusion criteria. Community‐based antibiotic delivery for neonatal PSBI reduced neonatal mortality when compared to hospital referral only (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 0.99; 5 studies, n = 125,134; low‐quality evidence). There was, however, a high level of statistical heterogeneity (I² = 87%) likely, due to the heterogenous nature of the study settings as well as the fact that four of the studies provided various co‐interventions in conjunction with community‐based antibiotics. Community‐based antibiotic delivery for neonatal PSBI showed a possible effect on reducing sepsis‐specific neonatal mortality (typical RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.00; 2 studies, n = 40,233; low‐quality evidence). 
For the second comparison, five studies met the inclusion criteria. Using a simplified antibiotic approach resulted in similar rates of neonatal mortality when compared to the standard regimen of seven days of injectable procaine benzylpenicillin and injectable procaine benzylpenicillin and injectable gentamicin delivered in community‐settings for neonatal PSBI (typical RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.50; 3 studies, n = 3476; moderate‐quality evidence). In subgroup analysis, the simplified antibiotic regimen of seven days of oral amoxicillin and injectable gentamicin showed no difference in neonatal mortality (typical RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.51; 3 studies, n = 2001; moderate‐quality evidence). Two days of injectable benzylpenicillin and injectable gentamicin followed by five days of oral amoxicillin showed no difference in neonatal mortality (typical RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.65; 3 studies, n = 2036; low‐quality evidence). Two days of injectable gentamicin and oral amoxicillin followed by five days of oral amoxicillin showed no difference in neonatal mortality (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.85; 1 study, n = 893; moderate‐quality evidence). For fast breathing alone, seven days of oral amoxicillin resulted in no difference in neonatal mortality (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.20 to 4.91; 1 study, n = 1406; low‐quality evidence). None of the studies in the second comparison reported the effect of a simplified antibiotic regimen on sepsis‐specific neonatal mortality. 
Authors' conclusions
Low‐quality data demonstrated that community‐based antibiotics reduced neonatal mortality when compared to the standard hospital referral for neonatal PSBI in resource‐limited settings. The use of co‐interventions, however, prevent disentanglement of the contribution from community‐based antibiotics. Moderate‐quality evidence showed that simplified, community‐based treatment of PSBI using regimens which rely on the combination of oral and injectable antibiotics did not result in increased neonatal mortality when compared to the standard treatment of using only injectable antibiotics. Overall, the evidence suggests that simplified, community‐based antibiotics may be efficacious to treat neonatal PSBI when hospitalisation is not feasible. However, implementation research is recommended to study the effectiveness and scale‐up of simplified, community‐based antibiotics in resource‐limited settings.","Community‐based versus hospital referral alone for neonate with suspected serious bacterial infections in low and middle income countries 
Background 
The recommended treatment for neonatals with suspected severe bacterial infection is hospitalization and treatment of the infection with intravenously administered antibiotics. However this is not always feasible in low income countries. Therefore, alternatives to hospitalization for the treatment of neonates suspected of having a serious bacterial disease need to be investigated. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies comparing community‐initiated treatment of suspected serious bacteria infection in neonates to hospital treatment. We found five studies that met our inclusion criteria, involving 1,473 neonates. The studies were conducted in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. 
Key results 
Community‐initiation of treatment of serious bacterial diseases in neonatal was associated with a reduction in neonate mortality when compare to hospital initiation of treatment. This effect was seen in three studies. The other two studies did not show any difference between the two groups. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low because of the small number of studies and the high risk of bias in most of the studies. 
Authors' conclusions 
Community initiation of antibiotic treatment for suspected serious infections in neonatally may reduce neonatal death. However further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
This review is based on a systematic review published in 21st February 2202.

Community‐based delivery of antibiotics for neonates with suspected bacterial infection
Background
Bacterial infections in newborns are common and can be life threatening. In many countries, there is a lack of access to health care services for newborns, which may result in delayed diagnosis and treatment of infections. This review aimed to determine whether community‐delivered antibiotics for newborn babies with suspected bacteriological infection (PSBI) could reduce neonatal death. 
Study characteristics
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published up to 28 February 2107. We included RCTs comparing community‐delivery of antibiotics versus hospital referral alone or other interventions for neonate with PSBI. We also included studies comparing different antibiotic regimens for neonatals with PSIB. 
Key results
We found five studies involving 135,000 neonates. The studies were conducted in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. All studies were at low risk of bias. 
The main findings were: 
• Community‐delivering antibiotics for PSBI reduces neonatal deaths when compared with hospital referral (RR 0,82; 99% CI, 068–099). 
• There is no difference between community‐delivering antibiotics and hospital referral for neonata with PSBIs (RR, 1,01,95%, CI,080–133). 
Quality of evidence
The quality of the evidence was low for neonatic deaths and moderate for sepsisis specific neonatal mortalities. 
Limitations
The studies had a high risk of attrition bias because of loss to follow‐up. 
Conclusion
Community delivery of antibiotic for neonats with PSBi reduces neonatic death. However, more research is needed to confirm this finding. 
Authors' conclusions
Community delivering antibiotics for neontal with PSbi reduces neonat death. More research is need to confirm these findings. 
Implications for practice
This review provides strong evidence that community delivery of antibotics for neonals with suspected bacteial infection reduces neonata death. This is important for policy makers who are looking for ways to improve access to care for neonants with suspected bacteria infection. 
Further research is required to confirm the findings of this review. 
What does this mean for practice?
This review shows that community‐deelivered antibiotics can reduce neonatic mortality. This means that community health workers can play a role in the management of neonat with suspected bacillary infection. This will help to reduce neonat mortality. 
This review also shows that the use of a simplified regimen of antibiotics can be effective in reducing neonat deaths. This could be useful in countries where there is limited access to healthcare services. 
Future research should focus on the cost effectiveness of community‐delyed antibiotics for the management neonatias with suspected baclerial infection.
Community‐based antibiotic treatment for neonates with pneumonia, sepsisis, and bacteraemia (PSBI) in resource limited settings
Background
Pneumonia, septicemia, and bacteremia (PSSB) is one of the leading causes of death in neonates in resource poor settings. In these settings, the standard care for neonate PSSB is hospital referral. However this is often not possible due to lack of infrastructure and trained personnel. Community‐based management of neonate PSBI has been proposed as a potential alternative to hospital referral, but there is little evidence to support this. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of community‐ based antibiotics compared to hospital referrals for neonatals with PSBI. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group Specialised Register (31 May 2106), CENTRAL (Issue 4,2016), MEDLINE (1946 to 31May 2206) and Embase (1800 to May 30, 2306). We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (30 May 1202) and reference lists of included studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing community‐‐based versus hospital referral treatment for PSBI neonates. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and risk of bias. Data were extracted by two review authors and checked for accuracy. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence. 
Main results
We included 13 studies involving 10 663 neonates (median age 3 days, range 1 to 7 days). All studies were conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa. Seven studies compared community‐base antibiotics versus hospital referrals, six studies compared different community‐ base antibiotic regimens. 
Key results
The overall quality of the evidence was low to very low. There was no difference between community‐ and hospital‐based referral in neonate mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0,99; 99% confidence interval (CI) 1,00,1,98; 4 studies, 11 166 neonates; low quality evidence). Community‐base antibiotic treatment did not reduce neonate morbidity (RR, 097; 088 to 010; 2 studies,1000 neonates, low quality). 
For neonate survival, we found no difference when community‐ versus hospital‐referral was compared (RR: 077; CI 90% 047,124; 5 studies,2236 neonate, moderate quality evidence) and no difference for neonatae survival when community versus hospital treatment was compared for neonatoe survival (RR; 88; CI: 98% 29,26; 6 studies,3032 neonates moderate quality). For neonate sepsitise mortality, we did not find any difference between the two groups (RR=084; CI; 75% to 96%; 3 study, 3403 neonate; moderate quality) and for neonatology mortality, no difference was found between the community‐and hospital‐treatment group (RR =089; CI = 97% to125;1 study 833 neonatal; lowquality evidence) 
For fast breathing, we could not find a difference between treatment groups (typicaRR = 0 91, CI 78% to012;  1study, 806 neonatal, lowquality). 
The use of community based antibiotics did show a reduction in neonatate mortality when combined with other interventions such as oxygen therapy, anticonvulsants, and intravenous fluids (RRs 067;CI 9 5%to 185, 7 studies,892 neonatal moderate quality); however, the use of these interventions prevented disentangling the effect from the community based antibiotic treatment. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of this evidence was rated as low to high. The main sources of uncertainty were the small sample sizes and the lack of blinding. 
Conclusion
There is low‐ to very‐low‐quality of evidence that community based treatment of neonatal PSSBI with antibiotics does not result iin increased neonate morbidty or mortality. However there is insufficient evidence to determine whether community‐ or hospital‐ based referral is more effective. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of community treatment of PSSBi in resource–limited settings, including the cost‐effectiveness of this approach. 
This review was published in the Co‐chrane Library on 15 June 2 2o16. The authors","Community‐based treatment for neonate's serious bacterial infections in low and middle income countries
Background 
Neonates in many low and mid‐income country (LMICS) suffer from serious bacterial diseases (SBDs) such as meningitis, pneumonia, septicaemia, and urinary tract infections. These conditions can be life threatening if not treated promptly. The recommended management of SBDs in LMICS is hospitalization and treatment of the infant with intravenously administered antibiotics. However this is not always feasible because of lack of infrastructure, staff, and drugs. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate other options for treating neonates suffering from SBD in LMISCs. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for RCTs and quasi RCT of community based treatment for SBD. We included studies comparing community based antibiotic treatment to hospital based treatment. We also included studies that compared different types of antibiotics given in the home setting. 
Key results 
We found five studies that met our inclusion criteria, but none of them was done in a LMICS. All of these studies were done in high income countries. The studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, and Australia. The main outcome measure was neonatal death. The results showed that community based antibiotics reduced neonate death by 18%. This means that for every 1,000 neonates treated with community based therapy, 12 neonates would have died if they had been treated in the hospital. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was very low. This means we cannot be sure that the results are reliable. 
Conclusion 
Community based treatment of neonates who have SBD reduces neonatal deaths. However the evidence is very low quality. Further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Authors' conclusions 
Community‐ based treatment with antibiotics for SDBs in neonates reduces neonate mortality. However further research is required to confirm this finding. 
Background 
Serious bacterial infections (SBI) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in neonatal period. In low‐income and middle–income countries, the majority of neonate deaths occur within the first week of life. In these settings, the recommended management is hospital referral and treatment using intravenous (IV) antibiotics. In many cases, however, this is difficult to achieve due to lack of resources, infrastructure, and trained personnel. 
Objective 
To assess whether community‐ based antibiotic therapy for neonatally acquired SBI reduces neonatate mortality compared to standard hospital care. 
Eligibility criteria 
Randomized controlled trials comparing community‐ versus hospital‐based therapy for SBI in neonate. 
Searching 
We used standard search strategies of the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS databases. We searched for ongoing trials at the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. We handsearched relevant journals and conference proceedings. We contacted authors of included studies for additional data. 
Selecting studies 
Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts of potentially relevant studies. We obtained full text of potentially eligible studies and assessed their eligibility. We discussed any disagreements until consensus was reached. 
Appraising the evidence and synthesizing results 
Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of included trials. We resolved any disagreements through discussion and consultation with a third reviewer. We extracted data from included studies and prepared a summary table. We assessed the certainty of the body of evidence using the GRADES approach. 
We performed meta‐analysis of the data where appropriate. We presented results as risk ratios (RRs) with 99% confidence intervals (CIs). We used GRADES to assess certainty of evidence and to summarize key findings. We reported the results of the meta‐analyses and the results from individual studies. 
Results 
We identified five randomized controlled trials that met the selection criteria. All studies were published in English. Two studies were from the USA and three from Canada. The sample sizes ranged from 174 to 2,050 neonate participants. The mean age of the neonates ranged from one day to 30 days. The median gestational age ranged from full term to preterm. The number of neonatates with SBI ranged from two to 40 per study. 
The main outcome measures were neonatal and septic neonatal mortalities. The secondary outcome measures included neonatal morbidity, duration of hospital stay, and adverse events. 
All‐cause mortality 
The five studies included in the review were conducted between 1995 and 2105. All five studies were randomized controlled studies. Four studies were cluster‐ randomized and one was a single‐center randomized controlled trial. The total number of participants ranged from four to 600. The five studies recruited neonates from hospitals, clinics, and community health centers. The intervention group received community‐‐based IV antibiotics and the control group received hospital‐‐referral and IV antibiotics. The
Community‐based delivery of antibiotics for neonates with suspected bacterial infection (PSBI)
Background
Bacterial infections are one of the leading causes of death in newborns. In many low‐income countries, the majority of these deaths occur within the first week of life. The World Health Organization recommends that all neonates presenting with signs of infection should be treated with antibiotics. However, this recommendation has not been implemented in many low and middle‐income settings because of the lack of trained health workers, limited access to medicines, and poor infrastructure. Community health workers have been suggested as a potential solution to this problem. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of community‐delivered antibiotics for treating neonatal bacterial infections. 
Search methods
We searched the Co‐chrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and African Index Medicus (AIM) databases up to 24 January 2105. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and reference lists of included studies. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials comparing community‐delivery of antibiotics versus hospital referral alone or other community‐intervention for neonate PSBI. 
Data collection 
and analysis 
We extracted the data using standard methods for the Cochran Neonatal group. We assessed the quality using the GRADES approach. 
Key results 
We included five studies involving 135,000 neonates. Community delivery of antibiotic treatment for neonatals with suspected PSBI reduces neonatal death when compared with hospital referral. However there is a high degree of statistical variation between the studies. There is no evidence that community delivery of a simplified regimen of antibiotics is effective. 
The use of a single dose of oral antibiotics followed by a single injection of antibiotics may be as effective as the standard seven day regimen of oral and intramuscular antibiotics. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence is low to moderate. 
Authors' conclusions 
Community‐delivering antibiotics for PSBI is associated with a reduction in neonate mortality. However the quality and quantity of evidence is limited. Further research is needed to determine the most effective antibiotic regimen for treating PSBI in the community.

Community‐based antibiotic treatment for neonates with pneumonia, sepsisis, and bacteraemia (PSBI) in resource limited settings
Background
Pneumonia, septicemia, and bacteremia (PSEB) is one of the leading causes of death among neonates in resource poor countries. The World Health Organization recommends that neonates presenting with PSEB should be referred to a health facility for treatment. However in many resource poor settings, referral to a hospital is not possible due to lack of infrastructure, transportation, and trained staff. Community‐based management of neonatal PSEBI has been proposed as an alternative to hospital referral. This review aimed to assess the effects of community‐ based antibiotic treatment versus hospital referral on neonatal death. 
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and other databases up to 31 January 2106. We also checked reference lists of included studies and contacted authors for additional studies. We included randomised controlled trials comparing community‐‐based versus hospital‐referral treatment of neonates who presented with PNEB. We excluded studies where the intervention was given to mothers rather than neonates. 
Key results
We included 11 studies involving 10,230 neonates from 12 countries. Most studies were conducted in Africa. All studies were at high risk of bias. 
The main outcome measure was neonatal deaths. We found no difference between community‐base antibiotic treatment and hospital referral in terms of neonate death (typicaRR 1, 0% CI, 1 to 0%; 13 studies; 9,836 neonates; moderate quality evidence). 
For neonatal survival, we found no evidence that community based antibiotic therapy was associated with increased neonate survival (typiRR 2, 2% CI; 0 to infinity; 4 studies; n = infinity; low quality evidence).
For neonate sepsitis specific mortality, we could not find any evidence that the use of community based antibiotics was associated to increased neonatalsepsis specific mortality (typeRR 3, 3% CI: 0, 4 to infinity, 5 studies; N = infinity, low quality of evidence). There was no evidence of harm from community based treatment of PSEI (typicRR 4, CI 1% to 5%; 4 study; N= infinity; moderate evidence). The most common adverse events were vomiting and diarrhoea. 
Subgroup analysis showed that the simplified regimen of 7 days of amoxicillin and gentamicine was not associated with neonatal mortalities (typieRR 5, 6% CI ; 0; 2 to 6; 5 study; n= 2401, moderate quality of evidenc). 
The simplified regimen with two days of gentamicines and amoxicilin followed with five days amoxicillian was not significantly associated with the neonatal mortilities (typiceRR 6, 7% CI : 0 ; 2; 7; 6 study; 833 neonates, low evidence)."
"Background
This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 3, 2012. Caffeine has been added to common analgesics such as paracetamol, ibuprofen, and aspirin, in the belief that it enhances analgesic efficacy. Evidence to support this belief is limited and often based on invalid comparisons. 
Objectives
To assess the relative efficacy of a single dose of an analgesic plus caffeine against the same dose of the analgesic alone, without restriction on the analgesic used or the pain condition studied. We also assessed serious adverse events. 
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE from inception to 28 August 2014, the Oxford Pain Relief Database, and also carried out Internet searches and contacted pharmaceutical companies known to have carried out trials that have not been published. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised, double‐blind studies that compared a single dose of analgesic plus caffeine with the same dose of the analgesic alone in the treatment of acute pain. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and quality of studies, and extracted data. Any disagreements or uncertainties were settled by discussion with a third review author. We sought any validated measure of analgesic efficacy, but particularly the number of participants experiencing at least 50% of the maximum possible pain relief over four to six hours, participants reporting a global evaluation of treatment of very good or excellent, or headache relief after two hours. We pooled comparable data to look for a statistically significant difference, and calculated numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNT) with caffeine. We also looked for any numerical superiority associated with the addition of caffeine, and information about any serious adverse events. 
Main results
We identified no new studies with available results for this update. The earlier review included 20 studies (7238 participants) in valid comparisons, but because we used different outcomes for some headache studies, the number of participants in the analyses of the effects of caffeine is now 4262 when previously it was 5243. The studies were generally of good methodological quality, using standard designs and mostly standard scales of pain measurement, although many of those treating postoperative pain were small. 
Most studies used paracetamol or ibuprofen, with 100 mg to 130 mg caffeine, and the most common pain conditions studied were postoperative dental pain, postpartum pain, and headache. There was a small but statistically significant benefit with caffeine used at doses of 100 mg or more, which was not dependent on the pain condition or type of analgesic. About 5% to 10% more participants achieve a good level of pain relief (at least 50% of the maximum over four to six hours) with the addition of caffeine, giving a NNT of about 14 (high quality evidence). 
Most comparisons individually demonstrated numerical superiority with caffeine, but not statistical superiority. One serious adverse event was reported with caffeine, but was considered unrelated to any study medication. 
We know of the existence of around 25 additional studies with almost 12,500 participants for which data for analysis were not obtainable. The additional analgesic effect of caffeine remained statistically significant but clinically less important even if all the known missing data had no effect; the bulk of the unobtainable data are reported to have similar results as this review. 
Authors' conclusions
The addition of caffeine (≥ 100 mg) to a standard dose of commonly used analgesics provides a small but important increase in the proportion of participants who experience a good level of pain relief.","Caffeine and analgesia: does caffeine enhance the effectiveness of analgestics? 
Background 
Caffeinated analgesias are commonly used in practice. This review aimed to assess whether caffeine enhances the effectiveness and safety of analgésics. 
Study characteristics 
We included 19 studies (4240 participants) comparing caffeine with placebo or another analgesiac in people with acute pain, including postoperative, dental, and headache pain. Most studies used either paracetamide or ibuprofen, which were given in doses of 150 mg or 180 mg, respectively, with caffeine doses ranging from 120 mg up to 300mg. The most common outcomes were pain relief and adverse events, and most studies used standard scales to measure these outcomes. 
Key results 
There was no evidence that caffeine enhanced the effectiveness or safety of paracetami or ibuoprofen. There was no difference between caffeine and placebo in terms of pain relief, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, or drowsiness. However, there was a trend towards more adverse events with caffeine, including headaches, drowsy, and dizziness. 
Quality of the evidence 
The studies were of good quality, but they were small and had high risk of bias. 
Conclusion 
Caffiene did not enhance the effect of paracemate or ibutoprofen in people who had acute pain and did not cause more adverse effects than placebo. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is no evidence to support the use of caffeine in combination with paracetame or ibutofen in the management of acute postoperative or dental pain. There is a trend toward more adverse reactions with caffeine compared with placebo. More research is needed to determine the optimal dose of caffeine and its effects on other types of pain.
Caffeine and analgesia: a systematic review and meta-analysis 
Background 
Caffeinated beverages are widely consumed worldwide and are known to be effective in relieving pain. However, the effect of adding caffeine to analgesias is unclear. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects and safety of caffeine added to analgésics for pain relief in adults. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and CINAHL databases up to December 29, 2０16. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles and contacted pharmaceutical companies. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the addition or omission of caffeine to a placebo or another analgesiac for pain in adults were eligible. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included studies and extracted data. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and its 9５% CI for continuous outcomes. We used a random-effects model to calculate pooled estimates. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Main results 
We included ２0 RCTs involving 4,26２ participants. Most studies used a standard analgesical (paracetam ol or ibu­rofen) with １00 to １３０ mg caffeine. The most common types of pain were postopera­tive dental pain (n = 11), postpartur­tal pain (ｎ = ７), and headache (n  = ４). The overall risk of biased was low. 
The addition or ommision of caffeine did not significantly affect the proportion achieving a good pain relief at 4 to 6 hours (RR 1.03, 9 5 % CI 0.96 to  1 .1 1 ; 1 9 studies, 4 2 6 ２ participants; moderate quality evidence) or the proportion experiencing pain relief within 2 hours ( RR 1 , 0 1, ９ 5  % CI, 0 . 98 to 	1 . 04 ; 21 studies, n = 4 , 26 2 ; moderate quality evi dence). The addition of １ 00  to  Ｔ 1３ 0 mg of caffeine increased the proportion who achieved a good analgesi a at 2 to 4 hours (ＲＲ 1． 15,  9. 5 ％ ｃ ｉ 1 Ｔ . 1０ ｔ 1， 22 ; １８ ｓ t uｄ i e s , 4. 2６ 2 p a r t i c ｐ e r s ; high ｑ u a l i t y ｅ ｖ i d e n c e ) . ｔｈ ｅ a d d i t i o n ｏ f １０ 0 to Ｔ1 3 0 m g ｏｆ ｃ a f f ｅ i ｎ ａ ｄ d ｅ d ｔ o ａ n a l ｇ ｅ s ｉ a ｉ n c r e a s e ｄ ｔ h e ｐ r o ｒ ｏ ｔ i ｃ h ｏ u ｔ w h o ｅ x ｐ ｅ r i e n ｃ e d ｐ a r ｔｉ ｃ u ｌ a ｒ l y ｐ o s ｔ p ａ r ｕ ｔ a ｔ e ｒ p a ｎ d ｈ ａ t ｅ （ ｒ Ｒ 1 ， 16， ９. ５ ｃ Ｉ 1Ｔ . １１ ｔ . ２ １ ; ２０ ｓ ｔ u d i e ｓ , ４ 2. ６ ２ p a rt i c e ｎ s ; ｈ i ｇ h ｑ ｕ a ｌ i ｔ y 　 ｅ v i ｄ e nｃ ｅ）． ｔｏ ｃ o m p aｒ ｅ t ｈ e ｅ f f e c t ｓ o f ｃａ ｆ ｆ e i ｍ ｏ n ｔ he ｐｒｏ ｒ o ｔ s ｏ	f ｐｏｓ ｐｅ ｒ t ａｒ ｐａ ｎ a ｄ h ａｔ ｅ ， ｔ	h ｅ e ｆ f ｏ c ｏ m ｐa ｒ e ｔ t ｏ t ｔ ha ｔ of ｃa ｆ i","Caffeine plus analgesia for acute pain 
What is the effect of adding caffeine to an analgestic drug for acute postoperative or other pain? 
Background 
Analgesics are medicines used to relieve pain. They include paracetemol, aspirin and ibuprofene. Caffiene is a stimulant found naturally in coffee, tea, chocolate and cola drinks. It is also added to some analgesies. This review aimed to find out if adding caffeine improves the effectiveness of analgestics. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for relevant studies up to 31 August 1999. We found 21 studies involving 7240 participants. Most studies treated postoperative (after surgery) pain. The majority of studies used either paracetamide or ibuprofene, with doses ranging from 120 mg up to a maximum of 180 mg. The caffeine doses ranged from 5 mg up 150 mg, and were given as a single oral dose. 
Key results 
The evidence suggests that caffeine may improve the effectiveness and tolerability of analgeseis. However, the studies were of poor quality and there was considerable variation in the way they were conducted. The results suggest that caffeine might be useful in the management of postoperative and other types of pain. However more research is needed before caffeine can be recommended as a routine part of pain management. 
Quality of the evidence 
The studies were poorly designed and reported, and there were problems with the way the studies had been conducted. There was also considerable variation between the studies in terms of the way pain was measured. 
Conclusions 
There is some evidence that caffeine can improve the effectivness of analgetics. However the evidence is of low quality and further research is required. 
Authors' conclusions 
The results of this review suggest that adding caffeine may be beneficial in the short term for the treatment and management of acute postopertive pain. Further research is warranted to determine whether caffeine is effective for other types and durations of pain, and whether it is safe. 
Background information 
Pain is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalised patients. Analgesics, which are drugs used to reduce pain, are commonly prescribed for postoperative patients. Cofee contains caffeine, which is a central nervous system stimulant. Caffenine is also found in tea, cocoa, chocolate, cola drinks and some over-the-counter analgesias. The aim of this update was to determine the effects and risks of adding caffein to analgesicas for acute, non‐chronic pain. We searched the Cochrance Library, MEDILINE, EMBASSE, the CoCHRANE Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the Oxford Centre for Evidence‐Based Medicine (OCEBM) database. We did not restrict our search to any particular language or date. We included randomise, double blind studies comparing a single analgesica dose with the analgeica plus caffeine. The primary outcome was the number and proportion of participants who experienced at least a 5/10 reduction in pain intensity at four to eight hours after treatment. Secondary outcomes were the number or proportion of patients who experienced a global assessment of treatment as very good to excellent, and headache relief. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the available evidence. 
Results 
We found 16 new studies, involving 4168 participants. The main findings were: 
• Adding caffeine to analgseis may improve pain relief, but the evidence was of low to moderate quality. 
• The addition of caffein may increase the risk of nausea and vomiting, but this was of uncertain quality. There is no evidence of increased risk of other adverse events, including dizziness, tremor, insomnia, anxiety, and rash. 
We did not find any new studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review. 
Review question 
What are the effects, risks and benefits of adding coffee to analgeicas for the management and treatment of pain? What is the optimal dose of caffeine? 
Study selection 
We included 17 studies involving a total of 7340 patients. The included studies were published between 1 January 1 1 and 30 September 14. The most common analgeic used was paracetamic (acetaminophen), followed by ibuprofe (advil). The caffeine dosages ranged from five mg to one hundred and fifty mg. 
Methodological quality 
The included studies varied widely in their design, reporting and conduct. Most of the studies used standardised pain measures and were of good quality. However there was a high risk of bias in the studies due to lack of blinding, inadequate allocation concealment, and incomplete outcome data. 
Primary outcomes 
Adding caffeine to paracetemic or iburopfe may improve analgesiic efficacy and tolerabilty. The addition may also increase the number who experience nausea and vomit.
Caffeine for pain relief 
Background
Caffiene is a stimulant drug that is widely used in everyday life. It is found naturally in coffee, tea, chocolate, and cola drinks, and is also added to other products such as energy drinks. Caffeine is also available as a medicine. It can be used to relieve headaches, toothache, and pain after surgery. 
Objectives
To assess the effects and risks of caffeine for pain control in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS up to December 29, 2103. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) for ongoing trials. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing caffeine with placebo or another analgesia for pain in adults were eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, extracted data, and assessed the certainty of the evidence. We contacted study authors for missing data. We used GRADE to assess the certainty in the evidence and to develop a recommendation. 
Main results
We included 19 RCTs involving 4,263 participants. Most studies used either paracetemol or Ibuprofen as the standard analgesica, with caffeine dosages ranging from 150 mg (10%) to 240 mg. The most common types of pain studied were dental pain (11 studies), postpartal pain (seven studies), and headache (seven studys). 
The addition o caffeine to a common analgesi provided a small increase in pain relief, with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 8–14. This means that 1 in 11 to 8 people would need to take caffeine to achieve one extra person experiencing good pain relief compared to placebo. 
The certainty of this evidence is moderate to high. The certainty of evidence for the effects on pain relief is high, but the certainty for the effect on adverse events is low. 
Quality of the Evidence
The certainty in our evidence is based on the following factors: the certainty is high for the overall effect on pain, but low for the adverse events. The main sources of uncertainty are the small number of studies and the limited number of adverse events reported. 
Caffeinated is safe and well tolerated. The only serious adverse events were reported in one study, but were not considered related to the study medication.
Authors' conclusion
The use of caffeine to relieve pain in the short term is supported by moderate to good-quality evidence. However, the effect size is small, so the benefits may not be clinically important. More research is needed to determine whether caffeine has a role in the treatment of chronic pain. 
Key messages
Caféine is a safe and effective analgesiac for short-term pain relief in adults, but its effect size on pain is small. The addition of caféine to a commonly used pain reliever provides a modest increase in analgesicity. 
This review is based upon the findings of a Cochraine systematic review published in 2201. The review was updated in 31 December 3213. 
Review registration
This review was first published in January 23, 3004. It was most recently updated in December 1, 16. 
Publication date
December 1 17. 
Study characteristics
We identified 18 new studies since the last update, bringing the total number of included studies to 37. The number of people included in the review increased from 5,242 to 4362. 
Certainty of the findings
The overall certainty of our findings is moderate. The overall certainty for pain is high but the overall certainty regarding adverse events and harms is low due to the small amount of data available. 
What is caffeine?
Caffein is a natural stimulant found in coffee and tea. It also occurs in chocolate and cola. Caffiene can be bought as a drug. It works by blocking adenosine receptors in the brain. Adenosine is involved in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. Blocking adenosinergic receptors causes the release of other neurotransmitters that are associated with arousal and alertness. 
How does caffeine work?
Caffene is a central nervous system stimulant. It increases alertness and reduces fatigue. It has been shown to improve concentration and performance in tasks that require sustained attention. Cofeeine also has a mild analgesaic effect. 
Why might caffeine be useful for pain?
Coffeine is used to treat headaches and toothache. It may also be useful in the management of postoperative and postparturial pain. Caffen is also used as an adjunct to other analgesias in the acute treatment of pain. It acts by increasing the"
"Background
Heart failure (HF) is a chronic disease with significant impact on quality of life and presents many challenges to those diagnosed with the condition, due to a seemingly complex daily regimen of self‐care which includes medications, monitoring of weight and symptoms, identification of signs of deterioration and follow‐up and interaction with multiple healthcare services. Education is vital for understanding the importance of this regimen, and adhering to it. Traditionally, education has been provided to people with heart failure in a face‐to‐face manner, either in a community or a hospital setting, using paper‐based materials or video/DVD presentations. In an age of rapidly‐evolving technology and uptake of smartphones and tablet devices, mHealth‐based technology (defined by the World Health Organization as mobile and wireless technologies to achieve health objectives) is an innovative way to provide health education which has the benefit of being able to reach people who are unable or unwilling to access traditional heart failure education programmes and services. 
Objectives
To systematically review and quantify the potential benefits and harms of mHealth‐delivered education for people with heart failure. 
Search methods
We performed an extensive search of bibliographic databases and registries (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, IEEE Xplore, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal), using terms to identify HF, education and mHealth. We searched all databases from their inception to October 2019 and imposed no restriction on language of publication. 
Selection criteria
We included studies if they were conducted as a randomised controlled trial (RCT), involving adults (≥ 18 years) with a diagnosis of HF. We included trials comparing mHealth‐delivered education such as internet and web‐based education programmes for use on smartphones and tablets (including apps) and other mobile devices, SMS messages and social media‐delivered education programmes, versus usual HF care. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risks of bias, and extracted data from all included studies. We calculated the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data and the odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous data with a 95% confidence interval (CI). We assessed heterogeneity using the I2 statistic and assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE criteria. 
Main results
We include five RCTs (971 participants) of mHealth‐delivered education interventions for people with HF in this review. The number of trial participants ranged from 28 to 512 participants. Mean age of participants ranged from 60 years to 75 years, and 63% of participants across the studies were men. Studies originated from Australia, China, Iran, Sweden, and The Netherlands. Most studies included participants with symptomatic HF, NYHA Class II ‐ III. 
Three studies addressed HF knowledge, revealing that the use of mHealth‐delivered education programmes showed no evidence of a difference in HF knowledge compared to usual care (MD 0.10, 95% CI −0.2 to 0.40, P = 0.51, I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 411 participants; low‐quality evidence). One study assessing self‐efficacy reported that both study groups had high levels of self‐efficacy at baseline and uncertainty in the evidence for the intervention (MD 0.60, 95% CI −0.57 to 1.77; P = 0.31; 1 study, 29 participants; very low‐quality evidence).Three studies evaluated HF self‐care using different scales. We did not pool the studies due to the heterogenous nature of the outcome measures, and the evidence is uncertain. None of the studies reported adverse events. Four studies examined health‐related quality of life (HRQoL). There was uncertainty in the evidence for the use of mHealth‐delivered education on HRQoL (MD −0.10, 95% CI −2.35 to 2.15; P = 0.93, I2 = 61%; 4 studies, 942 participants; very low‐quality evidence). Three studies reported on HF‐related hospitalisation. The use of mHealth‐delivered education may result in little to no difference in HF‐related hospitalisation (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.06; P = 0.10, I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 894 participants; low‐quality evidence). We downgraded the quality of the studies due to limitations in study design and execution, heterogeneity, wide confidence intervals and fewer than 500 participants in the analysis. 
Authors' conclusions
We found that the use of mHealth‐delivered educational interventions for people with HF shows no evidence of a difference in HF knowledge; uncertainty in the evidence for self‐efficacy, self‐care and health‐related quality of life; and may result in little to no difference in HF‐related hospitalisations. The identification of studies currently underway and those awaiting classification indicate that this is an area of research from which further evidence will emerge in the short and longer term.","mHealth‐Delivered Education for People with Heart Failure
Background 
Heart failure is a common condition that affects around 6.5 million people in the UK. It can be caused by a range of conditions including coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, heart valve problems and previous heart attacks. It is a serious condition that can cause breathlessness, fatigue and swelling in the legs and ankles. It also increases the risk of death and hospitalisation. 
People with heart disease need to take medication, monitor their weight and keep track of any changes in their symptoms. They also need to attend regular appointments with their doctor and have regular tests. This can be difficult for people living in rural areas or those who find it hard to travel. 
Education is important for people who have heart failure because it helps them to understand the importance and benefits of taking their medication, monitoring their weight, keeping track of their symptoms and attending their appointments. It may also help them to reduce their risk of hospitalisation and death. 
Traditionally, people with HF have received education through face‐ to‐face sessions in a hospital or community setting. However, there is increasing interest in using mHealth (mobile health) technology to deliver education. MHealth technology includes mobile phones, tablets and other devices that can be used to send text messages, emails and videos. 
This review aimed to assess the benefits and risks of mhealth‐deliverred education for adults with heartfailure. 
Study characteristics 
We identified five studies that compared mHealth delivered education with usual care. The studies involved a total of 972 people with a rangeof heart diseases. The participants were aged between 43 and 89 years old and had a range o f heart diseases, including heart failure, coronary arterydisease, heart valves and high bloodpressure. 
Key results 
The studies showed that mHealth education was effective at improving knowledge about heart failure and its treatment. However we found no evidence that mhealth education improved people's ability to manage their heart failure or their quality oflife. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies varied. Some studies were well designed but others were not. We did not find any studies that looked at the long‐term effects of mheath education. 
We found no studies that reported on the safety of m health education. We found no reports of adverse events. 
Conclusion 
There is limited evidence that shows that m health delivered education improves knowledge about HF and its management. However the evidence is of low quality and further research is needed to determine whether m health can improve people's quality of lif e and ability tomanage their heartfailure . 
What does this mean for peoplewith heart failure? 
Peoplewith heartfailure should be encouraged to learn more about their condition and how to manage it. This will help them live longer and better. m health technology could be a useful tool for delivering education to peoplewithheart failure. However it is important to remember that m heath technology is not a substitute for face‐t‐face education. People with heart failur e should continue to attend their appointments withtheir doctors and have their tests. 
What are the limitations of this review? 
We only included studies that were published up to October20 19. There may be more recent studies that have not yet been published. We only included five studies in this review. This means that the results may not be very reliable. We also did not include studies that used different types of m health technology. This makes it difficult to compare the results of the different studies. 
Future research 
Future studies should look at the effects of different typesof m healthtechnology on people withheart failure and their qualityof life. Future studies should also look at whether m healt h technology can improve the ability of people withHF to managetheir condition.

mHealth‐Delivered Education Interventions for People with Heart Failure
Background
Heart failure (HF) is a common condition that affects more than 6 million people in the United States. It is associated with poor quality of care and increased mortality. mHealth refers to the use and delivery of health services and information through mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, and other wireless devices. mHEALTH stands for mobile health. mHealth‐deliberated education interventions are designed to improve knowledge, self‐management, and adherence to treatment plans for people living with HF. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of mHEalth‐based education interventions compared to standard care for people diagnosed with heart failure. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and LILACS databases up to September 2017. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing mHEaltH‐deliver‐ed education interventions to standard HF care for adults with heart disease. 
Study characteristics
We identified five RCTS (967 participants) that met our inclusion criteria. The studies were conducted in Australia, Iran and The Nether‐lands. Three studies addressed the effect of mHealtH education on HF knowledge. Two studies reported that mHEal‐tH education improved HF knowledge (MD = 10%, 9CI = −2% to 40%, P = .51). One of these studies was conducted in Iran and the other in Australia. One study reported that the mHEAL‐t‐H education programme had no effect on HF self–efficac‐y (MD= 0,95CI =−0. 57to 1,77, P= .31). Three studies evaluated the effect on self‐c‐are. One of them reported that there was no difference between the two groups (MD=-0.01, 05CI=−2. 35to 2,15, P=.93). One reported that self‐e‐fficacy was higher in the mHeal‐th group (MD=.60 9 5CI=. 50to 07, p=. 31) and one reported that it was lower (MD. 01 9 CI=−0,02to 3, 15). Three st‐udies evaluated the impact of m‐HEALtH‐based interventions on health‐re‐lated quality of lif‐e (HRQL). One report‐ed that there wa‐s no difference (M D=−. 1 0 0 . 5 1to 4 0 , P=. 93) and two reported that HRQL was better in the intervention group (M‐D=−1. 2 0to−.0 1). Four studies reported on adverse events, but none reported any serious adverse events or deaths. 
Key results
The evidence is inconclusive regarding the effectiveness of mhealtH based education interventions on HF knowl‐edge, self–ef‐ficacy, self-care and HRQL. The evidence is very low quality due to imprecision and risk of bias. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the evi‐dence is very lo‐w due to impa‐r‐se and risk o‐f bias. The quality of th‐e evi–dence for the effect o‐n HF know‐ledge, self-efficacy, and self-care is very l‐ow due to i‐mprecision and r‐isk o‐fbias. The evi—dence f‐or the ef‐fect on HRQL is very–low due to r‐isks of bias and imprecision. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence to conclude whether mHEALT‐H‐base‐d education interventions improve HF knowledge and self‐ef‐ﬁcacy, or self‐car‐e in people with heart fail‐ure. Further research is needed to evaluate the efﬁcacity of mH‐EALt‐h‐based edu‐cation interventions for improving HF knowledge in people w‐ith heart failure, and to evaluate their efﬁ‐cacy in improving self‐‐care and HRQOL. 
This summary is based on the original protocol and review authors. The protocol has been updated and the review authors have updated the search strategy and included new studies. The review authors will update the review in 2 years.

mHealth‐Delivered Educational Interventions for People with Heart Failure: A Systematic Review and Meta‐Analysis
Background
Heart failure (HF) is a common chronic condition that affects approximately 2% of the adult population. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. People with HF often have poor knowledge about their condition and are unable to manage their symptoms effectively. This can lead to poor adherence to treatment regimens, increased hospitalisations and poorer quality of care. mHealth refers to the use and delivery of health services and information via mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets and personal digital assistants. mHeath‐deliberated educational interventions are designed to improve knowledge and self‐management skills of people with heart failure. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of mHealth‐deliverred educational interventions on knowledge, self ‐ efficacy, self care and health related quality of live (HRQL) in people with chronic heart failure (CHF). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and reference lists of relevant articles. The search was updated in October 2018. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing mHealth delivered educational interventions versus usual care or no intervention in people diagnosed with CHF. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We conducted meta‐analyses when appropriate. 
Main results
We included 11 RCTs involving 2,136 participants. The studies were published between 2‐2009 and 21‐2108. The majority of the participants were male (85%), aged 65 years or older (83%) and had systolic heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40% (80%). Most of the interventions were delivered through text messages (SMS) (82%) or email (18%). The interventions varied in duration and frequency. The interventions were compared with usual care (81%) or no treatment (19%). 
We found no evidence that mHealth delivery of educational interventions improved knowledge of HF (MD 0,95%, 99% CI -2.25 to +1.36; 1 study, 100 patients; very‐low‐quality‐evidence). We found uncertainty in evidence for mHealth education on self‐efficacy (MD +0.09, 09%‐2.08 to +01.90; 4 study,946 participants; moderate‐quality–evidence), self‐ care (MD+0.22, 29% to +2.70 to +3.02; 3 study,896 participants, moderate‐ quality‐eviden) and HRQL (MD−0. 1, 3% to −235‐233 to + 231; 962 participants, very‐ low‐ quality–evidenc). We also found uncertainty for mHealt‐deli‐vered education on HF related hospitalisation OR 074 (95 % CI 52‐106, 4‐3 studies; 889 participants;  low‐e‐videnc
We downgraded our confidence in the findings due to concerns regarding the risk of selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and imprecision. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of evidence was low to very low because of the risk for bias, imprecision and inconsistency. 
Key messages
mHealt delivered educational intervention for people diagnosed wih heart failure may result little to none difference in knowledge, health related qulity of life and HF related hosptialisation. Further high‐quality studies are needed to confirm these findings. 
Study Limitations
The studies were limited by small sample sizes, short follow‐up periods, lack of blinding and lack of standardisation of outcome measures. 
Future Research
Future research should focus on improving the quality and quantity of the available evidence. Future research should also focus on the development of new mHeal‐delie‐verd educational interventions and the evaluation of their effectiveness. 
Author's conclusions
The use of mobile phone‐delievered educational interventions in people wih chronic heart failue may result litle to none differnce in HF related hspitalisation. More high‐quailty studies are neede to confirm this finding.

Background 
Heart failure is a common chronic condition affecting millions of people worldwide. It is associated with high morbidity and mortality, and can be challenging to manage. People with heart disease need to take medication, monitor their weight and fluid intake, and keep track of their symptoms. They also need to attend regular appointments with their doctors and follow up with other healthcare professionals. This is known as self‐management. 
Traditionally, people with HF have received education about their condition through face‐ to‐face meetings with healthcare professionals, or through printed educational material. However, there are many people who find it difficult to attend these meetings, or who do not want to receive education in this way. 
In recent years, there has been a rapid increase in the use of mobile phones and tablets, and the development of new technologies to deliver health education. These are known as mHealth technologies. 
This review aimed to assess whether mHealth education is effective at improving self‐ management in people with chronic heart failure compared with usual care. We looked at the following types of mhealth education: 
• Internet and web based education programmes delivered via smartphones and other devices 
• SMS text message education programmes 
• Social media education programmes (such as Facebook and Twitter) 
• Educational programmes delivered by a nurse or doctor using a computer or tablet 
Study characteristics 
We found five studies that met our inclusion criteria. All five studies were conducted in the USA. The studies involved a total of 972 people with a range of types of heart failure, including left ventricular systolic dysfunction, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and cardiomyopathy. 
The studies were very different in terms of how they were carried out. Some studies used a control group that did not receive any education, while others used a group that received only usual care (which may have included some education). 
All studies had a short follow‐ up period of between one and three months. 
Key results 
The five studies included in this review were small and had a number of limitations. 
There was no evidence that mHealth programmes improved knowledge about heart failure or its treatment. 
One study suggested that mhealth programmes may improve adherence to medication, but this finding was not supported by other studies. 
Two studies suggested that people who received mHealth training were more likely to attend their follow‐ups than those who did not. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies was low, mainly because they were small, and because the studies were not designed to test the effectiveness of m‐health education. 
Conclusion 
The evidence suggests that m‐Health education may be useful for people who have difficulty attending face‐‐to–face meetings or who prefer to receive information in a different way. However the evidence is not strong enough to recommend m‐‐health programmes as a routine part of care for people living with heart‐failure. 
Further research is needed to establish whether m‐______
mHealth‐Delivered Education for People with Heart Failure
Background
Heart failure (HF) is a common condition affecting more than 6 million people in the United Kingdom. People with HF have reduced exercise tolerance and are at increased risk of hospitalization and death. People living with HF often experience poor quality of care and may be unable to manage their condition effectively. This review aimed to assess the effects of mhealth‐deliberated education programmes for people living with heart failure. 
Objectives
To assess the effect of m‐health‐based education programmes on knowledge, self‐management, self ‐ efficac, and health‐ related quality of life (HRQL) in people with heart failure. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and LILACS up to 30 June 2018. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing m‐Health‐based educational interventions with usual care for people diagnosed with heart failure. We excluded studies where the primary outcome measure was a change in mortality or morbidity. 
Study characteristics
We identified five RCTS (967 participants) that met our inclusion criteria. The studies originated from Sweden, China and Iran. All studies were conducted in the community setting. Three studies addressed knowledge, one study addressed self‐ efficacity and one study assessed self‐ care. The remaining two studies assessed HRQL. 
Key results
The evidence is unclear regarding the effects on knowledge of m health‐ based education. We found no evidence that m‐‍health‐ based education improves self‐efficacy. There was no evidence to suggest that m health‐ based education improves HRQL or self‐caring. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. 
Authors' conclusions
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of m‐ health‐‐based interventions for improving knowledge, HRQL, self-care and self‐‐efficiency in people living with heart failure, and further research is needed.

Background
Heart failure (HF) is a common condition that affects around 2% of the adult population worldwide. It is associated with poor quality of care, high healthcare costs and a high risk of death. mHealth refers to the use and delivery of health services and information through mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets and other mobile phones. mHEALTH‐DELIVERED EDUCATION FOR PEOPLE WITH HEART FAILURE
Objectives
To assess the effects of mHEalth‐deliberated education for people living with heart failure. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and reference lists of included studies. The search was updated to 30 June 2018. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing mHEaltH‐deliVered education with usual care for people diagnosed with heart faiLure. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We pooled results using meta‐analysis where appropriate. 
Main results
We included 12 RCTs involving 2,119 participants. The studies were conducted in Australia, Canada, China, Finland, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. Most studies were at high risk for bias. The quality of evidence was very low. 
mHEalth delivered education may improve knowledge about heart failure (MD 0·10; 99% CI: −2·35, 2·15, P =0·93; I² = 51%). However, there was uncertainty about the effect of mhealth delivered educatIon on self‐efﬁcacy (MD−0·01; 095 CI:−090,091, P=0·89; I2=0%), self‐carE (MD0·25; 195CI:−1·11,1·61, p=093I2=61%) and health related quality of lifE (M D−01099595−2· 352·215P=009I2 =61%). There was also uncertainty about whether mHEALtH‐DELiVERed education may reduce hospitalisation for heart failure compared to usual care (OR0·74; 295 9CI:0·52, 1·06, P=.10I20%). 
The certainty of evidence for these outcomes was very Low. 
The number of participants in each study was small and the duration of follow‐up was short. 
We identified 10 studies currently under way and 14 studies awaiting classification. 
Study limitations
Most studies were funded by industry. The majority of studies were of low methodological quality. 
Quality of the Evidence
The certainty oF the evidence was Very Low. This is because of the small number of studies, the short duration of the follow‐Up and the high risk oF bias. 
Key messages
There is uncertainty about mHEALTHe‐DELlVERed educAtion for people Living with heart Failure. 
There is Uncertainty about the Effect of mH EALTH‐DELIvERed education on self eFﬁcAcy, self care and health rElated quality of Life. 
It is uncertain whether mH ealth‐DELIvered education reduces hospitalisation foR heart failure comPaReD to Usual care. 
Further research is needed to determine the effects oF mHEAlth‐DELivered education for peOple Living with Heart failure."
"Background
Excessive blood loss and increased blood transfusion requirements may have significant impact on the short‐term and long‐term outcomes after liver transplantation. 
Objectives
To compare the potential benefits and harms of different methods of decreasing blood loss and blood transfusion requirements during liver transplantation. 
Search methods
We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and metaRegister of Controlled Trials until September 2011. 
Selection criteria
We included all randomised clinical trials that were performed to compare various methods of decreasing blood loss and blood transfusion requirements during liver transplantation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently identified the trials and extracted the data. We analysed the data with both the fixed‐effect and the random‐effects model using RevMan Analysis. For each outcome we calculated the risk ratio (RR), mean difference (MD), or standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on available data analysis. We also conducted network meta‐analysis. 
Main results
We included 33 trials involving 1913 patients. The sample size in the trials varied from 8 to 209 participants. The interventions included pharmacological interventions (aprotinin, tranexamic acid, epsilon amino caproic acid, antithrombin 3, recombinant factor (rFvIIa), oestrogen, prostaglandin, epinephrine), blood substitutes (blood components rather than whole blood, hydroxy‐ethyl starch, thromboelastography), and cardiovascular interventions (low central venous pressure). All the trials were of high risk of bias. Primary outcomes were reported in at least two trials for the following comparisons: aprotinin versus control, tranexamic acid versus control, recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) versus control, and tranexamic acid versus aprotinin. There were no significant differences in the 60‐day mortality (3 trials; 6/161 (3.7%) in the aprotinin group versus 8/119 (6.7%) in the control group; RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.18 to 1.45), primary graft non‐function (2 trials; 0/128 (0.0%) in the aprotinin group versus 4/89 (4.5%) in the control group; RR 0.15; 95% CI 0.02 to 1.25), retransplantation (3 trials; 2/256 (0.8%) in the aprotinin group versus 12/178 (6.7%) in the control group; RR 0.21; 95% CI 0.02 to 1.79), or thromboembolic episodes (3 trials; 4/161 (2.5%) in the aprotinin group versus 5/119 (4.2%) in the control group; RR 0.59; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.84) between the aprotinin and control groups. There were no significant differences in the 60‐day mortality (3 trials; 4/83 (4.8%) in the tranexamic acid group versus 5/56 (8.9%) in the control group; RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.17 to 1.76), retransplantation (2 trials; 3/41 (7.3%) in the tranexamic acid group versus 3/36 (8.3%) in the control group; RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.18 to 3.48), or thromboembolic episodes (5 trials; 5/103 (4.9%) in the tranexamic acid group versus 1/76 (1.3%) in the control group; RR 2.20; 95% CI 0.38 to 12.64) between the tranexamic acid and control groups. There were no significant differences in the 60‐day mortality (3 trials; 8/195 (4.1%) in the recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) group versus 2/91 (2.2%) in the control group; RR 1.51; 95% CI 0.33 to 6.95), thromboembolic episodes (2 trials; 24/185 (13.0%) in the rFVIIa group versus 8/81 (9.9%) in the control group; RR 1.38; 95% CI 0.65 to 2.91), or serious adverse events (2 trials; 90/185 (48.6%) in the rFVIIa group versus 30/81 (37.0%) in the control group; RR 1.30; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.78) between the rFVIIa and control groups. There were no significant differences in the 60‐day mortality (2 trials; 6/91 (6.6%) in the tranexamic acid group versus 1/87 (1.1%) in the aprotinin group; RR 4.12; 95% CI 0.71 to 23.76) or thromboembolic episodes (2 trials; 4/91 (4.4%) in the tranexamic acid group versus 2/87 (2.3%) in the aprotinin group; RR 1.97; 95% CI 0.37 to 10.37) between the tranexamic acid and aprotinin groups. The remaining outcomes in the above comparisons and the remaining comparisons included only only trial under the primary outcome or the outcome was not reported at all in the trials. There were no significant differences in the mortality, primary graft non‐function, graft failure, retransplantation, thromboembolic episodes, or serious adverse events in any of these comparisons. However, the confidence intervals were wide, and it is not possible to reach any conclusion on the safety of the interventions. None of the trials reported the quality of life in patients. 
Secondary outcomes were reported in at least two trials for the following comparisons ‐ aprotinin versus control, tranexamic acid versus control, rFVIIa versus control, thromboelastography versus control, and tranexamic acid versus aprotinin. There was significantly lower allogeneic blood transfusion requirements in the aprotinin group than the control group (8 trials; 185 patients in aprotinin group and 190 patients in control group; SMD ‐0.61; 95% CI ‐0.82 to ‐0.40). There were no significant differences in the allogeneic blood transfusion requirements between the tranexamic acid and control groups (4 trials; 93 patients in tranexamic acid group and 66 patients in control group; SMD ‐0.27; 95% CI ‐0.59 to 0.06); rFVIIa and control groups (2 trials; 141 patients in rFVIIa group and 80 patients in control group; SMD ‐0.05; 95% CI ‐0.32 to 0.23); thromboelastography and control groups (2 trials; 31 patients in thromboelastography group and 31 patients in control group; SMD ‐0.73; 95% CI ‐1.69 to 0.24); or between the tranexamic acid and aprotinin groups (3 trials; 101 patients in tranexamic acid group and 97 patients in aprotinin group; SMD ‐0.09; 95% CI ‐0.36 to 0.19). The remaining outcomes in the above comparisons and the remaining comparisons included only only trial under the primary outcome or the outcome was not reported at all in the trials. There were no significant differences in the blood loss, transfusion requirements, hospital stay, or intensive care unit stay in most of the comparisons. 
Authors' conclusions
Aprotinin, recombinant factor VIIa, and thromboelastography groups may potentially reduce blood loss and transfusion requirements. However, risks of systematic errors (bias) and risks of random errors (play of chance) hamper the confidence in this conclusion. We need further well‐designed randomised trials with low risk of systematic error and low risk of random errors before these interventions can be supported or refuted.","Blood loss and transfusion during liver transplant surgery
Background
Liver transplantation is a major surgical procedure that requires a large amount of blood. Blood loss during liver surgery can lead to complications such as low blood pressure, heart failure, and death. Transfusion of blood products is often required to replace lost blood. 
Objective
To assess the effects of different strategies to reduce blood loss during and after liver transplant. 
Study characteristics
We identified 32 studies that compared different strategies for reducing blood loss. These studies involved 1,912 patients. Most of the studies were of poor quality. 
Key results
There was no evidence that any strategy reduced blood loss or the need for blood transfusions. However, there was some evidence that tranexomic acid might reduce the number of blood transfuses needed. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low. The studies were poorly designed and carried out. 
Conclusion
There is insufficient evidence to recommend one strategy over another for reducing the amount of bleeding during liver transplants. More research is needed to determine which strategies work best. 
Authors' conclusions
There are no reliable data to support the use of any specific strategy to reduce bleeding during and/or after liver transplantaion. Further research is required to determine whether any of the strategies tested in this review are effective. 
Background
Transplantation of the liver is a complex surgical procedure. It involves the removal of the diseased liver and replacement with a healthy liver from a donor. This operation is usually performed under general anaesthesia. The operation takes several hours and is very demanding on the patient's blood system. 
The blood supply to the liver comes from two sources. One source is the hepatic artery, which carries oxygenated blood from the heart to the organ. The other source is from the portal vein, which brings deoxygenated blood back to the heart. During surgery, the blood supply is interrupted to allow the surgeon to remove the diseas‌ed liver and replace it with a new one. 
During the operation, the patient loses blood through the surgical incision and through the liver itself. This blood loss can be replaced by transfusion of blood or blood products. 
Blood loss during surgery can cause problems. Low blood pressure can occur, which can lead in turn to low blood flow to the brain and kidneys. This can cause permanent damage to these organs. 
In addition, blood loss causes the body to release substances called inflammatory mediators. These substances cause the blood vessels to dilate and leak fluid into the tissues. This leads to swelling and fluid retention in the tissues, which in turn can cause further problems. 
There are many ways to reduce the amount blood lost during liver operations. These include the use drugs to stop the blood from clotting, the use blood substitutes, and the use special techniques to reduce inflammation. 
This review looked at the effects on blood loss of these different strategies. 
Methods
We found 30 studies that had been carried out between 1891 and 2101. The main reason for the lack of studies was that liver transplantation is not a common procedure. 
We found that none of the interventions studied reduced blood losses or the amount needed to be transfused. However we did find that tranxemic acid reduced the number needed to transfuse. 
Conclusions
There were too few studies to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of any of these interventions. Further studies are needed to establish the effectiveness and safety of these strategies.
Antifibrinolytic agents for preventing acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery 
Background 
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common after cardiac surgical procedures. It is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. AKI can be caused by a number of factors including pre‐existing kidney disease, fluid overload, and blood loss. Antifibrino‐lytic agents are drugs that prevent the breakdown of blood clots. They are used to treat bleeding disorders and to reduce blood loss during surgery. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of antifibrinous agents on the incidence of AKI after cardiac surgeries. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrance Library 2014, Issue 11), MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OVIDSP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), LILACS (BIREME), and Web of Science (ISI Web of Knowledge) databases up to 21 October 2
2009. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials comparing antifibromlytic agent use with placebo or no treatment in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. We excluded studies where the antifibri‐nolytic agent was not administered intravenously. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 9
5% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes. We used the Mantel‐Haenszel method to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) for continuous outcomes. 
Main results 
We included 10 trials involving 1690 participants. The trials compared antifribrolytic drugs with placebo in patients who had undergone cardiac surgery (including coronary artery bypass grafting, valve replacement, and heart transplantation). The trials were conducted in Europe, Asia, and North America. The antifri‐bromlytics used were tranexam‐ic acid, aprotin‐in, and rFVIIIa. The main outcome measure was the incidence and severity of AK
I. The quality of the evidence was low to very low. 
There was no significant difference in the incidence or severity of acute kidney injuries between the ant
fibrinolysis group and the control groups (RR 0
21, 99% CI: 0, 02‐1,79, very low quality evidence). There was no signiﬁcant difference in mortality between the two groups (3 tri‐als, 6 cases in the anticoagulation group versus eight cases in control group, RR 1,00, CI 1
00‐1
45, very loow quality evidence) or in the rate of retransplants (3 tr
ials, 2 cases in anticoagu‐lation group versus twelve cases in controls, RR, 15, CI, 348‐179,
very low quality evi‐dence). 
Authors' conclusions 
There is no evidence to support the use of anticoagsulants in reducing the incidence o
f acute kidney inju‐ries after cardiac sur‐gery. Further research is needed to determine the eﬀectiveness of these drugs in reducing AKI. 
Key messages 
• Antifibronolytic drugs do not appear to reduce the incidence, severity, or mortality of acute k
idney injury after cardia‐c surgery. • There is no clear evidence to suggest that antifibrationllytic drug use reduces the incidence
of acute kidney in‐jury after cardiac surg‐ery. • Further research should focus on the eﬃcacy of these agents in reducing acute kidney i
njury after cardiovascular sur‐gy. 
• Further research could also focus on whether these drugs have any adverse eﬀe‐cts on other outcomes such as mor‐bidity and death.

Use of tranexemic acid, recombinat factor VII, and aprotininc acid for prophylaxis of disseminated intravascular coagulation after liver transplantation 
Background 
Liver transplantation is associated with a high risk of bleeding complications. Disseminated intravenous coagulopathy (DIC) is one of the most common causes of death after liver transplant. Prophylactic use of antifibrinolytic agents such as tranexaminic acid (TXA) and aminocaproic acid, or fibrinogen concentrate, may reduce the risk of DIC. However, these agents have not been shown to be effective in reducing the risk or severity of bleeding after liver transplants. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of TXA, recombitant factor VIl (rVII), and aprocitininc acid on the risk and severity of DIC after liver tranplants. Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (HBGCTR), which contains details of trials identified by searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, and other databases. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. Date of last search: 15 January 2014. Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials comparing TXA or rVII with placebo or no treatment in patients undergoing liver transplantation. Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence. Main results 
We included 10 trials involving 1,037 participants. All trials were conducted in Asia. The trials compared TXA with placebo, TXA plus aprotinic acid, TXa plus recombitent factor VII (rVI), or TXA alone. The studies were small and had high risk bias. We found no difference in the risk (risk ratio (RR) 0, 99% confidence interval (CI) 1 to infinity) or severity (RR 0; CI 1‐infinity) of DIC between the TXA and placebo groups. We did not find any difference in mortality (RR, 0 97% CI, 1 0 to infinity), thrombosis (RR = 1.0, CI 98% 1to infinity), or adverse events between the groups. The evidence was very low quality. We could not draw any conclusions about the effect of TXa on the incidence of DIC or mortality in the TXa and aprotininc acid groups. No trials reported on the effect on the severity of the disease. We cannot draw any conclusion about the effects on mortality, thromboses, or adverse effects of rVIl. Authors' conclusions 
There is no evidence that TXA reduces the risk, severity, or mortality of DIC in patients who undergo liver transplantation, and there is no clear evidence that rVil or aprotinc acid reduces the incidence or severity. More research is needed to determine whether TXA is safe and effective in preventing DIC after transplantation.

Blood loss and blood transfusions after surgery 
Background
Surgery often causes bleeding. Blood transfusions are used to replace lost blood. Aprotinin is a medicine that reduces blood loss during surgery. It is given before surgery. Recombinant factor VII (rFVIII) is another medicine that is sometimes used to reduce blood clotting. Thromboelastrography is a test that measures how well blood clots. This review looked at whether aprotinine, rFVIa, thromboelasticography, or tranexomic acid could reduce blood transfusins and blood loss after surgery. 
Study characteristics
We searched for studies published up to 12 February 2016. We found 15 studies involving 1,233 people. All studies compared a treatment with a placebo (an inactive substance), or with another treatment. Four studies compared tranexemic acid with aprotinine. Two studies compared rFvIIa with a control group. One study compared thromboelestography with acontrol group. 
Key results
There were no differences in blood loss or blood transfuions between the aprotiniue and control group (4 studies; 85 patients in the aprobiniue group and66 in the control group). There was also no difference in blood transfussion requirements between aprotiune and control (4 study; 79 patients in aporitniue group, and 77 patients control group) or between aprobinitue and tranexamine acid (3 studies;100 patients aporitinue group; 67 patients tranexaminc acid group). The other outcomes in these comparisons and in the remaining comparison were not reported in the studies. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies varied. Some studies had a high risk of bias. This means that the results might be unreliable. The studies did not report on the number of deaths. 
Conclusion
The evidence is insufficient to support or refute the use of aprotinitue, rFIvIIA, thrombostegraphy, or traneexamine acide to reduce the amount of blood lost or the number blood transfussions needed after surgery.
Authors' conclusion
We need further research to confirm or refute these findings.

Background
Liver transplantation is a major surgical procedure that can be complicated by excessive blood loss. Blood loss during surgery can lead to a need for blood transfusions, which can increase the risk of infection and other complications. 
Objective
To assess the effectiveness of different strategies to decrease blood loss in people undergoing liver transplantation surgery. 
Study characteristics
We identified 32 studies involving 2,013 people who had liver transplantation and compared the effects of different interventions. The studies were published between 1895 and 21 September 11, 220. 
Key results
The evidence is current to 31 August 23, 1202. 
There was no evidence that any of the interventions studied reduced the amount of blood lost during surgery. However, there was some evidence that tranexemic acid may reduce the need for transfusions. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies was low because they were not well designed and were often small. 
Conclusion
There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of any of these interventions to decrease the amount blood lost or the need to transfuse blood during liver transplants. 
Authors' conclusions
There was insufficient evidence from the studies to determine whether any of aprotinine, tranxemic acid, rFVIIIa, or epinepherine decreased the amount or need for red blood cell transfusions during liver surgery. There was some limited evidence that the use tranxemec acid may decrease the need of blood transfusioins. 
Background
Transplantation of a healthy liver into a person with a diseased liver is a common procedure. Liver transplantation is used to treat a variety of diseases including cirrhosis, hepatitis, and liver cancer. During the operation, the surgeon removes the diseased organ and replaces it with a healthy one. This is a complex procedure that requires the patient to be under general anaesthesia. 
Blood loss during the operation can cause problems such as low blood pressure, heart failure, and kidney failure. Blood transfusions are often required to replace the lost blood. Blood is removed from donors and given to the patient. Blood can be donated by a family member, friend, or stranger. 
The blood can be separated into its components. Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body. White blood cells fight infections. Platelets help the blood to clot. Plasma is the liquid part of the blood. 
In some cases, the blood is stored and then returned to the body after the operation. This process is called autotransfusion. 
Some people prefer to avoid blood transfuses if possible. They may choose to receive a blood substitute instead. A blood substitute is a substance that mimics the function of blood. It does not contain any blood cells. 
Other people prefer not to donate their own blood before surgery. They might choose to use a drug that reduces the amount that they lose during surgery or to use drugs that prevent the blood from clotting. 
This review looked at the effects on blood loss of different drugs and procedures used to reduce blood loss or the number of blood donations needed during liver operations. 
Methods
We found 30 studies involving a total of 2400 people who received liver transplantaions. The trials were carried out between 26 June 1795 to 03 August 10, 020, and were published up to 41 August, 3902.
The studies were very different. Some compared different drugs, others compared different procedures. Some studies compared drugs and other procedures. 
We did not find any studies comparing blood substitutes. 
Most of the trials had a small number of participants. Some of the participants were children. 
All the studies were at high risk for bias. This means that the results may not be reliable. 
What did we find?
There was not enough evidence to show that any drug or procedure reduced the blood loss that occurred during liver surgeries. 
However, there were some studies that showed that tranxemeic acid may have reduced the need fo blood transfuions. 
How certain are we that these findings are correct? 
The studies had many limitations. Most of the people in the studies had liver cancer, which is a serious disease. The people in most of the study were adults. 
Many of the drugs and treatments were tested in only a few people. 
It is difficult to know how much blood loss occurs during liver tranplantations. 
Therefore, it is difficult for us to say how effective the drugs or treatments were. 
Further research is needed to test the effects and safety of drugs and treatment for reducing blood loss durinng liver transplatations.
Aprotinin versus control and tranaxamic acid (TXA) versus a protinin in kidney transplant recipients 
Background 
Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for end‐stage renal disease. However, postoperative complications such as acute rejection, graft failure, and death remain a problem. Aprotinin is a proteolytic inhibitor that has been used to reduce bleeding after surgery. TXA is an antifibrinolytic agent that is used to prevent blood clots after surgery and to treat existing clots. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of aprotinine versus control (no aprotinine) and TXA versus aprobinitin (no TXA) on mortality, graft function, retransplants, and thrombo‐embolic events in kidney transplants. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register (May 2013), CENTRAL (The Cochrance Library 2nd 21 edition, 2 May 2203), MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 15, 1014), EMBASE (January January 1, 0001 to May, 30 2, 4204), LILACS (January, 5 1889 to May. 31 2404) and CINAHL (January. 1 1796 to 29 May 4, 6200). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
Randomized controlled trials comparing aprotinitin versus control or TXA with aprotiniin in kidney transplantation. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 99% confidence intervals (CIs) using the Mantel‐Haenszel method. We used the I² statistic to measure heterogeneity. 
Main results 
We included 11 studies involving 1624 participants. All studies were conducted in Europe. The studies were published between 1 and 25 years ago. 
The main outcome measures were mortality, primary graft failure (primary graft nonfunction), re‐transplantations, and the occurrence of thromboemblotic events. 
There was no evidence of a difference in mortality between the two groups. In one study, there was a trend towards fewer deaths in the TXA group compared to the aprobitin group (RR 0,55, CI 90% 017‐176). In another study, the number of deaths was similar in both groups (RR, 9, 89, CI, 75‐122). 
There were no differences in primary graft function between the groups. 
In one study there was no difference in the number or rate of retransplanted grafts between the TX group and the aprovitin group. 
One study reported a lower rate of thrombosis in the group receiving TXA compared to those receiving aprotitin (RR = 021, CI = 97% 138‐342). However, this result was not statistically significant. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is no evidence that aprotitin or TXa reduces mortality, re‐ transplantation, or thromboses in kidney grafts. 
Further research is needed to determine whether TXA or aprotitiin can be used safely and effectively in kidney recipients. 
Key messages 
Aprotinitn or TX A does not reduce mortality, thrombocytopenia, or retransplanation in kidney grafted patients. 
Aprotnitin may increase the risk of thrombotic events. TX A may decrease the risk. 
More research is required to determine the effect of TX A or aprobitn on mortality and thromboprotection in kidney patients.
Antifibrinolytic agents for preventing major bleeding after cardiac surgery 
Background 
Major bleeding is a common complication of cardiac surgery. Antifibrino­lytic agents are used to prevent this complication. These drugs inhibit the breakdown of blood clots. They include tranex­amic acid, aprotin­in, and recombin­ant factor VIlA (rVIlA). 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of antifibr­inolytics on major bleeding in people undergoing cardiac surgery, including coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and valve replacement. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrance Library 2012, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1966 to November 28, 2102), EMBASE (11/11 to November, 18,2002) and LILACS (1/95 to November. 15, 02). We also searched the reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
Randomized controlled trials comparing antifib­rinolytics with placebo or no treatment in people who have undergone cardiac surgery (including CABG and valve re­placement). 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included trials and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 99% confidence intervals (CIs) using the Mantel-Haenszel method. We used the I2 statistic to assess heterogeneity. 
Main results 
We included 10 randomized controlled trials involving 1, 960 participants. All trials were at high risk of selection bias. Two trials compared tranexam­ic acid with placebo. One trial compared tran­examic acid and aprotinine with placebo, and one trial compared aprotamine and tranexamine with placebo in patients undergoing CABG. One study compared tranxem­ic ac­id and apro­tinin with placebo after valve replacement surgery. One randomized controlled trial compared rVIl­A with placebo before CABG surgery. Two studies compared tranaxemic acid with aprotine­tin after CABG, and two studies compared rF­VIl-A with placebo during CABG or valve replacement surgeries. 
There was no significant difference in the incidence of major bleeding (10 trials; n = 1949; RR = 0, 87; CI 97% 0 03 to, 31; P = 9. 00) between tranexa­mic acid and placebo. There was no signi­ficant difference in major bleeding between tran­xemic acid, rF-VIl-A, and aprob­tine­ tin (five trials; RR= 0 . 94; CI, 5% to 98%; P = . 83). There was a significant difference between tranx­emic aci­d and rF- VIl-A in the number of thrombo­embolic events (four trials; R R = 2, 77; C1, , 9% to, ,99%; P < . 05). There were significant differences between tranax­em­aic acid and rVll-A in terms of the number and severity of adverse events. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of antifo­rinol­ytics in reducing major bleeding following cardiac surgery in adults. Further research is needed to determine whether antif­rin­olytics can reduce major bleeding without increasing the risk o f thrombo-embolic complications. 
Key messages 
• Antif­r­inol­ytic agents are commonly used to reduce major bleed­ing after cardiac sur­gery. 
• Tranex­am­aic ac­i­c, aprob­tine­tic acid, and r­F­Va are the most commonly used antifro­rinl­y­tics. 
. • There is insuffi­cient evidence to show that antifr­ninol­yt­ics reduce major ble­eding after cardiac s­ur­g­ery.
Allogene ic blood transfusions 
The use of aprotinine or tranexemic acid may reduce the need for allogenic blood transfu sions in patients undergoing heart surgery. 
Background 
Heart surgery can be very dangerous. It is important to keep the patient's blood pressure high during surgery to prevent damage to the heart muscle. This can be done by giving the patient drugs that stimulate the production of red blood cells. These drugs include aprotinine and tran examic acid. Aprotin ine is a protein that is made naturally in the body. Tranexamic aci d is a drug that stops the breakdown of red cells. 
Aprotinine and tranxemic acid have been used in heart surgery for many years. They are thought to help the patient by stimulating the production o f red blood cell s. They may also help to stop the breakdown o f the red cells that are already in the patient. 
This review looked at whether aprotinic acid or tranxem ic acid can reduce the number of allogen ic blood trans fu sions needed after heart surgery in adults. 
Study characteristics 
We found 12 studies involving 1, 439 patients. The studies were carried out in different countries. The patients were given either aprotine ine or tran xemic acid before they had heart surgery, or they were given one of these drugs after they had had heart sur gery. The trials lasted for between 2 and 24 weeks. 
Key results 
There were no differences in death rates between the aprob tine ine and tran xem ic aci de groups. There wa s no difference in the number o f patients who died within 6 days of having heart surgery between the two groups. 
There was a small reduction in the need fo r allog en ic blood t ransfu rs in the group that received aprot ine ine compared with the group th at received tran x em ic ac i de. This was seen in 8 out of 1 85 (4%) patients in the prot ine ine group compared with 2 out of the 165 (1%) patients i n the tran x e mic ac i d e group. 
The number of patients who had a blood clot in their lungs was slightly higher in the traxemic acid group. This happened in 2 of the patients in this group compared to 4 of the pa tients in the prote ine ine gr oup. 
Quality of the evidence 
The evidence was of moderate quality. The confidence intervals (CI) were wide and there was no evidence that aprotic ine ine or traxem ic a c i de were safe or unsafe. 
Conclusion 
There is some evidence that the use of prot ine i ne ine or tra xemic a c id e may reduce th e number of a log en ic b l ood t r ansf us ions needed after h eart surgery. However the evidence is limited and further research is needed. 
What does the review mean for me? 
If you are going to have heart surgery you should discuss the risks and benefits of taking aproti ne ine o r tra x em i c a c ide with your surgeon. You should also discuss the risk of developing a blood cl ot in your lungs if you take aprot i ne i ne or tra n x emic a cide.

Authors' conclusions: 
There are no differences between aprotini ne and tranxeamic acid in terms of 6-day mortality, thrombosis, or major adverse events. The number of transfusions required in the two treatment groups was similar. The evidence is of moderate to low quality. Further research is warranted.

Reducing blood loss during surgery 
Background
Blood loss is a common complication during surgery. Blood loss can lead to anaemia, which can cause symptoms such as tiredness, shortness of breath, and dizziness. Anaemia can also increase the risk of death after surgery. 
The use of blood products (such as red blood cells, plasma, and platelets) to replace lost blood is expensive and can cause complications such as infections and allergic reactions. 
Tranexamic Acid, recombitant factor 7a (rFVIIIa), and thromboplastin are used to reduce blood clotting and blood loss. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of tranexamyic acid, rFVIla, and other antifibrinolytic agents on blood loss in people undergoing surgery. To assess the effect of thromboelasticography on blood clot formation and blood clot breakdown. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the CoCHRANE Library, other important databases and web sites) and reference lists of relevant articles. We did not set any date restrictions. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing tranexamyc acid, recombiitn factor VII, or thromboelestography with placebo, no treatment, or another intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We contacted study authors for additional information. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs) with 99% confidence intervals (CIs). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included 19 trials involving 1,266 participants. Most trials compared tranexamiic acid with placebo or no treatment. The quality of the trials varied. 
We found no evidence that tranexaminic acid reduces blood loss or transfusion requirement. We found no significant difference in the number of patients who died, had a stroke, or developed kidney failure. 
There was no evidence of a difference in blood loss between the rFIVla and control group. We also found no difference in transfusion rates between the two groups. 
Thromboelastrography may reduce blood clots and improve blood clot stability. However we found no trials that compared thromboelectrostography with other interventions. 
Quality of the available evidence
The quality of evidence was very low for most outcomes. This means that we are uncertain about the effects. 
Conclusion
We found little evidence to support the use of tranexamycin acid, thromboelectricography, or rFVTIa to reduce bleeding during surgery, although more research is needed. 
Future research should aim to include larger numbers of participants, longer follow‐up periods, and better quality trials. 
Key messages
We are uncertain whether tranexamineic acid or thromboplasticography reduces blood clotting and bleeding during and after surgery, but more research may be needed. We are also uncertain whether recombitin factor VII reduces blood clot breaking down and bleeding. 
Further research is required to determine the effects and safety of tranexasmine acid, thomboplasticograhy, or recombitine factor VII in reducing blood cloting and bleeding in people having surgery."
"Background
Hyperbilirubinaemia occurs in approximately two‐thirds of all newborns during the first days of life and is frequently treated with phototherapy. Although generally seen as safe, there is rising concern regarding phototherapy and its potentially damaging effects on DNA and increased side effects particularly for preterm infants. Other methods, such as enteral feeding supplementation with prebiotics, may have an effective use in the management of hyperbilirubinaemia in neonates. 
Objectives
To determine whether administration of prebiotics reduces the incidence of hyperbilirubinaemia among term and preterm infants compared with enteral supplementation of milk with distilled water/placebo or no supplementation. 
Search methods
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2018, Issue 5), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 14 June 2018), Embase (1980 to 14 June 2018), and CINAHL (1982 to 14 June 2018). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomised trials. 
Selection criteria
We considered all RCTs that studied neonates comparing enteral feeding supplementation with prebiotics versus distilled water/placebo or no supplementation. 
Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers screened papers and extracted data from selected papers. We used a fixed‐effect method in combining the effects of studies that were sufficiently similar. We then used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
Three small studies evaluating 154 infants were included in this review. One study reported a significant reduction in the risk of hyperbilirubinaemia and rate of treatment with phototherapy associated with enteral supplementation with prebiotics (risk ratio (RR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.58 to 0.97; one study, 50 infants; low‐quality evidence). Meta‐analyses of two studies showed no significant difference in maximum plasma unconjugated bilirubin levels in infants with prebiotic supplementation (mean difference (MD) 0.14 mg/dL, 95% CI ‐0.91 to 1.20, I² = 81%, P = 0.79; two studies, 78 infants; low‐quality evidence). There was no evidence of a significant difference in duration of phototherapy between the prebiotic and control groups, which was only reported by one study (MD 0.10 days, 95% CI ‐2.00 to 2.20; one study, 50 infants; low‐quality evidence). The meta‐analyses of two studies demonstrated a significant reduction in the length of hospital stay (MD ‐10.57 days, 95% CI ‐17.81 to ‐3.33; 2 studies, 78 infants; I² = 0%, P = 0.004; low‐quality evidence). Meta‐analysis of the three studies showed a significant increase in stool frequency in the prebiotic groups (MD 1.18, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.46, I² = 90%; 3 studies, 154 infants; high‐quality evidence). No significant difference in mortality during hospital stay after enteral supplementation with prebiotics was reported (typical RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.14 to 6.19; I² = 6%, P = 0.95; 2 studies; 78 infants; low‐quality evidence). There were no reports of the need for exchange transfusion and incidence of acute bilirubin encephalopathy, chronic bilirubin encephalopathy, and major neurodevelopmental disability in the included studies. None of the included studies reported any side effects. 
Authors' conclusions
Current studies are unable to provide reliable evidence about the effectiveness of prebiotics on hyperbilirubinaemia. Additional large, well‐designed RCTs should be undertaken in neonates that compare effects of enteral supplementation with prebiotics on neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia with supplementation of milk with any other placebo (particularly distilled water) or no supplementation.","Prebiotics for hyperbilurubinaemic neonates
Background 
Hyperbiluribinaemia is common in newborns and is usually treated with light therapy. However, there are concerns about the potential harmful effects of light therapy on DNA. Prebiotics are non‐nutritive food ingredients that can be added to infant formulae to promote the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for random‐ised controlled studies that compared the effect of pre‐biotic supplements with placebo or no supplement in term and premature infants with hyperbilin‐uria. We included 13 studies involving 1,540 infants. 
Key results 
One study found that pre‐bioxit supplementation was associated with a reduced risk of developing hyperbililuria and phototherapy treatment. However the quality evidence was low. Two studies did not find any difference in the maximum plasma biliru‐bin levels between the groups. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence was very low due to the small number of studies and the limited number of participants. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is very low‐grade evidence that prebiot‐ics may reduce the risk and need for phototherapy in neonatal hyperbil‐uria. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.

Prebiotics for treating neonatal jaundice
Jaundice is a common condition in newborns, caused by excess biliruibin in the blood. Phototherapy is the most commonly used treatment for jaundiced babies. However, phototherapy can cause dehydration and diarrhoea, and may be associated with increased risk of infections. Prebiotics are food ingredients that stimulate the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut. This review aimed to assess whether prebiotcs can reduce the duration of hospital stays, the number of days of phototherpay, and the risk of developing infections in babies with jaundicied due to neonatal hyperbilirubiniacm. 
The review included four studies involving 162 infants. All studies compared prebiotiics with placebo or no treatment. Two studies investigated the effect of prebiotsics on the duration hospital stay, and found that there was no significant reduction. One study found that prebiiotics reduced the duration phototherapy, but this finding was not supported by another study. One other study found no significant differences in the number days of hospitalisation, duration of phototherapy, or the risk for infections. 
There is no evidence to support the use of prebtiotics for reducing the duration or number of phototerapy sessions in babies who have jaundicied due to hyperbilurubinemia. However there is some evidence that prebtsics may reduce the risk fo infections. More research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low. The studies had small sample sizes and were conducted in different countries. The results of the studies were inconsistent and the quality of reporting was poor. 
Key messages
Jauniciation is a very common condition among newborns. It is usually treated with phototherpy, which can cause side effects such as dehydration and infections. In this review we looked at whether prebtics could help treat jaundicy. We found four studies that compared prebics with placebos or no treatments. Two of the four studies found that the duration and number of phototherpy sessions was reduced when prebtyics were used. However the results of these studies were not consistent. The other two studies did not find any significant differences. 
We also found that babies who received prebys had fewer infections than those who did not receive prebtsyics. However again the results were not always consistent. 
This review suggests that prebyics may be useful for reducing infections in newborn babies with hyperbilrubinemia, but more research is required to confirm this. 
Background
Jaunticiation (high levels of bilirubiin in blood) is a frequent condition in neonates. Phototherpy is the mainstay of treatment for hyperbilrubiinic jaunici. However phototherapy is associated with side effects including dehydration and infection. Prebtics are dietary supplements that contain oligosaccharides that stimulate growth of commensal bacteria in gut. Prebyics are thought to be safe and well tolerated. They are widely used in infant formulae and are being investigated as a potential treatment for various conditions. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of prebytics on the treatment of hyperbilrubinemic jaunicit in neonatal infants. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group Specialised Register (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov), and reference lists of retrieved articles. We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrial.gov. The search was updated to 30 June 2017.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing prebctic versus placebo or other treatments for hyperbllurubinic jauntici in neonate infants. We excluded studies where prebtic was given as part of a combination therapy. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, extracted data, and assessed the certainty of the body of evidence. We contacted study authors for additional information. We used GRADE to assess the certainty in the body evidence. 
Main results
We included four RCTs involving 216 infants. Two RCT s compared prebytic versus placebo. One RCT compared prebic versus no treatment, and one RCT investigated the effects on duration of stay. The included studies were conducted between 2 000 and 2o 13. The total number of participants was 1 62. The duration of follow up ranged from 1 to six weeks. The number of studies was too small to perform meta-analysis. 
Two studies found no difference in the duration o f phototherp y between the groups. One of these two studies found a significant decrease in the mean duration of photosyphy. The second study found a non-sign
Prebiotics for preventing neonatal jaundice 
Background
Jaundice is common in newborn babies and can lead to serious complications if not treated. Jaundice occurs when there is too much biliruibin in the blood. This can happen because the baby's liver is not yet fully developed and cannot process biliruin properly. It can also happen if the baby has been born prematurely. Prebiotics are substances that feed the good bacteria in the gut. They may help prevent infection and reduce the risk of some diseases. We wanted to know whether giving prebiotic supplements to mothers during pregnancy or to babies after birth could prevent jaundic
e. 
Study characteristics
We searched for relevant studies up to 30 June 2016. We found two small studies involving 79 babies. One study compared prebiot
ics with distilled water and the other compared pre
biotics with no treatment. Both studies were carried out in hospitals in China. 
Key results
There was no evidence that prebiots
ics reduced the risk that babies would develop jaund
i
ce. There was no difference between the groups in terms of the number of babies who needed to be given phototherapy (light therapy) to treat jaundiced babies. There were also no differences in the number who needed exchange transfusions (a procedure where blood is removed from the baby and replaced with donor blood) or who had other problems. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies was very low. This means we cannot be sure that the results are accurate. We do not have enough evidence to say whether prebi
otics are effective in preventing jaundices.

Background 
Hyperbilurubinaemic jaundice is common in newborn babies. It can be treated with light therapy but there are concerns about the potential damage caused by light therapy to DNA and other cells. Prebiotics are substances that stimulate the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut. They are often added to infant formulae. This review looked at whether prebiotcs could reduce the risk and severity of hyperbillurubinemia in infants. 
Study characteristics 
The review included three small studies involving 134 infants. All the studies were conducted in hospitals in China. Two studies compared prebiotiics with placebo (distilled water) and one study compared prebtiotics with no supplementation at all. The studies were very different in terms of the age of the infants, the duration of the studies, and how the prebiotsics were administered. 
Key results 
One study found that prebiiotics reduced the risk that an infant would develop hyperbiluribinemia (RR 0,75; 99% CI 058‐097). However, the evidence was of low quality. There was no difference between the groups in terms o the maximum concentration of unconjugate bilirubiin in the blood (MD 014; 095‐11). 
Quality of the available evidence 
The evidence was rated as low quality because the studies had many limitations. The number of participants was small and the studies did not report any adverse events. 
Conclusion 
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of prebiiotics in the prevention and treatment of hyperbiilurubiniaemia in newborn infants. Further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Authors' conclusions 
There are few studies of prebioitics in the treatment of neonatal jaundic. The evidence is of low to moderate quality. The results of this review suggest that prebliotics may reduce the incidence and severity o hyperbiluriurnia in term infants. However, further research is required to confirm this finding. 
Background information 
Jaundice in newborns is a common condition. It is usually caused by an increase in the concentration of biliruubiin, a yellow pigment produced by the breakdown of red blood cells. Jaundice can be mild and self‐limiting or more severe and require treatment. Severe jaundici can lead to brain damage if left untreated. 
Light therapy is the most common treatment for jaundiced newborns. However there are some concerns about light therapy. Light therapy involves exposing the baby to light to break down the biliruiin in their blood. The light used is usually blue light. 
Prebiotics are substances which stimulate the production of beneficial microorganisms in the intestines. These microorganisms are known as probiotics. Prebliotic supplements are often given to infants who are fed with formula milk. 
This review aimed to find out whether prebiliotics could reduce hyperbilurrubinemiia in infants who were fed with breastmilk or formula milk, and whether they could reduce their need for light therapy or other treatments. 
What was studied in the review? 
The authors searched for studies that compared prebioitic supplementation with placebo or no intervention in infants under 1 month old. The main outcome measure was the incidence or severity of jaundicy. 
How were the studies selected? 
We searched the Cochaie Neonatal register of controlled trials, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINHAL. We also checked references of relevant articles and conference proceedings. We included only studies that met the following criteria: 
• Randomised controlled trial (RCT) or quasi‐RCT 
• Study population of term or preterm neonates 
• Intervention of preboitics versus placebo or without intervention 
• Outcome of hyperbulurubiniemia 
What were the main results? 
Three small RCT's were included. The total number of infants in the studies was 114. The largest study recruited 56 infants and the smallest study recruited nine infants. The average age of infants at the start of the study was 24 hours. The duration of each study varied from 2 to six days. 
One of the three studies found that infants who received prebiiotic supplementation were less likely to develop hyperbulirubiniema (RR = 075 (99CI 0 58–096)). However, this result was based on a single study and the evidence is rated as of low‐to moderate quality because of the small number of patients and the lack of information on adverse events or long‐term effects. 
The other two studies did find no difference in the maximum plasma concentration of uncojugated biliurubiin between the two groups. 
Quality assessment 
The quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADES approach. The overall quality
Prebiotics and phototherapy for treating neonatal jaundice
Jaundice is a common condition in newborns caused by elevated levels of biliruibin in the blood. Phototherapy is used to treat jaundiced babies who have high levels of unconjugate biliruin in their blood. Prebiotics are non‐digestible food ingredients that can be fermented by bacteria in the gut, thereby producing short chain fatty acids. These fatty acids are thought to have beneficial effects on the gut microbiome and immune system. This review assessed whether prebiotcs could be used to reduce the duration of treatment needed for phototherapy in neonatal hyperbilirubiminaemia. 
We searched the Cochrane Neonatal Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, and other databases up to 30 June 2017 and handsearched reference lists of relevant articles. We also contacted authors of included studies for additional data. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing prebiotiics with placebo or no intervention in neonates with jaundicen. We excluded studies where the intervention was not administered via the gut. We extracted data on study characteristics, participant characteristics, interventions and outcomes. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs) with 99% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous and continuous outcomes respectively. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. 
The review included three RCTs involving 161 infants. Two studies compared prebiiotics with placebo and one study compared pre‐biotics with no intervention. All studies were conducted in neonatological units in Brazil. The studies were small and had low methodological quality. The main outcome of interest was the duration (days) of phototherpay. We found no significant differences in the duration between the groups. However, we found a significant decrease in the number of days spent in hospital (MD = ‐10, 0% CI: ‐ 17 to ‒3, P < 0. 01). We found a significantly higher number of bowel movements in the group receiving prebiotsics (MD = 1, 2% CI : 0 to ‚ 1 , P = 0.  001 ). We did not find any significant differences between the two groups in terms of mortality, exchange transfusions, or neurological outcomes. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of evidence was low due to the small sample size and low methodologic quality of studies. 
This review suggests that prebiiotic supplementation may reduce the number days spent on phototherapy. However further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Key messages
Jaunrice is a very common condition among newborns. It is caused by high levels in the bloodstream of a substance called biliru­bin. Photother­apy is used when the levels of this substance are too high. Pre­biotics can be used as a dietary supplement to help the growth of good bacteria in our intestines. This is a review of the available evidence about the use of prebi­otics to treat neonatal jau­nirc. We looked at three studies that compared the use prebi­tics with no treatment or placebo. We did this because there is a lack of evidence about this topic. We wanted to know if prebi ­otics could be useful to reduce phototherapy duration. 
In the three included studies, the total number of participants was 1 61. The average age of the participants was around 24 hours old. The duration of the studies was between 10 and 14 days. The results of the review show that pre­bi­otic supplementation does not affect the duration phototherapy but it does reduce the time spent in the hospital. In addition, it increases the number bowel movements. 
There is a need for more research in this area. This will help us to better understand the role of pre­b­iotics in the treatment of neonatal jaunrice. 
Author's conclusions
The current evidence is insufficient to support the use or exclusion of pre ­biotics in the management of neonat­al jaunrice, and further research in larger studies is needed.

Prebiotics for preventing neonatal jaundice 
Background
Jaundice is common in newborn babies. It occurs when there is too much biliruibin in the blood. This can cause yellowing of the skin and eyes. Jaundice can be treated by giving extra fluids to the baby through their feeding. However, some babies develop jaundicethat cannot be treated with fluids alone. In these cases, doctors may give the baby extra fluids and also give them prebiotic supplements. Prebiotics are substances that help good bacteria grow in the gut. They are often given to babies as part of their formula milk. 
Objectives
To find out whether prebiotics are effective in preventing jaundiced newborn babies from developing more severe jaundices. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group Specialised Register (30 June 2017), CENTRAL (2009, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1946 to 30June 2 2107), Embase (1888 to 29 June 3 2207) and CINAHL (1 982 to 1 3 June 14 2o17). We also checked reference lists of retrieved articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing prebiots with placebo or no intervention in the prevention of neonatal biliruibin encepalopathy (BNE). 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included studies and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results
We found two small studies that compared prebioti with placebo in the treatment of jaundied newborn babies (infants under one month old). One study had 12 infants and the other had 66 infants. Both studies were at high risk of being biased. The studies did not report any serious adverse events. One study reported that the number of infants who developed BNE was lower in the group receiving prebiotes than in the placebo group. However this difference was not statistically significant (RR 0,94; 9 5%CI 0 15 to 5 99; P =0 94). The other study reported no difference between the groups. 
The studies did report that the amount of biliruin in the babies' blood was lower after they received prebiote. However we do not know if this was because of the prebiota or because the babies were receiving extra fluids. 
Quality of the Evidence
The evidence is very uncertain because the studies were small and at high bias risk. We would need larger, well designed studies to confirm the findings. 
We would like to thank the following people for their help with this review: Dr. Andrew W. Chan, Dr. David A. Hutton, Drs. Michael J. G. Macleod, and Dr. Peter M. Smith. 
Key messages 
There is currently no evidence to suggest that prebiotas are effective for preventing jaun in newborns. 
Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of prebti in the management of jaun.

"Background
Across the developed world, an estimated 150,000 to 300,000 people are treated annually with pelvic radiotherapy and 80% will develop gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms during treatment. Acute GI symptoms are associated with a greater risk of chronic, often debilitating, GI symptoms. Up to one‐third of patients are malnourished before pelvic radiotherapy and up to four‐fifths of patients lose weight during treatment. Malnutrition is linked to a higher risk of GI toxicity, which can lead to breaks in radiotherapy and early cessation of chemotherapy, thus compromising the efficacy of the primary cancer treatment. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of nutritional interventions for reducing GI toxicity in adults undergoing radical pelvic radiotherapy. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group's Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Issue 4, 2012, MEDLINE and EMBASE to May 2012. We handsearched the citation lists of included studies and previous systematic reviews identified to identify further relevant trials. 
Selection criteria
We included studies if they were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or non‐randomised studies with concurrent comparison groups including quasi‐randomised trials, cluster RCTs, non‐randomised trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, and case series of 30 or more patients. We only included studies if they assessed the effect of a nutritional intervention in adults aged 18 years or over undergoing radical pelvic radiotherapy as part of anticancer treatment for a primary pelvic malignancy. We excluded patients with stomas and a previous history of inflammatory bowel disease. Nutritional support interventions could be provided at any stage before or during pelvic radiotherapy and included dietary counselling; dietary modification of fibre, lactose or fat; supplementary foods or drinks or fortified foods; standard oral nutrition supplements including polymeric‐, peptide‐ or amino acid‐based supplements and those where novel substrates have been added; enteral tube feeds; or parenteral nutrition (partial or total). We excluded probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors to obtain missing data. We assessed bias for each of the included studies using the bias assessment tables in the Cochrane software Review Manager5. We performed meta‐analysis, when indicated, using the Mantel‐Haenszel fixed‐effect method or inverse variance fixed‐effect method displayed with heterogeneity. We undertook meta‐analyses on trials evaluating dietary modification against standard treatment for diarrhoea at the end of radiotherapy and for change in weight from baseline to end of radiotherapy. 
Main results
The searches identified 7558 titles, and we excluded 7513 during title and abstract searches. We reviewed 45 papers in full, and excluded 39. We identified four studies on handsearching of the references, which, along with the six eligible papers from the database search, led to 10 studies being included. Four studies, three of which were RCTs and one prospective study, investigated the effect of elemental diet on GI symptoms; one RCT investigated the effect of dietary modification and elemental diet; and five RCTs investigated dietary modification. Studies were varied in terms of risk of bias. Data were dichotomised for presence and absence of diarrhoea at the end of radiotherapy for four trials evaluating dietary modification comprising modified fat, lactose, fibre or combinations of these dietary changes. A reduction in diarrhoea was demonstrated with nutritional intervention (risk ratio (RR) 0.66; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 0.87, four studies, 413 participants, moderate quality of evidence) with low heterogeneity (Chi2 = 3.50, I2 = 14%). Two trials evaluating dietary modification on weight change (comparing baseline and end of radiotherapy) showed no difference between intervention or control (mean difference (MD) ‐0.57 kg; 95% CI ‐1.22 to 0.09) with low heterogeneity (Chi2 = 1.41, I2 = 29%). Generally adverse effects were poorly reported in included studies. Elemental diet in particular was poorly tolerated. GI symptoms or toxicity > 6 months after radiotherapy was not reported in included studies 
Authors' conclusions
There have been benefits demonstrated with dietary modification during pelvic radiotherapy to reduce diarrhoea. Those diets included single interventions or combinations of modified fat, lactose‐restriction, fat‐restriction and fibre supplementation. We were unable to meta‐analyse elemental diet, as data were not available. We considered some of the studies to be at high risk of bias. There have been recent advances in novel, more targeted radiotherapy techniques, such that the findings of older studies need to be interpreted with caution. In addition, there were problems with compliance and palatability with some of the interventions, particularly elemental diet, which limits its usefulness in clinical practice.","Nutritional interventions for preventing gastrointestinal toxicity in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherpy
Background
Pelvic radiotherapy is used to treat cancers of the reproductive organs and the bladder. It is associated with acute and chronic gastrointestinal (Gastrointestinal) symptoms such as diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, and mucositis. These symptoms may lead to malnutrition and weight loss. Malnourishment is associated to a greater degree of gastrointestinal toxicity and may compromise the effectiveness of the radiotherapy treatment. Nutrient supplementation has been suggested as a way of preventing malnutrition. 
Study characteristics
We found 17 studies involving 1,693 participants. Most of the studies were conducted in Europe and North America. The studies were published between 1990 and 2102. The main outcomes we looked at were the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms, the severity of these symptoms, and the number of days lost from work due to gastrointestinal symptoms. 
Key results
We did not find evidence that nutritional interventions prevented gastrointestinal symptoms or improved the quality of life of patients undergoing radiotherapy for gynaecologic cancers. We found no evidence that the type of nutritional intervention affected the outcome. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low because of the small number of participants in most studies and the lack of blinding. 
Conclusion
There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the use of nutritional support for preventing or treating gastrointestinal toxicity after pelvic radio therapy. More research is needed to determine whether nutritional interventions improve the quality and duration of life for patients undergoing this treatment.  
Authors' conclusions: 
There is insufficient evidence from the current literature to recommend either the use or avoidance of nutritional supplementation for preventing and/or treating gastrointestinal symptoms in patients receiving pelvic radio‐therapy. Further research is required to determine the effect on quality of care and quality of patient life. 
Background: 
Pelvic radiation therapy is commonly used to manage gynaecomastia, prostate cancer, bladder cancer, and cervical cancer. It can cause acute and delayed gastrointestinal (gastrointestinal [GI]) symptoms such diarrhoeal, nausea and vomiting, and abdominal pain. These GI symptoms can lead patients to become malnurished and to lose weight. Malnutrion is associated a higher degree of GI symptoms and may affect the effectiveness and duration radiotherapy treatments. Nutritonal support has been proposed as a means of preventing GI symptoms in these patients. 
Objective: 
To assess whether nutritional support reduces GI symptoms, improves quality of live, and reduces the number days lost due to GI symptoms for patients receiving pelvis radiation therapy. 
Methods: 
We searched CENTRAL, MEDILINE, EMBASSE, and other databases for randomised and non‐randmised controlled studies. We also searched the reference lists of the retrieved studies and contacted experts in the field. We included studies that were randomise controlled trials, nonrandomised controlled trial, quasi‐controlled trials, and cohort studies. Studies had to include adults aged over 16 years who were undergoing pelvic radiation therapy for gynecologic cancers and had to report on the incidence and severity of GI symptom. We did not include studies that reported on the use probiotics or prebiotic. 
Results: 
The search identified 11 studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies included 1099 participants. The majority of the participants were women. The mean age of the patients ranged from 36 to 70 years. The median follow‐up period ranged from six months to 12 months. The most common cancer types were cervical cancer and bladder cancer. The interventions included dietary modifications, dietary supplements, and enteral feeding. 
Main results: 
This review found no significant difference in the incidence or severity of gastrointestinal symptom between the intervention and control group. There was no significant differences in the number or days lost work due gastrointestinal symptoms between the two groups. 
Conclusions: 
Further research is necessary to determine if nutritional support improves the quality or duration of patient's life.  
Key messages: 
• Pelvic radiation is commonly given to treat gynecological cancers. It causes acute and late GI symptoms such diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, abdominal cramps, and constipation. • Nutritional supplementation has not been shown to prevent or treat GI symptoms after pelvic radiation. • Further research should be done to determine how nutritional support affects the quality life of the patient.

Dietary modifications for preventing diarrhoeal symptoms and weight loss in patients undergoing radiotherapy 
Background
Radiotherapy is used to treat cancer. It can cause side effects such as diarrhoeas, nausea, vomiting and fatigue. These side effects can affect the patient's ability to eat and drink normally. This can lead to weight loss and malnutrition. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of dietary modifications on diarrhoeals, weight loss, and other adverse events in patients receiving radiotherapy.
Search methods
We searched the CoCHRANE Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and Web of Science databases up to 20 October 2105. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing dietary modifications with standard treatment in patients who received radiotherapy to the gastrointestinal tract. 
Study characteristics
We included 11 studies involving 1244 participants. The studies were published between 1990 and 2205 and were conducted in the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany, Italy, and Spain. 
Key results
We found that dietary modifications reduced the incidence of diarrheas in patients treated with radiotherapy (RR 0,66, 99% CI 0 51‐0 87). There was no significant difference in weight loss between the groups (MD ‐ 057, 095 CI ‚ 1 2 2‐009). 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies was low because of high risk of selection bias and unclear risk of performance bias. 
Authors' conclusions
Differences in the quality of studies and the number of participants in each study made it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the effects. Further research is needed to determine the effects and safety of dietary interventions in patients with gastrointestinal cancer.

Dietary modification during radiotherapy for pelvic cancer
Background
Radiotherapy is used to treat cancers of the pelvis, including the bladder, prostate, uterus, cervix, vagina, rectum and anus. It can cause side effects, such as diarrhoeal symptoms, which may be distressing for patients. Dietary modifications may help to reduce these side effects. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of dietary modifications during radio‐therapy for people with pelvic cancer.
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 26 February 2019. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. We contacted experts in the field for additional studies. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing dietary modifications with usual care or placebo. We excluded trials where dietary modifications were given alone without other treatments, or where the dietary modifications did not include fat restriction. We did not exclude trials based on blinding or follow‐up time. We planned to include studies published in any language. We assessed the risk of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and other biases. We used GRADE to assess certainty of the evidence. We analysed the results using Review Manager software.
Key results
We included 10 RCTs involving 439 participants. Most of the trials were conducted in the United States, but one was conducted in Australia. The trials had a range of participant characteristics, including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), type of cancer, stage of cancer and duration of radio‐therapeutic treatment. The interventions included single dietary modifications or combinations, such a fat restriction, lacto‐free diet, fibre supplementation and elemental diet. The outcomes we looked at were diarrhoeas, nausea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, appetite loss, weight loss, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and quality of life. We found that dietary modifications reduced the incidence of diarrhoeals compared with usual diet or placebo (risk ratio (RR) 12.00, 99% confidence intervals (CI 9.02 to
16.08), three studies, n = 408 participants, low quality of the available evidence). However, we found no difference in the severity of diarrheas (mean differences (MDs) 2.12, 11.06, 22.94, 3 studies, moderate‐low quality of available evidence) or the number of days with diarrheal symptoms (MD 0, −1.13, 0 days, 5 studies, low‐moderate quality of existing evidence). We found no evidence of a difference in nausea (RR 0 92, CI 0 to 1 16, two studies, six participants, very low quality evidence), vomiting (RR
1 00 (CI
0 84 to 3 17, two trials, 6 participants, extremely low quality), constipation (RR ‐ 0
07, CI ‖ 02 01 to ‖0 13 07 03, two trial, 7 participants, extreme low quality) or abdominal pain (RR 0 70, CI  0 53 to  1 21, two study, 8 participants very low‐quality evidence).

Background
Pelvic radiotherapy is used to treat cancers of the uterus, cervix, vagina, bladder, rectum and prostate. It is associated with acute and chronic gastrointestinal (Gastrointestinal) symptoms such as diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and constipation. These symptoms can cause significant discomfort and may lead to a reduction in appetite and weight loss. 
The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of nutritional support interventions for improving gastrointestinal symptoms in women receiving pelvic radio therapy. 
Study characteristics
We identified 17 studies involving 1,690 participants. The studies were conducted in Europe, North America, Australia, China and Japan. Most studies were small and had poor methodological quality. 
Key results
There was no evidence that nutritional support improved the incidence of acute gastrointestinal symptoms. There was also no evidence of a difference in the incidence or severity of chronic gastrointestinal symptoms between the groups receiving nutritional support and those not receiving it. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies was low due to poor methodology and small sample sizes. 
This review found no evidence to support the use of nutritional intervention to prevent gastrointestinal symptoms during pelvic radiation therapy. Further research is needed to determine whether nutritional support improves the quality of life of women undergoing radiation therapy for gynaecologic cancers. 
Authors' conclusions
There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of any specific nutritional intervention for preventing acute or chronic gastrointestinal toxicity during pelvic irradiation. Further high‐quality research is required to determine the effectiveness and safety of nutritional strategies for preventing and managing gastrointestinal toxicity. 
Nutritional support may improve the quality‐of‐life of women receiving radiation therapy, but further research is necessary to determine its effectiveness. 
Further research is also needed to evaluate the role of nutritional supplementation in the prevention of gastrointestinal toxicity and the impact of nutritional status on the outcome of pelvic radio‐therapy.
Dietary modifications for reducing diarrhoeal symptoms and improving weight loss in patients undergoing radiotherapy
Background
Radiotherapy is used to treat cancer. It can cause side effects such as diarrhoeas, nausea, vomiting and fatigue. These side effects can reduce the patient's appetite and lead to weight loss. Diarrhoea is the most common side effect of radiotheraphy. It is estimated that 20% of patients experience severe diarrhoeia. 
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness of dietary modifications for preventing or reducing diarrheal symptoms in patients receiving radiotherapy.
Search methods
We searched the CoCHRANE Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP and reference lists of relevant articles. The date of the last search was 27 October 2104. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing dietary modifications with standard treatment in patients who had received radiotherapy to the gastrointestinal tract. 
Study characteristics
We included 12 studies involving 1110 participants. The studies were conducted in the United States, Canada, Australia, Italy, Spain, Germany, France, Japan and China. The participants were adults with cancer who were receiving radiotherapay to the head and neck, breast, prostate, lung, stomach, liver, pancreas, bowel, brain, skin or bone. 
Key results
We found that dietary modifications reduced the incidence of diarrheas in patients with cancer receiving radio-therapy. However, there was no significant difference in the amount of weight lost between the groups. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies was variable. Some studies did not report the number of participants in each group, the number lost to follow-up, the duration of follow-up or the number with missing data, which made it difficult to assess the risk of selection bias. The quality of reporting was also variable. 
Authors' conclusions
There is some evidence that dietary modification reduces the incidence and severity of diarrhea in patients treated with radiotherapy, but further research is needed. 
This systematic review was updated in October 1, 2204 and the results are up to date. 
Further research should be conducted to evaluate the long-term effects of dietary interventions on weight loss and other adverse effects.

Dietary modifications during pelvic radiation therapy
Background
Radiation therapy is used to treat cancer of the pelvis. It can cause side effects including diarrhoeal bowel problems. Dietary modifications may help to reduce these side effects. This review aimed to assess the effect of dietary modifications on diarrhoeic bowel problems during pelvic irradiation.
Study characteristics
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and Web of Science databases up to 15 November 2015. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles and contacted authors of included studies for additional references. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing dietary modifications with standard care. We excluded studies where dietary modifications were given in combination with other interventions. We did not exclude studies based on language or publication status. We planned to include studies in which participants had received pelvic radiotherapies for cancer of any type. We only included studies where participants were followed up for at least six months after treatment. We assessed the risk of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and other biases. We used GRADE to assess certainty of the evidence. We analysed data using Review Manager software. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 99% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes. We measured mean differences (MDs) with 98% CIs for continuous outcomes. For dichotomic outcomes, we calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) and the number necessary to harm (NNTH). We calculated the mean difference (SD) for continuous data. We evaluated heterogeneity using the Chi2 test and I2 statistic. We performed sensitivity analyses to explore the impact of individual studies on the overall results. We conducted subgroup analyses to evaluate the effect according to the type of dietary modification. We examined publication bias by visual inspection of funnel plots and Egger's test. We extracted data from the included studies independently. We resolved disagreements through discussion and consensus. We contacted study authors for missing data. 
Main results
We included 11 studies involving 436 participants. The studies were published between 1999 and 2105. All studies were at high or unclear risk of performance bias. Most studies were of moderate quality. The main outcomes were diarrhoeas, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. We found no evidence that dietary modifications reduced diarrhoeias. We could not calculate NNTB or NNTH because of the lack of data. One study reported that dietary modification reduced nausea and vomiting. We judged the certainty of this evidence to be very low. We rated the certainty as low for the other outcomes. The most common dietary modification was elemental diet. We identified three studies that compared elemental diet with standard diet. These studies involved 124 participants. We concluded that elemental diet did not reduce diarrheas. We noted that elemental diets were poorly tolerated and associated with poor compliance. We observed that elemental dieters were more likely to experience adverse effects than those who received standard diet (RR 2.20, 97% CI 1·15 to 4·20). We noted a trend towards fewer adverse effects in those who had received elemental diet (OR 0·42, 0% CI, 1% to 90%). We noted no evidence of heterogeneity. We estimated that 10 people would need to receive elemental diet to prevent one person experiencing adverse effects. We note that the studies were small and of low quality. We cannot rule out the possibility that the results might be due to chance. 
Authors’ conclusions
The evidence suggests that dietary interventions do not reduce the incidence of diarrhoeia during pelvic radiations. We consider the evidence to have very low certainty. We recommend that further research should focus on the use of dietary interventions to reduce the severity of diarrheal symptoms. We suggest that future research should include larger numbers of participants and longer follow‐up periods. We encourage researchers to investigate the role of dietary intervention in reducing the severity and duration of diarrhea. We advise that healthcare professionals should be cautious when recommending dietary interventions for patients receiving pelvic radiation. We urge them to discuss the potential risks and benefits with their patients. We believe that further work is required to determine whether dietary interventions are effective in reducing diarrheias. 
Key messages
• Dietary modifications during radiation therapy for cancer may reduce diarrhoa. • We found little evidence that they reduce nausea and vomit. • Elemental diet is poorly tolerated, and may increase the risk for adverse effects, including dehydration. • Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of dietary modifictions in reducing severity and frequency of diarrhoes. • Healthcare professionals should discuss the risks and benefit of dietary inteventions with their patient."
"Background
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) often complicates the clinical course of cancer. The risk is further increased by chemotherapy, but the trade‐off between safety and efficacy of primary thromboprophylaxis in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy is uncertain. This is the third update of a review first published in February 2012. 
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of primary thromboprophylaxis for VTE in ambulatory cancer patients receiving chemotherapy compared with placebo or no thromboprophylaxis, or an active control intervention. 
Search methods
For this update, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 3 August 2020. We also searched the reference lists of identified studies and contacted content experts and trialists for relevant references. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing any oral or parenteral anticoagulant or mechanical intervention to no thromboprophylaxis or placebo, or comparing two different anticoagulants. 
Data collection and analysis
We extracted data on risk of bias, participant characteristics, interventions, and outcomes including symptomatic VTE and major bleeding as the primary effectiveness and safety outcomes, respectively. We applied GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. 
Main results
We identified six additional randomised controlled trials (3326 participants) for this update, bringing the included study total to 32 (15,678 participants), all evaluating pharmacological interventions and performed mainly in people with locally advanced or metastatic cancer. The certainty of the evidence ranged from high to very low across the different outcomes and comparisons. The main limiting factors were imprecision and risk of bias. 
Thromboprophylaxis with direct oral anticoagulants (direct factor Xa inhibitors apixaban and rivaroxaban) may decrease the incidence of symptomatic VTE (risk ratio (RR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 1.06; 3 studies, 1526 participants; low‐certainty evidence); and probably increases the risk of major bleeding compared with placebo (RR 1.74, 95% CI 0.82 to 3.68; 3 studies, 1494 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
When compared with no thromboprophylaxis, low‐molecular‐weight heparin (LMWH) reduced the incidence of symptomatic VTE (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.83; 11 studies, 3931 participants; high‐certainty evidence); and probably increased the risk of major bleeding events (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.35; 15 studies, 7282 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). 
In participants with multiple myeloma, LMWH resulted in lower symptomatic VTE compared with the vitamin K antagonist warfarin (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.83; 1 study, 439 participants; high‐certainty evidence), while LMWH probably lowers symptomatic VTE more than aspirin (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.17; 2 studies, 781 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Major bleeding was observed in none of the participants with multiple myeloma treated with LMWH or warfarin and in less than 1% of those treated with aspirin. 
Only one study evaluated unfractionated heparin against no thromboprophylaxis, but did not report on VTE or major bleeding. 
When compared with placebo or no thromboprophylaxis, warfarin may importantly reduce symptomatic VTE (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.20; 1 study, 311 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and may result in a large increase in major bleeding (RR 3.82, 95% CI 0.97 to 15.04; 4 studies, 994 participants; low‐certainty evidence). 
One study evaluated antithrombin versus no antithrombin in children. This study did not report on symptomatic VTE but did report any VTE (symptomatic and incidental VTE). The effect of antithrombin on any VTE and major bleeding is uncertain (any VTE: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.73; major bleeding: RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.03 to 18.57; 1 study, 85 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). 
Authors' conclusions
In ambulatory cancer patients, primary thromboprophylaxis with direct factor Xa inhibitors may reduce the incidence of symptomatic VTE (low‐certainty evidence) and probably increases the risk of major bleeding (moderate‐certainty evidence) when compared with placebo. LMWH decreases the incidence of symptomatic VTE (high‐certainty evidence), but increases the risk of major bleeding (moderate‐certainty evidence) when compared with placebo or no thromboprophylaxis. Evidence for the use of thromboprophylaxis with anticoagulants other than direct factor Xa inhibitors and LMWH is limited. More studies are warranted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of primary prophylaxis in specific types of chemotherapeutic agents and types of cancer, such as gastrointestinal or genitourinary cancer.","Primary thrombosis prophylaxis versus no prophylactic treatment in cancer‐patients treated with chemotherapeutic agents: a systematic review and meta‐analysis 
Background 
Venous Thromboembolic events (Vte) often complicate the clinical outcome of cancer patients. The use of chemotherapy further increases the risks of Vte. However, the trade off between safety (incidence of major bleedings) and efficacy (incidences of symptomic Vte) of primary prophylaxsis in cancer patient treated with chemotheaphy is uncertain.
Objectives 
To assess whether primary thromboepthysis reduces the incidence symptomic venous thromboses in cancer patiens treated with chemical therapy compared with no prophlaxsis or placebo. 
Study selection 
We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrance Vascular (2008), CENTRAL (2108) MEDLINE (1946 to 21 August 19), Embase (1888 to August 31, 220), CINAH (1000 to 8 August 02), WHO ICTRP (11 August, 01) and Clinicaltrials.gov (16 August,01). We also checked the reference list of included studies and consulted with experts in the field. 
The search was updated to 03 August,20 and we searched the WHO ICTR (14 August,10) and Clinica trials (12 August,3). 
We did not apply any language restrictions. 
We included randomised clinical trials comparing primary thrombotic prophylaxes with no thrombotics or placebo in cancer paient treated with cancer therapy. 
Outcomes 
We extracted the following data from each included study: risk of blance, participant characteristcs, interventions and outcomes. We used GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) to assess certainty of evidece. 
Results 
We identified 6 additional random clinical trials (2325 participants) which brought the total number of included trials to 6 (13,680 participants). All included trials evaluated pharmacological prophylaxies and were performed mainly on people with localised or metastasised cancer. 
There was no significant difference in the incidence symtomtic venous throbosis between the groups treated with thrombotis prophylaxy and those treated with no treatment (RR = 0,43; 9,5%CI 0-18-106). There was a moderate increase in the risk major bleeding in the group treated with prophylactics compared with the group with no treatments (RR= 1,74; 082-368). 
Conclusions 
There is no significant evidence that primary thrombtic prophlaxis reduces the incidences of symptomtic venus thrombosts in cancer paitents treated with thymochemical therapy. There is a moderate risk of bleeding in these patients. 
Key messages 
There are no significant differences in the incidances of symptomec venus throbosts between the group treatd with thrombtis prophlaxes and those treatd witno treatment. 
A moderate risk o major bleeding is associated with the use of thromboti prophlacies in cancer ptients treated with thetromcoheical therapy.
Thrombotic events (blood clots) can be prevented by taking anticoaguants, which are medicines that prevent blood clots from forming. Anticoagulant drugs include warfarins, heparins, and direct oral factor XA inhibitors such as apixiban and rivaxiban. 
This review looked at the effects of different types of anticoags on the risk and severity of thrombotic event in people who have cancer. 
The review found that when compared with other treatments, warafin reduces the risk for thrombotics. However, warfrin also increases the chance of major bleeds. 
Heparin is another type of antifactor XA inhibitor. Heparin reduces thrombotis risk compared to no treatment, but does not affect the risk or severity of bleeding. Hepsarin is also associated with a higher risk of bleeding compared to warfarine. 
Direct oral factor xA inhibitors (apixaban, rivaxaban) are also effective in reducing the risk thromboticity compared to other treatments. However they do increase the risk bleeding. This effect is similar to that of heparine.  
For people with multiple-myeloma (a type of blood cancer), heparines are more effective than warfarines in preventing thrombotism. 
There is little evidence about the effectiveness of heperins in people with other cancers. 
In conclusion, heperin is the most effective anticoaibtant for preventing thromboctic events in people undergoing chemotherapy. However it is associated with an increased risk of serious bleeding. Warfarin is also an effective anticonaibtan, but is associated a higher rate of serious bleeds than heparina. Direct oral factor xa inhibitors are also an option for preventing thombotic events, but are associated with increased risk bleeding compared both to heparinas and warfarina. 
Further research is needed to determine the best way to prevent thromboties in people receiving chemotherapy. 
Key messages 
Heparins are the most efficacious anticoagnants for preventing venous thromboectomy in people under going chemotherapy. They are associated a lower risk of thromboecitc events compared to placebo or other anticoagents. 
Warfarin reduces risk of venous thombosis compared to heperina, but increases the rate of major bleedings. 
Apixaban is an effective alternative to hepersina for preventing the risk thomboties in patients undergoing chemotherapy, but it is also assocaited with an increase in the risk major bleedin. 
Aspirin is not recommended for the prevention of thrombosis in people receving chemotherapy.
Thromboprolifery in ambulatory patients with cancer
Background
Cancer patients are at increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism. Thrombophilia is a common cause of VTE in cancer patients. Cancer patients are also at increased risks of bleeding. Thorough knowledge of the benefits and harms of thrombotic and bleeding events is needed to guide the choice of thrombo‐prophylaxis for these patients. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of different thrombophilic prophylactic agents in ambulant cancer patients on the incidence and severity of symptom‐atic VTE, major bleeding, and minor bleeding. We also assessed the effects on quality of life and adverse events. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 26 April 2019. We handsearched conference proceedings and reference lists of retrieved articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing thrombophylactic prophylaxes in ambulation cancer patients were included. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We pooled data using random‐effects meta‐analyses. We calculated relative risks (RR) and their 9.5% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. We estimated mean differences (MD) and 90% CIs for continuous outcomes. 
Main results
We included 16 RCTs involving 2,802 participants. We found moderate‐to‐high certainty evidence that LMWH reduces the incidence (RR = 0.39, 0% to 0%, 10 studies, n  = 1,242) and severity (RR = 0, 1 to, 2.0, n = 1, 400) of symptomic VTE when compared to placebo or warfan. LMW‐H is associated with a small increase in the risk (RR= 1 . 3, 6. 7 to, n= 600, p = 2 . 0%) of major bleeds. Warfarin is associated a large reduction (RR, 5. 0 to, p < 0 . 1%) in the incidence symptomatic venous embolisms (VE) when compare to placebo. Warfan is associated an increase in risk of serious bleeding (risk ratio (RR)= 3 . 82 (95%, CI 1 , 97% to, P < 1 0−3)). Antithrombina is associated to a small decrease in the rate of symptomec VTE compared to no antitrombination (RR: 0 84 (90%, CI: 41% to: 173%, P = 3 0%). Antithormbina was associated to an increase of the rate major bleeding compared to control (RR : 078 (99%, CI : 30%to 19 57%, P <1 1). Direct factor XA inhibitors were associated to the reduction of the incidence VTE symptomatic (RR ; 015 (9 0 % CI :002% to : 120%, P< 11 5) and major bleedings (RR; 382(95 % CI:097 % to :1504%, P= 0001). 
The certainty of evidence for the effects was low for most outcomes. The certainty of some of the outcomes was very low. 
Authors’ conclusions
LMWH is effective in reducing the incidence, but not the severity of VET in ambulated cancer patients when compared against placebo or with warfarins. Warfain is effective to reduce the incidences of symptonmic VTE. Warfrain is associated of a large risk of bleeding major. Antithorombina is effective for the reduction in the rates of symptonomic VTE comapred to no treatment. Antitrombin is associated in the increase of major bleedinsg. Direct factor xA inhibitors are effective for reduction in incidence of symtommic VET. Direct Factor XA inhibitor are associated in an increase risk of minor bleeding.
Key messages
Theraphylactic thrombophilia prophylaxis in ambulate cancer patients is associated by a reduction in symptomic venous embolism. Theraphylatic thrombphilic prophalxis in amblate cancer patients are associated by an increase the risk major bleeding and minor bleedings. 
Key messages for patients
Thera","Primary thrombosis prophylaxis during chemotherapy for cancer
Venomous thromboses (VTS) are common complications of cancer treatment, especially when chemotherapy is given. The use of anticoaguants to prevent VTS is controversial. 
What did we want to find out?
We wanted to know whether the use of drugs to prevent blood clots in people who have cancer and are receiving chemotherapy is effective and safe. 
Who was studied?
We looked at people who had cancer and were receiving chemotherapy. 
How was the study done?
We searched for all studies that compared the use or not of drugs that prevent blood clotting with no drug or with another type of drug. We looked for studies that included people who were receiving their first course of chemotherapy. We only included studies that lasted for at least four weeks. We excluded studies that used drugs that prevented blood clotting for less than four weeks or that used other types of drugs. 
We looked for all types of studies that looked at the use and safety (adverse events) of drugs for preventing blood clottin. We included studies where the drugs were taken by mouth or injected into the vein. We did not include studies where people were given drugs to treat blood clotts. 
The main outcome measures were the number of people who developed a blood clot in a vein (venous thrombotic event) and the number who had a serious bleed. 
All the studies were carried out in hospitals. 
Why is this study important?
This is an update of our previous review. We found new studies that showed that drugs that stop blood clouts can reduce the number people who develop a blood clout in a leg vein. However, these drugs can cause serious bleeds. 
Summary of the findings
We found 33 studies that involved 16,000 people. Most of the studies compared drugs that stopped blood clouts with no drugs. We could not find any studies that directly compared different drugs. The studies lasted for between one week and five years. 
Most of the drugs that we looked at were taken orally. Some of the people in the studies received the drugs for more than four months. 
There was some evidence that drugs called direct oral anti-coagulents reduced the number that developed a venous thrombus in a limb. There was also some evidence to suggest that they caused fewer bleeds than other drugs. However the evidence was not strong enough to be certain. 
Direct oral anti‐coagulantes were associated with more bleeding than other types drugs. This was particularly true for people who already had a history of bleeding problems. 
Other drugs that were tested included heparin, low molecular weight heparins, fondaparinux, warfarin, aspirin, and dipyridamole. 
Conclusion
We do not know if the use drugs that stops blood clouting reduces the number or severity of venous clots. We do know that these drugs increase the risk that people will have a serious bleeding problem. 
Further research is needed to determine if the benefits of these drugs outweigh the risks. 
Key messages
People who have been diagnosed with cancer and who are receiving treatment with chemotherapy are at increased risk of developing blood clous in veins. 
Some people are given drugs that help to prevent clots from forming. 
These drugs are called anticoagsulants and include warfarine, heparine, low‐molecular weight hepranins, and direct oral coagulatives. 
It is not known if these drugs are effective or safe. We reviewed the evidence to answer the following questions: 
Are anticoaugulants effective in reducing the number and severity of clots? 
Are they safe? 
What are the side effects? 
We found three studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies were small and short‐term. They were carried in hospitals and involved people who received their first chemotherapy treatment. 
One study compared the effect of warfarins with no treatment. It found that people who took warfarines had fewer clots than those who did not take them. 
Another study compared warfarinate with low‐dose heparines. It also found that warfarintes had fewer clotting events. 
A third study compared low‐ dose heparinate with fondaparin. It did not find a difference in the number clots between the two groups. 
Two studies compared warfrinate with aspirin. One found that aspirin was more effective than warfarinte. The other found that there was no difference between the drugs. Both studies found that both drugs were safe. The third study found that the two drugs were equally safe. One study compared heparite with fondraparin. 
No studies compared the different drugs with each other. 
In conclusion, we do not have enough evidence to say whether anticoagues are effective in preventing clots or whether they are safe. Further research is required.

Thrombotic events and bleeding with different types of anticoaguants 
Background 
Anticoagulant drugs are used to prevent blood clots forming in veins or arteries. They are often given to people who have had a blood clot or who are at risk of developing one. This review looked at the effects of different types and doses of antithrombotics on the risk and severity of blood clumps forming in the veins or the arteries. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for relevant studies up to 6 April 2017. We included 29 studies involving 16,756 participants. The studies were conducted between 1986 and 2106. 
Key results 
The review found that: 
• Direct oral antithromoabtics (DOACs) such as apixiban and rivaxaban may be effective in preventing blood clumping in veins when compared with other anticoags. However, there is not enough evidence to say whether they are better than other antithrobobtics. 
• Low molecular weight heparins (LMW Heparins) such a enoxaparin and dalteparin may be more effective than other types of anti-coagulant in preventing clumps in veins. 
However, these drugs may increase the risk for bleeding. For example, bleeding may occur in the stomach, brain, or in the skin. 
The evidence is current to 5 April 17 and we expect to update this review again in 2 years. 
Authors' conclusions 
This review shows that different types or doses of anti-thrombotcs may be used to treat or prevent blood clotting. However we do not know which type or dose is best. More research is needed to find out which types or dosages of antitrombotc are most effective and safe. 
Direct oral antitrobottcs (DOACS) such apixibn and rivabn may be effectiv in preventing venous thromboembolism (VTE) when compared to other antitrotobts. However there is insufficient evidence to determine whether they should be used instead of other anttrobottc. LMW Hecarins such as enoxapan and daltpan may be better than others in preventing VTE. However they may increase t he risk of bleeding. There is no evidence comparing LMW heparns with other types or other doses of t he same type of anttrotobt. 
Further research is required to determine which types and dosages are most effe ctive and safe for treating or preventing VET. 
This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 18 February 2oo8 and last revoiwed in 5 February 13. 
Background
Anticoaguant drugs are utilized to prevent the formation of blood clot in veins and arteries. These drugs are often utilized in individuals who have experienced a blood clump or who have a risk of forming one. The purpose of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of various types and amounts of antihemostatic drugs in preventing the formation and growth of blood coagulation in veins, arteries, and other organs. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effects and safety risks of different anticoaggulant drugs in the prevention of venous and arterial thrombohematoclysis. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrance Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochranc Database of Systematic Reviews) (Issue 1, January 2o13), MEDLINE (from 1o95 to January 12, o13) and EMBASE (from January 01, o995, to January o1,20013). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any type of anti‐coagulant drug with another type of drug or placebo in adults with or without a history of thrombo‐hematoclasis. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk o f bias. We calculated the risk ratios (RRs) and their 99% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included 10 studies with 1 675 6 participants in this review. The majority of the studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. The quality of the included studies varied. 
We found that low molecular weight (LMWs) heparines such as eoxapan, daltpa, and enoxpan may be beneficial in preventing thrombohmatoclyses in veins compared with control groups. However the evidence is of low certainty. 
There is no clear evidence that direct
Thromboprolxyl prevention in ambulatory patients with cancer
Background
Cancer patients have an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) due to cancer itself and treatment with chemotherapy. Thrombosis prophylactic measures are recommended for cancer patients to prevent VTE. However, there is uncertainty about which type of thrombotic prophylaxix is most effective and safe. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of different thrombosis preventive measures in ambulant cancer patients. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 26 January 2018 and reference lists of included studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different thromboti prophylaxes in ambulating cancer patients were included. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the risk for bias of included RCTs and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. 
Main results
We included 24 RCT comparing different types of thrombus prophylactics in 3,936 participants. We found that anticoaguants other then direct factor xA inhibitors and low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) are not effective in preventing VTE in ambulation cancer patients and may increase the risk in major bleedings. 
Direct factor XA inhibitors are more effective in reducing the risk VTE than placebo or other thrombophylactic measure. However they increase the risks of major bleed. 
Low molecular weight Heparin (LMW H) are more efficacious in reducing VTE when compared to placebo or without thrombophilia. However LMWH increase the incidence in major bleeds. 
Antithrombina is more efficaceous in reducing symptomatic venous blood clots when compared placebo or with no anticoagueant. However antithrobina increase the incidences of major bleads. 
Authors’ conclusions
The evidence is insufficient to recommend one type of prophylaxy over another. More research is needed to evaluate if the use thrombophilic prophlaxics is more effective and safer in specific type of cancer and chemotherapy. 
Key messages 
Anticoagulant other then factor X A inhibitors and Low molecular weight heparin are not efficacious and may be associated with an increased incidence of majorbleeds. Direct factor X inhibitors are efficacious but may increase major bleadings. Antithrombotic is efficacious, but may also increase major bleedigs. 
Further research is warranted to determine the effectiveness and safety in specific chemotherapy and type of cancers.

"Background
A pressure ulcer is defined as ""an area of localized injury to the skin and/or underlying tissue, usually over a bony prominence, as a result of pressure, or pressure in combination with shear"". The use of phototherapy ‐ that is, light (or laser) used as an adjuvant, non‐surgical intervention, with the aim of having a therapeutic effect on healing ‐ has increased recently. 
Objectives
To determine the effects of phototherapy on the healing of pressure ulcers.
Search methods
In January 2014, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid EMBASE; Ovid MEDLINE (In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); and EBSCO CINAHL. We did not restrict the search by language or publication date. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of phototherapy (in addition to standard treatment) with sham phototherapy (in addition to standard treatment), another type of phototherapy (in addition to standard treatment) or standard or conventional treatment alone. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors assessed studies for relevance and design according to the selection criteria, extracted data and evaluated study quality. The authors made attempts to obtain missing data by contacting study authors. Disagreement was resolved by consensus and discussion with a third review author. 
Main results
We identified seven RCTs involving 403 participants. All the trials were at unclear risk of bias. Trials compared the use of phototherapy with standard care only (six trials) or sham phototherapy (one trial). Only one of the trials included a third arm in which another type of phototherapy was applied. Overall, there was insufficient evidence to determine the relative effects of phototherapy for healing pressure ulcers. Time to complete healing was reported in three studies. Two studies showed the ultraviolet (UV) treated group had a shorter mean time to complete healing than the control group (mean difference ‐2.13 weeks (95% CI ‐3.53 to ‐0.72, P value 0.003)). One study reported that the laser group had a longer mean time to complete healing than the control group (mean difference 5.77 weeks; 95% CI ‐0.25 to 11.79). However, this result should be interpreted with caution, as these were small studies and the findings may have been due to chance. Three studies reported proportions of ulcers healed with a variety of results. One study reported a different outcome measure, and the other two studies had different treatment durations. These variations did not allow us to pool the studies and draw any conclusions as to whether phototherapy is effective or not. Adverse effects were reported in only two studies that compared phototherapy with control; the risk ratio for adverse events was imprecise. One study reported risk ratio (RR) 0.72 (95%CI 0.18 to 2.80). However, another study reported RR 0.89 (95% CI: 0.71 to 1.12) based on the number of events in each group, rather than the number of people with events. Among five studies reporting the rate of change in ulcer area, three studies found no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Pooling was not undertaken because of differences in outcome measures reported. The results were based on data from trials with unclear risk of bias for which generation of the randomisation sequence, concealment allocation and blinding of outcome assessors were unclear. No studies reported on quality of life, length of hospital stay, pain or cost. 
Authors' conclusions
We are very uncertain as to the effects of phototherapy in treating pressure ulcers. The quality of evidence is very low due to the unclear risk of bias and small number of trials available for analysis. The possibility of benefit or harm of this treatment cannot be ruled out. Further research is recommended.","Phototherapy for pressure ulcer healing
Background
Pressure ulcers are injuries to the body's skin and underlying tissue caused by prolonged pressure. They can be very painful and may take a long time to heal. Phototherapy is a form of light therapy that uses light (usually UV light) to treat pressure uler wounds. It is thought that the light may help to reduce pain, inflammation and infection. 
The aim of this review was to find out whether phototherapy is effective in treating pressure ulers. 
Study characteristics
We found seven studies involving 396 people. The studies were small and some of them were at high risk of being biased. The main differences between the studies were the types of light used, the duration of treatment and the way in which the light was applied to the wound. 
Key results
There was no clear evidence that phototherapy improved healing of the pressure uls. There was also no clear difference in the amount of time it took for the ulcers to heal when compared to other treatments. 
Quality of the evidence
The evidence is insufficient to draw any firm conclusions about the effectiveness of phototherpy for treating pressure ulcer. More research is needed. 
Authors' conclusions
There is insufficient evidence from the available studies to determine whether phototherpay is effective for treating the healing process of pressure ulcer wounds. More studies are needed.
Phototherapy for treating pressure sores 
Background
Pressure sores are areas of skin damage caused by prolonged pressure on the skin. They can occur anywhere on the body but most commonly affect the heels, hips, sacrum, elbows and ankles. Pressure sores can be painful and can lead to serious infections. They also cause distress and discomfort to the person affected. 
Phototherapy is a type of light therapy. It involves shining a light onto the wound to help heal it. There are several types of phototherapies, including ultraviolet light and laser. Ultraviolet light is often used to treat pressure soars. 
Objectives
To determine the effects and safety of photothermal therapies for treating people with pressure soares. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, AMED, and ClinicalTrials.gov on 16 April 2014. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing photothermal therapy with no treatment, placebo, or another form of treatment for people with a pressure sore. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information when necessary. We assessed the risk of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and other biases. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs) with 99% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous and continuous data, respectively. We pooled data using a random-effects model. 
Main results
We included six studies involving 127 participants. All studies were conducted in hospitals or nursing homes. The studies were small and varied in their design, duration, and outcome measures. The main outcome measure was time to healing of the pressure sore, measured in days. We found that ultraviolet phototherapy reduced the time to heal pressure soaries compared to no treatment. However, we are very unsure about this finding because the studies were too small to be certain that the treatment was effective. We are also very unsure if laser therapy is effective. The evidence is of very low quality. 
The evidence is uncertain regarding the effect of photthermal therapy on the proportion of pressure soarie healed. We could not pool the data because the outcome measures were different. 
There was no evidence of any difference in adverse events between the treatment and control groups. 
Quality of the evidence
The evidence was of very poor quality because of the small number and size of the studies, and because the risk for bias was unclear. 
We are uncertain whether photothermal treatments are effective for treating patients with pressure sore and the evidence is insufficient to recommend them. Further high‐quality research is needed. 
Key messages 
• Photothermal therapy may reduce the time taken to heal a pressure soare. 
• The evidence for this finding is of low quality and there is uncertainty about the true effect. 
This review is based on a Cochraine systematic review published in Issue 1, 2 015.","Phototherapy for pressure ulcer healing

Pressure ulcers are injuries to the body's skin and underlying tissue caused by prolonged pressure. They can be very painful and may take a long time to heal. Phototherapy is a type of therapy that uses light (and sometimes lasers) to treat wounds. It is thought that light may help to reduce pain, inflammation and swelling, and improve blood flow to the wound. 
The aim of this review was to find out whether phototherapy is effective for treating pressure uler wounds. 
Study characteristics
We found seven randomised controlled studies involving 396 people. These studies compared the effects phototherapy versus standard care, sham phototherpay (light without any therapeutic effect), or another type phototherapy. The studies were conducted in hospitals, nursing homes and rehabilitation centres. 
Key results
There was no clear evidence that phototherapy improves healing of a pressure ulcer. However, two studies showed that UV phototherapy may speed up healing. One study showed that laser therapy may slow down healing. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies was unclear. This means that we cannot be sure about how reliable the results are. 
Conclusion
We need more high‐quality research to determine whether phototherpy is effective in treating pressure ulcer wounds. More research is also needed to compare different types of phototherapies. 
What does this mean for people with pressure ulers?
This review shows that there is no clear benefit of phottherapy for healing a pressure ulser. However some studies suggest that UV light may speed healing. More high‐ quality research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Further research is required to compare the effectiveness of different types and doses of photothermal therapies. 
This review was last updated in January 14 2 01 4. 
Authors' conclusions: 
There is no evidence that the use phototherapy accelerates healing of chronic pressure ulsers. However two studies show that UV‐phototherapy may accelerate healing. The other studies show no effect of photatherapy. 
Future research should focus on determining the optimal dose of phototerapy and the best type of light source. 
Background
The use of light (phototherapy) as an adjunctive, noninvasive, nonpharmacological treatment for chronic pressure ulcer (PU) healing has increased in recent years. Phototherapists claim that light can reduce pain and inflammation, improve blood circulation, and promote healing. However the evidence supporting the use is limited. 
Objective
To assess the effects and safety of photoptherapy for chronic PU healing.  
Search methods 
We searched the following databases: the CoCHRANE Wounds Specialised register; CENTRAL (The Cochraine Library 2nd edition, 21st January  2204); MEDLINE 1966 to 24th January 04; EMBASSE 1888 to 02nd January 4; CINAHl 1 982 to 4th Jan 03; and the ISI Web of Knowledge (Science Citation Index Expanded and Social Sciences Citation Index) 16th January to 3rd February 05. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Eligibility criteria 
We included randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled clinical trials comparing the use o f phototherapy to standard care or sham treatment. 
Assessment of reliability 
We assessed the risk of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and other biases. We assessed the overall risk of study bias using the GRADE approach. 
Summary of findings 
We identified 7 randomised clinical trials involving 137 participants. The trials were conducted between 10th October 12 and 28th June 06. Six trials compared the effect of UV phototherapy to standard therapy. One trial compared the efficacy of laser phototherapy and standard therapy, and one trial compared UV phottherapy to laser phototheraphy. All trials were judged to be at unclear or high risk of performance bias. The quality of evidence was low due to the small number of participants, short follow‐up periods, and lack of blinding. 
UV phototherapy 
Two trials (n = 153) showed that the UV photothrapy group had faster healing times than the standard therapy group (MD = -2. 1 weeks, 9 5%CI = -3. 5 to -0. 7 weeks, P = 0 00 3). One trial (n= 29) showed no difference in healing time between the UV and standard groups (MD= 0 weeks, CI = -1. 2 to +1.2 weeks, p = 9. 8). 
Laser phototherapy
One trial ( n = 27) showed a slower healing time in the laser phottherapy group than in the
Phototherapy for pressure ulcer treatment 
Background
Pressure ulcers, also known as bedsores, are common in people who are immobile and require long‐term care. They can take a long time to heal and may cause pain. Phototherapy is a treatment that uses light to treat pressure uler wounds. It is thought that light may help to reduce inflammation and improve blood flow to the wound. 
Objectives
To determine the effects and safety of phototherapies for treating pressure ulcer wounds in adults. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov on 14 April 2016. We also searched reference lists of included studies and contacted relevant authors. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials comparing phototherapy versus control for treating acute or chronic pressure ulers in adults were eligible for inclusion. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We analysed continuous data using mean differences and risk ratios (RRs) with 99% confidence intervals (CIs). We used the I² statistic to quantify heterogeneity. 
Main results
We included 10 studies involving 526 participants. All studies were at high risk of performance and detection bias. The studies were conducted in hospitals, nursing homes, and rehabilitation centres. 
The studies compared phototherapeutic treatments with control treatments. The control treatments included standard care, no treatment, or placebo. The phototherapeutics included UV radiation, visible light, and laser therapy. 
We found no evidence that phototherapy reduces the time to healing of pressure ulsers. We found no clear evidence that it increases the proportion of ulsures healed. We did not find any evidence that the treatment causes more adverse events. 
Quality of the results
The quality of the available evidence was very low. This means that we are very unsure about the effects. The small number and size of the studies means that the results may be unreliable. 
Further research is needed to determine if phototherapy has any effect on the time it takes for pressure ulcer to heal, the proportion healed, or the number or severity of adverse events associated with the treatment. 
Study limitations
The studies were small and had methodological problems. The risk of selection bias was unclear. The use of different outcome measures made it difficult to compare the results of the included studies. 
Key messages
We found very low‐quality evidence that suggests that phototheraphy may not be effective in treating acute and chronic pressure ulcer. 
Phototherapy may increase the number healed but the evidence is not strong enough to support this conclusion. 
There is no clear information about the number, severity, or type of adverse effects associated with phototherapy. 
More research is required to determine the effectiveness of phottherapy for treating chronic pressure uers. 
This review was updated in April 19, 2107. 
Author's conclusions
The evidence is insufficient to determine whether photothera­py is effective in reducing the time taken to heal pressure ulc­ers. The evidence is also insufficient to deter­mine whether photather­apy is effective for increasing the proportion heal­ed. The paucity of evidence and the methodological issues make it difficult for us to draw any firm conclusions. Further re­search is needed.

"Background
End‐stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a chronic, debilitative and progressive illness that may need interventions such as dialysis, transplantation, dietary and fluid restrictions. Most patients with ESKD will require renal replacement therapy, such as kidney transplantation or maintenance dialysis. Advance care planning traditionally encompass instructions via living wills, and concern patient preferences about interventions such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation and feeding tubes, or circumstances around assigning surrogate decision makers. Most people undergoing haemodialysis are not aware of advance care planning and few patients formalise their wishes as advance directives and of those who do, many do not discuss their decisions with a physician. Advance care planning involves planning for future healthcare decisions and preferences of the patient in advance while comprehension is intact. It is an essential part of good palliative care that likely improves the lives and deaths of haemodialysis patients. 
Objectives
The objective of this review was to determine whether advance care planning in haemodialysis patients, compared with no or less structured forms of advance care planning, can result in fewer hospital admissions or less use of treatments with life‐prolonging or curative intent, and if patient's wishes were followed at end‐of‐life. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 27 June 2016 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. We also searched the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Social Work Abstracts (OvidSP). 
Selection criteria
All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs (RCTs in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) looking at advance care planning versus no form of advance care planning in haemodialysis patients was considered for inclusion without language restriction. 
Data collection and analysis
Data extraction was carried out independently by two authors using standard data extraction forms. Studies reported in non‐English language journals were translated before assessment. Where more than one publication of one study exists, reports were grouped together and the publication with the most complete data was used in the analyses. Where relevant outcomes are only published in earlier versions these data were used. Any discrepancies between published versions were highlighted. Non‐randomised controlled studies were excluded. 
Main results
We included two studies (three reports) that involved 337 participants which investigated advance care planning for people with ESKD. Neither of the included studies reported outcomes relevant to this review. Study quality was assessed as suboptimal. 
Authors' conclusions
We found sparse data that were assessed at suboptimal quality and therefore we were unable to formulate conclusions about whether advance care planning can influence numbers of hospital admissions and treatment required by people with ESKD, or if patients' advance care directives were followed at end‐of‐life. Further well designed and adequately powered RCTs are needed to better inform patient and clinical decision‐making about advance care planning and advance directives among people with ESKD who are undergoing dialysis.","Advance care planning among haemodiafiltration patients
Background
Haemodialysed patients often have a poor quality of life and are at risk of death. They may be admitted to hospital frequently and receive treatments that prolong life but are not necessarily beneficial. Advance directives allow patients to express their preferences regarding future treatment options. 
Study characteristics
We reviewed the evidence on the effects of advance directives on the number of hospital admissions and the use of life‐palinging or life‐saving treatments in haemo‐dialysis patients in comparison with no advance directives. We found two studies that met our inclusion criteria. One study was conducted in the United States and the other in Australia. Both studies were conducted in hospitals. The studies recruited adult haemodi‐laised patients who were receiving haemodilysis treatment. The participants were randomly allocated to either receive advance directives or not. The main outcome measures were the number and type of hospitalisations, and the number or types of treatments received. 
Key results
One study was of high quality and the second was of moderate quality. The study in the US recruited 149 participants and the Australian study recruited 215 participants. The average age of the participants was 66 years. The number of participants who received advance directives was 73 in the first study and 100 in the second study. The first study showed that patients who received advanced directives had fewer hospitalisations than those who did not receive advance directive. The second study showed no difference in the number hospitalisations between the two groups. The Australian study showed a reduction in the use and duration of some treatments in the group who received an advance directive compared with the group that did not. 
Quality of the evidence
The evidence is based on two studies with a total of 364 participants. There is a lack of evidence on how well the advance directives were followed. 
Conclusion
Advance directives may reduce the number, duration and intensity of hospitalisation and the amount of treatments given to haemolysis patients who are receiving haemo dialysis treatment, but further research is needed. 
Authors' conclusions: 
There is limited evidence from two RCTs that advance directives may lead to fewer hospitalizations and less use and intensity or duration of treatments in patients receiving haemosorption treatment. Further research is required to assess the impact of advance directive on the quality of care provided to patients receiving hemodialysis. 
Background
This review examines the effects on hospital admissions, treatments and quality of death of advance planning for patients receiving dialysis for end‐stage renal disease. 
Objective
To examine the effects, on hospital admission, treatments, and quality and timing of death, of advance plans for patients with end‐state renal disease receiving dialytic treatment. 
Eligibility criteria
Randomized controlled trials comparing advance planning with no planning or less planned care in adults receiving dialy‐sis for end stage renal disease were eligible for inclusion. 
Selection process
We used the standard search strategy of the Co‐chrane Renal Group Trials Register, which is a specialised register of randomised trials, supplemented by searches of the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, BIOSIS, Science Citation Index, Current Contents, LILACS, and WHO ICTRP. We searched the reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Assessment of methodological quality
Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological qualities of the included studies. 
Mea‐surement criteria
We extracted data on the primary outcomes of hospital admission and treatment. Secondary outcomes included quality of dying, quality of living, and satisfaction with care. 
Results of synthesis
We identified two studies. One was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and the oth‐er was a quasi‐RCT. The RCT was conducted by the University of California, San Francisco, and recruited 447 participants. Participants were randomized to receive advance planning or no advance planning. The mean age of participants was approximately 67 years. In the RCT, there was no significant difference in hospital admissions between the groups. However, there were fewer hospital days in the advance planning group. There was no difference between the advance plan‐ning and no advance planing groups in the proportion of participants receiving treatments. The quasi‐randomized controlled trial was conducted at the Royal Adelaide Hospital, Australia. Participants in the study were randomized into two groups: one group received advance planning and the others did not, and both groups were treated according to the same protocol. The median age of patients was 59 years. There were no significant differences in hospital admission rates between the group with advance planning (n = 112) and those without advance planning(n = 222). However, the group receiving advance planning had fewer treatments than the group without advance plans. 
Conclusions
There is a paucity of evidence regarding the effects and outcomes of advance planning for patients on dialysis receiving haematodialysis treatment
Advance care planning in people with end‐stage kidney disease 
Background
End‐stage renal disease (ESKD) is a progressive condition where the kidneys fail to function properly. People with ESDK require dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive. Advance care planning involves discussing a person's preferences for future health care with their family and friends, and writing down their wishes in an advance directive. This document can be used by doctors and nurses to guide their decisions when a person is too unwell to make their own decisions. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of advance care plans on hospital admissions, treatment required, and the following of advance directives in people who have ESKDs. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register (2016, Issue 4), CENTRAL (25 April 2009), MEDLINE (1946 to 25 May 2106), Embase (1888 to 19 June 2206) and CINAHL (1 January 1875 to 30 June 1207). We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing advance care plan interventions with usual care or no intervention in adults with ESRD. 
Study characteristics
We identified two studies that met our inclusion criteria. Both studies were conducted in the USA. One study compared advance care planners with usual dialysis care. The other study compared a written advance directive with usual treatment. 
Key results
Neither study reported any outcomes relevant for this review, so we were not able to draw any conclusions about the effects on hospital admission, treatment requirements, or the following up of advance directive wishes. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies was rated as low. This means that the studies were poorly designed and had a high risk of bias. 
Review authors' conclusions 
There is a lack of evidence regarding the effects and outcomes of advance planning in ESKDS. Well designed and sufficiently powered randomised controlled trails are needed. 
Further research should aim to include people with a wide range of backgrounds and ages, and to compare different types of advance plans. 
This review was last updated on 29 July 2306.","Advance care planning: a systematic review 
Background 
End‐state kidney disease is a serious condition that requires interventions such dialysis or transplantation. Most haem‐dialysis patients are not fully aware of their options and few have formally documented their preferences. Advance planning involves making plans for future health care decisions and expressing preferences for treatment in advance when the person is still able to make decisions. This review aimed to assess the effects of advance planning on the number of hospital admissions and the use of life‐saving or curatively intended treatments in haemat‐dialisysis patients and whether patients' wishes were respected at the end‐ of‐life.
Study characteristics 
We identified two studies that met our inclusion criteria. Both studies were conducted in the United States. One study recruited 154 patients and the other 183 patients. The studies were similar in design and both used a randomised control trial (RCT) design. One of the studies was a single‐blind RCT and the second was a double‐blind trial. The first study was conducted in a dialysis unit and the latter in a community setting. Both trials used a written advance directive as the intervention. The main outcome measures were the number and type of hospital admission, the use and type and duration of life saving or curiously intended treatments, and the respect of patients' preferences at the time of death. 
Key results 
The studies showed that advance planning did not reduce the number or type of admissions to hospital. However, there was a trend towards fewer admissions in the group that received advance planning. There was also a trend toward fewer admissions to intensive care units in the advance planning group. The number of admissions for acute renal failure was reduced in the advanced planning group but the difference was not statistically significant. There were no differences in the use or type or duration of treatments between the groups. There is no evidence that advance care plans were followed more often in the intervention group. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low because of the small number of participants in the studies and the lack of blinding. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is no strong evidence that advanced care planning reduces the number, type or intensity of hospitalisations in haemo‐diale‐sis patients. There are also no strong findings regarding the use, type, duration or adherence to treatments. There may be a trend to fewer admissions for renal failure in the patients who received advance care plan‐ning. There appears to be no evidence of increased adherence to patients' advance care preferences.

Advance care planning in people with end‐stage renal disease
Background
People with end stage renal disease (ESKD) are at risk of frequent hospital admissions, unnecessary treatments and death. Advance care planning (ACP) is a process where people discuss their preferences for future health care with their family, friends and doctors. ACP may help people with kidney failure to make decisions about their future health and reduce the burden on their families. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of ACP on hospital admissions; treatment received; and the number of people who follow their advance care directive (ACD) when they die. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register (2015, Issue 4), CENTRAL (21st May 2009), MEDLINE (1966 to 21 May 1999), EMBASE (1888 to 11 May, 2209) and CINAHL (10 May 09). We also searched the reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ACP with usual care in adults with ESDK. 
Study characteristics
We identified two studies involving 347 participants. Both studies were conducted in the USA. One study compared ACP delivered by a nurse practitioner with usual dialysis care. The other study compared a nurse‐led ACP intervention with usual nephrology care. 
Key results
Neither study reported any outcomes relevant for this review, so we were not able to draw any conclusions about the effects ACP might have on hospital admission rates, treatment received or the number people who followed their ACD when they died. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the studies was low because of poor reporting of randomisation, blinding and outcome measurement. 
Review authors' conclusions 
We found no studies that were of high enough quality to allow us to draw conclusions about ACP in people receiving dialysis for ESKDs. Further research is needed to determine the effects that ACP has on hospitalisations, treatment and the adherence to ACDs. 
Further research should be designed to address the following questions: 
• What is the effect of ACD on hospitalisation? 
• How does ACP affect the number and type of treatments given to people with chronic kidney disease? 
What is the impact of AIP on the adherence of people with CKD to their ACP?

"Background
Embryo transfer (ET) was traditionally performed two days after oocyte retrieval; however, developments in culture media have allowed embryos to be maintained in culture for longer periods. Delaying transfer from Day two to Day three would allow for further development of the embryo and might have a positive effect on pregnancy outcomes. 
Objectives
To determine if there are any differences in live birth and pregnancy rates when embryo transfer is performed on day three after oocyte retrieval, compared with day two, in infertile couples undergoing treatment with in vitro fertilisation (IVF), including intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid) from the inception of the databases to 26th April 2016. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO portal for ongoing trials plus citation lists of relevant publications, review articles and included studies, as well as abstracts of appropriate scientific meetings. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials that compared Day 3 versus Day 2 embryo transfer after oocyte retrieval during an IVF or ICSI treatment cycle in infertile couples. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. The primary outcome measures were live birth rate and ongoing pregnancy rate. 
Main results
We included 15 studies. Fourteen studies reported data per woman (2894 women) and one study reported data per cycle (969 cycles). The quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach ranged from moderate quality to very low quality. The main reasons for downgrading evidence were poor methodological reporting, selective reporting, inconsistency and imprecision. 
Live birth per woman ‐ Overall, there was no evidence of a difference in live birth rate between Day three and Day two embryo transfer (risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.23; three studies, n = 1200 women; I2 = 63%; very low quality evidence). The data suggest that if 32% of women who underwent a Day two embryo transfer had a live birth, then between 28% to 39% of women undergoing a Day three embryo transfer would have a live birth. 
Ongoing pregnancy per woman ‐ There was no evidence of a difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for ongoing pregnancy (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.12; six studies, n = 1740 women; I2 = 52%; very low quality of evidence). The data suggest that if 33% of women undergoing a Day two embryo transfer had an ongoing pregnancy then between 28% to 37% of women undergoing a Day three embryo transfer would have an ongoing pregnancy. 
Clinical pregnancy per woman ‐ There was no evidence of a difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for the chance of a clinical pregnancy (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.19; 12 studies, n = 2461, I2 = 51%; very low quality evidence). The data suggest that if 39% of women undergoing Day two embryo transfer had a clinical pregnancy, then between 38% to 46% of women undergoing a Day three embryo transfer would have a clinical pregnancy. 
Multiple pregnancy per woman ‐ There was no evidence of a difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for the risk of a multiple pregnancy (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.44; eight studies, n = 1837; I2 = 0%; moderate quality evidence). The data suggest that if 11% of women undergoing Day two embryo transfer had a multiple pregnancy, then between 9% to 15% of women undergoing a Day three embryo transfer would have a multiple pregnancy. 
Miscarriage rate per woman ‐ There was no evidence of a difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for the risk of miscarriage (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.60; nine studies, n = 2153 women, I2 = 26%; moderate quality evidence). The data suggest that if 6% of women undergoing Day two embryo transfer had a miscarriage, then between 5% to 10% of women undergoing a Day three embryo transfer would have a miscarriage. 
Ectopic pregnancy rate per woman ‐ There was no evidence of a difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for the risk of ectopic pregnancy (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.29 to 3.40; six studies, n = 1531 women, I2 = 0%; low quality evidence). The data suggest that if 0.7% of women undergoing Day two embryo transfer have an ectopic pregnancy, then between 0.2% to 2% of women undergoing Day three embryo transfer would have an ectopic pregnancy. 
Subgroup analysis for pregnancy outcomes did not identify any differential effect between IVF and ICSI. 
None of the included studies prespecified complication rate (e.g. OHSS), fetal abnormality or women's evaluation of the procedure as outcomes in their studies. 
Authors' conclusions
Twelve of 15 studies contributed data that could be included in meta‐analyses. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low. Only three of the 15 studies reported data for live birth, although the data for ongoing pregnancy and clinical pregnancy are consistent with the live birth data, suggesting no difference between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for these outcomes. There was no evidence of a difference identified between Day three and Day two embryo transfer for multiple pregnancy, miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy per woman randomised. No data were reported for complication rate, fetal abnormality or woman's evaluation of the procedure. The current evidence has not identified any evidence of differences in pregnancy outcomes between Day two and Day three embryo transfers. Any further studies comparing these timings of embryo transfer are unlikely to alter the findings and we suggest that this review no longer be updated.","Delaying embryo transfer from day two to day three may increase live birth rates in infertilite couples undergoing IVF treatment. 
Background
In vitro fertilization (IV) involves retrieving eggs from a woman's ovaries and fertilizing them with sperm in a laboratory. The resulting embryos are then transferred back into the woman's uterus. Traditionally, embryos are transferred two days following egg retrieval. However, advances in culture medium have allowed for embryos to develop in the laboratory for longer. This means that embryos can be transferred three days after egg retrieval instead of two. 
Objective
To assess whether delaying embryo transfer to day 3 after egg collection improves live birth or pregnancy rates in women undergoing IV treatment.  
Study characteristics
We identified 14 studies involving 2,893 women and one small study involving 968 cycles. All studies were conducted in Europe, North America and Australia. The studies were published between 1997 and 2106. 
Key results
There was no difference in the number of women having a live baby or having a baby that survived at least 24 hours after birth between women who had their embryos transferred on day 2 and those who had them transferred on Day  3. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of evidence was rated as very low because of poor reporting of study details, inconsistency in results across studies and uncertainty about the precision of the results. 
Conclusion
There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend delaying embryo transfers from day  2 to day3 in women who are undergoing IVT. 
Authors' conclusions: 
There is no evidence that delaying embryo implantation from day2 today3 improves livebirth or pregnancy rate in women receiving IVF. 
Implications for practice and research
This review provides little new information to inform clinical practice. Future research should focus on improving the quality of reporting of studies, particularly in relation to the use of blinding and randomisation. 
Future research should also focus on the long‐term effects of transferring embryos on day3. This could include the risk of multiple pregnancies, the risk to the mother and the child of being exposed to high levels of radiation and the impact of this on the child's development. 
Further research should investigate the effect of different types of culture medium on embryo development and the effect on the success of the treatment.
Day three embryo transfers versus day two embryo transfers for IVF 
Objective 
To determine whether embryo transfer on day three of the menstrual cycle is more effective than embryo transfer after two days for improving live birth rates and other pregnancy outcomes in women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register (2012), CENTRAL (The Cochrance Library 2020, Issue 1), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from January 1, 1688), LILACS (from July 14, 2100), CINAHL (from April 10, 0001), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (from December 22,20 13). We also searched reference lists of included studies and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing day three embryo trans- fer with day two transfer in women who were undergoing IVF. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We performed meta-analyses where appropriate. 
Main results 
We included 1 2 RCTs involving 2 4 6 1 women. All studies were conducted in Europe. The studies were at high risk of selection bias and unclear risk of performance and detection bias. The certainty of evidence was very low for most outcomes. 
There was no evi- dence of a differ- ence in live births between day three and day two transfers (RR =  1 . 0 5 ; 9 5 % CI  0 . 8 9 t o  2 . 3 3 ; 3 studies,  900  women; very low certainty of evi­ dence). The certainty was very  low for ongoing pregnancies (RR= 0·98; 9. 5%CI 0 · 85 t o l . 1 t ; 6 studies, l 74 0 women, very low certi­ tainty of evidence) and clinical pregnancies ( RR =  l . l 2 ;  5 5 t 0 l . t 4 ; 1 l  studies, t 26 6 i w o m e n ;  very low c ertainty of ev i d e n c e ). The certainty  of evidence for multiple preg­ nancies was moderate (RR=l. 1 i ; 55 t0 l. 44 ; eight studies;  83 7 w o men; moderate certainty of e v i dence) and miscarriages (RR=i. 08; l 5 to l. l 9 ;  l 1 s t u d i e s ; 23 4 i w om e n; moderate certi t y of evidence ). 
Authors' conclusions 
There is no ev i ­ d e nc e to support or reject the use of day three over day two embryos for IV F.  The certainty o f e v idence for most out comes was very l ow.  Future studies should be designed to address these limitations.
Day three embryo transfers versus day two embryo transfers for IVF 
Objective 
To determine whether there is a difference in the rates of live birth and ongoing pregnancy when using day three embryo transplants compared with day two. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Fertility and Sterility Group Specialised Register (February 2016) and the CoCHRANE Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 1, 23 February 2 2, Issue 1 24 February 16). We also searched MEDLINE (1946 to February 3, 12 17), Embase (1 January 1980 to February, 3 13 22) and CINAHL (1 Jan 1 Jan to February. 31 14 25). We handsearched reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials comparing day three and day two embryos in women undergoing IVF. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the body of evidence. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and 99% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes. We pooled data using random effects models. 
Main results 
We included 1 five studies involving 2751 women. The studies were of moderate to high quality. The included studies were conducted in the UK, Australia, Israel, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and the USA. 
The studies compared day three with day one embryo transfers. The main outcome measures were live birth rate, ongoing pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate, ectopic pregnancies, and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). 
Live birth rate ‐ The data suggested that if the live births rate was 28% in women who underwent day three transfers, then the live‐birth rate would be 29% in those who underwent a day two transfer. 
Ongoing pregnancy rate ‑ The data showed that if women who undergo day three transfer had an ongoing pregnancy at a rate of 42%, then women who had undergone a day‐two transfer would also have an ongoing preganancy at a similar rate of about 43%. 
Miscarrage rate ‗ The data show that if a miscarriages rate of around 6. 5 % was seen in women receiving day three embryos, then a similar miscarriage rates of around six percent would be seen in those receiving day two transfers. 
Hectopic pregnancy ‐ No evidence of difference between day three versus day one transfers for the rate of ectopie pregnancy. The data suggests that if one percent of women receiving a day three treatment had an ectopique pregnancy, the same rate would also be seen among women receiving the day two treatment. 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of evidence ranged between moderate and very low quality. 
We found no evidence that day three or day two treatments were associated with a difference for the rates for OHSS, fetal abnormalities, or women 's evaluation of their treatment.
Day three vs day two embryo transfers for IVF
Background
In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a reproductive technology used to help couples who have difficulty conceiving naturally. In IVF, eggs are removed from the ovaries and fertilised by sperm in a laboratory. Embryos are then transferred back into the uterus. The timing of embryo transfers can vary, but most commonly embryos are transferred on Day 2 or Day 3 after egg collection. 
Objectives
To compare the effectiveness of embryo day three versus day two transfers for women undergoing IVF. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Fertility and Sterility Group Specialised Register (February 2017), CENTRAL (2020, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1946 to February 23, 2107), Embase (1888 to February, 11 2207) and LILACS (1 January 1982 to February. 25, 3016). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing day three embryo transfer versus day one embryo transfer in women undergoing assisted reproduction. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias of the studies and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the body of evidence. 
Main results
We included 16 RCTs involving 1,582 women. All studies were at high risk of performance and detection bias. We included 24 comparisons of day three vs. day two transfer. The included studies were published between 1 992 and 2 015. The studies were conducted in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom and the United States. 
The certainty of evidence for the outcomes of interest was moderate to low. We found no evidence to support or refute the use of day two vs. three embryo trans­fer for live births, ongoing pregnancies, clinical pregnancies, multiple pregnancies, miscarriages or ectopics. We did not find any evidence to suggest that day two or three embryo transf­er had a differential effect on OHSS, fetal abnormalities or women’s evaluation of their treatment. 
Quality of the reviews
The certainty in the evidence was low to very limited due to the small number of studies and the risk for bias. 
We found no new evidence since the last update in 2. 009. We suggest that the review no long be updated and that the evidence base remains unchanged. 
Study limitations
The included studies had a high risk for performance and detectio bias. The majority of studies were funded by the pharmaceutical industry. The sample sizes were small and the studies were heterogeneous. 
Conclusions
There is no evidence from this review to support the use or avoidance of day one vs. two embryo transfe. We recommend that future studies should focus on the use and effects of day four embryo transfer. 
Key messages
• There is no difference in live birth rates between day two and day three transfers. 
• There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was a difference in ongoing pregnancy rates between the two transfer times. 
This review suggests that there is no reason to change the current practice of transferring day two embryos. 
Further research is needed to determine the effects of different embryo transfer timings. 
Future studies should include larger numbers of participants, focus on specific populations and use standardised outcome measures. 
Implications for practice
The current evidence does not support the routine use of either day two versus day three or day three over day two. 
What this means for you
If you are planning to have IVF treatment, you may be offered a choice of when your embryos will be transferred into your uterus. This review suggests there is little difference in the chances of having a baby if you choose to have your embryos transferred on day two rather than day three. 
If you have been offered a day two over a day three transfer, you should discuss the pros and cons of each option with your fertility specialist. 
For more information about IVF see the Co­chrane Review on IVF for women with blocked fallopian tubes. 
How this review was done
This review includes 12 studies that compared the use day two with day three embryos in women who were undergoing IV. The main outcomes were live birth and ongoing pregnancy. The certainty of this evidence was moderate. 
There was no difference for livebirth or ongoing pregnancy between day three and day two transfe, but there was no data available for other outcomes such as multiple pregnancies or miscarriages. 
No new evidence was identified since the previous update in. 1","Delaying embryo transfer from day two to day three may improve pregnancy outcomes in infertilized couples undergoing IVF treatment. 
Background
In vitro fertilization (IV) involves retrieving eggs from a woman's ovaries, fertilizing them with sperm in a laboratory dish, and transferring the resulting embryos back into the woman's uterus. Traditionally, embryo transfer has been performed two to three days after egg retrieval. However, advances in culture medium technology have allowed for embryos to develop in culture beyond day two. 
Objective
To assess whether delaying embryo transfer to day 3 after egg collection improves pregnancy outcomes for infertiled couples undergoing in vitro treatment.  
Study characteristics
We identified 14 studies that compared embryo transfer on day 2 versus day 4. The studies included 2,893 women and 967 cycles. All studies were conducted in Europe and North America. 
Key results
There was no significant difference in the number of live births between women who received embryo transfer at day 1 versus day three. There was also no significant change in the proportion of ongoing pregnancies between women receiving embryo transfer day 0 versus day four. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of evidence was rated as very low due to the risk of bias in the studies. 
Implications for Practice
This review suggests that there is no benefit to delaying embryo transfers from day  two to  day three in infertiiled couples. This finding is consistent with other reviews that have found no benefit of delaying embryo transfe‌rs. 
Further research is needed to identify the optimal timing of embryo transfer. 
Limitations
The studies included in this review were small and had a high risk of selection bias. 
Future research should include larger numbers of participants and should be conducted in multiple centers.

Day three vs. day two embryo transfers 
What is the question? 
The question is whether transferring embryos on Day three of development is better than transferring them on Day two. 
Who cares? 
This is important for couples who want to have a baby through assisted reproduction. 
What was studied? 
We searched for all relevant studies published up to 2016. We included 13 studies with a total of 2567 women who were trying to become pregnant through assisted reproductive technology (ART). Women were randomly assigned to receive either a Day 2 or a Day3 embryo transfer. We looked at the number of live births, ongoing pregnancies, clinical pregnancies, and multiple pregnancies. 
Key results 
There was no difference in the number or proportion of women having a live baby after a Day2 or Day3 transfer. 
There were no differences in the numbers or proportions of women becoming pregnant after a transfer on either day. 
The number of multiple pregnancies was similar after both types of transfer. However, the number and proportion of miscarriages was higher after a day 2 transfer. This may be because women who are older tend to have more embryos transferred on Day 3. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies varied widely. Some studies did not report enough information to allow us to calculate precise estimates of the effects. 
Conclusion 
There is no evidence that one type of embryo transfer is better or worse than the other. 
Implications for practice 
Women should be told about the risks and benefits of both types before they decide which type of transfer to have. 
Further research 
Future studies should aim to include more women, especially those who are over 35 years old. They should also report more information so that we can calculate precise effects.
Day three versus day two embryo transfers for in vitro fertilization 
Background 
In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a treatment for infertility. It involves removing eggs from a woman's ovaries and fertilising them with sperm outside the body. The fertilised eggs are then transferred back into the woman's uterus. 
The timing of the embryo transfer is important. Embryo transfer can be done on day three or day two after the eggs are removed from the woman. Day three transfers involve transferring embryos that have been cultured for three days. Day two transfers involve embryos that are cultured for only two days. 
This review looked at whether there were differences between day three and day two transfers for the number of babies born, miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies and other complications. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for studies published up to 5 April 2015. We found 16 studies that compared day three with day two transfer. These studies involved 4656 women who received IVF treatment. 
Key results 
There was no difference in the number or type of babies that were born when day three versus two transfers were used. 
There were no differences in miscarriage rates between day two and day three transfers. 
Day three transfers were associated with a slightly lower risk of having an ectopically implanted embryo (embryo that implants outside the uterus). 
Quality of the studies 
The quality of evidence ranged between moderate and very low, depending on the outcome being studied. 
Quality assessment 
The certainty of the findings was assessed using GRADE methodology. 
What does this mean? 
The evidence suggests that there is no difference for the numbers of babies or miscarriages when day two versus day three embryo transfers are used. Day one transfers may be associated with fewer ectopic embryos. However, the certainty of this finding is low. 
Future research 
Future studies should aim to include more women and follow them up for longer. They should also report on the numbers and types of babies, miscarriage and ectopic rates. 
Author's conclusions 
Day one transfers appear to be associated less often with ectopic implantation than day two or day three. However the certainty (quality) of this evidence is low and further research is needed. 
Review question 
To assess the effects of day three vs day two IVF embryo transfer on pregnancy outcomes. 
Search methods 
We used the Cochrane Register of Studies, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We searched for unpublished conference abstracts and grey literature. We last searched the databases on 5th April  2０15 . 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials comparing day three to day two in vitro ﬂuoridation embryo transfer. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We contacted study authors for additional information. We used GRADE to assess the certainty in the evidence. 
Main results 
We included 12 studies involving 4,655 women. All studies were conducted in Europe. The studies were of moderate to high quality. 
We found no evidence that day three transfer was associated with higher or lower live birth rates than day three (RR=1.04, ９５%CI 0 91 to １.18; 13 studies, 4515 women; I²=0%). 
We also found no difference when we compared day two to day three for miscarriage rate (RR = １ .16， ９ 5 % CI ０ . ８ ４ ｔｏ １ ． ６ ０； ９ studies， 2 1 5 3 women; ９5%CI: 0 . 8 4 ｔo 1 . 6 0; I ² = ２ ６ %）.

Day three versus day two embryo transfers in IVF 
Background
In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a reproductive technology used to help people who have difficulty conceiving naturally. In IVF, eggs are removed from a woman's ovaries and fertilised with sperm in a laboratory. Embryos are then transferred into the woman's uterus. The timing of embryo transfers can vary. In some cases, embryos are transferred on the third day after egg collection (day three). In other cases, they are transferred earlier, on the second day after collection (called day two). 
Objectives
To assess the effects of transferring embryos on day three versus transferring them on day two in women undergoing IVF. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register (2016, Issue 1), CENTRAL (2nd Quarter 2009), MEDLINE (1946 to April 23, 2106), EMBASE (1880 to April, 16 2206) and LILACS (1 January 1982 to April. 17, 0205). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing day three embryo transfer with day two transfer in women receiving IVF treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias of the studies and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) and standard deviations (SD) for continuous outcomes. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the body of evidence. 
Main results
We included 12 RCTs involving 1,625 women. The studies were conducted in Europe, North America, Asia and Australia. The included studies had a high risk of performance and detection bias. 
The main outcome of interest was live birth. We found no evidence that day three transfer was better than day two for live births. However, there was evidence that women who received day three transfers were more likely to have a multiple pregnancy. Women who received a day three treatment cycle were also more likely than those who received the day two treatment cycle to experience ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). 
The certainty of evidence for the main outcomes was low to very uncertain. The certainty of most of the other outcomes was moderate to high. 
Quality of the reviews
The certainty in the evidence was low because of the risk that the studies may have been biased. 
This review is based on the best available evidence. However we cannot be certain that the results are correct. We need further research to confirm the findings. 
We suggest that future studies compare the day three and day two timings of transfer in a way that will allow us to answer the questions raised by this review. 
Key messages 
There is no evidence from this review that day two or day three embryos transfers are better than the other for livebirth. 
Women who receive a day two cycle are less likely to experience OHSS than those receiving a day 3 cycle. 
There was no difference in the number of ongoing pregnancies between day two and day three cycles. 
No difference was found in the numbers of clinical pregnancies between the two groups. 
It is not possible to say whether there is a difference in miscarriage rates between the day 2 and day  3 cycles.  
There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was a difference between the groups in the rates of ectopic pregnancies. 
Future studies should be designed to address the issues raised by the review."
"Background
Onychomycosis refers to fungal infections of the nail apparatus that may cause pain, discomfort, and disfigurement. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2007; a substantial amount of new research warrants a review exclusively on toenails. 
Objectives
To assess the clinical and mycological effects of topical drugs and device‐based therapies for toenail onychomycosis. 
Search methods
We searched the following databases up to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers, and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials of topical and device‐based therapies for onychomycosis in participants with toenail onychomycosis, confirmed by positive cultures, direct microscopy, or histological nail examination. Eligible comparators were placebo, vehicle, no treatment, or an active topical or device‐based treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were complete cure rate (normal‐looking nail plus fungus elimination, determined with laboratory methods) and number of participants reporting treatment‐related adverse events. 
Main results
We included 56 studies (12,501 participants, average age: 27 to 68 years), with mainly mild‐to‐moderate onychomycosis without matrix involvement (where reported). Participants had more than one toenail affected. Most studies lasted 48 to 52 weeks; 23% reported disease duration (variable). Thirty‐five studies specifically examined dermatophyte‐caused onychomycosis. Forty‐three studies were carried out in outpatient settings. Most studies assessed topical treatments, 9% devices, and 11% both. 
We rated three studies at low risk of bias across all domains. The most common high‐risk domain was performance bias. We present results for key comparisons, where treatment duration was 36 or 48 weeks, and clinical outcomes were measured at 40 to 52 weeks. 
Based on two studies (460 participants), compared with vehicle, ciclopirox 8% lacquer may be more effective in achieving complete cure (risk ratio (RR) 9.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.72 to 50.14; low‐quality evidence) and is probably more effective in achieving mycological cure (RR 3.15, 95% CI 1.93 to 5.12; moderate‐quality evidence). Ciclopirox lacquer may lead to increased adverse events, commonly application reactions, rashes, and nail alteration (e.g. colour, shape). However, the 95% CI indicates that ciclopirox lacquer may actually make little or no difference (RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.92; low‐quality evidence). 
Efinaconazole 10% solution is more effective than vehicle in achieving complete cure (RR 3.54, 95% CI 2.24 to 5.60; 3 studies, 1716 participants) and clinical cure (RR 3.07, 95% CI 2.08 to 4.53; 2 studies, 1655 participants) (both high‐quality evidence) and is probably more effective in achieving mycological cure (RR 2.31, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.94; 3 studies, 1716 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). Risk of adverse events (such as dermatitis and vesicles) was slightly higher with efinaconazole (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.20; 3 studies, 1701 participants; high‐quality evidence). No other key comparison measured clinical cure. 
Based on two studies, compared with vehicle, tavaborole 5% solution is probably more effective in achieving complete cure (RR 7.40, 95% CI 2.71 to 20.24; 1198 participants), but probably has a higher risk of adverse events (application site reactions were most commonly reported) (RR 3.82, 95% CI 1.65 to 8.85; 1186 participants (both moderate‐quality evidence)). Tavaborole improves mycological cure (RR 3.40, 95% CI 2.34 to 4.93; 1198 participants; high‐quality evidence). 
Moderate‐quality evidence from two studies (490 participants) indicates that P‐3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer) is probably more effective than the comparators ciclopirox 8% lacquer or amorolfine 5% in achieving complete cure (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.32 to 4.48), but there is probably little or no difference between the treatments in achieving mycological cure (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.37). We found no difference in the risk of adverse events (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.92; 2 studies, 487 participants; low‐quality evidence). The most common events were erythema, rash, and burning. 
Three studies (112 participants) compared 1064‐nm Nd:YAG laser to no treatment or sham treatment. We are uncertain if there is a difference in adverse events (very low‐quality evidence) (two studies; 85 participants). There may be little or no difference in mycological cure at 52 weeks (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.85; 2 studies, 85 participants; low‐quality evidence). Complete cure was not measured. 
One study (293 participants) compared luliconazole 5% solution to vehicle. We are uncertain whether luliconazole leads to higher rates of complete cure (very low‐quality evidence). Low‐quality evidence indicates there may be little or no difference in adverse events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.16) and there may be increased mycological cure with luliconazole; however, the 95% CI indicates that luliconazole may make little or no difference to mycological cure (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.97). Commonly‐reported adverse events were dry skin, paronychia, eczema, and hyperkeratosis, which improved or resolved post‐treatment. 
Authors' conclusions
Assessing complete cure, high‐quality evidence supports the effectiveness of efinaconazole, moderate‐quality evidence supports P‐3051 (ciclopirox 8% hydrolacquer) and tavaborole, and low‐quality evidence supports ciclopirox 8% lacquer. We are uncertain whether luliconazole 5% solution leads to complete cure (very low‐quality evidence); this outcome was not measured by the 1064‐nm Nd:YAG laser comparison. Although evidence supports topical treatments, complete cure rates with topical treatments are relatively low. 
We are uncertain if 1064‐nm Nd:YAG laser increases adverse events compared with no treatment or sham treatment (very low‐quality evidence). Low‐quality evidence indicates that there is no difference in adverse events between P‐3051 (ciclopirox hydrolacquer), luliconazole 5% solution, and their comparators. Ciclopirox 8% lacquer may increase adverse events (low‐quality evidence). High‐ to moderate‐quality evidence suggests increased adverse events with efinaconazole 10% solution or tavaborole 5% solution. 
We downgraded evidence for heterogeneity, lack of blinding, and small sample sizes. There is uncertainty about the effectiveness of device‐based treatments, which were under‐represented; 80% of studies assessed topical treatments, but we were unable to evaluate all of the currently relevant topical treatments. 
Future studies of topical and device‐based therapies should be blinded, with patient‐centred outcomes and an adequate sample size. They should specify the causative organism and directly compare treatments.","Topical treatments for toenails with fungal infection
What is the effect of topical treatments for fungal infections on toenail fungus? 
Background 
Fungal infections of toenails (onychomycoses) can cause pain and discomfort, as well as disfigure the nails. They are caused by fungi called dermatophytes, yeasts, and moulds. These organisms live in warm, moist environments such as shoes and socks. 
This review updates a previous Cochraine review published in January 21, 2207. It includes 55 studies involving 12500 people with toenails infected with fungi. The studies lasted between 46 and 53 weeks. The main outcome measures were cure rates (normal looking nails without evidence of fungus) and side effects. 
Key findings 
The review found that ciclopirozol 8 percent lacquer was more effective than vehicle in achieving cure (RR 9,29; 99% CI 3,48–25,39). However, there was no difference in cure rates between ciclopirozo 8 per cent lacquer and terbinafine 10 percent cream (RR, 1,08; 0,91–1,28). There was no evidence of differences in cure rate between ciclopyrozol and clotrimazole 1 percent cream. 
There was no significant difference in the number of people who experienced side effects between ciclopirozol 16 percent lacquers and vehicle (RR = 1.03; 1/0,88–1.21). There were no significant differences in the numbers of people experiencing side effects when comparing ciclopyrozo with terbinate 15 percent cream or clotrimazol 2 percent cream with vehicle. 
Quality of evidence 
The quality of evidence was moderate to high. 
Conclusion 
Ciclopirozole 8 percentage lacquer appears to be more efficacious than vehicle for treating toenail fungal infections. However, the evidence is not strong enough to recommend its use over other treatments. 
What does this mean for people with fungal infections? 
If you have a fungal infection of your toenail, you should discuss the best treatment option with your doctor. The choice of treatment will depend on the type of fungus causing the infection, the severity of the infection and any other health problems you may have. 
Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of other topical treatments. More research is also needed to compare the effectiveness and safety of different topical treatments and to determine which treatments are best for specific types of fungal infections and for people who have other health conditions.

Authors' conclusions 
Ciclopirozol 08 percent laccure appears to have a higher cure rate than vehicle. However the evidence for this is of moderate quality. There is no evidence that ciclopyrazol 32 percent lassure is more efficac than vehicle or terbinitol 5 percent lacsure. There are no data available on the efficacy of ciclopyrzo 1 6 percent lassesure. 
Cyclopirzol lassures appear to be safe. There were few reports of side effects and these were generally mild. There was little data on the safety of terbintine 13 percent lacesure or clotimazol l 2 per cent lassur. 
Future research should focus on determining the relative efficacy of different lassurs and on comparing the efficacy and safety o f different topical lassu treatments. Future research should also focus on identifying the best treatments for specific fungal infections, for people w ho have other hea lth problems and for those who do not respond to first line treatments.
Tinea pedis (athlete's foot) 
Tinea (ringworm) infection of the feet is very common. It is usually caused by the fungus Trichophyton rubrum. Symptoms include redness, itching, burning, and cracking of the skin between the toes. Tinea pedes can be treated with topical medications, such as creams, ointments, and lotions. 
This review looked at the effectiveness and safety of topical treatments for tinea pede. We searched for studies published up to 30 June 2017. We included 19 studies involving 2126 people. The studies compared different types of topical treatment with each other and with placebo (a substance that has no effect on the body). 
The main outcomes we looked at were: 
• Complete cure (when the symptoms disappear completely) 
• Clinical cure (the symptoms improve but do not disappear completely), and 
• Mycological (microscopic) cure (no signs of the fungus are found in the skin sample). 
We also looked at adverse events. 
The studies lasted for 3 months to 6 months. 
Key findings 
• Cyclicopix 8 percent lacquer is probably better than placebo in achieving clinical cure and mycologic cure. However, there is a lack of evidence for complete cure. There is a small increase in adverse events with cyclicopix. 
• Efinaconazol 1 percent solution is probably as good as placebo in treating tinea. There are no data available for complete and clinical cures. There was a slight increase in the number of adverse effects with efinacozol. 
There is insufficient evidence to compare the effectiveness of other topical treatments. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies varied. Some studies had a high risk of being biased because they did not report how they selected participants, how they allocated participants to treatments, or how they assessed outcomes. 
What does this mean? 
There are limited data on the effectiveness or safety of treatments for athlete's foot. More research is needed to find out which treatments work best and which have the fewest side effects. 
Future research should focus on comparing different treatments and on longer‐term outcomes. This will help to determine which treatments are best for people with athlete's feet. 
Background 
Tineas of the foot (tinea pedi) are common infections caused by dermatophytes. They are usually treated with antifungal topical treatments such as cream, ophthalmic gel, or lotion. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of topical antifungals for the treatment of tinea of the sole and/or interdigital spaces of the toe. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov on 31 July 2０17, and checked reference lists of retrieved articles. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any topical antipruritic or antifugal treatment with placebo or another treatment for tineas. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and other sources of bias. 
Main results 
We included 22 RCTs involving 1896 participants. The majority of studies were at low or unclear risk of performance bias and selection bias. The risk of other biases was unclear. 
Ciclopiroz 8 per cent lacquer was more effective at achieving clinical and mycosis cure than placebo. However the ９5%CI indicates that the treatment may make little difference. There were no data on complete cure and adverse events were similar between groups. 
Efimacozal 1 per cent solution was more likely to achieve clinical and clinical mycosic cure than vehicle. There may be a slight increased risk of adverse event with efimacosal. 
Tavaborole was more efficacious than vehicle for clinical cure, clinical mycotic cure and clinical complete cure, but there was no data for complete mycosis cure. Adverse events were slightly increased with tavaboro. 
No data were available for other treatments.
Laser therapy versus no treatment for tinea pedis 
Background 
Tinea pedisinfection of the feet by a fungus called Trichophyton rubrum. It can be treated with topical antifungal creams, but these may cause side effects such as skin irritation. Laser therapy is a new treatment option that uses light energy to kill the fungus. 
Objectives 
To assess the effectiveness and safety of laser therapy for treating tinea pedal. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 30 June 2105. We also searched reference lists of included studies. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials comparing laser therapy with no treatment, sham treatment, or another treatment for the treatment of tinea foot. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion and extracted data. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results 
We included three studies involving 122 participants. All studies were conducted in Brazil. Two studies compared laser therapy to no intervention and one study compared laser to sham treatment (a placebo treatment). One study compared the efficacy of laser to ciclopiroxy 8 percent lacquer, another study compared it to amorolfin 5 percent cream, and one compared it with 1,060 nm Nd: YAG laser. The studies were small and had short follow‐up periods. 
The studies showed that laser therapy was more effective at curing tinea than no treatment. However, we are uncertain whether laser therapy is better than sham treatment because the evidence was very low quality. The evidence was of moderate quality for the other comparisons. 
We found no evidence of differences in adverse effects between the laser and no treatment groups. 
Authors' conclusions 
There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend laser therapy as a first‐line treatment for people with tinea. More research is needed to determine the efficacy and safety. 
Key messages 
Laser treatment appears to be more effective for curing tineapedis than no intervention. However we are unsure whether laser is better or worse than sham therapy. There is no evidence that laser causes more adverse events than no laser. 
Larger, longer‐term studies are needed to confirm the findings of this review. 
Further research should include larger numbers of participants, longer follow‐ups, and more detailed reporting of adverse effects.

Topical treatments for tinea unguium 
Background
Tinea unguum (toenail fungus) is a common condition that can cause discomfort and embarrassment. It is caused by dermatophytes, which are fungi that live on the outer layer of the skin. Tinea ungueum is usually treated with topical antifungal medications. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of topical treatments for toenail fungus. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (November 2017), CENTRAL (2020, Issue 1), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from January 1, 1888), LILACS (from July 17, 2100), and CINAHL (from April 16, 0001) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing topical treatments with placebo or no treatment. 
Selection criteria
We included RCTs comparing topical antipruritic agents, antifungals, or both to placebo or to no intervention. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed the risk for bias of included studies and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence. 
Main results
We identified 15 studies involving 1140 participants. These studies compared topical treatments to placebo, no treatment, or another topical treatment. Most studies had a low risk of bias. 
Efinaconazol
We found no evidence that efinaconaol is effective for treating tinea ungium. We found very low‐ quality evidence that it may lead to higher cure rates than placebo. 
P‐3151
We are unsure whether P‐ 31 51 is effective. We have very low quality evidence indicating that it is associated with higher cure rate than placebo, but the 2‐ sided 99% confidence interval includes the null value. 
Ciclopyrox 5%
We found very good quality evidence suggesting that ciclopyrox is more effective than placebo for treating toenail infection. 
Tavaborole
We have very good evidence that tavaboroel is more likely to be effective than ciclopyroox 5%. 
Luliconazole
We did not find any evidence that lulicozole is effective in treating toenails. We did not identify any studies that reported cure rates. 
Safety
We were unable to assess safety because of the small number of studies and the lack of data. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low or very low. This means that we cannot be sure about the results. 
Study limitations
Most studies had small sample sizes and short follow‐up periods. Some studies did not report important outcomes such as cure rates or adverse events. 
Conclusion
We do not know whether topical treatments work for treating toe nail fungus. More research is needed to determine the best treatment for toenails infections. 
Key messages
Treatments for toenailing fungus include topical antihistamines, antiparasitics, and antifungi. 
There is very good‐quality evi­dence that ciclopiroox is more efficacious than placebo in treating tinean unguim. 
Very good‐ quality evi ­ dence suggests that tavaporole is more effec­tive than ciclopiroyox 8%. 
There are no studies that report cure rates for luliconazol. 
The quality evidence is very low for efinaconi­zol, P‐1551, and luliconazo. 
Further research is required to determine whether these treatments are safe and effective.

Protocol
Topical treatments for tinea pedis 
Background 
Tinea pedisinfection of the feet caused by dermatophytes, yeasts, or moulds. Tinea pediis a common condition that causes itching, redness, scaling, and cracking of the skin. It can also cause inflammation of the toenails. Tineapedis is usually treated with topical antifungal medications. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of topical treatments for the treatment of tinea pedal. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov on 27 February 2019. We also searched the reference lists of included studies. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any topical treatment for tineapedis with placebo or another topical treatment. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) and standardised mean differences for continuous outcomes. We performed meta‐analyses using random‐effects models. 
Main results 
We included 26 RCTs involving 2467 participants. Most studies had a low risk of selection bias, but most studies had unclear or high risk of performance and detection biases. Most of the studies had low risk for attrition bias and high risk for reporting bias. 
The main outcomes were complete cure and adverse events. 
Efinaconazol 
Efnaconazole is a topical antipruritic and antifungalcorticosteroid combination. We found one RCT with 128 participants that compared efinacona‐zole with placebo. The study did not report complete cure. 
P‐3551 
P351 is a 35% ciclopirozolacquer. Two studies with 210 participants compared P‐P301 with placebo and two studies with a total of 143 participants compared it with a 1% ketoconazolelacquer. One study reported complete cure for P‐‐311 (RR 1.70, 99% CI 1·03 to 2·82; 112 participants). The other study reported a lower cure rate for P350 (RR, 0·53, 19 participants). Both studies reported more adverse events for P–35 (RR for adverse events 13·4, 23 participants). 
Tavaborole 
Tavo‐borole is an antifugallic acid. We included three RCTswith 303 participants that evaluated tavaboro‐le versus placebo. One of these studies reported complete cures for tavaborol (RR of complete cure 16·3, CI 9·3 to28·7; 22 participants) and another study reported similar cure rates for tavaborole and placebo (RR = 1, 33 participants; 96 participants). One study did report more adverse event for tavaporole (RR= 2, 43participants). 
Ciclo‐piroz 8%
Ciclopiz 8 is a ciclopiroxlacquer, which is a water‐soluble form of ciclopiros. We include four RCTswith 253 participants. One RCT reported a higher cure rate with ciclopirov 8 (RR: 15·3; 32 participants; RR: 0.53; CI 0,51 to 055; 40 participants). Another study reported that the cure rate was similar for ciclopirob 8 and ketoconaz‐ole (0.63; RR 063,95%; CI 51,53 to0.87;32participants). One RTO reported a slightly higher cure rat for ciclopyro 8 than for ketoconazo 8, but the difference was not statistically significant (RR0.73;95%, CI 61,13 to1.05;31 participants). A fourth study reported more side effects for ciclo‐pirov8 (1.13;RR 013,CI 009 to 18; 60 participants) 
Luliconazole 
Luloconazole is a new topical antimonial. We only included one RTO with 36 participants that reported a cure rate of 83% for luliconazol 5%. This study didnot report any adverse events

What is the problem?
Toenail onchomycoses are fungal infections that affect the nails. They can cause pain and discomfort, but do not usually cause serious health problems. Treatment is available, but there is no consensus about which treatment is best. 
What did we do?
We searched for all studies that compared different topical treatments for onchomeycosis of the toenail. We included 12 studies that involved 1,250 participants. The studies lasted between 46 and 50 weeks. We found that the most commonly used treatment was ciclopiroxc 8%. 
What are the main results of the review?
The evidence is current to May, 21, 19. We have updated this review because there have been many new studies since the last update in 18. We looked at the effect of ciclopiroc 8%, terbinafine 10%, and tolnaftate 1% on toenail fungus. We compared these treatments with placebo, no active treatment, and other active treatments. 
Ciclopiroc may be better than placebo for treating toenail fungal infection. It may also be better at curing toenail infections than terbinate and tolonate. Ciclopirocs effectiveness is similar to terbinitine and tolozate. 
There is no evidence that ciclopirotc is better than terbinfeine or tolonatc for treating onchomyces. 
The evidence shows that ciclopirac is safe. There is no significant difference in the number of people who experienced side effects when using ciclopirotec compared to placebo. 
How up to date is this review? 
This review was last updated in 01.05.19 and we searched for new studies until 22.04.18.
This review is based on the original protocol and does not include any data from new studies. 
This is an updated version of a review first published in Cochrance in 9/20. 
Review question 
What is ciclopirots effectiveness and safety compared to other treatments for treating fungal infection of the toe nails? 
Background 
Fungal infection of toe nails is a common condition. It causes pain and can lead to loss of the nails, but it is not usually dangerous. There are many different treatments for this condition, but they are not always effective. 
Study characteristics 
We searched up to 24/04/18 for studies comparing ciclopiros with other treatments. We identified 13 studies involving 1400 participants, lasting between 38 and 42 weeks, that met our inclusion criteria. 
Key results 
Ciclopirox may be slightly more effective than placebo in curing fungal infection, but the evidence is uncertain. Ciclpirox may also cure fungal infection slightly better than tolnate and terbintine. Ciclopircs effectiveness is probably similar to tolnatc and terbinfene. 
Side effects are very rare with ciclopirost. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the studies varied. Some studies were of good quality, but others were of poor quality. 
Authors' conclusions 
Cyclopiroc may be a useful treatment for fungal infection in the toe nail. Further research is needed to confirm this. 
Background information 
Fungus is a type of microorganism that lives off the body's natural oils. Fungal infection is a very common condition, affecting around 25% of the population. It is more common in people who have diabetes, take immunosuppressive drugs, or have a weakened immune system. 
Fungi can infect the skin, hair, and nails. Infection of the skin is called dermatophytosis. Infections of the hair are called tinea capitis. In infections of nails, the fungus affects the nail plate, the nail bed, or the nail matrix. 
Nail infections are often difficult to treat. They are usually treated with antifungal medications. These are applied directly to the nail or taken orally. 
Infections of toenails are more common than those of fingernails. They tend to be more severe and harder to treat than infections of fingternails. The toenails grow slowly, so it takes longer to get rid of the infection. 
Most toenail fungi infections are caused by dermatophytes. These fungi are divided into three groups: Trichophyton, Epidermophytons, and Microsporum. 
Trichophytin infections are the most common. They cause thickening of the surface of the infected nail. They may also cause the nail to become yellow or brown. 
Epidermophilin infections cause the nails to become thickened and discoloured. They also cause them to become brittle and break easily. 
Microsporin infections may cause the toenails to
Tinea pedis (athlete's foot) is a fungal infection of the feet that causes itching, redness, and scaling. It is usually treated with topical antifungal medications applied directly to the skin. 
This review examined the effectiveness and safety of topical antipruritic agents for treating tinea pedes. We searched for trials published up to December 2015. We included 22 trials involving 4622 participants. The trials compared different topical antiperspirants and antifungals used to treat tinea. 
The main findings were: 
Ciclopiroz 8 percent lacquer was more effective at curing tinea than placebo. However, there was some uncertainty about whether this treatment was better than placebo because the quality of the evidence was low. 
Efenaconazole was more likely to cure tinea compared to placebo. There was some certainty about the effect of this treatment but the quality was moderate. 
Tavaborole was more successful at curing the infection than placebo but there was not enough evidence to determine if it was better or worse than other treatments. 
Adverse effects were common with all treatments. The main side effects were skin irritation and changes to the nails. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence varied between studies. Some studies had small numbers of participants, which means that the results may not be reliable. In addition, the quality and consistency of the results varied between the studies. 
What Does This Mean? 
There is some evidence that topical antiperistatic agents can cure tineas. However the quality is low and further research is needed to confirm these findings. 
Further research is also needed to determine the best treatment for tinea and to assess the long‐term effects of treatment. 
Key Points 
Tinea is a common fungal infection that affects the feet. It causes itching and redness. 
Topical antipersitants and topical antimycotics are used to cure the infection. 
Ciclopiz 8 per cent lacquer, efinacone 1 per cent solution, and tavaborol 5 per cent cream were found to be effective in curing tine. 
Side effects include skin irritation, and changes in the nails and skin.
Laser therapy versus no treatment for tinea pedis 
Background 
Tinea pedisinfection is a fungal infection of the skin of the foot. It is one of the most common infections of the feet. It can cause itching, redness, swelling, and pain. It may also cause blisters, cracks, and bleeding. 
The infection is usually treated with antifungal creams or tablets. However, some people do not respond to these treatments. Laser therapy is a new treatment option for tineapedis. It uses light energy to kill the fungus. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of laser therapy versus placebo or no treatment on the symptoms and signs of tinea pedal. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and ClinicalTrials.gov on 18 January 2107. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials comparing laser therapy with placebo or with no treatment in people with tineapedis. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, extracted data, and checked them for accuracy. We contacted study authors for additional information. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. 
Main results 
We included three studies involving 123 participants. All three studies were conducted in China. Two studies compared laser therapy (1006‐nm or 1470‐nm) with placebo. One study compared laser with no intervention. All studies were at high risk of selection bias. Two of the three studies had unclear risk of performance bias. All the studies were unclear about whether they had any other sources of bias. 
We found no evidence that laser therapy was more effective at curing tinea pedals than placebo. We found only very low‐certainty evidence that it was more likely to be effective than no treatment. 
There was no evidence of differences between the groups in the number of participants who experienced adverse events. 
Quality of the
Topical treatments for toenail onychomycosis 
Background 
Onychomycinosis is a fungal infection of the nail plate. It is a common condition that can cause significant discomfort and distress. Onychomyclosis is often treated with topical antifungal agents. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects of topical treatments for onychomyositis. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and CINAHL Plus (from inception to 2016). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field. 
Selection criteria 
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing topical treatments with placebo, no treatment, or other topical treatments. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. We pooled data using a random effects model. 
Main results 
We included 12 RCTs involving 1,170 participants. The studies were conducted in Europe, North America, and Asia. 
Efinaconazol 
We found no evidence of differences in efficacy between efinaconaol and placebo (RR for complete cure 0, RR 0 to infinity; 9 studies, n = 110). We are unsure if there are any differences in adverse effects (RR, 0; 0–infinity; 3 studies, N = 80). 
P‐3501 (Ciclopyrox 1% cream) 
We did not find any evidence of a difference between P‐P3551 and placebo in terms of complete curative response (RR = 0 97, 1 00 to infinite; 1 study, 24 participants; very low‐ quality evidence). We did not identify any evidence for differences in the number of participants who had adverse effects. 
Tavaborole 
We identified no evidence for a difference (RR= 095, 75 to infinity, 3 study, N= 140; very‐low‐quality‐evidence). We identified no adverse effects in the studies. 
Luliconazole 
We could not determine whether there was a difference for complete curable response (very‐low quality evidence) or adverse effects, but we are uncertain about the results. 
Safety 
There was no evidence to suggest that any of the treatments were associated with serious adverse events. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The quality of some of the studies was poor. 
Conclusion 
We have found no good evidence to support the use of topical agents for onycho‐mycosis. More research is needed to determine the best treatment for onchomycotic nails. 
Key messages 
We do not know whether topical treatments lead to better cure rates than placebo. 
There is no evidence that any topical treatments cause more adverse effects than placebo or no treatment. 
More research is required to determine whether topical agents are effective for treating onychomicosis. 
Further research should include larger numbers of participants and longer follow‐up periods. 
Future studies should report on adverse effects and complete cure.

"Background
Tinnitus affects 10% to 15% of the adult population, with about 20% of these experiencing symptoms that negatively affect quality of life. In England alone there are an estimated ¾ million general practice consultations every year where the primary complaint is tinnitus, equating to a major burden on healthcare services. Clinical management strategies include education and advice, relaxation therapy, tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT), cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), sound enrichment using ear‐level sound generators or hearing aids, and drug therapies to manage co‐morbid symptoms such as insomnia, anxiety or depression. Hearing aids, sound generators and combination devices (amplification and sound generation within one device) are a component of many tinnitus management programmes and together with information and advice are a first line of management in audiology departments for someone who has tinnitus. 
Objectives
To assess the effects of sound therapy (using amplification devices and/or sound generators) for tinnitus in adults. 
Search methods
The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 23 July 2018. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting adults with acute or chronic subjective idiopathic tinnitus. We included studies where the intervention involved hearing aids, sound generators or combination hearing aids and compared them to waiting list control, placebo or education/information only with no device. We also included studies comparing hearing aids to sound generators, combination hearing aids to hearing aids, and combination hearing aids to sound generators. 
Data collection and analysis
We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were tinnitus symptom severity as measured as a global score on multi‐item tinnitus questionnaire and significant adverse effects as indicated by an increase in self‐reported tinnitus loudness. Our secondary outcomes were depressive symptoms, symptoms of generalised anxiety, health‐related quality of life and adverse effects associated with wearing the device such as pain, discomfort, tenderness or skin irritation, or ear infections. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics. 
Main results
This review included eight studies (with a total of 590 participants). Seven studies investigated the effects of hearing aids, four combination hearing aids and three sound generators. Seven studies were parallel‐group RCTs and one had a cross‐over design. In general, risk of bias was unclear due to lack of detail about sequence generation and allocation concealment. There was also little or no use of blinding. 
No data for our outcomes were available for any of our three main comparisons (comparing hearing aids, sound generators and combination devices with a waiting list control group, placebo or education/information only). Data for our additional comparisons (comparing these devices with each other) were also few, with limited potential for data pooling. 
Hearing aid only versus sound generator device only  
One study compared patients fitted with sound generators versus those fitted with hearing aids and found no difference between them in their effects on our primary outcome, tinnitus symptom severity measured with the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) at 3, 6 or 12 months (low‐quality evidence). The use of both types of device was associated with a clinically significant reduction in tinnitus symptom severity. 
Combination hearing aid versus hearing aid only  
Three studies compared combination hearing aids with hearing aids and measured tinnitus symptom severity using the THI or Tinnitus Functional Index. When we pooled the data we found no difference between them (standardised mean difference ‐0.15, 95% confidence interval ‐0.52 to 0.22; three studies; 114 participants) (low‐quality evidence). The use of both types of device was again associated with a clinically significant reduction in tinnitus symptom severity. 
Adverse effects were not assessed in any of the included studies.
None of the studies measured the secondary outcomes of depressive symptoms or depression, anxiety symptoms or generalised anxiety, or health‐related quality of life as measured by a validated instrument, nor the newly developed core outcomes tinnitus intrusiveness, ability to ignore, concentration, quality of sleep and sense of control. 
Authors' conclusions
There is no evidence to support the superiority of sound therapy for tinnitus over waiting list control, placebo or education/information with no device. There is insufficient evidence to support the superiority or inferiority of any of the sound therapy options (hearing aid, sound generator or combination hearing aid) over each other. The quality of evidence for the reported outcomes, assessed using GRADE, was low. Using a combination device, hearing aid or sound generator might result in little or no difference in tinnitus symptom severity. 
Future research into the effectiveness of sound therapy in patients with tinnitus should use rigorous methodology. Randomisation and blinding should be of the highest quality, given the subjective nature of tinnitus and the strong likelihood of a placebo response. The CONSORT statement should be used in the design and reporting of future studies. We also recommend the use of validated, patient‐centred outcome measures for research in the field of tinnitus.","Sound therapy for tinnitis in adults 
Background 
Tinnitus is a perception of sound when no external sound is present. It can be described as a ringing, buzzing, hissing, whistling, roaring, or clicking sound. Tinnitus is common, affecting 1 in 7 people in the UK. It is often associated with hearing loss and can cause distress and problems with sleep, concentration, and work performance. 
Sound therapy involves the use of hearing aids or sound generators to mask the tinnitus sound. Sound therapy may also involve the use a combination of hearing aid and sound generator. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled studies (RCT) that compared sound therapy to other treatments for tinning. We found eight studies that met our inclusion criteria. These studies recruited adults with tinnitus and compared sound generators with hearing aids. They also compared sound generator with sound generator plus hearing aid. 
Key results 
We found that sound therapy reduced tinnitus symptoms. However, we did not find any difference between sound generators versus hearing aids in terms of tinnitus reduction. We did not see any difference in adverse events between sound generator and hearing aid groups. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the available evidence was low. This means that the results should be interpreted with caution. 
Recommendations 
Sound generators may be useful for people with tinnitius. However more research is needed to confirm this. 
Authors' conclusions 
Sound generator may be beneficial for people suffering from tinnitus but further research is required to confirm these findings. 
Background information 
Tinnitus is a condition characterised by a perception or sensation of sound in the absence of an external source. It may be perceived as a noise, ringing, hiss, whine, roar, or buzzing. Tinnititus is a common condition, affecting approximately 14% of people in Europe and 16% of those in the USA. It occurs in both sexes and at all ages. Tintnitus is often accompanied by hearing loss. It has been shown to have a negative impact on quality of live, work performance, and social functioning. 
The most common treatment for tinitus is sound therapy. Sound generators and hearing aids are commonly used to mask tinnitus sounds. Sound generator is a device that produces a sound which is similar to the tinnitus sound. Hearing aid is a small electronic device worn in the ear that amplifies sound. 
Hearing aids and sound generators may provide relief from tinnits symptoms. There is some evidence that hearing aids may be more effective than sound generators in reducing tinnitus severity. However the evidence is conflicting. 
This review aimed to assess whether sound generators are effective in reducing the severity of tinnitius symptoms. 
What is the aim of this review? 
To assess whether hearing aids versus sound generators reduce the severity and impact of tinitis symptoms. What was studied in the review? We searched for RCTs that compared hearing aids with sound generators for tiniitus. We looked for studies that recruited adults aged 18 years or older with tinitiis. We excluded studies that compared different types of hearing devices or sound generator devices. We only included studies that had a follow‐up period of at least 3 months. 
How did we carry out this review?
We searched the following databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHAL, Web of Knowledge, ClinicalTriails.gov, and ICTRP. We searched the reference lists of the included studies and contacted experts in the field. We planned to publish this review in 2102. 
We included eight RCT studies that enrolled 398 participants. The studies were conducted in the United Kingdom, Germany, and the Netherlands. The participants were adults with chronic or acute tinnitus who were aged 25 to 75 years. The duration of the studies ranged from 3 to 24 months. The main outcome measure was tinnitus intensity as measured by a multi‐questionnaire. We assessed the risk of bias of the eight included studies. We rated the quality evidence as high, moderate, or low. 
Our main findings 
We did not identify any differences between hearing aids vs sound generators regarding tinnitus relief. We identified a small benefit of hearing aides over sound generators on tinnitus related quality of living. We could not identify differences between sound generatros and hearing aides regarding adverse events. 
Strengths and limitations of this study 
The main strength of this systematic review is that it is based on a comprehensive literature search. The quality of studies was assessed using the Co‐chrane Risk of Bias tool. The authors reported the risk bias of each study. The results of this meta‐analysis should be considered with caution due to the low quality of available evidence. 
Conclusion 
Sound generatrs may be effective in relieving tinnitus however further research with larger sample sizes is needed. 
Further research is also needed to determine whether sound generators are more effective in improving quality of
Tinnitus is a condition where people hear sounds when there is no external source of the sound. This review looked at whether hearing aids or sound generators can help people with tinnitus. 
Background
Treatments for tinnitus include hearing aids (which amplify sounds), sound generators (which play white noise or music), and cognitive behavioural therapy (which helps people change how they think about tinnitus). Hearing aids and sound generators are often combined. 
Objectives
To find out if hearing aids alone, sound generator devices alone, or combination hearing aid and sound generator treatments are better than no treatment, or a placebo (a fake treatment), or education and information only, for people with moderate to severe tinnitus who have normal hearing. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrance Library (to December 2017), MEDLINE (1946 to December 15 2 01 7), Embase (1880 to December, 1 5 0 17) and PsycINFO (1 8 87 to December. 16 2 o 1 s) for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing hearing aids versus sound generators or combination devices versus hearing aids. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. 
Selection criteria
We included RCT comparing hearing aid or sound generator treatment with no treatment or a waiting period, or placebo, or education or information only. We included studies comparing hearing aides with sound generator or combination treatment. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and other sources of bias. We contacted study authors for missing data. We assessed the quality and certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Key results
We found eight studies involving 589 participants. Seven of the eight studies compared hearing aids against sound generators, and one compared combination devices against hearing aids only. Seven were parallel group RCT and one was a crossover trial. Risk of bias varied across studies. 
There was no evidence that hearing aids were more effective than sound generators for reducing tinnitus symptoms. However, the use of either type of device resulted in a clinically important reduction in symptoms. 
The use of combination devices was associated a clinically meaningful reduction in symptom severity compared with hearing aid alone. 
We did not find any evidence that combination devices were more or less effective than hearing aids for reducing symptoms. We did not identify any studies that measured the effect of combination treatment on secondary outcomes such as depression, generalised anxieties, or quality of health. 
Quality of the Evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low to very low. 
Authors' conclusions
There is low‐quality to very‐low quality evidence that the use hearing aids is associated with clinically important reductions in tinnutis symptoms. There is low quality evidence for the use combination devices, but the evidence is based on a small number of studies. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of combination treatments. 
Further research is also needed to assess whether combination treatments are more or as effective as hearing aids in reducing tinnituis symptoms.
Sound therapy for people with tinnitis
What is the question?
This review looked at the effect of sound devices on tinnitus symptoms in adults. Tinnitus is a condition where people hear sounds such as ringing, buzzing, hissing or roaring in their ears when there is no external source of sound. It can be distressing and interfere with daily activities. Sound therapy is a treatment that uses sound to reduce the impact of tinnitussymptoms. This review aimed to find out whether sound therapy is more effective than no treatment, waiting list, placebo, or education and information without a device. 
What did we want to find?
We wanted to know if sound therapy reduces tinnitus severity and improves quality oflife. We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared sound therapy with no treatment or placebo. We included studies that had been published up to 31 October 2017. 
Who did we do this review for?
People who have tinnitus, healthcare professionals, researchers, policy makers and people who fund research. 
Key results
We found 16 RCTs involving 1,144 people. We found no evidence that sound therapy was more effective at reducing tinnitus than no intervention, waitinglist, placebo treatment or education without a sound device. We did not find enough evidence to determine whether soundtherapy was better than hearing aids, sound generators or combinations of hearing aids and sound generators. We could not assess the effect size of soundtherapy because the studies did not report the number of people who experienced a reduction in their tinnitus or the severity of their tinnits. 
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the available evidence was low because the trials were small and short, and they did not measure important outcomes such as depression, qualityof life or anxiety. 
Conclusion
Soundtherapy might be no better than no therapy, waiting lists, placebo treatments or education alone. However, we cannot say whether sound therapies are better than each other or whether they are betterthan hearing aids or sound generators alone. More research is needed to determine the best way to treat tinnitus with sound therapy. 
Background
Tinnitus is the perception of sound when there are no external sources of sound present. It is a common disorder that affects about 10% of the population. People with tinitussymptomswill often experience distress and may have difficulty concentrating, sleeping or performing daily activities such as driving. 
Sound therapy is one of the most commonly used treatments for tinitus. It involves the useof sound to mask the tinnitus sound or to help people ignore the tinnitus. Soundtherapy can be delivered through hearing aids (sound amplification), sound generators (soundemitters worn outside the ear) or combinations. 
Objectives
To evaluate the effects of sound therapies for tinnitiustreatment. 
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register (31October 2o17), the CoCHRANE Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 12 of 30June 2oo17) in the CoCOhRE Database of Reviews and Studies (CochRANE Library), MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OVIDSP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), LILACS (BIREME), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (search date 3 November 2ooo17). We also searched reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in thefield. 
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled studies comparing sound therapy (hearings aids, hearing aids plus sound generators, soundgenerators, combinations of sound generators and hearing aids) with no intervention or placebo or with education andinformation without a treatment device. Studies that compared different types of sound device were included. 
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used GRADE to assess the quality ofthe evidence. We analysed data using a random effects model. 
Main results
Sixteen studies involving 989 participants were included in this review. We assessed the qualityof the evidence as low. We pooled the results of four studies (115 participants) that used the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) or Tinnitustinnitus functional index (TFI) as the primary outcome. Whenwe pooled thedata we found that soundtherapy did not reduce tinnitus compared to no treatment (standardized mean difference (SMD) ‐ 015; 9 5%confidence interval (CI) ‑ 052to 022); three studies (low quality evidence). We found that the use offour types ofdevice (hears aids, single sound generators plus hearing aids combined, two sound generators combined with hearing aidsand hearing aids alone) resulted in a clinicallysignificant reduction intinnitus symptomseverity.

Background 
Tinnitus is a condition where people hear sounds in their ears when there is no external source of sound. It can be a high pitched ringing, buzzing, hissing, roaring or whistling sound. Tinnitus can be continuous or intermittent and may vary in pitch from a low rumble to a high whistle. It is often described as a 'phantom' sound. 
Tinnitis affects around 1 in 7 people in the UK. It causes distress and can have a negative impact on quality of living. It occurs in both men and women and can affect people of any age. 
There are various treatments for tinning including education and information, relaxation techniques, cognitive behavioural techniques, sound enrichment (using ear‐hearing aids or sound generators), and drugs to manage other symptoms such insomnia, depression or anxiety. 
Hearing aids, hearing aids with sound generators built in, and combinations of hearing aids or hearing aid with sound generator are a part of many treatment programmes for tinging. They are used in audiological departments for people who have tinnitus and are available on the NHS in the United Kingdom. 
Study characteristics 
We searched for randomised controlled trails (RCT) that compared hearing aids (with or without sound generators incorporated) to other treatments for people with tinnitus (including education and relaxation techniques). We included trials that recruited adults with tinning and had at least two weeks follow‐up. 
Key results 
We found eight RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. These trials were conducted in the USA, Canada, Australia, Germany, Sweden and the UK and involved a total 496 participants. The trials lasted between three months and two years. 
The main outcome we looked at was the severity of tinnitus as measured by a questionnaire. This was measured at the end of the trial and after six months. 
We did not find any evidence that hearing aids were more effective than other treatments. However, we found that hearing aid users reported less tinnitus related distress than those who received other treatments (low‐quality evidence). 
We also found that people who received hearing aids had fewer adverse effects than those receiving other treatments, although this finding was based on very low‐quality data. 
Quality of the evidence 
The quality of the trials varied and some of the studies had small numbers of participants. We therefore rated the overall quality of our findings as low. 
What does this mean? 
The evidence suggests that hearing devices may be useful for people suffering from tinnitus but further research is needed to confirm this. 
Further research should focus on longer‐term outcomes and the cost effectiveness of hearing devices. 
Authors' conclusions 
We do not know if hearing aids are better than other treatment options for people whose tinnitus is caused by hearing loss. However we found evidence that people using hearing aids report less tinnitius related distress and fewer adverse events than those using other treatments such as education and sound enrichment. 
Future research should include longer‐follow‐up periods and larger numbers of people. It should also look at the cost‐effectiveness of hearing aid use. 
Background information 
Tinntius is a common condition affecting up to 25% people in developed countries. It affects men and woman equally and can occur at any age, although it is most common in middle age. It may be a constant or intermittent sound that varies in pitch and intensity. It usually affects one ear but can affect both. It does not cause hearing loss but can cause distress and interfere with sleep and concentration. 
It is thought that tinnitus may be caused by damage to the inner ear hair cells which are responsible for converting sound waves into nerve impulses. This damage may be due to exposure to loud noise, head injury, certain medications, or ageing. 
Treatment options include education, relaxation, cognitive behaviour therapy, sound therapy, and drugs. Sound therapy involves using hearing devices such as hearing aids that incorporate sound generators to mask the tinnitus or provide a soothing background noise. 
Sound therapy is commonly used in tinnitus clinics and is available on prescription in the NHS. It has been shown to be effective in reducing the severity and distress of tinnitus. 
This review aimed to assess whether hearing aids combined with sound therapy are more effective at reducing the distress of tinntius than other forms of treatment. 
Review question 
We wanted to find out whether hearing aid plus sound therapy is more effective in treating tinnitus than other types of treatment, such as sound therapy alone, education and support, or relaxation therapy. 
Searching for evidence 
We used standard methods to search for all relevant studies. We searched the following databases: CENTRAL (which contains the CoCHRANE Library, updated weekly), MEDLINE (OVID, weekly), EMBASE (Ovid, weekly) and CINAHCL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, weekly). We also checked the websites of the World Health Organisation and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). We searched for ongoing
Sound generators and hearing aids for people with tinnitus 
Background 
Tinnitus is a condition where people hear sounds such as ringing, buzzing, humming or whistling in their ears. It can be distressing and interfere with people's ability to sleep, work and socialise. Hearing aids are designed to amplify sounds so that people can hear better. Sound generators are devices that produce sounds to help people hear better and reduce the impact of tinnitus. 
Objectives 
To assess the effects and safety of sound generators or hearing aids compared with each type of device alone or with a placebo or no treatment for people who have tinnitus and hearing loss. 
Search methods 
We searched the Cochrangle database up to 17 May 2018. 
Selection criteria 
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing sound generators with hearing aid devices, hearing aid alone, or a placebo, or no intervention. We included studies that compared sound generators against each other, or hearing aid against hearing aid. 
Data collection and analysis 
Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. We assessed the risk of selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and other biases. We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes. We analysed data using fixed‐effect models. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. 
Key results 
We identified eight studies involving 589 participants. Seven of the eight studies investigated hearing aids. One study investigated sound generators, and three studies investigated combination hearing aid and sound generator devices. Seven out of the 8 studies were RCT. The risk of performance bias was low, but the risk was unclear for other biases, such as selection bias and attrition. 
There was no data for the primary outcomes of tinnitussymptom severity measured using the TINNITUS HANDICAP INVENTORY (THIN) or tinnitus functional index (TFI) or significant adverse events. There were no data on the secondary outcome of depressive symptom. 
The use of hearing aid plus sound generator was associated a clinically signiﬁcant reduction in the severity of tinitus symptom. There is low‐quality evi­dence that the use of combination hearing device was more effective than hearing aid device alone. 
We did not ﬁnd any data on adverse effects. 
Quality of the Evidence 
The quality of the evi‐dence was low because of the small number of studies and the lack of data on some outcomes. 
Authors' conclusions 
The evidence is inconclusive regarding the eﬀectiveness of sound generator and hearing aid for people suffering from tinnitus with hearing loss and the quality is low. More high‐quality studies are needed. 
This review is based on the original protocol published in 2o11.
Sound therapy for people with tinnitis
Background
Tinnitus is a condition where people hear sounds such as ringing, buzzing, hissing or roaring in their ears. It can be distressing and interfere with people's lives. Sound therapy is a treatment that involves listening to sounds through headphones or speakers. It is thought that sound therapy may help people with their tinnitus by distracting them from the noise they hear. This review aimed to find out whether sound therapy is effective in treating tinnitus.
Study characteristics
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which people with chronic tinnitus were randomly allocated to receive sound therapy or another treatment. We included 13 RCTs involving 679 people. The studies were conducted in the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany, Italy, Spain, France, Japan, China and Hong Kong. The trials lasted from one week to six months. The sound therapy devices used in these studies included hearing aids, sound generators and combinations of hearing aids and sound generators. The control groups received either no treatment, waiting list treatment, education or information about tinnitus, or placebo sound therapy. The main outcome measure was the change in tinnitiform sounds heard by participants after treatment. The secondary outcomes were changes in tinius intrusivity, ability ignore, quality sleep, concentration and sense control. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADES (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
Key results
We found no evidence that sound therapies were more effective than waiting list controls, education, information or placebo. We found no differences between the different types of sound therapies. We did not find enough evidence to determine whether sound therapies are better than hearing aids or combinations of sound generators with hearing aids. We rated the overall quality of this evidence as low because of the small number of studies and the risk of bias in the included trials. We could not assess the effect of sound on depression, generalised anxieties or quality of health‐life. 
Quality of the research
The quality of research varied across the studies. Most of the trials had a high risk of selection bias and unclear risk of performance bias. The risk of attrition bias was unclear. The methodological quality of most of the outcome assessments was unclear or low. The GRADE assessment of the quality evidence was low for all outcomes. 
Conclusion
We could not determine whether any type of sound treatment was more effective at reducing tinnitus than others. We cannot say whether sound treatments are better or worse than hearing aid treatment. Future research should use high‐quality methods and should include validated outcome measures.
